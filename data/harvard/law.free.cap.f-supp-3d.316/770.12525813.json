NATHAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This putative class action case arises out of atrocities committed by the Government of Sudan against its citizens between 1997 and 2009. Victims of the Sudanese government's human rights abuses bring a variety of state law claims against BNP Paribas S.A. and its subsidiaries and branches alleging that the bank funded the Government of Sudan and assisted the government in circumventing U.S. economic sanctions, allowing the Government of Sudan to continue its genocidal campaign against the people of Sudan. The Defendants have moved to dismiss the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint on all claims. For the reasons that follow, the motion to dismiss is granted in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the facts in this litigation. In short, Plaintiffs were victims of horrific human rights abuses undertaken by the Government of Sudan between 1997 and 2009, including \"beatings, maiming, sexual assault, rape, infection with HIV, loss of property, displacement from their homes, and watching family members be killed.\" Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Dkt. No. 49, \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 30-50 (outlining specific abuses suffered by each representative Plaintiff). The Defendants are BNP Paribas S.A., a French financial institution, as well as several of its branches and subsidiaries, as well as individual defendants working for the bank (collectively \"BNPP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between 1992 and 1997, in response to the Government of Sudan's human rights abuses against its own people, the United States government took a series of steps aimed at stemming the abuses, including formal condemnation, designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and eventually economic sanctions. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 85-89. In 2002, Congress passed the Sudan Peace Act, again condemning the ongoing atrocities in the Sudan and requiring the President to implement additional sanctions. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 90-92. Additional legislation and executive orders implemented further sanctions between 2004 and 2006. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 93-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in 1997 and continuing through 2007, BNPP became the primary bank of the Government of Sudan, through which it accessed U.S. financial markets and circumvented U.S. sanctions. SAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-14. BNPP created several schemes to avoid the sanctions, including removing information from financial documents identifying that a Sudanese entity was one of the parties involved in the financial transaction, SAC \u00b6 111, and using satellite banks in the United States through which to funnel money, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 112-13. According to the Second Amended Complaint, Sudan's access to U.S. financial markets was critical to funding the Government, including its continued atrocities against its people. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 115-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BNPP's actions were investigated by numerous state and federal agencies in the United States, and in 2014, BNPP pled guilty to conspiring to violate the laws of the United States in connection with circumventing U.S. sanctions on behalf of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 191-98. BNPP also pled guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy under New York law. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 199-201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the criminal actions against BNPP, the Plaintiffs initiated the present action on April 29, 2016 by filing its initial complaint. Complaint, Dkt. No. 1. On January 20, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC. In it, Plaintiffs bring twenty state-law claims on which they seek to hold BNPP liable. The Plaintiffs allege that BNPP is liable for negligence per se (Counts 1 and 2), conspiracy to commit battery (Count 3), aiding and abetting battery (Count 4), conspiracy to commit battery in performance of a public duty or authority (Count 5), aiding and abetting battery in performance of a public duty or authority (Count 6), conspiracy to commit assault (Count 7), aiding and abetting assault (Count 8), conspiracy to commit false arrest and false imprisonment (Count 9), aiding and abetting false arrest and false imprisonment (Count 10), conspiracy to commit conversion - wrongful taking (Count 11), aiding and abetting conversion - wrongful taking (Count 12), conspiracy to commit conversion - wrongful detention, use, or disposal (Count 13), aiding and abetting conversion - wrongful detention, use, or disposal (Count 14), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 15), negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count 16), commercial bad faith (Count 17), unjust enrichment (Count 18), conspiracy to commit wrongful death (Count 19), and aiding and abetting wrongful death (Count 20). On March 21, 2017, the Defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in its entirety. Dkt. No. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties agree that New York's statutes of limitations will apply to the causes of action in this case because under New York's borrowing statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 202, the Court must apply the shorter statute of limitations period of either New York or the state where the cause of action accrued. MTD at 6 n.4; Opp. at 14 n.72. The parties further agree that the claims of Plaintiffs who were under the age of 18 at the time of injury may bring claims that are timely. Plaintiffs argue in support of their other claims that they are governed by a seven-year statute of limitations that is applicable to the victims of crime under New York law and that they are further entitled to equitable tolling. The Court concludes that the seven-year statute of limitations is inapplicable, but that the Plaintiffs are entitled to equitable tolling. When equitable tolling is applied, all of Plaintiffs' claims are timely except for their claims alleging intentional act torts (Claims 3-10 and 15), all of which are also dismissed because of the act of state doctrine as explained above. Each of these points is explicated below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Claims of Plaintiffs Injured as Minors Are Timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There is no dispute that the claims of Plaintiffs Abdalla and Ahmed are not time barred because those Plaintiffs were under the age of 18 when they were injured, and in such circumstances, New York law allows claims to be brought within three years after the injured persons turn 18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 6 n.5; Opp. at 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   N.Y.

As alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, both Plaintiff Abdalla and Plaintiff Ahmed were 18 when the initial complaint was filed in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 31, 50. Their claims were thus filed within three years of attaining the age of majority as provided for in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208. As a result, their claims - and the claims of the class of similarly situated individuals - are not dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213-b Is Inapplicable, and a Seven-Year State of Limitations Does Not Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In New York, the intentional tort claims of \"assault, battery, false imprisonment,\n   malicious prosecution, libel, slander, [and] false words causing special damages\" are governed by a one-year statute of limitations, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215, negligence actions are governed by a three-year statute of limitations, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214, and claims based on fraud or bad faith are governed by a six-year statute of limitations, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213. In this case, Plaintiffs argue that none of these statutes of limitations apply because they are victims of Defendants' crimes, and thus their claims are subject to a seven-year statute of limitations under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213-b. This argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under New York law, crime victims have seven years in which to bring civil actions based on the perpetrator's crimes. Specifically, under New York Civil Practice Law Rule 213-b, a seven-year limitations period applies when \"(1) the plaintiff is a crime victim, (2) the defendant has been convicted of a crime, (3) the defendant's crime is the subject of the civil action, and (4) the plaintiff's injury resulted from that crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Boice v.

Thus, the victim of the crime to which BNPP pled guilty was the United States - not the individual Plaintiffs. For this reason, at BNPP's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Goldstein represented to the court that individuals \"who suffered grievous harm at the direction of the regime[ ] in Sudan .... are not victims of this crime [to which BNPP pled guilty] and cannot show that they were directly harmed by BNPP's conduct.\" Transcript, Dkt.

Even accepting these statements, they do not make the Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    victims\n   </em>\n   of the crimes to which BNPP pled guilty for purposes of Rule 213-b rather than indirectly harmed parties. Plaintiffs provide no case law to suggest that New York intended its law to be so expansive that any person\n   <em>\n    affected\n   </em>\n   by a crime could avail herself of a\n   longer statute of limitations.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 111-14, 199, 270. BNPP stipulated to such facts in its related criminal case. Ex. C to SAC, Dkt. No. 49-3, \u00b6\u00b6 22-27, 30, 37-41. Indeed, the Defendants pled guilty to felony concealment under New York law. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 199. Based on these allegations, the Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded that they are entitled to equitable tolling for some period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs are only entitled to equitable tolling until June 2014 rather than May 1, 2015. In particular, Plaintiffs do not contest that BNPP's fraud was widely publicized in June 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 10 n.9 (citing public declarations that BNPP had committed sanctions violations, including funding the Government of Sudan). Such publications were sufficient to put a reasonable person in Plaintiffs' position on notice that they may have claims against the Defendants. Plaintiffs respond that they were \"traumatized victims\" who were \"unfamiliar with the legal system.\" Opp. at 15. While the Court is sympathetic to the experiences the Plaintiffs suffered, this does not eliminate the legal requirement\n   that Plaintiffs demonstrate at least reasonable diligence in pursuing their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because the applicable statutes of limitations began running in June 2014 for Plaintiffs' claims, all claims with a statute of limitations of two or more years are timely. However, Plaintiffs' intentional torts (Claims 3-10 and 15), are governed by a one-year statute of limitations under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 215. As a result, these claims expired in June 2015, nearly a year before the first complaint was filed in this action. As a result, Plaintiffs' Claims 3-10 and 15 are dismissed, except for Plaintiffs who were minors at the time of their injuries. All remaining claims are not dismissed on the basis of the statutes of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on the Court's rulings on the act of state doctrine and statutes of limitations, Plaintiffs' claims in Counts 1-16 and 19-20 are dismissed based on the act of state doctrine. Plaintiffs' claims contained in Counts 3-10 and 15 are alternatively dismissed as untimely for all Plaintiffs who were 18 or older at the time of their alleged injuries. This leaves Plaintiffs' claims in Counts 17 and 18 to be considered on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Remaining Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs allege two claims that do not require the Court to consider whether the acts of the Government of Sudan were legitimate in violation of the act of state doctrine and which are timely under the applicable statute of limitation. These remaining causes of action allege that BNPP engaged in commercial bad faith and was unjustly enriched. The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and will therefore dismiss these remaining claims as to all Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim of Commercial Bad Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs first allege that BNPP committed commercial bad faith in violation of New York law by \"complet[ing] thousands of illegal financial transactions that gave the [Government of Sudan] unlawful access to the U.S. financial system.\" Opp. at 37-38. Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' commercial bad faith claim on two grounds: first, that the claim is governed by the law of either Sudan or Switzerland, which do not recognize a claim for commercial bad faith, MTD at 33; and second, that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a claim upon which relief can be granted, MTD at 33. The Court need not resolve the choice of law question because the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim even if New York law applies. The Court agrees with the Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted and concludes that the commercial bad faith claim created by the state of New York is inapplicable to the facts alleged by the Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The New York Court of Appeals fashioned the doctrine of 'commercial bad faith' as an exception to the general rule that a bank is absolved of liability for a check made out to a fictitious payee when the maker knows that the payee is fictitious.\"\n   <em>\n    Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644965\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/273/#p293\">\n    459 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this doctrine, \"a bank may be held liable if it in fact knows of the fraud and participates in it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644965\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/273/#p293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Second Circuit has cautioned that it has \"considerable doubt whether the doctrine has any applicability\" to claims that \"do not allege fraud in the making and cashing of checks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644965\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/273/#p293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While the Second Circuit has not held conclusively that a commercial bad faith claim could not apply outside of the fraudulent check context, the Court concludes\n   that the doctrine is not applicable to the facts as alleged. All of the case law on the tort of commercial bad faith involves factual circumstances that are not analogous to the facts at issue here. The cases establishing the commercial bad faith doctrine concerned an individual who was the victim of a fraudulent check scheme seeking to hold the participating bank liable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc. v. Citibank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4411835\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/73/263/\">\n    73 N.Y.2d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=539%20N.Y.S.2d%20699\">\n    539 N.Y.S.2d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.E.2d%201118\">\n    536 N.E.2d 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (1989). Even where it has been extended beyond a fraudulent checking scheme to other fraudulent schemes, courts have found a claim of commercial bad faith sufficiently stated only where the plaintiffs were direct victims of the fraudulent scheme or had another sufficiently direct link to the scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mazzaro de Abreu v. Bank of Am. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3388198\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/525/381/#p384\">\n    525 F.Supp.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (plaintiffs were victims of an investment scheme run through defendant banks that cost plaintiffs $250 million);\n   <em>\n    Rossner v. Bank of China\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205416380\">\n    2008 WL 5416380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2008) (plaintiff was permanent equity receiver of perpetrators of fraud). As a result, the commercial bad faith doctrine is inapposite to a case such as this where individuals harmed only indirectly by a fraud seek to hold the bank liable. At the very least, in the absence of case law from either the New York Court of Appeals or the Second Circuit Court of Appeals holding that the commercial bad faith cause of action is applicable on these facts, the Court declines to expand the doctrine in such an unprecedented way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Plaintiffs' claim of commercial bad faith (Count 19) is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs next allege that BNPP was unjustly enriched \"by fees from billions in transactions at Plaintiff's expense.\" Opp. at 38. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not established a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim on two grounds: first, that the claim is governed by the law of either Sudan or Switzerland, which have more stringent requirements than the law of New York, MTD at 32; and second, that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled a claim upon which relief can be granted, MTD at 32. The Court need not resolve the choice of law question because the parties do not dispute that New York law is at least as favorable to the Plaintiffs as the law of any other jurisdiction that might govern the claim, MTD at 32; Opp. at 39, and the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim even under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A claim for unjust enrichment \"is available only in unusual situations when, though the defendant has not breached a contract nor committed a recognized tort, circumstances create an equitable obligation running from the defendant to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Corsello v.
