Furthermore, as EPA points out,\n      <em>\n       see\n      </em>\n      EPA Cross-Mot. at 11 n.2, FOIA leaves to the agency's discretion the question whether a record will be the subject of subsequent requests.

BATES, United States District Judge\n     The world moves fast, but government bureaucracy does not. Officials meet daily with individuals and groups that attempt to sway their thinking on the issues of the moment. But while the buttering-up and sausage-making takes place in real time, citizens may only discover what their officials are up to if they ask-and then sue. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires disclosure of records, such as calendar entries, upon request. Yet agencies may take months to respond, and an incomplete or delayed answer can mean months longer in court. Requesters therefore fear that by the time they can wrest the desired information from an agency's hands, it will be too late for that information to be useful.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      The\n      <em>\n       New York Times\n      </em>\n      and one of its reporters, Eric Lipton, believe they have found a way to cut this Gordian knot. One section of FOIA, known as the \"reading-room provision,\" requires agencies proactively to publish certain materials on their websites. Among other things, agencies must make publicly available any previously-released records that either already have been sought at least three times or are likely to be the subject of further requests.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n       5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a)(2)(D). Lipton and the\n      <em>\n       Times\n      </em>\n      (hereinafter \"plaintiffs\") wish to use this provision to obtain from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), on a rolling basis, the detailed daily calendar of former Administrator Scott Pruitt's activities. EPA counters that the reading-room provision cannot guarantee plaintiffs access to calendar entries that have not yet been, and may never be, created. As the government has the better of this statutory interpretation debate, partial summary judgment will be entered for EPA on Claim One of plaintiffs' complaint.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        BACKGROUND\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      FOIA consists of both proactive and reactive provisions.

The reading-room provision does not enable plaintiffs to seek all future entries in the Administrator's detailed calendar on a rolling basis; it only requires an agency to make publicly available documents that have already been created, requested, and released in the past.

Plaintiffs' interpretation of the reading-room provision, however, would extend its reach to situations like this one in which different groups request information from different date ranges, which do not constitute requests for the \"same\" records. It also could require agencies to continue releasing an official's calendar in perpetuity, after only three requests for even a small number of calendar entries. This would only increase, not alleviate, agencies' workloads.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-36\">\n      The committee reports also provided examples of the sort of \"previously-released records on a popular topic\" that Congress believed would now become subject to the reading-room provision.

No. 114-4, at 4 (2016), 2016 U.S.C.C.A.N. 321, 324. Thus, far from changing what constitutes a record for purposes of the reading-room provision, the 2016 Amendments merely \"clarif[y] that\" the provision applies to \"any document that has been released under FOIA and has been requested three or more times.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 7, 2016 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 327.

Of course, an agency cannot either have created or obtained information that does not yet exist. Nor can the agency have control over information that had not been created at the time of the reactive FOIA request that serves as prerequisite for the reading-room provision.

Pls.' Reply at 15. But more disclosure does not always equal more efficient disclosure. One of Congress's purposes in enacting the 1996 Amendments, which created \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D), was to \"enable agencies to more efficiently use their limited resources to complete [FOIA] requests on time.\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 12-13, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3455-56. Yet plaintiffs' reading of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) would create massive, ongoing duties to publish non-static records if any part or prior version of a record had met the provision's prerequisites. Sticking with the example of a calendar, an agency might be required to publish an office's calendar on a rolling basis if, over several years, three people\n     requested one day's worth of entries each. Or even upon the first request for any entry in the calendar, if the agency determined that other requesters would likely seek that or any other entry. The same might hold true of other non-static records, from email chains to Google Docs to White House access logs.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-45\">\n      Nor does this duty have any natural stopping point. In arguing that the detailed calendar they seek has previously been released, as required by the reading-room provision, plaintiffs note that EPA \"has released the Administrator's Calendar pursuant to FOIA under previous administrations.\" Pls.' Mot. at 11. If release of an agency head's calendar under a prior administration suffices to trigger rolling disclosure of the current agency head's calendar, then a mere three requests for certain entries would necessitate decades of effort on the agency's part. Popular interest in a non-static document like a calendar at one time could saddle an agency with responsibility to publish every update even when there would otherwise be no interest in or request for those updates at a later time. This is not the sort of efficient access that Congress envisioned.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-46\">\n      At oral argument, plaintiffs attempted to draw numerous distinctions: between electronic calendars and certain other non-static documents; between requests for targeted sets of calendar dates and more general calendar requests; and between Pruitt's calendar and other Administrators' calendars, if different Administrators are given different user accounts. This sort of parsing raises more concerns than it resolves. For one thing, agencies and courts would be required to engage in fact-intensive analyses of the particular technology used to create the record(s). This would eliminate much of the efficiency advantage that might otherwise be gained by making future changes to an existing record subject to publication under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). For another thing, the reading-room provision would become subject to manipulation. EPA could, for instance, create new user accounts for the same Administrator each month so that each month's entries would constitute a new record. And, most importantly, FOIA itself mandates none of this line-drawing. Plaintiffs suggest, for example, that editing and overwriting a document might not render the archived and new versions separate records. However, if one created a new document with a new name, rather than overwriting the same one, it would undoubtedly constitute a new record. Nowhere does FOIA state that the reading-room provision can be toggled on and off by pressing \"Save\" versus \"Save As.\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-47\">\n      Plaintiffs point out that if the reading-room provision is not read to require affirmative disclosure of the Administrator's calendar, repeat requesters like them will be forced to file regular FOIA requests.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Pls.'

Mot. at 15-16; Pls.' Reply at 15-16. But \"such anomalies often arise from statutes, if for no other reason than that Congress typically legislates by parts-addressing one thing without examining all others that might merit comparable treatment.\"\n      <em>\n       Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty.\n      </em>\n      , --- U.S. ----,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n       134 S.Ct. 2024\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 2033,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n       188 L.Ed.2d 1071\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2014). If plaintiffs think the reading-room provision's standards should be different, their argument is best directed to Congress. The\n      <em>\n       New York Times\n      </em>\n      certainly has a prominent position from which to do its convincing. And Congress has shown itself willing to tinker significantly with FOIA over the years. Indeed, it last did so only two years ago. Thus, telling plaintiffs to \"take their objections across the street,\"\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-49\">\n      Hence, for all of these reasons, Claim One of plaintiffs' complaint will be dismissed. Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief, requiring EPA regularly to provide updated versions of Pruitt's calendar to plaintiffs until Pruitt leaves office.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Compl. \u00b6 18(b), Prayer for Relief \u00b6 3; Pls.' Mot. at 9, 13. Pruitt has now resigned, but EPA has not yet released these documents, so the issue remains live. However, the injunction is requested as a remedy for EPA's alleged violation of the reading-room provision.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Compl., Prayer for Relief \u00b6 3; Pls.' Mot. at 9, 13, 17; Pls.' Reply at 19-21. Since the reading-room provision has not been violated, no relief is necessary.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-50\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-51\">\n      This Circuit has recognized that delayed disclosure under FOIA, often after protracted litigation, \"provides scant comfort when stale information is of little value yet more costly than fresh information ought to be.\"\n      <em>\n       Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">\n       837 F.2d 486\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Given the strong interest many organizations have shown in the Administrator's daily calendar, EPA would do well to consider adopting a more proactive stance and releasing the calendar on a rolling basis. But FOIA does not\n      <em>\n       require\n      </em>\n      EPA to publish any calendar entries under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) until that provision's prerequisites have been met. And those prerequisites are not met when the information sought has not yet been created. Therefore, the Court will deny plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment and grant EPA's partial motion for summary judgment on Claim One. A separate order has been issued on this date.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
