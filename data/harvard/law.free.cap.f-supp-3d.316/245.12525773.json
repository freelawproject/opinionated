The House noted that it had rejected the Senate's definition because the definition was pulled from the Records Disposal Act, and courts had read that law's disclosure exclusions (e.g., for \"library materials\") so broadly as to place documents beyond FOIA's reach. <em>See</em> H.R.

BATES, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"247\" href=\"#p247\" id=\"p247\">*247</a>The world moves fast, but government bureaucracy does not. Officials meet daily with individuals and groups that attempt to sway their thinking on the issues of the moment. But while the buttering-up and sausage-making takes place in real time, citizens may only discover what their officials are up to if they ask-and then sue. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires disclosure of records, such as calendar entries, upon request. Yet agencies may take months to respond, and an incomplete or delayed answer can mean months longer in court. Requesters therefore fear that by the time they can wrest the desired information from an agency's hands, it will be too late for that information to be useful.</p><p id=\"p-9\">The <em>New York Times</em> and one of its reporters, Eric Lipton, believe they have found a way to cut this Gordian knot. One section of FOIA, known as the \"reading-room provision,\" requires agencies proactively to publish certain materials on their websites. Among other things, agencies must make publicly available any previously-released records that either already have been sought at least three times or are likely to be the subject of further requests. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(a)(2)(D). Lipton and the <em>Times</em> (hereinafter \"plaintiffs\") wish to use this provision to obtain from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), on a rolling basis, the detailed daily calendar of former Administrator Scott Pruitt's activities. EPA counters that the reading-room provision cannot guarantee plaintiffs access to calendar entries that have not yet been, and may never be, created. As the government has the better of this statutory interpretation debate, partial summary judgment will be entered for EPA on Claim One of plaintiffs' complaint.</p><p id=\"p-10\"><em><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></em> <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-11\">FOIA consists of both proactive and reactive provisions. The reactive provision of FOIA mandates that agencies disclose most records upon request. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(a)(3).

But the Act also requires agencies affirmatively to publish certain information about themselves, as well as all their substantive rules and all final opinions or orders resolving agency adjudications. <em>See</em> Pub.

On October 19, 2017, plaintiffs updated their request, asking not only for Pruitt's detailed calendar through the date of EPA's search but also \"that Administrator Pruitt's daily schedule ... be made available for public inspection in an electronic format\" and \"that the record be regularly updated throughout [his] time as a federal employee.\" Langford Decl.

Claim One alleges that EPA's failure to make the Administrator's calendar available on a regularly updated basis throughout Pruitt's tenure violated \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). <em><extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\"> \u00b6\u00b6 23-24</extracted-citation>.

They seek a declaratory injunction that the detailed calendar they seek is a public record which must be published in an electronic format under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D), an injunction ordering EPA to process and release regular updates of the Administrator's calendar, and orders related to the alleged violation of the reactive provision. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">id.</extracted-citation></em> Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.

Mot. at 9. They urge that the calendar meets all of the prerequisites for publication under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) : EPA has already released certain date ranges of the calendar, the calendar is of significant public interest and is likely to be the subject of future requests, and it has already been the subject of three or more FOIA requests. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">id.</extracted-citation></em> EPA responds that plaintiffs \"have fundamentally misread section 552(a)(2)(D),\" which EPA asserts \"cannot, by its terms, apply to future calendar records, or indeed to any categorical type of future records that the agency may or may not produce.\" Gov't Mot. at 8-9. As EPA reads the statute, \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D)'s requirement that a document be released under the reactive provision before the section is triggered dooms plaintiffs' claim, as one cannot make a proper FOIA request for documents that do not yet exist. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">id.</extracted-citation></em> To resolve plaintiffs' claim, then, the Court must determine whether the Administrator's detailed calendar-including both existing and future entries-constitutes a single \"agency record\" which must be continuously published under the reading-room provision.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Two initial observations. First, for the purposes of this opinion, the Court assumes without deciding that the Administrator's detailed electronic calendar up through the date of plaintiffs' FOIA request is an \"agency record\" (or \"records\"). <em>See</em> <em>Consumer Fed'n of Am. v. Dep't of Agric.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456664,3253266\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/455/283/\">455 F.3d 283</extracted-citation>, 293 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (finding that electronic calendars were records subject to FOIA when they were broadly distributed within the agency and other employees at the agency used and relied on them). Second, as \"FOIA's terms apply government-wide,\" the Court will \"decline to accord deference to agency interpretations of the statute, as [it] would otherwise do under\" the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine. <em>Al-Fayed v. CIA</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3728274,11088388\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/300/\">254 F.3d 300</extracted-citation>, 307 (D.C. Cir. 2001).</p><p id=\"p-20\">Ultimately, however, the Court finds that EPA's proffered interpretation is correct. The reading-room provision does not enable plaintiffs to seek all future entries in the Administrator's detailed calendar on a rolling basis; it only requires an agency to make publicly available documents that have already been created, requested, and released in the past. This \"conclusion rests in large part upon the statute's wording, both its individual words and the text taken as a whole.\" <em>Lagos v.

And the ordinary understanding has long been that a \"record\" is an existing document or other permanent, preserved account of past events. This was equally so in 1966, when FOIA itself became law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in 1996 and 2016, when FOIA was amended to include \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Common <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"251\" href=\"#p251\" id=\"p251\">*251</a>usage, and common sense, supports the government's interpretation of the term \"record.\"</p><p id=\"p-31\">Reading both \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) and FOIA as a whole further clarifies that the Administrator's detailed calendar is not a single, continuous \"record\" that must be produced in perpetuity under the reading-room provision. To qualify for publication under that provision, records must first \"have been released to any person\" under the more familiar, reactive FOIA provision. <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(a)(2)(D)(i). If the other prerequisites in the reading-room provision are fulfilled, the agency must publish \"copies\" of those same records. <em><extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). And one of the two ways in which those prerequisites can be met is if records are released under the reactive provision \"that have been requested 3 or more times.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D)(ii). Thus, \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) equates the \"records\" that must be published under the reading-room provision with the \"records\" that have been successfully requested under the reactive provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This language suggests that the particular information that must be published under the reading-room provision has to be the same information that has already been released in the past. <em>See</em> <em>PETA, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/\">285 F.Supp.3d 307</extracted-citation>, 315 n.5 (D.D.C. 2018), <em>appeal docketed</em>, No. 18-5074 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 21, 2018). One cannot previously have released information, or have copies of information, that has not yet been created. Nor is nonexistent information likely to have been requested three times.</p><p id=\"p-32\">This reading of the statute is confirmed by the requirement that an agency \"search\" for the records requested under the reactive provision. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522923\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/307/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 552(a)(3)(C).

Thus, records must already exist at the time of a search to be eligible for release under \u00a7 552(a)(3). Likewise, EPA's published rule for handling reactive FOIA requests notes-in concert with FOIA's definition of a \"search\"-that \"an office will ordinarily include only those records in its possession as of the date the request was received.\" <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.103\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.103</extracted-citation>(a).

Realty Tr., Inc. v. Somers</em>, --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p783\">138 S.Ct. 767</extracted-citation>, 783, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616856\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/767/#p783\">200 L.Ed.2d 15</extracted-citation> (2018) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (\"[E]ven when, as here, a statute's meaning can clearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable legislative history can still be useful, as it enables us to corroborate and fortify our understanding of the text.\"). To begin with, the history indicates that the addition of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) did not render currently nonexistent information subject to mandatory publication. Congress added a definition of \"record\" in the 1996 Amendments-but, as the text of FOIA implies, this was done only to \"make[ ] clear a comprehensive policy that records in electronic formats are agency records subject to the Act.\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 19 (1996), <em>as reprinted in</em> 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3448, 3462. The definition did not create a new substantive definition of what a record is.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, while the reading-room provision broadened the audience to which agencies must disclose certain records, \"matter not previously subject to FOIA when maintained in a non-electronic format [was] not made subject to FOIA by\" the 1996 Amendments. <em>Id.</em>; <em>see</em> 142 Cong. Rec. S10894, 104th Cong. (1996) (statement of Sen. Leahy) (\"[T]he bill would encourage agencies to increase on-line access to government records that agencies <em>currently</em> put in their public reading rooms.\" (emphasis added) ).</p><p id=\"p-34\">Indeed, in the House report on the 1996 Amendments, Congress noted its understanding that \"FOIA establishes a presumptive right for the public to obtain <em>identifiable</em>, <em>existing</em> records of Federal departments and agencies.\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 6, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3449 (emphasis added). This understanding would not appear to bring within FOIA's reach hypothetical, yet-to-be-generated information. Moreover, Congress clarified that \"the term 'record' \" is meant to be \"interchangeable\" with other terms used in FOIA, such as \" 'information' and 'matter.' \" <em>Id.</em> at 19, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3462. It makes little linguistic sense to refer to a document that might be created in the future as constituting the same \"information\" or \"matter\" as an already-existing one, no matter how similar the two may prove to be.</p><p id=\"p-35\">Confirming the clear contemplation of the statutory text, the committee reports on the 1996 and 2016 Amendments repeatedly express Congress's assumption that \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) requires publication only of information that is already in the government's hands when the triggering request is made under the reactive provision. These reports constitute \"the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"253\" href=\"#p253\" id=\"p253\">*253</a>intent\" in passing \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D), <em>Garcia v. United States</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">469 U.S. 70</extracted-citation>, 76, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">105 S.Ct. 479</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">83 L.Ed.2d 472</extracted-citation> (1984), and therefore deserve close attention. Both the House and Senate reports on the 1996 Amendments state that \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) was designed to reduce duplicative FOIA requests for the same documents, and thereby lessen agency workloads. <em>See</em> H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 21, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3464 (stating that \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D)\"would help to reduce the number of multiple FOIA requests for the same records requiring separate agency responses\"); S. Rep. No. 104-272, at 13 (stating that \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D)\"would reduce the number of duplicative FOIA requests for the same records requiring separate agency responses\"). Plaintiffs' interpretation of the reading-room provision, however, would extend its reach to situations like this one in which different groups request information from different date ranges, which do not constitute requests for the \"same\" records. It also could require agencies to continue releasing an official's calendar in perpetuity, after only three requests for even a small number of calendar entries. This would only increase, not alleviate, agencies' workloads.</p><p id=\"p-36\">The committee reports also provided examples of the sort of \"previously-released records on a popular topic\" that Congress believed would now become subject to the reading-room provision. H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 21, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3464. These examples refer to publication of extant documents regarding past events, rather than to rolling disclosures of future documents triggered by prior requests for existing ones. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11958640\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/469/70/#p76\">id.</extracted-citation></em> (\"[C]opies of previously-released records on a popular topic, such as the assassinations of public figures, would subsequently be treated as (a)(2) materials, made available for public inspection and copying.\"); S. Rep. No. 104-272, at 13 (\"[C]opies of records released in response to FOIA requests on a subject of popular interest, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and President Kennedy, or on human radiation experiments conducted by the Government, must subsequently be treated as materials subject to release ....\").<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-37\">The legislative history of the 2016 Amendments provides plaintiffs no more comfort. The 2016 Amendments added the three-request prong to \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). The Senate report described this provision \"as requiring the public posting of documents that have been released under FOIA on three or more occasions.\" S. Rep. No. 114-4, at 4 (2016), 2016 U.S.C.C.A.N. 321, 324. Thus, far from changing what constitutes a record for purposes of the reading-room provision, the 2016 Amendments merely \"clarif[y] that\" the provision applies to \"any document that has been released under FOIA and has been requested three or more times.\" <em>Id.</em> at 7, 2016 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 327. Legislative history therefore corroborates the most sensible reading of the text.</p><p id=\"p-38\">Finally, the courts have developed a test to determine what is an \"agency record.\" <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Judicial Watch</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">726 F.3d at 216</extracted-citation>. That test does not quite translate to this <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"254\" href=\"#p254\" id=\"p254\">*254</a>context, but it nevertheless suggests that FOIA's reference to \"records\" has a retrospective, rather than a prospective, focus. The Supreme Court has instructed that \"the term 'agency records' extends only to those documents that an agency both (1) 'create[s] or obtain[s],' <em>and</em> (2) 'control[s] ... at the time the FOIA request [was] made.' \" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073721,3665058\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/208/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> (quoting <em>U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Tax Analysts</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p144\">492 U.S. 136</extracted-citation>, 144-45, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p144\">109 S.Ct. 2841</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212428\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/136/#p144\">106 L.Ed.2d 112</extracted-citation> (1989) ). Of course, an agency cannot either have created or obtained information that does not yet exist. Nor can the agency have control over information that had not been created at the time of the reactive FOIA request that serves as prerequisite for the reading-room provision. Hence, as a matter of doctrine as well as of statutory interpretation, the Administrator's future calendar is not a \"record\" subject to FOIA's reading-room provision.</p><p id=\"p-39\">Against all this, plaintiffs offer two main responses, neither of which is persuasive. First, they argue that the Administrator's detailed calendar qualifies as a single \"record\" under FOIA because it is a \"continuously updated, non-static\" document. Reply in Supp. of Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Reply\") [ECF No. 27] at 13. Therefore, plaintiffs say, it does not matter that the calendar has been \"updated and released\" only \"in piecemeal fashion until this point.\" <em>Id.</em> at 11.</p><p id=\"p-40\">The central thrust of plaintiffs' argument is the implication that the Administrator's past and future calendar is one record that is merely \"update[ed] or alter[ed]\" by adding each new day's meetings. <em>Id.</em> Plaintiffs cite <em>Yeager v. Drug Enforcement Administration</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1470504,3631084\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/678/315/\">678 F.2d 315</extracted-citation> (D.C. Cir. 1982), for the proposition that \"updating or altering a record does not convert it into a 'new record' for purposes of FOIA.\" Pls.' Reply at 11. But <em>Yeager</em> was not so broad.

It rejected this argument in the context of determining the scope of an agency's \"duty to segregate and release nonexempt material,\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1470504,3631084\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/678/315/\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"1470504,3631084\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/678/315/\"> at 320</extracted-citation>, and cited a case that itself dealt with the segregation duty, <em>see</em> <em>Long v.

FOIA couches this requirement in terms of \"deletion\" of information, <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552</extracted-citation>(b) -hence <em>Yeager</em> <em>'</em> <em>s</em> language-but courts more commonly speak of it in terms of \"redact[ion],\" <em>Am.

And there is a fundamental difference between redacting information from an extant document and creating new information that did not exist when a FOIA request was made. As noted, the former is often required under FOIA's mandate \"to provide 'any reasonably segregable,' non-exempt portion of an existing record.\" <em>Students Against Genocide v. Dep't of State</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725883,11086188\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/828/\">257 F.3d 828</extracted-citation>, 837 (D.C.

It would defeat the purpose of the segregability requirement if following FOIA's directions removed a record from FOIA's ambit. But the statute contains no such mandate to create new information to satisfy a request. <em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">id.</extracted-citation></em> While adding to an existing record does not negate an agency's duty to release a prior, requested version, neither does it obligate an agency to disclose the new, never-sought version to an earlier requester-or proactively to publish it.</p><p id=\"p-41\">Plaintiffs also claim that \"the D.C.

That a statute has an overarching intent, however, does not mean that \"<em>whatever</em> furthers the statute's primary objective must be the law.\" <em>Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver Cty. Emps. Ret. Fund</em>, --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610392\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1061/#p1073\">138 S.Ct. 1061</extracted-citation>, 1073, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610392\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1061/#p1073\">200 L.Ed.2d 332</extracted-citation> (2018). Regardless, interpreting the reading-room provision in the manner plaintiffs prefer would not best fulfill Congress's purpose.</p><p id=\"p-44\">As plaintiffs themselves recognize, the intent behind the reading-room provision is not just \"access,\" but \"efficient access.\" Plaintiffs argue that the phrase \"records ... that have been released\" in \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) should be read to include \"the EPA Administrator's detailed calendar\" because this reading would \"streamlin[e] public access to those records\" in the face of a recent glut of requests for Pruitt's calendar entries. Pls.' Reply at 15. But more disclosure does not always equal more efficient disclosure. One of Congress's purposes in enacting the 1996 Amendments, which created \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D), was to \"enable agencies to more efficiently use their limited resources to complete [FOIA] requests on time.\" H.R. Rep. No. 104-795, at 12-13, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3455-56. Yet plaintiffs' reading of \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) would create massive, ongoing duties to publish non-static records if any part or prior version of a record had met the provision's prerequisites. Sticking with the example of a calendar, an agency might be required to publish an office's calendar on a rolling basis if, over several years, three people <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"256\" href=\"#p256\" id=\"p256\">*256</a>requested one day's worth of entries each. Or even upon the first request for any entry in the calendar, if the agency determined that other requesters would likely seek that or any other entry. The same might hold true of other non-static records, from email chains to Google Docs to White House access logs.</p><p id=\"p-45\">Nor does this duty have any natural stopping point. In arguing that the detailed calendar they seek has previously been released, as required by the reading-room provision, plaintiffs note that EPA \"has released the Administrator's Calendar pursuant to FOIA under previous administrations.\" Pls.' Mot. at 11. If release of an agency head's calendar under a prior administration suffices to trigger rolling disclosure of the current agency head's calendar, then a mere three requests for certain entries would necessitate decades of effort on the agency's part. Popular interest in a non-static document like a calendar at one time could saddle an agency with responsibility to publish every update even when there would otherwise be no interest in or request for those updates at a later time. This is not the sort of efficient access that Congress envisioned.</p><p id=\"p-46\">At oral argument, plaintiffs attempted to draw numerous distinctions: between electronic calendars and certain other non-static documents; between requests for targeted sets of calendar dates and more general calendar requests; and between Pruitt's calendar and other Administrators' calendars, if different Administrators are given different user accounts. This sort of parsing raises more concerns than it resolves. For one thing, agencies and courts would be required to engage in fact-intensive analyses of the particular technology used to create the record(s). This would eliminate much of the efficiency advantage that might otherwise be gained by making future changes to an existing record subject to publication under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D). For another thing, the reading-room provision would become subject to manipulation. EPA could, for instance, create new user accounts for the same Administrator each month so that each month's entries would constitute a new record. And, most importantly, FOIA itself mandates none of this line-drawing. Plaintiffs suggest, for example, that editing and overwriting a document might not render the archived and new versions separate records. However, if one created a new document with a new name, rather than overwriting the same one, it would undoubtedly constitute a new record. Nowhere does FOIA state that the reading-room provision can be toggled on and off by pressing \"Save\" versus \"Save As.\"</p><p id=\"p-47\">Plaintiffs point out that if the reading-room provision is not read to require affirmative disclosure of the Administrator's calendar, repeat requesters like them will be forced to file regular FOIA requests. <em>See</em> Pls.' Mot. at 15; Pls.' Reply at 16. Congress, they assume, could not have intended to require such a cumbersome process for both requester and agency. <em>See</em> Pls.' Mot. at 15-16; Pls.' Reply at 15-16. But \"such anomalies often arise from statutes, if for no other reason than that Congress typically legislates by parts-addressing one thing without examining all others that might merit comparable treatment.\" <em>Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty.</em>, --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">134 S.Ct. 2024</extracted-citation>, 2033, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">188 L.Ed.2d 1071</extracted-citation> (2014). If plaintiffs think the reading-room provision's standards should be different, their argument is best directed to Congress. The <em>New York Times</em> certainly has a prominent position from which to do its convincing. And Congress has shown itself willing to tinker significantly with FOIA over the years. Indeed, it last did so only two years ago. Thus, telling plaintiffs to \"take their objections across the street,\"</p><p id=\"p-49\">Hence, for all of these reasons, Claim One of plaintiffs' complaint will be dismissed. Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief, requiring EPA regularly to provide updated versions of Pruitt's calendar to plaintiffs until Pruitt leaves office. <em>See</em> Compl. \u00b6 18(b), Prayer for Relief \u00b6 3; Pls.' Mot. at 9, 13. Pruitt has now resigned, but EPA has not yet released these documents, so the issue remains live. However, the injunction is requested as a remedy for EPA's alleged violation of the reading-room provision. <em>See</em> Compl., Prayer for Relief \u00b6 3; Pls.' Mot. at 9, 13, 17; Pls.' Reply at 19-21. Since the reading-room provision has not been violated, no relief is necessary.</p><p id=\"p-50\"><em><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-51\">This Circuit has recognized that delayed disclosure under FOIA, often after protracted litigation, \"provides scant comfort when stale information is of little value yet more costly than fresh information ought to be.\" <em>Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1773026,4333453\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/837/486/\">837 F.2d 486</extracted-citation>, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Given the strong interest many organizations have shown in the Administrator's daily calendar, EPA would do well to consider adopting a more proactive stance and releasing the calendar on a rolling basis. But FOIA does not <em>require</em> EPA to publish any calendar entries under \u00a7 552(a)(2)(D) until that provision's prerequisites have been met. And those prerequisites are not met when the information sought has not yet been created. Therefore, the Court will deny plaintiffs' partial motion for summary judgment and grant EPA's partial motion for summary judgment on Claim One. A separate order has been issued on this date.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
