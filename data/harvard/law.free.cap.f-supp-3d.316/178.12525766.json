INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Michael Markowicz is a white man employed as a Special Agent by the United States Secret Service, an organization within the purview of the United States Department of Homeland Security (the \"Department\"). He claims that the Department denied him a promotion because of his race, and instead promoted three minority candidates. This decision, according to Special Agent Markowicz, violated the anti-discrimination provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Department's decision was based on nondiscriminatory criteria. Because a reasonable jury could conclude that the Department's proffered criteria were a pretext for discrimination, the Court denies Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Def.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Garabito Decl. \u00b6 19. Special Agent Markowicz applied to fill one of those open positions.

Ex. 8 at 5-9, ECF No. 29-9. Vacancy 10101 was a GS-14 grade level position, and Special Agent Markowicz was one of many GS-13 employees seeking the promotion, along with one GS-14 employee seeking a lateral move. Def.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12-13. To be eligible for a promotion to the GS-14 level or above, Special Agents must receive a Merit Promotion Plan (\"MPP\") score. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 3.

Ex. 8 at 26. The Advisory Board's membership includes the Secret Service's Deputy Director, Chief of Staff, Assistant Directors, Chief of the Uniformed Division, and Chief Counsel.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Mot. Ex. 13 (listing the Board's membership in December 2010), ECF No. 29-14.

Ex. 8 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In making its recommendations, the Advisory Board considers the views of the office and the division affected by the vacancy. These views are expressed by the Assistant Director of the affected office, who recommends one or more candidates to the Advisory Board after discussions with the office's Deputy Assistant Director and the Special Agent in Charge of the affected division. Magaw Decl. \u00b6 12, 29; Elias Decl. \u00b6 10 (stating that Special Agent in Charge Garabito had input into Assistant Director Elias's recommendations to the Advisory Board); Garabito Decl. \u00b6 8-9, 14 (same).

Selection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Vacancy 10101 was for PIAD positions within the Office of Strategic Intelligence and Information, the Assistant Director for that office, Richard Elias, was charged with recommending candidates for consideration by the Advisory Board. Elias Decl. \u00b6 8. Assistant Director Elias consulted with the Office's then-Deputy Assistant Director, Craig Magaw, and the Special Agent in Charge of PIAD, Nelson Garabito, before submitting his recommendations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Assistant Director Elias ultimately recommended Special Agents Thomas Edwards, Jonathan Wynn, and Gregory Naranjo for promotion, and the Board accepted those recommendations. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Elias Decl. \u00b6 1, 8. The Director of the Secret Service concurred with the Advisory Board's decision, and Special Agents Edwards, Wynn, and Naranjo were promoted to the three vacant PIAD ATSAIC positions. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 17; Def.'s Mot. Ex. 10 at 2, ECF No. 29-11. Special Agent Markowicz was not promoted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Thomas Edwards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Special Agent Edwards was ranked first on the Promotion Certificate for Vacancy 10101, meaning he had the highest MPP score of any GS-13 applicant, and he was ranked twelfth on the nationwide Promotion Register.

Def.'s Mot. Ex. 11, ECF No. 29-12. In total, he had eleven years and six months of experience as a Special Agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But he provided protective services only during his four years in the Vice Presidential Protective Division.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, he did not serve in either PIAD or the Presidential Protective Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Def.'s Mot. Ex. 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Elias Decl. \u00b6 21. He was therefore seeking promotion\n   within his current division. In total, he had twelve years and seven months of experience as a Special Agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Ex. 11.

George Luczko's Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Shortly after Special Agent Markowicz learned of his non-promotion, he allegedly had a revealing conversation with a member of the Secret Service's Advisory Board, George Luczko, who was the Assistant Director for the Office of Professional Responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Ex. 13; Markowicz Sept. 2011 Decl. \u00b6 9.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Special Agent Markowicz filed an administrative complaint and then, having failed\n   to obtain relief through the administrative process, filed suit in this Court against the Department alleging, among other claims, that the Department violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   by discriminating against him on the basis of his race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.; Def.'s Mot.

It is undisputed that Assistant Director Luczko was a member of the Secret Service Advisory Board in late 2010, when Vacancy 10101 opened.

Def.'s Statement \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.

The record indicates two key flaws. First, the Department's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its decision not to promote Special Agent Markowicz were based on subjective considerations. Second, Special Agent Markowicz has shown that those factors were not applied consistently to the candidates for Vacancy 10101. The significance of these flaws turns on the credibility of the Department's decision makers, an issue that is \"quintessentially one for the finder of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Aka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2338951,1567119\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/1284/\">\n    156 F.3d at 1298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Department's proffered reasons for not selecting Special Agent Markowicz to\n   fill Vacancy 10101 are based on subjective determinations about which types of experience would be valuable to the position. It claims that it selected Special Agent Wynn over Special Agent Markowicz, despite Special Agent Markowicz's more substantial body of work and higher MPP score, because Special Agent Wynn had prior experience in the Intelligence Division (the precursor to the PIAD) and in the Presidential Protective Detail, and because he \"had a reputation of being a hard worker in his prior assignments.\" Def.'s Statement \u00b6 21-23. Similarly, Special Agent Naranjo was selected because he was \"already an effective performer in PIAD\" and because an internal promotion would raise the division's morale. Def.'s Statement \u00b6 24; Garabito Decl. \u00b6 18. While Special Agent Markowicz had experience with the Vice Presidential Protective Division, the Department claims it was significant that he did not have Intelligence Division or Presidential Protective Division experience.

Ex. 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   To the extent that the Advisory Board emphasized certain factors over other factors when deciding which candidates should fill Vacancy 10101, Special Agent Markowicz has thus called into question whether those factors were used as a pretext to discriminate against him. The Court is particularly skeptical of the Department's reasoning because the Department has not shown how the factors were applied at the time of its promotion decision, but rather has justified the decision post hoc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050673,3769317\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1344/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1355-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Special Agent Markowicz has presented circumstantial evidence related to (1) his qualifications for Vacancy 10101 compared to the qualifications of the successful candidates; (2) Assistant Director Luczko's statement about the Advisory Board's practices; and (3) the Department's selection process and its, apparent, inconsistent application of its proffered criteria. Although any one of these factors alone likely would not defeat summary judgment, the Court must consider them all together. Giving all inferences to Special Agent Markowicz as the nonmoving party, and in light of the case law in this Circuit, the Court holds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Department's reasons for failing to promote Special Agent Markowicz were pretextual, masking a discriminatory employment decision. For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 29) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    As the Department notes, Special Agent Markowicz's Statement of Disputed Material Facts (\"Pl.'s Statement\"), ECF No. 31-1, fails to contest many of the facts asserted in the Department's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s Statement\"), ECF No. 29.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot.
