BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 21, 2014, Plaintiff Cecil Holt (\"Holt\") was injured while working on a construction site at 402 Tingey Street SE, Washington, D.C. when he fell through a hole in the roof he alleges was improperly covered. Holt is an employee of Tradesmen International, LLC (\"Tradesmen\"), a corporation that provides temporary, unskilled labor to its clients. In April 2014, Tradesmen entered into a Client Services Agreement with Third-Party Defendant AES Clean Technology, Inc. (\"AES\"), in which Tradesmen agreed to assign Holt to AES on a permanent basis. AES, in turn, assigned Holt to work for Third-Party Defendant Unified Building Systems, Inc. (\"UBS\"), a division of AES. UBS, through AES, was a subcontractor of Third-Party Plaintiff Walsh Construction Company II, LLC (\"Walsh\"), the general contractor of the construction project at 402 Tingey Street SE. UBS and Walsh have a signed Subcontract Agreement (\"Subcontract\") dated August 15, 2012, that governed the nearly $3,000,000 of work UBS completed for Walsh on the project, namely, installing metal wall panels and louvers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Holt originally filed his action in the D.C. Superior Court, naming Walsh\n   (among others) as a Defendant, alleging that Walsh's negligent control of the construction premises and project contributed to his injury. The action was subsequently removed to this Court on diversity jurisdiction. Holt had also named AES as a Defendant in the original action, but that claim was dismissed with Plaintiff's consent. Minute Order on July 27, 2017 granting Dkt. 19. On January 31, 2018, Walsh filed a Third-Party Complaint against AES and UBS (among others), seeking, in the event Walsh is found liable to Holt, (1) contractual indemnification (Counts VII and X), (2) equitable indemnification (Counts VIII and XI), and (3) contribution (Counts IX and XII\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) pursuant to the Subcontract, in which Walsh contends that UBS agreed to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Walsh in and against all claims or actions arising out of work performed under the Subcontract. [Dkt. 37 at 13-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the pending motion to dismiss, Third-Party Defendants AES and UBS (\"AES/UBS\") argue that Walsh's claims for indemnification and contribution are barred by the WCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2032-1501\">\n    D.C.

Walsh counters that its contractual indemnification claim falls within an exception to section 32-1504, which allows for express indemnification provisions. [Dkt. 55 at 7]. Walsh also contends that the Subcontract contains an express waiver of section 32-1504, which should operate to allow its indemnification and contribution claims to proceed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2032-1501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

If an employee is injured on the job and wants compensation from his employer, he must bring suit under the WCA in accordance with section 32-1504, an exclusivity provision that limits both the scope of an employer's liability and the compensation available to an employee. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The liability of an employer prescribed in [the section regarding coverage] shall be exclusive and in place of all liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, spouse or domestic partner, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law on account of such injury or death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The compensation to which an employee is entitled under this chapter shall constitute the employee's exclusive remedy against the employer, or any collective-bargaining agent of the employer's employees and any employee, officer, director, or agent of such employer, insurer, or collective-bargaining agent (while acting within the scope of his employment) for any illness, injury, or death arising out of and in the course of his employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1504\">\n    D.C.

The WCA's exclusivity provision seeks to strike a balance between employee and employer: the employee gets \"faster and virtually guaranteed compensation for accidental job-related injury,\" even where the employee was negligent, and the employer's assumption of a degree of no-fault liability relieves it \"of its previously unlimited common law tort liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Myco, Inc. v.

If AES/UBS are not Holt's employer, the WCA does not apply and it would not limit the types of claims Walsh may bring against AES/UBS. AES/UBS argue that they are Holt's employer under the \"lent employee\" doctrine and are thereby protected by the WCA's exclusivity provision. [Dkt. 52-1 at 4]. Walsh fails to contest AES/UBS's \"lent employee\" argument in its opposition. [Dkt. 55 at 5]. The argument is therefore conceded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

The \"lent employee\" doctrine\n   holds that when a \"general employer\" lends an employee to a \"special employer,\" the \"special employer\" also becomes liable for workers' compensation if: \"(a) the employee has made a contract of hire, express or implied, with the special employer; (b) the work being done is essentially that of the special employer; and (c) the special employer has the right to control the details of the work.\"\n   <em>\n    USA Waste of Maryland, Inc. v.

Although there is no express contract between Holt and AES, in\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   the court found that an employee's consent to the special employment relationship created an implied contract of hire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180307\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/954/1027/#p1034\">\n    954 A.2d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the third element-that the special employer has the right to control the details of the work-is met by reviewing the language in Tradesmen's contract with AES: \"[AES] is solely responsible for directing, supervising and controlling Tradesmen employees as well as their work ...\" [Dkt. 37-6 at 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a \"lent employee,\" Holt is thus barred by the WCA's exclusivity provision from bringing a tort action against AES/UBS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Love\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180307\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/954/1027/#p1034\">\n    954 A.2d at 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question remains whether Walsh's indemnification and contribution claims are also barred by the WCA because they are based on allegations of fault and negligence on AES/UBS's part. Walsh contends that its claims survive application of the WCA because: (1) they fall into an exception to the WCA's exclusivity provision for express indemnification, and (2) AES/UBS have waived the WCA's exclusivity provision in its Subcontract with Walsh.
