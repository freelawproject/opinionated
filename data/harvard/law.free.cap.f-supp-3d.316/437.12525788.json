No. 13] to suppress tangible evidence, both filed on June 5, 2018. The government filed an omnibus opposition\n   [Dkt. No. 17] to the motions to suppress on June 18, 2018. On July 11, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motions. The government presented two witnesses - Officer Krishaon Ewing and Officer Dmitry Gendelman. And both parties submitted evidence, including a number of video recordings from officers' body-worn cameras, and made further arguments in support of their positions. Upon consideration of the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the written and oral arguments of the parties, and the entire record in this case, the Court will grant both motions to suppress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the afternoon of February 3, 2018, Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") officers were patrolling the 2300 block of Good Hope Court in Southeast Washington, D.C. During this routine patrol, Officers Krishaon Ewing, Herman Kelly, and David Whitehead were riding as passengers in a marked police car driven by Officer Lavon Woods. According to Officer Ewing's testimony, the officers spotted three men, two of whom the officers suspected were drinking open containers of alcohol because the men were drinking from red \"Solo-style\" cups. Mr. Wills was the third man, not drinking from a red cup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Officer Ewing testified that, upon seeing the police car drive closer to the group, Mr. Wills turned and started to walk away, toward the exit of the apartment complex. Officer Ewing initially testified that \"[o]nce we stopped the vehicle, [Mr. Wills] was looking over his shoulder at [the police car]\" and only when Officer Ewing exited the vehicle did Mr. Wills begin to flee, running while holding his waistband. But when confronted with the footage from his own body-worn camera, Officer Ewing acknowledged that Mr. Wills \"was running when [Officer Ewing] got out of the car.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In any event, Mr. Wills ran and Officers Ewing, Kelly, and Whitehead pursued him on foot, while Officer Woods circled around in the police car. Officer Ewing testified that, because of the way Mr. Wills held his waistband with his right hand as he ran, with his left arm swinging, he believed that Mr. Wills had a firearm on his person. He explained that he based this belief on his prior experiences as an officer in similar situations, where a defendant had run while carrying a firearm in his waistband without a holster. Officer Ewing pursued Mr. Wills through the apartment complex, following him through two covered apartment building walkways. Officer Ewing testified that, as Mr. Wills turned corners during the pursuit, Officer Ewing would momentarily lose sight of him. In particular, as Mr. Wills exited the second covered walkway and turned to the left, Officer Ewing lost sight of him until Officer Ewing also exited the covered walkway. According to the footage from his body-worn camera, Officer Ewing drew his gun when he lost sight of Mr. Wills, before Officer Ewing exited the second covered walkway. Officer Ewing testified that, as he emerged from the second covered walkway, he heard a \"metallic object hit the wall\" of the apartment building. He then\n   saw Mr. Wills continuing his flight, no longer clutching his waistband. In addition, Officer Ewing observed Mr. Wills' hand \"coming down from ... a curved shape,\" as if \"coming back from a tossing motion.\" Officer Ewing did not see any object in Mr. Wills' hand. Because of Mr. Wills' gait, his arm movements, and the metallic noise, Officer Ewing testified that, based on his experience as a police officer, he believed Mr. Wills had thrown a gun against the building after he exited the second covered walkway. At that point, Officer Ewing alerted the other officers to this belief and used the police radio to broadcast the code word for \"firearm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after exiting the second covered walkway, Officer Ewing caught up to Mr. Wills and forcibly stopped him by pushing him into the patrol car being driven by Officer Woods. Mr. Wills crashed into the car and then fell to the pavement, sustaining abrasions to his head and the palms of his hands. Officer Ewing directed the other officers to search the bushes lining the wall of the apartment building for the firearm. After he assisted Officer Woods to handcuff Mr. Wills, Officer Ewing went over to join the search himself. Less than two minutes later, other MPD officers, including Officer Dmitry Gendelman, arrived on the scene. Officer Gendelman testified that, upon his arrival, he volunteered to assist Officer Woods with standing-up and supervising Mr. Wills, who was now handcuffed with his hands behind his back, while the other officers joined the search for the firearm. After helping Mr. Wills to his feet, Officer Gendelman immediately unzipped Mr. Wills' backpack, still attached to Mr. Wills' back, and searched its contents. During his testimony, Officer Gendelman explained that he was looking for contraband, including a potential firearm. During this time, Officer Woods questioned Mr. Wills, asking whether he lived on the premises, whether he had any identification, and whether he needed medical attention for his abrasions. As a result of the search of Mr. Wills' backpack, Officer Gendelman found a clear plastic bag containing approximately three ounces of a green leafy substance, later determined to be marijuana, as well as a digital scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During and after the search of his backpack, Mr. Wills appeared quite concerned about what Officer Gendelman had discovered in the backpack and made multiple related incriminating statements, such as \"You seen what's in my bag. That's why I ran.\" In addition, while Officer Woods continued to ask Mr. Wills questions to elicit booking information, Officer Gendelman asked him, \"You throw something or no?\" Mr. Wills responded to Officer Gendelman's question by stating: \"Man, look, I only threw a knife, that's what I'm telling you.\" At the time he made these statements, Mr. Wills had not been given\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Wills was subsequently indicted and now faces three criminal charges: (1) unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) ; (2) unlawful possession with intent to distribute marijuana,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), 841(b)(1)(D) ; and (3) use of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). In the instant motions, Mr. Wills seeks to suppress the contents of his backpack, as well as his statements regarding its contents, as fruit of an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. He also seeks to suppress his admission to throwing a knife as a violation of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.

First, the government argues that the police officers had reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop of Mr. Wills and a search of his backpack under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 4-7. Second, the government asserts that the officers had probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed at the time of the search and, as a result, the search of Mr. Wills' backpack was a permissible search incident to lawful arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 7-9. Finally, the government maintains that even if the search of Mr. Wills' backpack was neither a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   search nor a search incident to a lawful arrest, the firearm inevitably would have been discovered once the officers found the gun in the bushes and thus had probable cause to arrest Mr. Wills - they then permissibly could have searched him incident to arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that none of these exceptions applies here. As a result, the contents of Mr. Wills' backpack must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

But at the time of the search, the only facts in support of criminal activity were Mr. Wills' flight from police and Officer Ewing's observations that Mr. Wills held his waistband as he ran, that he heard the \"clink\" of metal on brick when he lost sight of Mr. Wills, and that, after regaining a line of sight, he saw Mr. Wills' hand come down as if completing a tossing motion.

In this case, however, the government has not presented any affirmative evidence of an inventory search policy of the MPD which would have inevitably resulted in the discovery of the contents of Mr. Wills' backpack. In fact, at the motions hearing, the government expressly disclaimed any reliance on an inventory search theory for purposes of inevitable discovery analysis. Instead, the government relies exclusively on the argument that the contents of the backpack would have been discovered pursuant to a lawful search incident to arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The government correctly notes that although the officers did not have probable cause at the time of the search, probable cause materialized shortly thereafter when officers found the gun. The government thus argues that discovery of the backpack's contents was inevitable because, once the officers found the gun and thus had probable cause to arrest Mr. Wills for a firearms offense, the officers could have lawfully searched the backpack incident to arrest. In support of this contention, the government cites an MPD General Order, which apparently serves as the Department's search incident to arrest policy. The Order provides in relevant part that \"[a]t the time of arrest, prisoners shall be thoroughly searched and all personal property, including those items (e.g., ties, belts, suspenders, scarfs, etc.) that could be used to inflict injuries upon themselves, shall be removed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   METRO.

As defense counsel has argued, it appears from the officers' body-worn camera footage that Mr. Wills would have had to engage in significant acrobatics in order to gain access to the contents of his backpack at the time it was searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And in fact, Officer Gendelman testified unequivocally that Mr. Wills could not have accessed the contents of his backpack while he was handcuffed. Thus, even if probable cause had existed at the time of the search, there does not appear to have been any realistic possibility that Mr. Wills could have accessed the contents of his backpack at that time. And where the \"justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent,\" the exception does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

It is impossible for the\n   Court to do more than hypothesize as to what \"inevitably\" would have occurred in such a scenario. Had the backpack not been illegally searched prior to the existence of probable cause, would officers have searched the backpack while it was still on Mr. Wills' back, or removed it and brought it several feet away? Would officers have removed Mr. Wills' handcuffs to take off the backpack or simply unbuckled the straps while Mr. Wills remained handcuffed? Would Mr. Wills have been locked inside of a police vehicle before or during such a search? Would his backpack have been removed before he was placed in a police vehicle? How many officers would have stood by to supervise Mr. Wills while another officer searched the backpack, either nearby or elsewhere? Such hypothesizing and speculation is the very antithesis of the inevitable discovery doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566449,5860885\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/1288/\">\n    505 F.3d at 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Certainly, what officers did later is somewhat instructive. Officer Keleman's body-worn camera footage shows that a few minutes later, while officers were tending to Mr. Wills' bleeding hands and after the gun had been found, Officer Gendelman conducted a second search of the backpack. He reopened the backpack, removed the bag of marijuana, and then spoke to Mr. Wills while confronting him with the bag of marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Wills' backpack then hung open for several more minutes. After cleaning and bandaging Mr. Wills' hands, Officer Keleman then removed Mr. Wills' backpack by undoing the straps, while Mr. Wills remained handcuffed. Officer Keleman walked a few feet away with the backpack and there proceeded to search it for a third time. Subsequently, Officer Keleman and then another unidentified officer proceeded to hold the backpack, carrying it as they walked around the scene before eventually leaving with the bag in a car separate from Mr. Wills' transport. Based on these facts, if either of these searches had been conducted as an initial search incident to arrest, it is not readily apparent that Mr. Wills would have had access to or control of the backpack justifying the exception to the search warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But again, the Court need not decide whether either or both of these searches of Mr. Wills' backpack would have amounted to a lawful search incident to arrest had they not been preceded by an unlawful search. It is certainly possible to review the various courses of conduct available to the officers and speculate about what they\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have done to eventually lawfully discover the marijuana as the result of a reasonable search.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Gore v.

Mr. Wills was compliant, handcuffed, and surrounded by multiple armed police officers; numerous other officers were on the scene searching for a firearm; and the search area was relatively defined and secured. In addition, Officer Gendelman had already (unlawfully) searched the contents of Mr. Wills' backpack. These circumstances stand in stark contrast to the cases cited by the government, in which officers were justified under the public safety exception in asking whether suspects currently had any weapons on their persons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 17 n.7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under the circumstances presented here, Officer Gendelman's question was objectively made not to resolve a threat to public safety, but to elicit an incriminating statement from Mr. Wills and more expeditiously recover incriminating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The government urges the Court nonetheless to find that public safety was implicated by an objective concern for an unrecovered and potentially loaded firearm. The government characterizes the officers' search as a \"frantic\" one and suggests that, as a result, Officer Gendelman's question - \"You throw something or no?\" - reflected an objective need to urgently locate the gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 17. But again, the circumstances here stand in stark contrast to those presented in cases where the public safety exception has been found to apply. This was not an instance, for example, in which one or two officers faced the imperative of locating a gun which they believed had been discarded in an unsecured zone from which some member of the public might retrieve it and either destroy the evidence or harm themselves or others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v.

Rather, a large number of officers were searching a relatively secured and limited area in a diligent and methodical manner, while Officers Woods and Gendelman stayed with the detained suspect. In fact, as officers searched the bushes alongside the apartment building, they appeared determined to locate a firearm, as evidenced by the body-worn camera footage and the testimony of Officers Ewing and Gendelman. Furthermore, by its plain language, the question itself did not seek to have Mr. Wills assist in locating a firearm - Officer Gendelman did not ask, for example, \"where is the gun?\" or \"did it land in the bushes?\" Rather, Officer Gendelman asked a question designed to elicit an incriminating response: \"You throw something or no?\" Assessing the plain meaning of Officer Gendelman's question in light of the objective circumstances, the government has failed to justify application of the public safety exception to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   's requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Mr.\n   Wills' statement that he threw a knife must be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will suppress the contents of Mr. Wills' backpack, as well as his statements relating to the contents of his backpack, as fruit of the poisonous tree under the Fourth Amendment. The Court will also suppress Mr. Wills' statement to Officer Gendelman that he threw a knife as a result of the failure to first provide Mr. Wills with the requisite\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Accordingly, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ORDERED that Mr. Wills' motion [Dkt. No. 12] to suppress statements is GRANTED; and it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that Mr. Wills' motion [Dkt.

Because the Court finds the evidence and statements at issue to have been unlawfully obtained in any event, the Court need not determine whether this use of force converted a legitimate\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    stop into an unlawful arrest or instead merely represented a \"legitimate[ ] escalat[ion]\" in response to attempted flight.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
