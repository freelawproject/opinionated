Western Power alleges that \"Defendant induced Plaintiff into entering into an agreement which Defendant had no intention of living up to.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransAmerican argues that \"WPI will be unable to prove that TAPP made a material misrepresentation to WPI with respect to the commissions to be paid on net sales over $1,000,001 as the Agreement explicitly states that those commissions are 'to be negotiated.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western Power responds that \"Defendant, who worked at concealing how the commissions would be calculated and paid for years, never intended to pay Plaintiff all amounts due\" and that TransAmerican's silence in response to requests for information \"[i]s evidence from which Defendant's subjective intent to deceive Plaintiff may be inferred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Western Power raises a genuine issue of material fact as to this claim. The summary judgment evidence establishes that Western Power requested information about how TransAmerican calculated commissions and repeatedly asked about when it would receive commission payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence also shows that TransAmerican paid different percentages of the net sales as commission on jobs with net sales of $1,000,001 or more. Although Western Power provides no evidence of any \"material misrepresentation,\" a reasonable jury could find that TransAmerican induced Western Power to agree to the Agreement's payment terms, including the amount \"to be negotiated.\" Therefore, the court will deny Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to this claim. To summarize, the court will grant Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's claim for quantum meruit on jobs with net sales of $1,000,001 or more, and will deny Defendant's Motion as to the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Western Power's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Western Power moves for partial summary judgment as to TransAmerican's liability on its breach of contract claim. Western Power argues that \"Defendant admits Plaintiff and Defendant had a contract\n   under which Defendant owes Plaintiff commissions Defendant has not paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support its argument that TransAmerican admitted liability Western Power attaches an excel spreadsheet that TransAmerican produced during mediation that shows how it calculated Western Power's commission and includes a column entitled \"Owed to WP.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransAmerican responds that Western Power is not entitled to summary judgment because the excel spreadsheet is inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransAmerican does not dispute the other arguments presented in Western Power's motion. The only portion of TransAmerican's Response that the court could interpret as an attempt to dispute liability reads \"TAPP certainly would not have shown the Excel Spreadsheet and extensively discussed its contents at the mediation if TAPP believed that in so doing it was admitting liability to Plaintiff on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court concludes that Western Power has satisfied its initial burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact as to liability exists. Nowhere in TransAmerican's Response does it dispute its liability or present any evidence that raises an issue of fact. Because TransAmerican only challenges the admissibility of the excel spreadsheet but has failed to present evidence establishing a genuine issue for trial on liability, partial summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Topalian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519776\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/954/1125/#p1132\">\n    954 F.2d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court will decide at trial on the admissibility of the spreadsheet, which is relevant to the amount of Western Power's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Western Power's Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Western Power argues that TransAmerican's conduct is sanctionable under Rules 37(e) (1) and 37(e) (2). Rule 37(e) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Failure to Preserve Electronically Stored Information.\n   </strong>\n   If electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e). The advisory committee notes to Rule 37 state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Because the rule calls only for reasonable steps to preserve, it is inapplicable when the loss of information occurs despite the party's reasonable steps to preserve. For example, the information may not be in the party's control. Or information the party has preserved may be destroyed by events outside the party's\n   control-the computer room may be flooded, a \"cloud\" service may fail, a malign software attack may disrupt a storage system, and so on. Courts may, however, need to assess the extent to which a party knew of and protected against such risks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37, Advisory Committee Notes, 2015 Amendment, Subdivision (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Western Power argues that invoices and other documents concerning commission or net sales were relevant to the dispute, in TransAmerican's custody and control, should have been preserved, and were destroyed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western Power contends that even if TransAmerican's computer system was hacked on September 16, 2017,-destroying the sales records between the parties-TransAmerican should have taken reasonable steps to preserve and protect the information since April 4, 2017, the date Western Power filed its Complaint, or since June 5, 2017, the date TransAmerican filed its Answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Western Power argues that it was prejudiced by the loss and that \"Defendant's inaction is sufficient circumstantial evidence from which to infer that it intended to deprive Plaintiff of the relevant data.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   TransAmerican responds that it took reasonable steps to preserve the electronically stored information before and after the cyberattack, that Western Power has not been prejudiced because it already prepared its underpayment calculation, that it did not act in bad faith or intend to deprive Western Power, and that Rule 37(e) is inapplicable when the loss occurs due to a \"malign software attack.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   TransAmerican argues that because all of its servers and computers were affected by the cyberattack, any attempt to segregate relevant data into another file would have been fruitless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although the advisory notes state that Rule 37(e) does not apply after a malign software attack, the court may assess whether Defendant adequately protected against the risk of such an attack. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37, Advisory Committee Notes, 2015 Amendment, Subdivision (e). Because the court's determination on whether TransAmerican took reasonable steps to preserve the information before the cyberattack is fact-intensive, the court will listen to the evidence and if it concludes that TransAmerican did not take reasonable steps the court will consider giving a spoliation instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion and Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis Defendant TransAmerican Power Products, Inc.'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff's Claims (Docket Entry No. 24) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   ; and Plaintiff Western Power, Inc.'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Liability on Plaintiff's Breach of Contract Claim (Docket Entry No. 22) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   The court's ruling on Plaintiff Western Power, Inc.'s Motion for Sanctions Under FRCP Rule 37 for Failure to Preserve Evidence (Docket Entry No. 25) is\n   <strong>\n    DEFERRED\n   </strong>\n   until the court has heard the evidence at trial.
