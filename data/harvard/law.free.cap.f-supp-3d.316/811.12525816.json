(\"BuzzFeed\"), alleging that BuzzFeed reproduced and published without authorization a copyrighted photograph owned by Mango. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Amended Complaint,\" Dkt. No. 16.) Mango alleges that he created a photograph depicting a man named Raymond Parker (the \"Photograph\"), licensed the Photograph to the\n   <em>\n    New York Post\n   </em>\n   , a daily newspaper, and registered the Photograph with the U.S. Copyright Office. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-16.) Mango alleges that BuzzFeed subsequently published a copy of the Photograph on its website, BuzzFeed News, without licensing the Photograph or otherwise obtaining permission from Mango. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-26.) On these facts Mango brings claims for copyright infringement (Count I) and for the removal of copyright management information (Count II). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A one-day bench trial is scheduled for August 13, 2018. BuzzFeed filed two motions in limine pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence (\"FRE\") 401, 402, 403, and 602. (Dkt. Nos. 38, 39.) BuzzFeed seeks to preclude Mango from: (1) presenting evidence regarding BuzzFeed's general financial condition (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"First Motion,\" Dkt. No. 38), and (2) calling Wajmah Yaqubi (\"Yaqubi\"), who works in BuzzFeed's legal department, as a witness (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Second Motion,\" Dkt. No. 39). For the following reasons, the First Motion is GRANTED and the Second Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by enabling the Court to rule in advance of trial on the relevance of certain forecasted evidence, as to issues that are definitely set for trial, without lengthy argument at, or interruption of, the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Palmieri v.

FRE 402 provides that relevant evidence is generally admissible, and FRE 403 provides\n   that evidence that is relevant may nonetheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by, among other considerations, the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 402, 403. Under FRE 401, \"[e]vidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\" Fed. R. Evid. 401. FRE 602 provides that \"[a] witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" Fed. R. Evid. 602. A witness's own testimony may prove her personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9043236\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/136/#p141\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FIRST MOTION; BUZZFEED'S FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BuzzFeed moves to preclude Mango from introducing evidence detailing BuzzFeed's net worth and general financial condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Motion.) BuzzFeed argues that such evidence would not be relevant to any damages calculation in this case, whether Mango elects to seek actual or statutory damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Additionally, BuzzFeed argues that any relevance of the financial information would be substantially outweighed by the prejudice BuzzFeed would suffer by producing it because the requested data is highly sensitive for the private company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Finally, BuzzFeed argues that the evidence has particularly low probative value in light of the fact that it has offered to stipulate to BuzzFeed's size, number of employees, and international presence, thereby obviating the need to disclose sensitive financial information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In opposition to the First Motion, Mango argues that BuzzFeed's financial condition is relevant to the deterrence effect of a potential damages award, which is a factor for the Court to consider in calculating statutory damages under the Copyright Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Pl. Mem. of Law\" at 8-10, Dkt. No. 40.) Mango argues that BuzzFeed's arguments for excluding the financial information presuppose that the alleged infringement in this case was not willful, but, Mango argues, he will prove willfulness at trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Mango further argues that a statutory damages award that will deter a defendant need not be based on the licensing fee the defendant would have paid if it obtained a license before publication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.) Finally, Mango argues that it would be amenable to stipulating to BuzzFeed's size, number of employees, international presence, and its approximate total net worth in order to avoid presenting live testimony about BuzzFeed's financial condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In reply, BuzzFeed argues that Mango has failed to show how the probative value of producing evidence of BuzzFeed's total net worth would outweigh the prejudice BuzzFeed would suffer as a result, especially in light of the fact that this is a case regarding a single use of a single photograph. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Def. Reply\" at 4-5, Dkt. No. 42.) BuzzFeed argues that the information to which it offered to stipulate, without including information about the company's total net worth, would be sufficient information about the size of the company for the Court to calculate statutory damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 504 of the Copyright Act provides that a copyright owner may elect to pursue either actual damages or statutory damages as a remedy for copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barcroft Media, Ltd. v.

Statutory damages may range from $750 to $30,000 for each copyrighted work, although a court may increase the award up to $150,000 for willful\n   infringement and may decrease it to $200 for an innocent infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), (2). In determining the amount of statutory damages, a court considers: \"(1) the infringer's state of mind; (2) the expenses saved, and profits earned, by the infringer; (3) the revenue lost by the copyright holder; (4) the deterrent effect on the infringer and third parties; (5) the infringer's cooperation in providing evidence concerning the value of the infringing material; and (6) the conduct and attitude of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

Mar. 31, 2016). In most cases, calculating statutory damages as a multiple of a reasonable licensing fee accomplishes the necessary deterrence by \"put[ting] infringers on notice that it costs less to obey the copyright laws than to violate them.\"\n   <em>\n    Broad. Music\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4327744\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/158/184/#p199\">\n    158 F.Supp.3d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court is persuaded that evidence of BuzzFeed's total net worth is not relevant to a potential statutory damages calculation in this case. BuzzFeed has agreed to stipulate to its size, number of employees, and international presence, and those facts will suffice to give the Court an understanding of the deterrent effect of a potential statutory damages award. Any statutory damages calculation in this case will surely pale in comparison to the total net worth of BuzzFeed; learning the total net worth of the company will therefore not helpfully inform the Court's calculation. Additionally, any potential relevance of BuzzFeed's financial data would be substantially outweighed by the delay and waste of time the presentation of such evidence would cause and the prejudice BuzzFeed would suffer as a result of disclosing private financial data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Therefore, the Court GRANTS BuzzFeed's motion to preclude evidence concerning BuzzFeed's financial condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     SECOND MOTION; YAQUBI'S TESTIMONY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With the Second Motion, BuzzFeed seeks to prevent Mango from obtaining testimony from Yaqubi about BuzzFeed's \"standards and practices, training given to BuzzFeed employees generally, and the witness's investigation of the claim following the filing of the lawsuit.\" (Second Motion at 1.) BuzzFeed argues that Yaqubi's\n   involvement in the case is limited to her investigation of BuzzFeed's use of the Photograph after Mango filed the instant case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) BuzzFeed asserts that Yaqubi therefore has no personal or unique knowledge concerning the \"licensing, attribution, and use of the [P]hotograph.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) BuzzFeed additionally argues that any knowledge Yaqubi has of BuzzFeed's general training practices would not be relevant to the training Michael Hayes (\"Hayes\"), the author of the BuzzFeed article containing the Photograph, received from BuzzFeed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) Finally, BuzzFeed argues that any testimony Yaqubi would provide about Hayes's training would be cumulative of Hayes's own testimony. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mango opposes the Second Motion, arguing that Yaqubi has direct knowledge of whether BuzzFeed's counsel authorized the unlicensed publication of the Photograph as well as any remedial actions BuzzFeed took once it had notice of the infringement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. of Law at 16.) Mango additionally argues that it would be relevant to an inquiry of willfulness to hear testimony from an employee in BuzzFeed's legal department about the company's general standards and practices in obtaining licensing fees and the training it provides to employees about how to comply with United States copyright law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mango finally argues that if BuzzFeed does not believe that Yaqubi is competent to answer these institutional questions then BuzzFeed must identify another corporate representative who would be so competent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In reply, BuzzFeed argues that the company's general standards and practices are irrelevant to a willfulness inquiry since what is at issue in this case is BuzzFeed's conduct with respect to its publication of the Photograph, and not its policies generally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Reply at 8-9.) BuzzFeed additionally reiterates that any testimony Yaqubi could provide about the publication of the Photograph would be cumulative of Hayes's testimony on the same topic. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court is persuaded that Yaqubi's testimony would be relevant to a statutory damages calculation in this case. BuzzFeed states that Yaqubi was involved in the company's investigation after BuzzFeed published the Photograph. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Motion at 2.) Mango argues that Yaqubi is part of an email exchange demonstrating that she was also aware of BuzzFeed's legal department's conduct prior to the Photograph's publication. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. of Law at 16.) Yaqubi's knowledge of BuzzFeed's conduct both before and after it published the Photograph is relevant to the \"infringer's state of mind\" and the \"conduct and attitude of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Barcroft Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524050\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/339/#p356\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 358-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, courts consistently consider testimony about a company's pre- and post- infringement practices and training programs in assessing whether the unlicensed publication of a photograph was willful.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524050\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/339/#p356\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524050\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/339/#p356\">\n    at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the defendant's culpability was diminished for purposes of a statutory damages inquiry because several \"witnesses testified about practices the company has put into place recently to ensure that content on its websites is properly licensed\");\n   <em>\n    Psihoyos v.
