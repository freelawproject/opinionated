The defendant is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the government points out, the Bonner Affidavit and the DEA investigation report from September 28, 2011, show exactly how \"agents learned defendant's identity by analyzing public records, McDuffie's GPS tracking data, and telephone records.\" Gov't's Opp'n at 19. Indeed, this Court, in considering pre-trial suppression motions, cited the various forms of evidence that led to the identification of McDuffie's co-conspirators, including the defendant here, stating that the\n   \"statements and actions of McDuffie ... in combination with cellular telephone calling records, agents' visual surveillance, and GPS tracking of McDuffie's vehicle, point directly to Mr. Burnett and the use of his residence at 1707 D Street, S.E., for narcotics trafficking.\" Mem. and Order GPS Monitoring at 8-10.
