Nautilus Insurance Company seeks a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Owen's Caf\u00e9 because of a policy exclusion for bodily injury that arises from an assault, battery, or physical altercation. Both Owen's Caf\u00e9 and plaintiffs in the underlying case seek to characterize the complaint in that action so as to avoid the exclusion, primarily relying\n   on\n   <em>\n    QBE Insurance Corporation v. M &amp; S Landis Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8340478\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/915/1222/#p1224\">\n    915 A.2d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1224 (Pa. Super. 2007). But because the policy exclusion here is much broader than the exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   , I am compelled to grant Judgment on the Pleadings in favor of Nautilus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the death of Thomas C. Ewing, his parents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   brought a wrongful death and survival action in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against Defendants Owen's Caf\u00e9 and Shawn Szrankowski [hereinafter \"Owen's\"]. The underlying complaint, pleads that Mr. Ewing was stabbed to death by one Angelo Maldonado on August 7, 2015. (Pl.'s Ex. 3-22, ECF No. 1-2.) The chain of events began when Ewing and other patrons took a bottle from behind the bar, ostensibly without paying for it. In response, Owen's employees directed Maldonado, a regular customer of the bar, to confront the patrons who had taken the bottle. Shortly after leaving the bar, Ewing was confronted by Maldonado, and he stabbed Ewing multiple times. The complaint asserts that the incident \"resulted solely from the negligence\" of Owen's employees, in that they were aware of Maldonado's violent history and had served him alcohol despite his being both visibly intoxicated and a minor, rendering it entirely foreseeable that he would confront the other patrons in a manner that would result in severe injuries or death. The Ewings' complaint was skillfully crafted to make Owen's negligent conduct in bringing about their son's death the focus of the underlying action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Owen's presented the claim to Nautilus Insurance Company, which proceeded to defend Owen's against the underlying action under a reservation of rights. Nautilus now moves for Judgment on the Pleadings on the basis of the assault and battery exclusion mentioned above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although the claim clearly falls with the policy's definition of \"bodily injury,\" Nautilus argues that an exclusion for injuries arising out of an assault, battery, or physical altercation applies. The exclusion states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Regardless of culpability or intent of any person, this insurance does not apply to 'bodily injury', 'property damage', 'personal and advertising injury' or medical payments arising out of any (1) actual or alleged assault or battery; (2) physical altercation; or (3) [a]ny act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of such acts, including the alleged failure to provide adequate security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Assault and Battery Exclusion, Pl.'s Ex. 59, ECF No. 1-2. The exclusion applies regardless of whether such damages are caused by any \"insured, employee, patron, or any other person,\" and so long as the damages occurred at any \"premises owned or occupied by any insured.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306908\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/72/641/#p645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It specifically excludes from coverage both the obligation to indemnify and the obligation to defend.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306908\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/72/641/#p645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fairly read, the underlying complaint falls within the language of this exclusion. Notwithstanding skillful pleading by Ewing's counsel as to the role played by Owen's in causing this tragedy, by any objective measure the injuries leading to Ewing's death at least in part arose out of an assault, battery, or physical altercation. It strains credulity to assert otherwise, when the complaint expressly states that \"Ewing was confronted by a visibly intoxicated Angelo Maldonado who stabbed him multiple times resulting in his death.\" (Ewing Compl. \u00b6 26, Pl.'s Ex. 8, ECF No. 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants assert that the policy is ambiguous because of Nautilus's failure to include a definition of 'assault,' 'battery,' 'physical altercation,' or 'arise out of' in the policy. But those terms have both common meaning and legal definition. When challenged at oral argument to identify what further clarification would be necessary for a policyholder to comprehend the scope and applicability of the exclusion, defense counsel could only reply that \"assault\" and \"battery\" are legal terms of art. Yet to the extent that they are, such terms are defined by Pennsylvania law. Recently, my colleague Judge Savage applied Pennsylvania definitions of \"Trafficking,\" \"Rape,\" and \"Simple Assault\" in determining the applicability of this same exclusion to claims that a motel's employee allowed unlawful conduct to take place on its premises.\n   <em>\n    Nautilus Ins.

Pa. 2015) (same). Moreover, to the extent that assault and battery are legal terms of art, the phrase \"physical altercation\" incorporates common language, any reasonable interpretation of which would include a stabbing. Indeed, inclusion of the phrase \"physical\n   altercation\" likely represents a deliberate decision by the carrier to use language that goes beyond terms that also carry a legal definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Owen's seeks to avoid the exclusion by arguing that the underlying complaint pleads the negligence of its employees as the moving force in causing Ewing's death, and that the structure of the complaint, combined with the lack of a specific definition of \"arising out of\" creates sufficient ambiguity to render the exclusion inapplicable.

There, in an effort by a nightclub's employees to forcibly evict a patron from the premises, its employees restricted the patron's ability to breathe by laying on top of him, ultimately smothering him to death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8340478\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/915/1222/#p1224\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8340478\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/915/1222/#p1224\">\n    at 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The provision on which the carrier relied described various types of conduct that might qualify as negligent acts, but did not explicitly exclude actions for negligence from coverage. The Superior Court noted that there was a \"litany of allegations\" of negligence on the nightclub's part, leading directly to the patron's death. It reasoned that those detailed allegations created an ambiguity as to the existence of coverage given the wording of the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants contend that the underlying complaint here is analogous to the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   . I agree, but that does not end the inquiry because the language in Nautilus' exclusion is materially different from the language of the exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Landis.\n   </em>\n   A later case involving the same carrier as in\n   <em>\n    Landis,\n   </em>\n   QBE Insurance, is instructive. The case arose several years after\n   <em>\n    Landis,\n   </em>\n   and QBE had in the meantime changed the wording of its exclusion, likely because of the deficiencies exposed by the Superior Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Landis.\n   </em>\n   The underlying dispute was a negligence action brought in part by a patron of a bar who was shot by another patron with whom he had a verbal confrontation earlier that night.\n   <em>\n    QBE Insurance Corporation v.

Here, the allegation that Owen's employees were negligent in failing to secure the bottle that started this unfortunate series of events, and in charging Maldonado with the task of retrieving it, can only be read as alleging conduct that is related to an \"assault, battery, or physical altercation\" that caused Ewing's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   That conclusion is bolstered by the fact that members of this court and panels of the Pennsylvania Superior Court have consistently limited\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   to its facts when considering policy exclusions with more expansive language.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Liberty Surplus Ins.

Defendants argue that because their employees' actions in instructing Maldonado to retrieve the bottle rendered Maldonado a volunteer employee, effectively deputizing him to carry\n   out Owen's right to use \"reasonable force\" in retrieving its property, no exclusion applies and Nautilus must defend them accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I cannot agree. As graphically demonstrated by the policy excerpt above, the phrase \"This exclusion,\" makes clear that the limitation following applies only to that specific exclusion. To hold otherwise would mean construing every exception to a particular exclusion as generally applicable throughout the policy. This would be an unreasonable interpretation of the language itself, and given the sheer volume of exceptions that arise in this section of the policy alone,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40 (containing a similarly-worded exception for every exclusion, running alphabetically from \"a\" through \"p\"), would render the policy incomprehensible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In conclusion, when the broad language of the exclusion is applied to allegations in the underlying complaint, it is clear coverage does not exist. Nautilus' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings must therefore be granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Mr. Ewing's parents are also named Defendants in this action, alongside Owen's Caf\u00e9 and its employee, Shawn Szrankowski.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
