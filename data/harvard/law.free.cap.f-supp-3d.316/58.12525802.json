It thus precludes later theories or pleas for relief arising out of the same claim only if they could have been asserted in the earlier case.

P. 9014 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   10 Collier on Bankruptcy P. \u00b6 9014.01 (listing types of contested matters). \"Contested matters\" are designed to adjudicate simple issues on an expedited basis and are therefore not governed by the full panoply of rules that pertain to federal civil actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10 Collier on Bankruptcy P. \u00a7 9014.06;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr.

Rather, they only involve motions practice and \"reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In comparison, \"adversary proceedings\" are governed by Part VII of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which incorporates the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Rule 7001 lists the types of actions that require an adversary proceeding, and Rule 7001(1) states that an action \"to recover money or property\" must be made in an adversary proceeding. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7001(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, defendants filed a proof of claim against Davenport, and Davenport initiated a contested matter by filing an objection to the proof of claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 120-21; Pls.' Mot. at 2. Plaintiffs argue that because Davenport initiated a contested action, Bankruptcy Rule 3007(b) prohibited him from seeking the kind of monetary\n   damages that can be obtained in an adversary proceeding. Pl.'s Mot. at 7, citing Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3007(b). Thus, they argue that they could not have brought their claims seeking monetary damages in the bankruptcy proceeding, and that plaintiffs' claims in the civil action are not \"the same claim\" for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   purposes. Pls.' Mot. at 7; Pls.' Reply at 2. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bankruptcy Rule 3007, which governs objections to claims like the one at issue here, was amended in 2007. Subsection (a) previously provided in its final sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   If an objection to a claim is joined with a demand for relief of the kind specified in Rule 7001, it becomes an adversary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   9 Collier on Bankruptcy P. \u00b6 3007.02 (16th ed. 2018). With the 2007 amendment, that sentence was replaced by subsection (b):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A party in interest shall not include a demand for relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001 in an objection to the allowance of a claim, but may include the objection in an adversary proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3007(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Advisory Committee Notes concerning the amendment to Rule 3007 reiterate the difference in the relief available in the two types of proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   First, the amendment\n   <em>\n    prohibits\n   </em>\n   a party in interest from including in a claim objection a request for relief that requires an adversary proceeding. A party in interest may, however, include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding. Unlike a contested matter, an adversary proceeding requires the service of a summons and complaint, which puts the defendant on notice of the potential for an affirmative recovery. Permitting the plaintiff in the adversary proceeding to include an objection to a claim would not unfairly surprise the defendant as might be the case if the action were brought as a contested matter that included an action to obtain relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The rule as amended does not require that a party include an objection to the allowance of a claim in an adversary proceeding. If a claim objection is filed separately from a related adversary proceeding, the court may consolidate the objection with the adversary proceeding under Rule 7042.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3007, Advisory Comm. Notes 2007 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, Rule 3007(b) and the Advisory Committee Notes make it clear that a contested matter initiated by the filing of an objection to a proof of claim and an adversary proceeding are distinct bankruptcy proceedings, and that certain demands for relief cannot be brought in a contested matter. Because Rule 7001(1) covers disputes \"to recover money or property,\" Rule 3007(b) precludes a debtor from making those claims in a contested matter. Therefore, Davenport could not have brought his claims for damages when he contested defendants' proof of claim in the bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Case law interpreting the interaction between the amended version of Bankruptcy Rule 3007(b) and Rule 7001 reinforces the Court's conclusion. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Donson\n   </em>\n   , a debtor filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and her largest creditor filed a proof of claim to which the debtor objected.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768002\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/434/471/#p473\">\n    434 B.R. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-74 (Bankr.

The court observed that a dispute regarding the dischargeability of a debt must be resolved in an adversary proceeding under Rule 7001(6), and that because Bankruptcy Rule 3007 was \"substantially amended\" in 2007, the rule now \"precludes a debtor from objecting to a claim's dischargeability in the main bankruptcy case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768002\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/434/471/#p473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 474-75 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed.

First, they all hinge on the fact that the plaintiffs never asserted an objection within the contested matter when they had the opportunity to do so. Here, Davenport did object to the proof of claim, and he litigated the narrow issue before the bankruptcy court to completion. Second, many of the cases cited above barred subsequent malpractice claims partially because, in awarding fees to attorneys in the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy judge had implicitly found that the attorney's services were acceptable so any litigation of attorneys work should have been brought in the bankruptcy case. Here, the bankruptcy court only was asked to determine the amount of money due on the note; no evaluation of the legitimacy of the foreclosure or of defendants' actions took place. And finally, almost all of the decisions applied Bankruptcy Rule 3007(b) before it was amended to make it clear that certain demands for affirmative relief cannot be brought within a contested matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The court's order stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n    1.

Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014, which governs contested matters, specifically provides that Federal Rules of Bankruptcy procedure 7008 and 7013 do not apply to contested matters. Rule 7008 makes applicable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c)(1) to adversary proceedings, which requires a party to bring affirmative defenses. And Rule 7013 makes applicable Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) regarding compulsory counterclaims.
