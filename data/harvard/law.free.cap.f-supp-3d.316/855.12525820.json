Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue in this civil rights case is whether the Court should grant a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants, Lower Merion School District (\"LMSD\"), Ryan Sankey (\"Sankey\"), and Frederick Agostini (\"Agostini\"), pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Plaintiff Matthew Lichtenstein (\"Lichtenstein\"), a special needs student who attended Lower Merion High School (\"LMHS\"), alleges that his substantive due process rights were violated as a result of injuries he suffered after a chair used to transport him from the LMHS pool collapsed and he was carried into the locker room (the \"incident\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For reasons discussed below, the Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case began on October 13, 2016, with Plaintiff Matthew Lichtenstein filing a Complaint against Defendants Agostini, LMSD, Sankey, and Pat Guinnane (\"Guinnane\"). (ECF, \"Compl.\"). The Complaint alleges three counts, all brought pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Count I seeks damages against LMSD for violating the Fourteenth Amendment, based on the \"special relationship\" exception. Count II seeks damages against all Defendants for violating the Fourteenth Amendment, based on the \"state-created danger\" exception. Count III asserts a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against LMSD, for failure to properly train or supervise Defendants Agostini and Sankey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (ECF 8, \"MTD\"), which this Court granted in part on February 8, 2017 (ECF 11), in order to dismiss, without prejudice, all claims against Guinnane. Plaintiff thereafter proceeded only on his claims against Agostini, Sankey, and LMSD (hereinafter, \"Defendants\"). Defendants answered the complaint on March 15, 2017 (ECF 15), and filed their Motion for Summary Judgment on February 28, 2018. (ECF 29, \"MSJ\"). Defendants also submitted, consistent with this Court's Rules, a \"statement of undisputed facts,\" with twenty-nine attachments as exhibits. (ECF 30, \"Def. SOUF\"). Plaintiff filed a Response to the Motion on March 14, 2018 (ECF 33, \"Response\"), together with a \"response to statement of undisputed facts,\" (ECF 33-3, \"Pl. Resp. to Def. SOUF\") and his own \"statement of undisputed facts (\"Pl. SOUF\"). Defendants then filed a Reply brief in support of the Motion on March 20, 2018 (ECF 36, \"Reply\"), with three additional exhibits as attachments (ECF 36-1-36-3), as well as a \"response to Plaintiff's statement of undisputed facts.\" (ECF 37, \"Def. Resp. to Pl. SOUF\"). The Motion for Summary Judgment has been fully and ably briefed for this Court's consideration, and this Court heard oral argument from the parties on June 7, 2018 (ECF 41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff Lichtenstein\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff has cerebral palsy, has been handicapped since birth, and has required the use of a wheelchair since childhood. (Def. SOUF \u00b6 3). He also has vision limitations and speech deficits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He attended school in the LMSD from kindergarten until the time of the incident on October 16, 2014, although he was frequently absent from school, including the entire 2010-2011 school year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Due to his multiple disabilities, while a student at Lower Merion, Plaintiff was eligible for special education services pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"IDEA\"), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 504\"). (Compl. \u00b6 15). Plaintiff's special education was provided pursuant to an Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). During the 2014-2015 schoolyear, Plaintiff's governing IEP provided that he take swimming lessons, and that, while swimming, he would be assisted by two \"2:1 assistants.\" (Def. SOUF \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sankey and Agostini were the two 1:1 assistants who provided assistance during swimming class for Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From December 17, 2013 to January 31, 2014, Plaintiff did not participate in swimming\n   class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27). During the first scheduled session, the heater was shut down and Plaintiff decided not to swim when given the option. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For all other scheduled swim classes, Plaintiff was either absent or not prepared with his swim suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In fact, on various occasions after January 31, 2014, Plaintiff chose not to swim or was absent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). Plaintiff determined how long he swam in the pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100). There was no order providing that Plaintiff had to swim on October 16, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108). On any day that Plaintiff did not want to swim, Sankey honored Plaintiff's decision not to swim, such that the choice to swim was solely Plaintiff's to make. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was not forced to attend swimming class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff's strengths included advocating for his physical needs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31). Plaintiff was permitted breaks throughout the school day as needed, and when requested by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34). His IEP encouraged Plaintiff to be a self-advocate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). Plaintiff was never forced to take any action at high school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 231). Instead, he directed his own care and was an advocate for the positions he took. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While in school, the nurse administered medication to Plaintiff, twice daily, pursuant to the protocol issued by Plaintiff's physician. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). LMSD made no medical decisions regarding Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff was twenty (20) years old at the time of the incident, which is over the compulsory school age required by Pennsylvania statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1326 and 13-1327.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Day of the Incident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the day of the incident giving rise to this litigation, October 16, 2014, Sankey and Agostini took Plaintiff to the LMHS pool area for swimming class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). They placed Plaintiff in a chair to transport Plaintiff from the locker room into the pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Plaintiff's swimming lesson, Sankey and Agostini placed Plaintiff back into the chair to transport Plaintiff from the pool to the locker room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). While Plaintiff was seated in the chair, the chair broke and either Sankey or Agostini \"grabbed\" Plaintiff to prevent him from falling onto the pool deck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). Sankey then carried Plaintiff to the locker room, with Plaintiff under his arms in an upright position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 106, ECF 30-3 (\"incident video\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once in the locker room, Sankey called and informed his supervisor, Bonnie Fox, of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fox recommended that Sankey and Agostini take Plaintiff to the nurse for a professional evaluation, which they did. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Right after the incident, Jeremy O'Boyle, a Healthy and Physical Education Teacher at LMHS, asked Plaintiff if he was okay and Plaintiff stated that he was fine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). On the afternoon of the incident, Christina Costello, a licensed Physical Therapist who works for the LMSD as an independent contractor, encountered Plaintiff and Sankey in the hallway, who informed her about the incident. Costello asked Plaintiff whether he was hurt, and Plaintiff replied, \"No.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the end of the school day,\n   Plaintiff's mother was notified of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). Plaintiff returned home at the end of the school day on the school bus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Plaintiff had experienced back pain prior to the incident, he began experiencing pain in his neck on the night of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-154). That night, he could not sleep and his arms were numb. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154). He would later experience various serious injuries (Pl. SOUF, Ex. 1-3), which Plaintiff claims arose out of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Chair\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff was only the third student to use the chair, which was purchased by LMSD around 2000. (Def. SOUF, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 59, 240). The chair was intended for use in a shower room to maneuver residents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248). The chair was not intended for use in a pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In September, 2013, Plaintiff was placed into the chair to ensure that it properly supported him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51). Physical Therapist Christina Costello did not detect any issue with the chair at that time, instead determining that the chair was stable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The chair was used to transport Plaintiff for all swim classes at Lower Merion High School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff's aids, Sankey and Agostini, performed a visual inspection of the chair each time it would be used, prior to placing Plaintiff in the chair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Approximately one or two weeks after the incident, the broken chair was observed with tape on its joints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). In fact, on the day of the accident, all chair joints were taped, although no witness testified that they knew who placed the tape on the chair joints or why. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95, 227). The tape had been present on the chair for at least several weeks before the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97). However, before the incident, no one reported that the chair was dangerous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A district court should grant a motion for summary judgment if the movant can show \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In fact, the Court specifically left open this possibility, stating that \"Plaintiff is a prisoner to his own body, not one of the State,\" and that \"this nuance may be relevant at some later stage.\" (MTD, at 9). We have now reached that \"later stage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff was beyond the compulsory school age at the time of the incident, and thus cannot be likened to the prisoners in\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   or the institutionalized persons in\n   <em>\n    Youngberg\n   </em>\n   . He attended school by choice, receiving medical and other care pursuant to an IEP which allowed him the independence to make choices about whether to engage in certain activities such as swimming. Indeed, to the extent that Plaintiff was a \"prisoner\" at all, it was not to the school but rather to his own physical limitations. While it is true that during the school day, Plaintiff relied on aides for many of his needs, he remained an adult free from any state imposed restriction. He could simply decide that he would not go to the state institution (school) on any given day (or ever again), unlike prisoners, foster children, or institutionalized persons, all of whom could not freely choose whether to interact with state actors. Much like the situation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Middle Bucks\n   </em>\n   , \"parents or others remain [Plaintiff's] primary caretakers and decisionmakers.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1871019\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/972/1364/#p1369\">\n    972 F.2d at 1372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Therefore, given the undisputed material evidence in this case, as a matter of law, Plaintiff cannot be said to be in a \"special relationship\" with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

However, the decision to carry Plaintiff without using a two-man transfer after the chair broke was one made by state actors in a hyperpressurized situation, or, at the very least, one in which there was no luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With respect to the latter decision, made without the benefit of deliberation, Plaintiff has presented no evidence from which a jury could infer that any Defendant consciously disregarded a great risk of harm. The presence of tape on the chair falls far short of what is legally required to show such conscious disregard. Therefore, there was undoubtedly no violation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights arising out of the failure of Defendants to use a two-man transfer after the chair broke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As for the decision to use the chair to transfer Plaintiff into and out of the pool, the Court employs the \"deliberate indifference\" standard, such that the necessarily level of culpability \"might exist without actual knowledge of a risk of harm when the risk is so obvious that it should be known.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3353070\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/298/#p303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3353070\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/298/#p303\">\n    at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only evidence favoring Plaintiff on this point is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (1) Testimony from the chair manufacturer's corporate designee stating that the chair in question was not designed or manufactured to be a transport or pool chair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (2) The presence of tape on the chair prior to the incident; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (3) The fact that as a result of Plaintiff's cerebral palsy, Defendants knew he was especially susceptible to injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   These pieces of evidence are insufficient to rise to the level of \"deliberate indifference.\" Plaintiff has presented no evidence that Defendants were not on actual notice that the chair was manufactured for a purpose other than for transporting Plaintiff to and from the pool. As stated above, the mere presence of tape is similarly insufficient (even in tandem with knowledge of Plaintiff's physical disability), as the chair had been used for years prior to the incident without any issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As a matter of law, Defendants' actions cannot be said to have \"shocked the conscience\" under any of the above tests. If this were a negligence case, summary judgment might be inappropriate. However, this is a case about constitutional harm, and the narrow \"state-created danger\" exception requires a substantially more searching, \"conscience-shocking\" analysis. Plaintiff falls far short of meeting that standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Third Element-Plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant's acts, or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state's actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendants do not make any arguments that Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden as to the third element. Therefore, Defendants have conceded, as they did at the Rule 12 stage, that the third element is fulfilled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In the present case, it is clear that the individual defendants were not on notice of a clearly established constitutional right. Neither the special relationship theory nor the state-created danger theory has prevailed in a sufficiently similar context so as to provide notice of the alleged constitutional harm at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The closest Third Circuit case in the special relationship context, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is\n   <em>\n    Middle Bucks\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court declined to extend the special relationship exception to the public school context in general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrow v.

This, of course, reinforces that Sankey and Agostini were not on notice of the possibility that they could be subject to a special relationship claim. Moreover, nothing indicates that the individual defendants \"should have known\" that a special relationship theory could extend to their interactions with Plaintiff, because Plaintiff could generally choose which activities from his IEP, including swim classes, he would perform each school day (or whether he would attend school at all).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As for the state-created danger theory, Defendants also cannot be said to have been \"on notice\" that they could be subject\n   to such a claim.
