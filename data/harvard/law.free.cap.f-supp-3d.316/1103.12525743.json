Presently before the Court is a motion to dismiss all of the claims in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). Dkt. No. 74. The Court finds this matter suitable for decision without oral argument and VACATES the hearing set for June 14, 2018. Civ. L.R. 7-1(b). For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Paragon Systems Inc. (\"Paragon\") is a private corporation which contracts with the federal government, the State of California, and local government to provide security for state and federal offices, including at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building at 280 South 1st Street in San Jose, California. SAC, Dkt. No. 72, at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Joseph Vegas, Jose Leuterio, Mario Ayala, Kenneth Inman, and DOES 1-20 are Paragon employees (collectively, \"Employee Defendants\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, on April 12, 2012 at approximately 11:30 a.m., he concluded his business at the Social Security Administration offices at the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building and proceeded to exit the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Believing he was following directions, Plaintiff attempted to leave through the emergency exit instead of through the customary exit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was then stopped by Ayala, who asked Plaintiff to accompany him inside so that an incident report could be prepared.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff complied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Back inside the building, Plaintiff was handed off to Leuterio, who took Plaintiff's driver's license and directed him to sit down.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. After waiting for about 30 minutes, Plaintiff got up and asked Ayala \"what is the delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Ayala replied that Leuterio was gathering information from Plaintiff's driver license and instructed Plaintiff to sit back down until Leuterio was finished.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff asked to speak to Leuterio's supervisor, and, when Ayala identified himself as the supervisor, Plaintiff asked to speak to Ayala's supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ayala told Plaintiff that his supervisor was in San Francisco, but provided Plaintiff with his supervisor's telephone number and welcomed Plaintiff to call him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, as he was typing the supervisor's number into his phone, Vegas-who was in the vicinity but previously uninvolved-grabbed Plaintiff's phone out of his hand and yelled \"you can't use your phone in here!!!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Vegas then yelled \"do you want me to arrest you?!?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, Plaintiff claims that without further warning, Vegas twisted Plaintiff's arm behind his back, Vegas and Leuterio slammed Plaintiff's face into a wall, and Vegas, Leuterio, and Inman tackled Plaintiff to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After another 15-20 minutes, Vegas and Leuterio had Plaintiff stand up and placed him in handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Plaintiff requested someone call the San Jose Police Department (\"SJPD\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ten minutes later, two officers responded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he overheard one of the police officers asking Ayala if it was a crime to accidentally walk out of the emergency exit, and Ayala said no.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. One of the officers then walked over to Plaintiff and asked \"have you ever been arrested?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff said no.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Then, with Plaintiff still in handcuffs, one of the police officers walked Plaintiff to his patrol vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Once at the vehicle, the officer removed the handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officer then told Plaintiff, \"what I'm about to tell you is really important; we ( [the two officers] ) have nothing to do with this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff was then handed a citation for misdemeanor battery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No formal charges were ever filed against Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

District and appellate courts addressing this issue have reached mixed results. The Sixth Circuit summarized the general trend as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The line divides cases in which a private actor exercises a power traditionally reserved to the state, but not exclusively reserved to it, e.g., the common law shopkeeper's privilege, from cases in which a private actor exercises a power exclusively reserved to the state, e.g., the police power. Where private security guards are endowed by law with plenary police powers such that they are de facto police officers, they may qualify as state actors under the public function test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Romanski v.

For example, a security guard that could patrol and eject unruly persons from a hospital, but who could not carry a weapon and had to call the police when individuals became belligerent was not a state actor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

However, a casino security guard authorized by Michigan statute to make arrests without a warrant was a state actor.\n   <em>\n    Romanski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280433\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/629/#p637\">\n    428 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, the Ninth Circuit has held that an individual making a citizen's arrest is not a state actor under the joint action test.\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Womancare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540614\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/1145/#p1154\">\n    878 F.2d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1154-56 (9th Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has not adequately alleged that the Employee Defendants were performing a \"public function\" under \u00a7 1983. The SAC does not allege that Employee Defendants were endowed with the type of plenary police power that is \"traditionally and exclusively governmental.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirtley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318730\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1088/#p1093\">\n    326 F.3d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, it makes almost no allegations regarding the scope of their power at all. At most, the allegations suggest that the security guards had some power to detain a person on the premises, temporarily confiscate personal property (e.g., Plaintiff's driver license), and place a person in handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. However, this small collection of abilities, by itself, is not exclusively governmental and, as such, is insufficient under the public function test. Plaintiff's second theory of state action fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, because Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege state action under either of the theories he asserts, his claims against the Employee Defendants under \u00a7 1983 will be DISMISSED. However, because further amendment may cure these deficiencies, these claims are dismissed WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The only question that remains, then, is whether Paragon itself can be held liable under \u00a7 1983. Plaintiff does not claim that Paragon committed constitutional violations of its own, but nevertheless argues that Paragon can be held liable because it supervises and manages the Employee Defendants. Opp. 7-8; SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-39. As such, Plaintiff's theory of liability fails at the outset: because, as discussed above, Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege that the Employee Defendants are liable under \u00a7 1983, he cannot plausibly allege that Paragon is liable under \u00a7 1983. Further, even if Plaintiff's allegations against the Employee Defendants had been sufficient, his theory of liability against Paragon is problematic for at least two other reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, \"[t]here is no\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability under section 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Accordingly, Paragon cannot be held liable for the constitutional violations of the Employee Defendants simply because it employs them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, in\n   <em>\n    Tsao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627395\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/1128/#p1140\">\n    698 F.3d at 1138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 691,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978) applies to private entities that act on behalf of municipalities. Under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1983 claims may be brought against municipalities only if a plaintiff demonstrates injury resulting from \"execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy.\" 436 U.S. at 694,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/#p691\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, at least in the case of municipality actions by private entities, a plaintiff must identify some policy or custom that allegedly caused his injuries to impose liability under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tsao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627395\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/1128/#p1140\">\n    698 F.3d at 1138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit has \"assumed\" but not explicitly decided that\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   also applies to private entities acting on behalf of a state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oyenik v.

Thus, even if Plaintiff had adequately alleged state action under a theory of joint action with the SJPD, his claims against Paragon would fail for this reason. Similarly, even if Plaintiff had adequately alleged state action under a police power public function theory, his claims against Paragon would at least be disfavored in light of\n   <em>\n    Tsao\n   </em>\n   . Thus, Plaintiff's claims against Paragon falter for this reason as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, in light of the above considerations, Plaintiff's claims against Paragon will be DISMISSED.
