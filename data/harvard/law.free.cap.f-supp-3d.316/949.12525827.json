Concluding that the use or attempted use of physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon is not a necessary element of a \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) offense, the court grants defendant's motion and dismisses the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Christopher Maurice Daniels (\"Daniels\") is charged in a one-count indictment with the offense of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9) and 924(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the indictment, Daniels committed this offense when he possessed two firearms after having been convicted of \"domestic assault\" under Tennessee law, which the indictment alleges is \"a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Daniels moves to dismiss the indictment, contending that, as a matter of law, his Tennessee conviction does not qualify as \"a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" and therefore that he cannot be guilty of violating \u00a7 922(g)(9).

Daniels posits that \u00a7 39-13-109(a)(2)-which makes it a crime in Tennessee to \"[i]ntentionally or knowingly cause[ ] another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury\"-does not necessarily require the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon; that the government cannot narrow the Tennessee domestic assault statute to a qualifying subsection because the statute is not divisible into distinct offenses; and that, even if the statute is divisible, the government cannot narrow Daniels' conviction on the record presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government responds that Tennessee's domestic assault statute is divisible, and that state court documents demonstrate that Daniels was convicted under \u00a7 39-13-109(a)(1)-a prong of the statute\n   that\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the written \"Waiver and Plea,\" Daniels admitted that he was advised and understood \"[t]he fact that there must be facts to support the plea\"; that \"the facts which he knows to exist equal the elements of the charge(s)\"; and \"that there is a factual basis for his plea.\" ECF No. 27-1 at 1.

At no point, however, does the document state the factual basis for the plea, the facts to which Daniels stipulated, or which prong of the assault statute constituted \"domestic assault.\" Daniels' admission that \"the facts ... equal the elements of the charge(s)\" is of no aid when multiple sets of elements could constitute the underlying \"domestic assault\" offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government contends that the \"Affidavit of Complaint\"-a sworn statement from the arresting officer that accompanied the arrest warrant-can provide the factual basis for the plea.

But it did not hold that the charging affidavit was a proper\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   document outright. Instead, the panel concluded that, during the plea colloquy, the defendant specifically stipulated to facts \"based on 'documents in the court file, including the complaint affidavit.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5541659\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/873/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5541659\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/873/\">\n    at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the defendant had admitted to specific facts that supported the necessary elements of the federal generic offense.

As\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   state, \"force\" was an element of common law battery satisfied by offensive touching.\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1410 ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Common law assault, however, incorporated this term of art differently. At common law, assault was \"an attempt or offer to apply force of any kind to another person[.]\" R.E. Ross, Russell on Crime 573 (9th ed. 1936);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (1768) (\"By assault; which is an attempt or offer to beat another, without touching him[.]\"); Stephen, A Digest of the Criminal Law 177 (3d ed. 1883) (defining assault as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"an attempt to apply any the least actual force to the person of another directly or indirectly\" and \"the act of using a gesture towards another giving him reasonably grounds to believe that the person using that gesture meant to apply such actual force to his person\"); 1 Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown 110 (8th ed. 1824) (\"Hawk. P.C.\") (\"[A]n assault is an attempt, or offer, with force and violence, to do a corporal hurt to another[.]\"). Thus the two methods of committing an assault each involved an inchoate application of force that, if completed, would have constituted a battery or application of force: either by an attempt, or an offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A statutory derivation of the latter form of common law assault is at issue here. An offer to apply force required more than words alone, as \"no words whatsoever c[ould] amount to assault\" at common law. Hawk. P.C. 110. Instead, any words needed to be accompanied by a physical act or gesture.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Blackstone, Commentaries 120 (\"as if one lifts up his cane, or his fist, in a threatening manner at another[.]\"); Hawk. P.C. 110 (\"or by holding up one's fist at him; or by any other such-like act done in an angry threatening manner[.]\"). These acts, however, do not appear to be physical \"force\" in and of themselves. \"Force\" required a completed battery-at a minimum, offensive contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Many states, including Tennessee, have now codified this form of assault among their assault and battery statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moving away from the common law's language, these statutes typically prohibit \"intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] another to reasonably fear imminent bodily injury\" or harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-13-101\">\n    Tenn.

For this reason, the offense is often referred to as \"intentional frightening\" assault. As at common law, however, words alone are not enough to cause another to reasonably fear bodily harm.

App. July 22, 1998), the court affirmed a conviction for simple assault under \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2), holding that intentionally raising a fist at another in a threatening manner satisfied the elements of \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2). As the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [the victim] encountered the defendant while [the victim] was walking with another attorney, Jerry Smith. Smith greeted the defendant, but [the victim] remained silent. After [the victim] had passed, the defendant approached [him] from behind and stated, \"I'm going to get you, you curly-headed m______f______.\" [The victim] turned, noted the defendant had a fist clenched and his teeth gritted, and asked if the defendant was threatening him. [The victim] testified at this point he was in fear of imminent bodily harm from the defendant.

Other Tennessee cases also indicate that physical contact is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the foregoing analysis demonstrates, common law \"force\" did not describe acts that involved neither direct nor indirect offensive contact between the defendant, his instrument, and a victim. In the assault context, \"force\" did not encompass the mere physical movements that made an \"attempt or offer\" of force. As applied to \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2),\n   <em>\n    McCaleb\n   </em>\n   makes clear that any threatening physical movement is sufficient to \"cause[ ] another to reasonably fear bodily injury,\" even if no physical contact is made or attempted. Therefore, a \"use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\" is not a necessary element of \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This definition of \"use or attempted use of physical force\" makes sense given the text of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The statute specifies that a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" must have one of three possible required elements: (1) a use of physical force; (2) an attempted use of physical force; or (3) the threatened use of a deadly weapon. Because a \"use of physical force\" requires employing offensive contact, it covers all state statutes that codify common law battery. \"Attempted use of force\" addresses all attempts at such contact, thereby covering all statutes codifying attempted battery assault. A specific type of threat-threatened use of a deadly weapon-is also covered. On the other hand, if \"use of physical force\" encompassed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   physical act, \"attempted use of physical force\" would be superfluous; any attempted battery would have already been covered as a \"use of force,\" since any attempted battery requires physical movement. \"The Government's reading is thus at odds with one of the most basic interpretive canons, that '[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

Not covering all \"intent to frighten\" assault statutes appears to be a deliberate choice when compared to the language of nearby statutory text.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For\n   example,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(8) prohibits,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , firearm possession by an individual subject to a court order that restrains the person from \"engaging in ... conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury,\" or that prohibits \"the use, attempted use, or threaten use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(8)(B) &amp; (C)(ii).

First, it contends that\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   's broad interpretation of \"use\" calls for a broader interpretation of \"use of physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   's holding, however, does not extend this far. The Court did make clear that \"use\" is not a term of art under the common law, and is to be interpreted according to its plain meaning: the act of employing something.\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court concluded that this understanding of \"use\" covered reckless uses of force, even though common law battery only criminalized intentional or knowing uses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598062\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2272/\">\n    at 2280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But while\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   broadened the mens rea encompassed by \"use,\" it did not alter\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   's requirement of contact in the actus reus of \"physical force.\" Indeed, in both of\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   's examples of the \"use of physical force,\" there is physical contact between the defendant's instrument and the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the government cites no case-and this court has found none-otherwise holding that a statute criminalizing intentionally causing another to reasonably fear imminent bodily harm requires the use of \"physical force,\" as that term is used in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court declines to do so as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The text of the statute and the Supreme Court's definitions aside, the government also contends that requiring \"physical contact\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   undermines Congress' intent \"to bar those domestic abusers convicted of garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors ... from owning guns.\"\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2280.

Here, the statutory text and application of Supreme Court precedent make clear that a \"use of physical force\" requires some sort of physical contact, and that \"attempted use of physical force\" requires an attempt to make such physical contact.

The government highlights seven states whose statutes it contends will be rendered ineffective if the court sides with Daniels' position. Of these seven, however, three of the statutes are plainly divisible; they give the \"intentional frightening\" version of assault a different punishment than other forms of assault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

In this way, the court's holding does not make \u00a7 922(g)(9) the \"dead letter\" that the Court sought to avoid in\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Hayes.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court is unpersuaded that it should alter its application of the relevant statutory text and Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The government contends that holding that \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) does not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence leads to absurd results. It notes that \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(3) qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence-it criminalizes \"offensive touching\"-and is classified as a\n   class B misdemeanor. Tennessee at the same time, however, classifies \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) as a class A misdemeanor-a more serious crime. The government maintains that it would be illogical and absurd for a version with a lower maximum sentence to be covered by \u00a7 922(g)(9), while another version with a higher sentence is not. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, regardless of the punishments they carry, \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(1) and (a)(3) both require some form of physical contact. As the court has explained, \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) does not. An offense under \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) can be committed without physical contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Second, Congress, in passing \u00a7 922(g)(9), and the Tennessee legislature, in establishing punishments for varying forms of assault, were attempting to answer different questions with different goals. In establishing punishments, a legislature may have varying objectives, such as retribution for the offense at issue, deterrence of future offenses, reformation of the offender, among others. On the other hand, Congress, in determining which domestic violence offenders should no longer be permitted to possess firearms, had only one objective: incapacitating an offender's future violent capabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706988,12579095\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1405/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1408-09 ;\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 2275 ;\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p429\">\n    555 U.S. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p429\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Congress' definition does not perfectly mirror the escalating severity of Tennessee's assault sentences is likely attributable to different objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, it would be impossible for Congress to perfectly reflect all states' judgments on the seriousness of the varying forms of assault because these judgments differ. Tennessee chooses to punish \"intentional frightening\" assault less than \"offensive touching.\" But in Texas, the two offenses receive the same punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022.01\">\n    Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). And a number of states choose not to criminalize \"intentional frightening\" assault at all, instead criminalizing only attempted battery.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    Cal.

Code Ann. \u00a7 2903.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). Thus the apparent mismatch between one state's sentencing arrangements and the federal consequences for a particular offense does not suggest that the court should part from its application of statutory text and precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The court therefore holds that a \"use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\" is not a necessary element of \u00a7 39-13-101(a)(2) ; that, as a result, Daniels' conviction for \"domestic assault\" under \u00a7 39-13-111(b) did not necessarily include a \"use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\" as an element; and that Daniels' conviction does not therefore qualify as \"a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" under \u00a7 922(g)(9). The court grants Daniels' motion and dismisses the indictment for failure to charge a \u00a7 922(g)(9) offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   So far as the court is aware, Daniels is being detained on the instant charge alone. Unless the government can establish otherwise, he is entitled to be released from pretrial detention based on the dismissal of the indictment. In order to provide the government sufficient time to show that there is another lawful reason to detain Daniels, or to seek a stay of this decision in the court of appeals, the court stays Daniels' release for 48 hours, through May 3, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. The stay shall lapse automatically, and Daniels shall be released, unless the court of appeals or this court orders otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the reasons explained, the court concludes as a matter of law that the\n   indictment does not contain the elements of a \u00a7 922(g)(9) violation, grants Daniels' motion to dismiss, and dismisses the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) provides the penalty for violating\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(9).
