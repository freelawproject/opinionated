Because the other evidence plaintiffs provided is sufficient for them to meet their burden, the Court need not evaluate the weight of this additional evidence. The Court notes, however, that market surveys have been endorsed by the Court of Appeals as another form of evidence a plaintiff may provide to prove the prevailing market rate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277058,6785367\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/97/\">\n     793 F.3d at 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Defendant did not oppose the request for $73.50 in costs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Opp. at 21 (\"Costs total $73.50 for the underlying administrative action ....\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Draft Invoice included charges up through January 5, 2018.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Draft Invoice at 3.
