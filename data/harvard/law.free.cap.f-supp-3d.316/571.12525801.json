Before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are all African American women who, for nearly the entire period of time relevant to the Amended Complaint, worked as Associate Investigators in the Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Department of the New York City Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Isbell began working for the DOC on August 30, 2004 and transferred to the EEO Department in 2010; Plaintiff Pickett began working in the EEO Department of the DOC in March 2007; and Plaintiff Norman-Delgado began working in the EEO Department of the DOC in February 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.) For most of the relevant time period, Plaintiffs worked with only one other Associate Investigator: Dennis Wall, a white Caucasian man, who began working in the EEO Department in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) Plaintiffs do not allege when Wall began working for the DOC, but do state that he was an Associate Investigator in the EEO Department from 2012 until July 2015, when he was transferred to a different department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) \"Plaintiffs and Mr. Wall performed work of equal skill, effort, and responsibility and virtually identical duties ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Such work included: investigating sensitive charges of discriminatory employment practices; performing site visits to interview knowledgeable parties, including charging parties' witnesses and respondents in response to discrimination\n   charges; and preparing, reviewing, summarizing, and evaluating relevant information in investigation reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Le Goff supervised Plaintiffs and Wall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From September 2012 through August 2014, Plaintiffs earned an annual salary of $49,528, which in September 2014 was increased to approximately $51,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) In 2011, Wall earned an annual salary of $71,340, and received raises in subsequent years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) In addition to the salary disparity, during the relevant time period, Plaintiffs also allege various \"[i]nstances of discriminatory harassment\" and \"racial animus\" exhibited by Defendant Le Goff, most of which they allege without any specificity, including that she:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 heavily scrutinized and unjustifiably criticized Plaintiffs' work and criticized them when they made work-related suggestions, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 54);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 made Plaintiffs attend corrective interviews with her assistant, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 baselessly disciplined Plaintiffs because of supposedly inadequate work product, including by \"writing up\" Plaintiffs for \"imagined or exaggerated infractions,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 52);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 criticized Plaintiff Isbell for taking a day off for medical reasons, even though she had complied with the DOC's notice requirements, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 53);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 refused to authorize overtime work while simultaneously criticizing Plaintiffs' inability to meet deadlines, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 replaced African American employees with employees of other races, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38-43, 46-47);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 refrained from communicating with African American employees, except through her assistant or deputy director, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 49-50);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 denied Plaintiffs' requests to use DOC vehicles to perform site visits and when she granted their requests, required them to fill up the car with gasoline, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 57);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 on one occasion in 2014, delayed Plaintiff Norman-Delgado's use of a DOC vehicle while confirming that she was approved, even though she had been approved to use the vehicle since 2007, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 59);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 criticized Plaintiffs for taking longer with their investigations when Le Goff's refusal to allow Plaintiffs to use a DOC vehicle caused the delays, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 attempted to transfer Plaintiff Pickett to a different DOC department without her knowledge, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 used a \"harsh and sarcastic tone,\" which she did not do when communicating with Wall, her non-African American deputy director, or other non-African American members of her staff (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 51, 63).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Le Goff treated Wall \"more favorably.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 55, 61.) For example, in 2014 and 2015, Le Goff \"freely\" permitted Wall to use a DOC vehicle to perform his investigations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Additionally, Le Goff was more responsive to Wall's suggestions and, after Wall advised her that a training program was not useful, denied Plaintiffs permission to attend that training program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant Le Goff transferred them for discriminatory reasons and in a discriminatory fashion and that Le Goff confided to the EEO counsel in 2011 that \"she wished to replace her predominantly African American staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Plaintiffs allege that Le Goff replaced African American employees in the EEO Department, \"largely with non-African American employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Specifically, Defendants transferred Plaintiff Isbell to a different unit in June 2015 and, after previously attempting unsuccessfully to transfer Plaintiff Pickett in 2014, transferred Plaintiffs Norman-Delgado and Pickett to different units in February 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 48.) In late 2014, Le Goff also replaced another African-American woman, the Deputy Director of the EEO Department, with a non-African American woman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) Unlike with Plaintiffs, Defendant Le Goff transferred Wall only after he requested a transfer, and Wall received a raise after being transferred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs allege retaliatory conduct in response to Plaintiffs' reports and complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Plaintiffs' numerous complaints include that: (1) Plaintiffs complained to Defendant Le Goff \"[o]n a number of occasions\"; (2) Plaintiff Isbell complained in December 2014 to R. Fenimore Fisher, the Deputy Commissioner, Citywide Chief Diversity &amp; EEO Officer at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (the \"DCAS\"); (3) Plaintiffs, around December 2014, reported Defendant Le Goff's conduct to the District Council 37 Union, and the Union initiated a grievance as a result; and (4) Plaintiffs separately filed complaints with the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"), alleging unlawful pay disparities, hostile work environment, and disparate treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.) In particular, Plaintiff Isbell filed NYSDHR complaints on November 14, 2014, February 26, 2015, and March 18, 2015; and Plaintiffs Norman-Delgado and Pickett filed NYSDHR complaints on or about March 18, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) Plaintiffs further informed Defendants on July 5, 2015 that they had retained an attorney to bring a lawsuit for discrimination and retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Plaintiffs allege that as a result of their complaints, Defendants transferred Plaintiff Isbell to a \"different and less prestigious unit\" in 2015 and, after Plaintiffs notified Defendants of their intent to file a lawsuit, Defendant Le Goff, through her assistant, began to harshly criticize the work of Plaintiffs Norman-Delgado and Pickett and gave them \"corrective interviews\" on or about August 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73, 75-76.) Plaintiff Pickett complained to Fisher on December 30, 2015, which resulted in a DCAS investigation that included an interview of Plaintiff Norman-Delgado. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-79.) On February 5, 2016, \"Defendants, upon information and belief at Defendant Le Goff's behest,\" transferred Plaintiffs Norman-Delgado and Pickett to a \"less prestigious unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this case by filing their Complaint on October 21, 2015, alleging numerous claims related to their employment at the DOC. (Doc. 1.) After I granted Defendants' request for an extension of time to respond to the Complaint on November 24, 2015, (Doc. 10), on January 6, 2016, Defendants filed a pre-motion letter in anticipation of filing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), (Doc. 11). On January 11, 2016, Plaintiffs responded by simply noting that they intended to amend the Complaint as of right, (Doc. 12), and on January 19, 2016, I granted Defendants' request for a pre-motion conference and requested that Defendants submit a letter stating their position with respect to Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   intended amendment, (Doc. 13). In response to my order, on January 21, 2016, Defendants submitted a letter indicating that they did not consent to the proposed amendment absent first reviewing the proposed pleading. (Doc. 14.) I subsequently set a pre-motion conference for February 4, 2016, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15), during which time I set a schedule for the motion to dismiss briefing and proposed amended complaint, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19). In accordance with that schedule, on February 18, 2016, Defendants filed their initial motion to dismiss, (Docs. 16-18), and on March 10, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, (Doc. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 30, 2016, Defendants submitted another pre-motion letter requesting a conference on their proposed motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint, (Doc. 22), and on April 4, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their response, (Doc. 23). In response to these letters, on April 12, 2016, I issued an order dismissing the initial motion to dismiss as moot in light of the filing of the Amended Complaint, noting that I would not hold a second pre-motion conference, and setting a briefing schedule for the second motion to dismiss. (Doc. 24.) Pursuant to the deadlines set, Defendants filed their motion to dismiss on May 12, 2016. (Docs. 25-27.) After twice requesting extensions to file their opposition, which I granted, (Docs. 29, 31), Plaintiffs filed their opposition on June 15, 2016, (Doc. 32). Defendants similarly requested an extension of time to file their reply, which I granted, (Doc. 34), and they filed their reply on July 15, 2016, (Doc. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Rule 12(b)(1)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants assert that the election-of-remedies provisions in the NYSHRL and NYCHRL bar the claims of Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado.

Mem. 9-11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants do not identify the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure pursuant to which they seek dismissal on election-of-remedies grounds, (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), but it is well-established that election-of-remedies challenges raise an issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Moodie v.

First, Defendants argue that any claims arising before October 21, 2012 are time-barred. (Defs.' Mem. 8-9.) Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims are barred by the election-of-remedies provisions of the NYSHRL and NYCHRL, given Plaintiffs' decision to pursue relief through the NYSDHR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11.) Third, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1983 claims are barred by collateral estoppel in light of the NYSDHR's findings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.) Fourth, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1981 claims must be dismissed because \u00a7 1983 provides the exclusive remedy for violations of the rights asserted by Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Fifth, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegations fail to plausibly state any claims for relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-24.)

Opp. 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this statement, Plaintiffs rely on the NYSDHR's notices of intent to dismiss, which state only that the NYSDHR is considering dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl. Ex. J.) Defendants have not offered evidence that contradicts these notices; therefore, I assume for purposes of deciding the election-of-remedies issue that the charges were dismissed for administrative convenience. As a result, Plaintiffs are not barred from filing suit for claims related to these charges unless they are otherwise barred by the charges separately filed by Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado, and decided by the NYSDHR. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202240227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Exs. B, E, G, H.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In light of the presumed NYSDHR dismissals for administrative convenience and considering only those charges that were not dismissed, I find that only the hostile work environment claims of Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado brought under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL-but not their retaliation or discrimination claims or any of Plaintiff Picketts' claims-are barred by the election-of-remedies provisions. With respect to the hostile work environment claim, it is clear that Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado's claims for relief here assert the same cause of action and are based on the same incidents as those alleged before the NYSDHR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Sup. Ct. Oct. 23, 2007) ). Indeed, Plaintiff Isbell's December 2014 NYSDHR charge specifically alleged discrimination and harassment in violation of the NYSHRL, including by intimidation, denial of training, denial of leave time and other benefits, criticism of the manner in which work was performed, and other disciplinary actions taken by Defendant Le Goff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl. Ex. B.) Similarly, Plaintiff Norman-Delgado's May 2013 NYSDHR charge claimed unlawful discrimination because of race and color in violation of the NYSHRL, and included allegations that Defendant Le Goff created a hostile work environment \"for the majority of African American staff assigned to the unit,\" engaged in unfair disciplinary actions, scolded Plaintiff Norman-Delgado for speaking loudly while not doing to the same to others, refused to move Norman-Delgado to a different desk while granting similar requests made by others, and effectively denied her overtime while granting the overtime request made by at least one other individual. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%203226958\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. G, at 1, 5, 9-10.) Although the Amended Complaint contains additional allegations not included in the NYSDHR charges, the facts are \"substantially similar\" such that barring the hostile work environment claims of Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201965334\">\n    2012 WL 1965334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In contrast, the discrimination and retaliation claims of Plaintiffs Isbell and Norman-Delgado were not fully before the NYSDHR, most notably because a necessary element of those claims, the adverse employment action ultimately alleged in the Amended Complaint-transfers to different departments-had not yet occurred when Plaintiffs filed their NYSDHR charges.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201965334\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting that the NYSDHR complaints identified the plaintiff's termination as an adverse employment action).

Although Plaintiff Isbell did complain of general retaliatory conduct in response to her requests for more training, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Blank Decl. Ex.

Defendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED with respect to (1) Plaintiffs' differential pay claims under the Equal Pay Act and New York Equal Pay Act; (2) Plaintiff Pickett's hostile work environment claim brought under the NYCHRL; (3) Plaintiffs' discrimination claims brought under the NYSHRL, NYCHRL, and \u00a7 1983 against all Defendants and under \u00a7 1981 against Defendant Le Goff in her individual capacity; and (4) Plaintiffs' retaliation claims brought under the NYSHRL, NYCHRL, and \u00a7 1983 against all Defendants and under \u00a7 1981 against Defendant Le Goff in her individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants shall file an Answer to the Amended Complaint within twenty-one (21) days of this Opinion and Order.
