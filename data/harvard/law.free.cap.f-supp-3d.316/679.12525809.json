The AGs are investigating whether Exxon misled investors and the public about its knowledge of climate change and the potential effects that climate change may have on Exxon's business. Exxon contends the investigations are being conducted to retaliate against Exxon for its views on climate change and thus violate Exxon's constitutional rights. The relief requested by Exxon in this case is extraordinary: Exxon has asked two federal courts-first in Texas, now in New York-to stop state officials from conducting duly-authorized investigations into potential fraud. It has done so on the basis of extremely thin allegations and speculative inferences. The factual allegations against the AGs boil down to statements made at a single press conference and a collection of meetings with climate-change activists. Some statements made at the press conference were perhaps hyperbolic, but nothing that was said can fairly be read to constitute declaration of a political vendetta against Exxon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Healey and Schneiderman have moved to dismiss Exxon's First Amended Complaint (the \"Complaint\") (Dkt. 100) on numerous grounds: personal jurisdiction, ripeness,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , abstention pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    424 U.S. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), and that the Complaint fails to state a claim. The AGs have reserved their other defenses, including abstention pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Younger v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    401 U.S. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711728\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/37/\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971), and qualified immunity, for subsequent motion practice, if necessary. Exxon has opposed the AGs' motions and cross-moved for leave to amend in order to file the SAC. The AGs argue that leave to amend should be denied as futile because the SAC also fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons given below, the Court concludes that Healey is subject to this Court's jurisdiction and that Exxon's claims against the AGs are ripe for adjudication. The Complaint and SAC suffer from a more fundamental flaw, however:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Exxon's allegations that the AGs are pursuing bad faith investigations in order to violate Exxon's constitutional rights are implausible and therefore must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. For the same reason, amendment and filing of the SAC would be futile. Additionally, Exxon's lawsuit against Healey is precluded by\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   The Court does not reach whether abstention would be appropriate pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Colorado River.\n   </em>\n   The motions to dismiss are GRANTED, leave to amend is DENIED, and the Complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The New York Subpoenas and Massachusetts CID\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In November 2015, the NYAG served Exxon with a subpoena seeking documents related to its historical knowledge of climate change and its communications with interest groups and shareholders regarding the same. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, 65-68. The subpoena was issued in connection with an investigation into deceptive and fraudulent acts in violation of New York Executive Law Art. 5 \u00a7 63(12) and New York General Business Law Art. 22-A, and the Martin Act, New York General Business Law Art. 23-A, which prohibits fraudulent practices in connection with securities issued or sold in New York. Declaration of Justin Anderson (\"Anderson Decl.\") (Dkt. 227) Ex. B (the \"Subpoena\") at 1; Compl. \u00b6 62. As Schneiderman explained at a press conference discussed in detail below, the NYAG was investigating whether Exxon's historical securities filings were misleading because they failed to disclose Exxon's internal projections regarding the potential costs to Exxon of climate change and likely climate change-related regulations. Compl. \u00b6 36. Among other things, the Subpoena demanded that Exxon produce documents relevant to: Exxon's research and internal deliberations concerning climate change since 1977, Exxon's communications concerning climate change with certain oil and gas interests since 2005, Exxon's support for outside organizations regarding climate change since 1977, and Exxon's marketing, advertising, and public relations materials concerning climate change since 1977. Subpoena at 8-9; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 65-66. The Subpoena was followed by an August 2016 subpoena served on PricewaterhouseCoopers (\"PwC\"), Exxon's outside auditor. Opp'n (Dkt. 228) at 12. In response, and after some disputes over the scope of the Subpoena, Exxon produced at least 1.4 million pages of documents to the NYAG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 692.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately one year later, in fall 2016, the NYAG requested additional documents relevant to what Exxon calls the \"stranded assets theory.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. Under this theory, Exxon's past disclosures of the value of its oil and gas reserves may have been overstated because Exxon did not account for the potential impact of new regulations designed to reduce harmful emissions on the economics and feasibility of extracting certain oil and gas reserves. Compl. \u00b6 75. These reserves would be \"stranded\" because it would no longer be economically feasible for Exxon to extract them. If Exxon's internal models showed that certain reserves were likely to be stranded, Exxon might have been required to disclose those facts to the market. Relatedly, according to Exxon, the NYAG is also investigating the possibility that certain of Exxon's assets may be impaired and that Exxon's public disclosures do not account for that impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 79. Exxon has engaged in a \"dialogue\" with the NYAG regarding these demands. Compl. \u00b6 76. In May and July, 2017, the NYAG served Exxon with subpoenas for testimony and documents relative to these theories. SAC \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   About six months after the NYAG served its first subpoena on Exxon, the MAG served Exxon with a Civil Investigative Demand (the \"CID\") to pursue a similar fraud theory. Compl. \u00b6 69. The CID was issued as part of an investigation into potential violations of Massachusetts General Law ch. 93A \u00a7 2, which prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in \"trade or commerce.\" Compl. \u00b6 69. Like the Subpoena, the CID demands internal Exxon documents regarding climate change since the 1970s, Compl. \u00b6 72; Anderson Decl. Ex. C (Civil Investigative Demand or the \"CID\") at 12, and records of communications between Exxon and other energy companies, affiliated interest groups, and conservative policy organizations, CID at 13, 18; Compl. \u00b6 73. The CID also demands records related to specific reports prepared by Exxon and statements by Exxon officers regarding climate change. CID at 14-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the CID demands any documents and communications concerning a paper entitled \"\n   <em>\n    CO2 Greenhouse Effect A Technical Review\n   </em>\n   ,\" which was prepared by Exxon researchers in 1982, and a 2014 report to shareholders entitled \"\n   <em>\n    Energy and Carbon-Managing the Risks\n   </em>\n   .\" CID at 13, 16. Broadly, the CID demands \"Documents and Communications concerning any public statement [former CEO Rex W. Tillerson]\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   has made about Climate Change or Global Warming from 2012 to present.\" CID at 15. Like the Subpoena, the CID also demands documents relevant to Exxon's discussion of climate change in marketing materials and securities filings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CID at 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Exxon's Lawsuit\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Exxon brought this lawsuit on June 15, 2016, two months after receiving the CID and eight months after receiving the Subpoena. The Complaint alleges that the CID and the Subpoena are part of a conspiracy to \"silence and intimidate one side of the public policy debate on how to address climate change.\" Compl. at 1. The overt portion of this campaign is a coalition of state attorneys general, including Healey and Schneiderman, called the \"AGs United for Clean Power\" or \"Green 20.\" Compl. \u00b6 27. The AGs United for Clean Power held a conference and press event with former Vice President Al Gore in New York on March 29, 2016, to announce a plan to take \"progressive action to address climate change.\" Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Schneiderman spoke at the March 29, 2016, press event and said that the conference's purpose was to \"com[e] up with creative ways to enforce laws being flouted by the fossil fuel industry and their allies....\" Anderson Decl. Ex. A (Tr. of March 29, 2016, press conference) at 1. He described climate change as the \"most important issue facing all of us,\" and described the conference as a \"collective of states working as creatively, collaboratively and aggressively as possible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anderson Decl. Ex. A at 2. Schneiderman also linked the AGs United for Clean Power\n   conference to inaction at the federal level to address climate change: \"[W]e know that in Washington there are good people who want to do the right thing on climate change but everyone ... is under a relentless assault from well-funded, highly aggressive and morally vacant forces....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anderson Decl. Ex. A at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Healey also spoke at the March 29, 2016, press conference and said that \"[c]limate change is and has been for many years a matter of extreme urgency.... Part of the problem has been one of public perception, and it appears, certainly, that certain companies, certain industries, may not have told the whole story, leading many to doubt whether climate change is real and to misunderstand and misapprehend the catastrophic nature of its impacts.\" Anderson Decl. Ex. A at 12; Compl. \u00b6 32. Referencing Schneiderman's earlier comments regarding Exxon's disclosures (quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n. 6), Healey said \"[t]hat's why I, too, have joined in investigating the practices of [Exxon]. We can all see today the troubling disconnect between what Exxon knew, what industry folks knew, and what the company and industry chose to share with investors and with the American public.\" Anderson Decl. Ex. A at 12; Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a wild stretch of logic, Exxon contends that the AGs' \"overtly political tone,\" Compl. \u00b6 38, and comments on public \"confusion\" relative to climate change show that their intent is to chill dissenting speech, Compl. \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (\"To [Schneiderman], there was 'no dispute but there is confusion and confusion sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public....' \"). And, Exxon alleges, the AGs' comments demonstrate that they have prejudged the outcome of their investigations, presuming Exxon's guilt from the get-go. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the March 29, 2016, conference was the culmination of a behind-the-scenes push by climate change activists. Among the activists allegedly involved are Peter Frumhoff, Director of Science and Policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, Compl. \u00b6 42, who previously contributed to a report titled \"Smoke, Mirrors, and Hot Air: how ExxonMobil Uses Big Tobacco's Tactics to Manufacture Uncertainty on Climate Science,\" Compl. \u00b6 44. Also allegedly involved is Matthew Pawa, a self-described specialist in \"climate change litigation.\" Compl. \u00b6 45. The Complaint describes the development\n   by Pawa, Frumhoff, and the private Rockefeller Family Fund of a strategy to promote litigation against fossil fuel producers, including, in particular, Exxon. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46-49. Pawa and Frumhoff allegedly made presentations to the AGs United for Clean Power at the March 29, 2016, conference, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, but when Pawa was asked for comment by a\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   reporter, a member of the NYAG's office requested that he \"not confirm\" his attendance at the conference. Compl. \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The SAC adds detail to the Complaint's allegations regarding Pawa and Frumhoff and the Rockefeller Family Fund. According to the SAC, Pawa, Frumhoff, and others hatched a scheme to promote litigation against Exxon at a June 2012 conference in La Jolla, California. SAC \u00b6 44. These activists saw litigation as a means to uncover internal Exxon documents regarding climate change and to pressure fossil fuel companies like Exxon to change their stance on climate change. SAC \u00b6 45. In January 2016, at a conference at the offices of the Rockefeller Family Fund, the activists discussed the \" 'the main avenues for legal actions &amp; related campaigns,' including 'AGs,' 'DOJ,' and 'Torts,' \" and which options \"had the 'best prospects' for (i) 'successful action,' (ii) 'getting discovery,' and (iii) 'creating scandal.' \" SAC \u00b6 53 (quoting Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. S1 at 1-2). Exxon connects this strategy to a few meetings attended by staff from various state attorneys general, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39, 46, 48, and records of communications and information-sharing between the activists, the NYAG, and other state attorneys general, SAC \u00b6\u00b6 48, 56-58, 67-69. For example, there was a conference at Harvard Law School in April 2016 entitled \"Potential State Causes of Action Against Major Carbon Producers: Scientific, Legal and Historical Perspectives,\" which included an hour-long session on \"state causes of action\" such as \"consumer protection claims\" and \"public nuisance claims.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. S47 at 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Complaint also alleges the document requests themselves demonstrate that the investigations are politically motivated. Exxon contends that the AGs' legal theories are so flawed-in terms of a factual or jurisdictional basis-that the only rational explanation is that the AGs are motivated by animus towards Exxon, rather than by a good faith belief that Exxon may have violated state law. It argues, for example, that the statutes cited by the NYAG have six-year statutes of limitations at most, but the Subpoena requests documents dating to 1977. This is evidence, according to Exxon, of an intent to harass rather than to conduct a good faith investigation of potential violations of law. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. And, according to Exxon, with limited and irrelevant exceptions, it has not sold any products or securities in Massachusetts during the applicable limitations period. Compl. \u00b6 70;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 71 (alleging the Subpoena and CID seek documents with no connection to Exxon's activities in New York and Massachusetts). Both the Subpoena and CID demand Exxon's communications with oil and gas interest groups, which, according to Exxon, demonstrates the AGs' political bias because communications with private parties have no relevance to Exxon's public disclosures. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66, 73. Exxon believes that the NYAG's shift in theories-from whether Exxon made misleading disclosures regarding its knowledge of climate change to whether it appropriately disclosed the value of assets likely to be stranded or impaired because of climate\n   change-is evidence of an investigation in search of a crime, further demonstrating the NYAG's improper purpose. Compl. \u00b6 76. According to Exxon, the stranded assets theory is also inconsistent with SEC guidance regarding disclosure of proved reserves. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on these allegations, Exxon alleges the NYAG and MAG are retaliating against Exxon for its speech relative to climate change and the \"policy tradeoffs of certain climate initiatives.\" SAC \u00b6 123;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 120-124 (elaborating on Exxon's current position regarding climate change). Exxon asserts seven causes of action: for conspiracy to deprive Exxon of its constitutional rights pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105-08; for violations of Exxon's free speech rights pursuant to the First Amendment, and right to be free from unreasonable searches pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 109-11, 112-14; for violations of Exxon's right to due process pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-17; for violations of the Dormant Commerce Clause, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 118-21; preemption of Massachusetts and New York law to the extent they conflict with applicable SEC regulations, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 122-26; and common law abuse of process, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 127-28. As revised in the SAC, Exxon demands broad relief, including a declaratory judgment that the AGs' investigations violate Exxon's constitutional rights, SAC at 58, and an injunction \"halting or appropriately limiting the investigations,\" SAC at 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Litigation in Massachusetts and New York\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One day after filing its federal lawsuit against Healey (but not Schneiderman) in Texas, Exxon petitioned a Massachusetts Superior Court to set aside the CID and to disqualify Healey from the investigation. Opp'n at 10. Exxon's petition alleged that the CID violates the Massachusetts constitution's protections for free speech and against unreasonable searches and seizures, is arbitrary and capricious, and that Exxon is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts. Declaration of Christophe G. Courchesne (\"Courchesne Decl.\") (Dkt. 218) Ex. 2 (the \"Petition\") \u00b6\u00b6 16-22. The Petition relied on substantially the same factual allegations as the Complaint. Citing the March 29, 2016, conference and the AGs United for Clean Power coalition, the Petition alleged that the CID is intended to chill Exxon's free speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 61-63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (among other things, quoting the same statements by Healey and Schneiderman at the March 29, 2016, press conference as are quoted in the Complaint). The Petition included,\n   <em>\n    verbatim\n   </em>\n   (or nearly\n   <em>\n    verbatim\n   </em>\n   ), the same allegations regarding Pawa and Frumhoff. Petition \u00b6\u00b6 28-35. Like the Complaint (and in nearly identical language), the Petition also alleged that the CID's demand for communications between Exxon and other oil and gas interests and affiliated organizations demonstrates that the MAG investigation is politically motivated, and it alleged that Exxon could not have violated Massachusetts law because it has not sold fuel or securities in Massachusetts during the applicable limitations period. Petition \u00b6\u00b6 40-48. Noting the potential overlap between the Petition and Complaint, Exxon requested that the Massachusetts Superior Court stay proceedings pending the outcome of the federal litigation it had commenced the day before in Texas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition \u00b6 71 (\"Staying the adjudication of this Petition would avoid the possibility of duplication or inconsistent rulings ..., and\n   will serve the interests of judicial economy and efficiency and the principles of comity.\"). The MAG cross-moved to compel Exxon to comply with the CID. Opp'n at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 11, 2017, the Massachusetts Superior Court denied Exxon's petition to set aside the CID and granted the MAG's petition to compel. Anderson Decl. Ex. OO (the \"Massachusetts Decision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Superior Court found that Exxon was subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts by virtue of its control over franchisees operating Exxon-branded gas stations in the Commonwealth. Mass. Decision at 8. The Superior Court also rejected Exxon's argument that the CID was arbitrary and capricious because the MAG did not have a \" 'reasonable belief' of wrongdoing.' \" Mass. Decision at 8-9. Turning to the viewpoint discrimination theory that is the core of the Complaint, the Court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Exxon also argues that the CID is politically motivated, that Exxon is the victim of viewpoint discrimination, and that it is being punished for its views on global warming. As discussed above, however, the court finds that the Attorney General [Healey] has assayed sufficient grounds-her concerns about Exxon's possible misrepresentations to Massachusetts consumers-upon which to issue the CID. In light of these concerns, the court concludes that Exxon has not met its burden of showing that the Attorney General is acting arbitrarily or capriciously toward it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mass. Decision at 9. The Superior Court also denied Exxon's motion to disqualify Healey holding that her comments at the AGs United for Clean Power conference did not show any bias: \"In the Attorney General's comments at the press conference, she identified the basis for her belief that Exxon failed to disclose relevant information to Massachusetts consumers. These remarks do not evidence any actionable bias on the part of the Attorney General: instead it seems logical that the Attorney General inform her constituents about the basis for her investigations.\" Mass. Decision at 12. Although the Superior Court said it would not consider Exxon's free speech claim because any misleading or deceptive speech by Exxon \"is not entitled to any free speech protection,\" it effectively rejected the claim when it found the CID was not issued in bad faith to chill Exxon's free speech rights. Mass. Decision at 9 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Exxon appealed the Superior Court's order on February 8, 2017. Opp'n at 11 n.42. Exxon's appeal was transferred to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, where it remains pending as of the date of this opinion. Dkt. 236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast to its strategy in Massachusetts, Exxon initially complied with both New York subpoenas and had, by November 2016, produced over 1.4 million pages of responsive documents.

Until recently, the parties took the position that Exxon's compliance with the Subpoena was consensual, based on a compromise refereed by the assigned Supreme Court justice, Barry Ostrager.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NY Mem. at 10-11 (Exxon and the NYAG have appeared four times before the Supreme Court to discuss the parameters of Exxon's productions); Opp'n at 12, 25 (characterizing the proceedings before Justice Ostrager as an \"unsuccessful attempt to compel ExxonMobil to produce documents outside the scope of the November 2015 subpoena\" and \"discovery conferences and letter writing related to ExxonMobil's technical compliance\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 25 (\"Not a single opinion has issued from the New York state court, other than a ruling on whether the accountant-client privilege protects materials responsive to the PwC subpoena....\").

(Dkt. 244) (\"Hr'g Tr.\") at 64-65. The record before Justice Ostrager supports that position. For example, at a hearing on November 21, 2016, Justice Ostrager ordered the parties to agree to a schedule for productions or he would enter a formal order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Leslie B. Dubeck (\"Dubeck Decl.\") (Dkt. 221) Ex. 10 (Nov. 21, 2016 Hr'g Tr.) at 24-26.

Although the shifting of positions on a fairly straightforward issue is curious, the Court takes the NYAG's position at oral argument as a concession that Exxon has been compelled by the New York Supreme Court to provide documents and testimony in connection with the Exxon investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The alleged \"facts\" in this lawsuit are the same as were alleged in the Massachusetts proceeding. In both proceedings Exxon argues that Healey's investigation is not a good faith investigation but is an overt act in a conspiracy to chill its ability to exercise its First Amendment rights. In both proceedings Exxon points to the CID, which it alleges was served in bad faith, and to Healey's attendance at the March 29, 2016 presentations, the AGs United for Clean Power, and Healey's participation in the March 29, 2016 press conference. As the Court has noted, the allegations in the Petition track closely the complaint in this proceeding. Exxon itself acknowledged the overlap at argument before the Superior Court: \"as we've argued [in the Texas district\n   court].... Our position is that this is all about bad faith. This is about regulating speech. It's about viewpoint discrimination.\" Courchesne Decl. Ex. 6 at 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is irrelevant that the precise causes of action asserted in this proceeding were not raised in the Massachusetts proceeding.

Under those circumstances Massachusetts law (like the Restatement) permits relitigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   , 402 Mass. at 24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20N.E.2d%20151\">\n    520 N.E.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelso v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   , the court\n   concluded that a divorce proceeding was not preclusive of a subsequent tort claim for damages because the divorce court lacked authority to hear the tort action or award damages. The tort plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   filed her claims before the divorce proceedings were initiated and could not have sought a divorce in the superior court or brought her tort claims in probate court; she did not choose to split her claims. Even assuming, as Exxon argues, that the Massachusetts proceeding was a limited one, Exxon has not explained why it was forced to bring its federal claims in Texas and its state claims in Massachusetts. There is no dispute that the Superior Court could have considered Exxon's federal constitutional claims (unlike the probate court in\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   ) and the relief Exxon requests here is essentially identical to the relief it requested in state court-an injunction to quash the CID. Unlike the tort plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   , Exxon made a tactical choice to split its claims. Exxon cites no case that has applied\n   <em>\n    Heacock\n   </em>\n   to a situation analogous to this case, and the Court's independent research has revealed none.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Muddying the differences between issue and claim preclusion, Exxon also argues that claim preclusion does not apply because the opportunity to litigate in this case is greater than the opportunity it had in the Massachusetts proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 35 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sprecher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1890773\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/716/968/#p972\">\n    716 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   972 ). As discussed above, under\n   <em>\n    Sprecher\n   </em>\n   , issue preclusion may not apply where there are differences in the burden of proof or the opportunity to develop evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 699-700. The same considerations do not apply to claim preclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Shea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532025\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/584/#p594\">\n    886 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   594 ; 18 Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4422 (3d ed.) (\"Issue preclusion,\n   <em>\n    although not claim preclusion\n   </em>\n   , may be defeated by shifts in the burden of persuasion or by changes in the degree of persuasion required.\") (emphasis added). Claim preclusion is primarily concerned with whether a party has improperly split its claim, forcing the defendant to litigate twice a controversy that could have been litigated once. Exxon did not seek discovery in Massachusetts, so this Court cannot say that discovery would not have been available. Had discovery been Exxon's goal, it could have raised its Section 1983 claims in state court. Exxon's lack of discovery in state court was the result of its own tactical decisions; those tactical decisions do not render inapplicable established law of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Exxon's remaining arguments are unpersuasive, and the Court rejects them. Notwithstanding Exxon's desire for a federal forum, there is nothing unique about Section 1983 claims that requires a federal lawsuit. The federal courts system presumes that state courts are competent to adjudicate federal rights, and the potential for preclusion is a necessary consequence of that.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Temple of the Lost Sheep, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 930 F.2d at 185. Finally, preclusion does not raise any due process concerns under the circumstances. As the Supreme Court has explained, the \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate standard requires that a prior proceeding satisfy the constitutional\n   minima of due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kremer v.

Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4415 (3d ed.) ) ). Exxon has not pointed to any limitation in the Massachusetts proceeding that falls below the constitutional standard. As Exxon's briefing to that court demonstrates, it had a full opportunity to be heard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The MAG's motion to dismiss on claim preclusion grounds is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The AGs argue that Exxon's allegations that their investigations have an improper purpose are implausible. Improper motive is admittedly difficult to plead. Nevertheless, Exxon must allege facts from which the Court may plausibly infer that the AGs know their investigations lack merit but have nonetheless proceeded against Exxon for ulterior reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this issue is at the heart of Exxon's case, and each of the constitutional torts it has asserted requires a plausible inference that the AGs acted not based on a good faith belief that Exxon may have violated state laws, but to retaliate against Exxon for, or to deter Exxon from, speech that is protected by the First Amendment. At oral argument on November 30, 2017, the Court directed the parties to brief whether the Complaint states a claim.

According to Exxon, the AGs' statements at the press conference evince their intent to discriminate against other viewpoints regarding climate change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28 (\"For the Green 20, the public policy debate on climate change was over and dissent was intolerable.\"), 133 (\"The investigations were commenced without a good faith basis and with the ulterior motive of coercing ExxonMobil to adopt climate change policies favored by the [AGs].\"). And-according to Exxon-the AGs \"linked\" the CID and Subpoena to \"the coalition's political efforts.\" SAC \u00b6 34. Exxon's narrative of events is the result of cherry-picking snippets from the transcript of the press conference, a complete transcript of which is attached to the Complaint. Read in context, the NYAG's comments suggest only that he believes that an investigation is justified in light of news reports regarding Exxon's internal understanding of the science of climate change. The NYAG's statements regarding Exxon speak for themselves, and so the Court quotes them in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 After describing a settlement with Peabody Energy, Schneiderman said: \"And the same week we announced [the Peabody settlement], we announced that we had served a subpoena on ExxonMobil pursuing that and other theories relating to consumer and securities fraud. So we know, because of what's already out there in the public, that there are companies using the best climate science.... And yet, they have told the public for years that there were no 'competent models,' was the specific term used by an Exxon executive not so long ago.... And we know that they paid millions of dollars to support organizations that put out propaganda denying that we can predict or measure the effects of fossil fuel on our climate, or even denying that climate change was happening.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B (Tr. of March 29, 2016, press conference) at 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 Next, Schneiderman said, \"There have been those who have raised the question: aren't you interfering with people's First Amendment rights? The First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen, does not give you the right to commit fraud. And we are law enforcements [sic] officers.... And we are pursuing this as we would any other fraud matter. You have to tell the truth. You can't make misrepresentations of the kinds we've seen here.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 In response to a reporter's question whether the Exxon investigation was a publicity stunt, Schneiderman said \"[i]t's certainly not a publicity stunt. I think the charges that have been thrown around-look, we know for many decades that there has been an effort to influence reporting in the media and public perception about this.... The specific reaction to our particular subpoena was that the public report that had come out, Exxon said were cherry picked documents and took things out of context. We believe they should welcome our investigation because, unlike journalists, we will get every document and we will be able to put them in context.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 Continuing, Schneiderman said, \"It's too early to say. We started the investigation. We received a lot of documents already. We're reviewing them. We're not prejudging anything.... It's too early to say what we're going to find with Exxon but we intend to work as aggressively as possible, but also as carefully as possible.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 17-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 In a response to a question about possible damages, Schneiderman said: \"Again, it's early to say but certainly financial damages are one important aspect of this but, and it is tremendously important and [sic] taxpayers-its been discussed by my colleagues-we're already paying billions and billions of dollars to deal with the consequences of climate change and that will be one aspect of-early foreseeing, it's far too early to say.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is not possible to infer an improper purpose from any of these comments; none of which supports Exxon's allegation that the NYAG is pursuing an investigation even though the NYAG does not believe that Exxon may have committed fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Perhaps recognizing this, Exxon relies instead on other portions of the press conference in which the NYAG described climate change as a settled issue and, in Exxon's words, \"derided\" arguments regarding the cause of climate change or the appropriate policy response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Opp'n at 17; SAC \u00b6 28 (Quoting Schneiderman as saying there is \"no dispute but there is confusion, and confusion sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public that really need to be cleared up.\"). The Complaint and the SAC set up a false equivalence between Schneiderman's belief that climate change is a settled issue and Exxon's inference that the NYAG is pursuing its investigation in order to retaliate against Exxon for its political speech. The fact that Schneiderman believes climate change is real-so does Exxon apparently-and advocates for particular policy responses does not mean the NYAG does not also have reason to believe that Exxon may have committed fraud. The latter depends on the separate question of what the NYAG believes Exxon knew, when it knew it, and whether what it knew differs from what it has publicly said. To the extent Schneiderman's statements regarding climate change generally are relevant at all,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   they tend to suggest that he believes that Exxon has an \"interest in profiting from\n   confusion\" and has created \"misperceptions in the eyes of the American public,\" i.e., that Exxon has made false statements. Schneiderman can be accused of hyperbole-he is a politician, after all-but asserting that one's political opponent is sowing \"confusion\" is a rather tame accusation in the present, overheated political climate. Moreover, pursuing an investigation because of a belief that a company has \"sowed confusion\" on an issue that is important to that company's bottom line would only be in bad faith if the investigator had concluded that the company actually believed the facts it was using to sow confusion. Nowhere does the Complaint or SAC allege that the NYAG knows or believes that Exxon was itself confused about the causes or risks of climate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Healey said even less at the press conference, and the discussion above applies equally to her. Healey referenced Exxon only once in her relatively brief remarks (they occupy less than two pages of the appendix to the SAC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 12). Regarding Exxon, she said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \u2022 \"Climate change is and has been for many years a matter of extreme urgency, but, unfortunately, it is only recently that this problem has begun to be met with equally urgent action. Part of the problem has been one of public perception, and it appears, certainly, that certain companies, certain industries, may not have told the whole story.... Fossil fuel companies that deceived investors and consumers about the dangers of climate change should be, must be, held accountable. That's why I, too, have joined in investigating the practices of ExxonMobil. We can all see today the troubling disconnect between what Exxon knew, what industry folks knew, and what the company and industry chose to share with investors and with the American public.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. B at 12. Like Schneiderman's statements, Healey's statement that Exxon \"may not have told the whole story\" in no way suggests that Healey knows or believes that Exxon, in fact, \"told the whole story\" but wants to retaliate against it for its truthful statements because it disagrees politically. To the contrary, Healey's statement suggests that she believes Exxon may have made false statements to its investors and the public and may have committed fraud.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Mass. Decision at 12 (\"In [Healey's] comments at the press conference, she identified the basis for her belief that Exxon may have violated [Massachusetts law]. In particular, she expressed concern that Exxon failed to disclose relevant information to its Massachusetts consumers. These remarks do not evidence any actionable bias on the part of [Healy]: instead it seems logical that [Healey] inform her constituents about the basis for her investigations.\"). The SAC appears to acknowledge as much by also alleging that the AGs have prejudged their investigation and concluded that Exxon is guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 34, 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The SAC presents this press conference as the culmination of a campaign by climate change activists to encourage elected officials to exert pressure on the fossil fuel industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 38-61. The relevance of these allegations depends on two inferences: first, that the activists have an improper purpose-that is, that they know state investigations of Exxon will be frivolous, but they see such investigations as politically useful; and second, that this Court can infer from the existence of meetings between the AGs and the activists, that the AGs share the activists' improper purpose. The Complaint and SAC do not plausibly allege facts to permit the Court to draw either inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   According to the SAC, Exxon's political opponents, led primarily by Matthew Pawa and Peter Frumhoff, have, since a 2012 meeting in La Jolla, California, sought to use litigation to gain access to Exxon's internal documents regarding climate change and to \"maintain[ ] pressure on the industry that could eventually lead to its support for legislative and regulatory responses to global warming.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 45. The SAC alleges additional meetings among private actors in July 2015 and January 2016. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 47, 52. There are no allegations that either the NYAG or the MAG attended the La Jolla conference or the conferences in July 2015 and January 2016, so these allegations have limited relevance to the AGs' motives in issuing the CID and Subpoena. Moreover, the SAC does not include any factual allegations to suggest that Pawa and Frumhoff and their confederates do not believe that Exxon has committed fraud. At best (for Exxon) the meetings are evidence that the activists recognize that the discovery process could reveal documents that would benefit their public relations campaign by showing that Exxon has made public statements about climate change that are inconsistent with its internal documents on the subject. This evidence falls short of an inference that the activists-to say nothing of the AGs-do not believe that there is a reasonable basis to investigate Exxon for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Exxon attempts to provide the missing link between the activists and the AGs by pointing to a series of workshops, meetings, and communications between and among Pawa and Frumhoff and other climate change activists and the AGs or their staffs. For example, Exxon alleges that the NYAG has communicated with Tom Steyer, a billionaire and climate-change activist, regarding campaign contributions and Exxon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 51. The NYAG has discussed \"the activities of specific companies regarding climate change\" with the Rockefeller Family Fund, a private philanthropic organization that has funded investigative journalism regarding Exxon's historical knowledge of climate change. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 52-57. And Frumhoff and Pawa made presentations to the AGs shortly before the press conference on March 29, 2016. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 43. Frumhoff's presentation was entitled the \"imperative of taking action now on climate change\" and Pawa's presentation was on \"climate change litigation.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-43. The SAC includes no other information about these presentations or their content; the content of the NYAG's communications with Tom Steyer; or the content of the NYAG's discussions with the Rockefeller Family Fund. It is pure speculation to suggest that the content of the presentations was to encourage baseless investigations of Exxon. But even if the climate activists did encourage the AGs to investigate Exxon as a means to uncover internal documents or to pressure it to change its policy positions without a good faith belief that Exxon had engaged in wrongdoing, another logical leap is required to infer the NYAG and MAG agreed to do so without having a good faith belief that their investigations of Exxon were justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Next, the SAC-but not the Complaint-alleges that the CID and Subpoena were precipitated by investigative journalism funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 57. According to Exxon these articles have been used \"as pretextual support\" for the AGs' investigations. SAC \u00b6 57. The only basis for Exxon's allegation that these articles are a pretext is that, according to Exxon, the documents cited in the articles \"demonstrate that [Exxon]'s climate research contained myriad uncertainties and was aligned with the research of scientists at leading institutions at the time.\" SAC \u00b6 57. Assuming the truth of Exxon's characterization of the documents, they appear to support the AGs' legal theory that Exxon's internal research was consistent with the scientific\n   consensus but that Exxon made statements to the market and the public that suggested otherwise. In any event, Exxon has included no\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   allegations that tend to show that the AGs do not believe that the articles based on Exxon's documents have raised legitimate concerns that should be run to ground. Absent such factual allegations, the Court is in no position to infer that duly authorized state investigations are pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Complaint and SAC also allege that a common-interest agreement among the Green 20 is evidence of concealment of their \"political agenda.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   SAC \u00b6 62. Exxon's attempt to transform a mine-run common-interest agreement into evidence of an improper motive is not plausible. The common-interest agreement covers a number of potential areas of litigation related to climate change, including: \"conducting investigations of representations made by companies to investors, consumers, and the public regarding fossil fuels, renewable energy and climate change,\" \"taking legal actions to compel or defend federal measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions,\" and \"taking legal action to obtain compliance with federal and state laws governing the construction and operation of fossil fuel and renewable energy infrastructure.\" Anderson SAC Decl. Ex. V at 19. The preamble to the agreement, quoted by Exxon, states that the AGs share an interest in \"ensuring the dissemination of accurate information about climate change.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 62. Although that would appear to be an admirable goal of a public official with which few would quarrel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   according to Exxon, this statement confirms the \"coalition's willingness to violate First Amendment rights to carry out its agenda.\" SAC \u00b6 62. It is unclear how that is so. Nothing in the common interest agreement defines \"accurate information about climate change\" in a way that suggests that the AGs have agreed to punish protected speech. Ensuring that \"accurate information\" reaches the market and the public is consistent with a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   investigation-not retaliation. As the Court has explained, and Exxon has agreed, false statements to the market or the public are not protected speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 34:16-35:1 (\"[The COURT]: But you don't have the right to lie in your securities filings. That's what they are investigating. If they are wrong, then they don't have a case. If they are right, then Exxon should be held to account. Do you agree with that? [EXXON]: I agree that that is the fact that ... they can conduct an investigation into fraud. No one is disputing the ability to conduct an investigation into fraud.\"). Alternatively, Exxon points to the reticence of the AGs (and the Vermont attorney general, also a signatory) to produce the common-interest agreement as evidence they have something to hide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 63, 69. This inference is speculative. FOIA and FOIL disputes are commonplace, and they do not give rise to an inference that something sinister is afoot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Exxon also points to the document requests themselves as circumstantial evidence of an improper motive. According to Exxon, the facts that the document requests seek documents from periods outside the statutes of limitations and demand communications between Exxon and outside groups demonstrate that the AGs' investigations are pretextual and retaliatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 77-86 (the Subpoena), 87-91 (the CID). Despite arguing to this Court that the document requests are so frivolous that they are evidence of pretext, Exxon did not dispute the validity of the Subpoena requests in New York Supreme Court; it challenged only the extent to which the Subpoena required it to produce general accounting documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dubeck Decl. Ex. 9 (Exxon's N.Y. Supreme Court brief) at 5-6 (disputing whether accounting related documents are called for by subpoena for climate change-related records); Dubeck Decl. Ex. 10 (Nov. 21, 2016 Hr'g Tr.) at 13 (arguing that accounting related documents are beyond the scope of the Subpoena). The Massachusetts Superior Court ruled on this issue and found that the CID was supported by a reasonable basis, and the CID demands substantially the same records as the Subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. Decision at 8. The fact that the demands seek historical documents from periods outside the statutes of limitations is not evidence of pretext: if the AGs are investigating whether Exxon made material misrepresentations in the past six years (the statute of limitations applicable to the Martin Act and New York General Business Law Art. 22-A), Exxon's historic knowledge is relevant, whether it was gained five years ago or twenty-five years ago. Evidence that Exxon made material misrepresentations before the limitations period is relevant to Exxon's present-day intent and could be evidence of a continuing scheme that persisted into the limitations period. Exxon's communications with outside groups are also potentially relevant. It could be relevant, for example, if Exxon shared internal documents concerning climate-science or knowingly helped climate-change deniers craft a messaging strategy that was consistent with Exxon's political desire to avoid regulations harmful to its economic interests but inconsistent with its internal understanding of climate change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Last, and along the same lines, Exxon argues that the NYAG's shifting investigative theory and attempt to explore a stranded-assets theory is evidence of pretext. It is to be expected that Exxon disagrees with the merits of the NYAG's investigation, and, more specifically, believes the NYAG's theory may be preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 95-97; Supp. Opp'n at 39-42. But if every time a questionable legal theory were pursued in an\n   <em>\n    investiga\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tion\n   </em>\n   -not even in an enforcement proceeding-the target could run into federal court and enjoin the state investigation on pretext grounds, the role of the states in our federal system would be seriously compromised. The fact that the NYAG's theories have shifted over time (presumably, at least in part, in response to facts learned as it receives material from Exxon) is too slim a reed to support Exxon's allegations of an improper motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In sum, whether viewed separately or in the aggregate, Exxon's allegations fall well short of plausibly alleging that the NYAG and MAG are motivated by an improper purpose. The Complaint and SAC do not allege any direct evidence of an improper motive, and the circumstantial evidence put forth by Exxon fails to tie the AGs to any improper motive, if it exists, harbored by activists like Pawa and Frumhoff. This issue is fatal to Exxon's claims for violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, its claims under Texas law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its claim for conspiracy pursuant to Section 1985.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Exxon's constitutional tort and state law cognate claims are DISMISSED and leave to amend is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   b.

According to Exxon, the Subpoena and CID nonetheless impermissibly regulate interstate commerce because they are intended to \"regulate\" the market for political speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Opp'n at 37. As Exxon concedes, the Subpoena and CID do not, on their face, regulate speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Opp'n at 36-38. Thus, Exxon's dormant commerce clause claim appears to rest on the theory that the Subpoena and CID are\n   <em>\n    sub silentio\n   </em>\n   regulations because they have an improper purpose. The Court rejects this argument for the reasons already given.
