BRYSON, UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this order, the Court addresses a dispute between the parties over the admissibility of certain exhibits that the plaintiffs (collectively, \"Pernix\") intend to offer at trial. Defendant Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd. (\"Alvogen\") contends that the materials are inadmissible as hearsay. Pernix argues that the materials in dispute are non-hearsay and can be used to cross-examine Alvogen's witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Admissibility of Alvogen's Expert Witness Reports Against Alvogen\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The principal issue before the Court involves the admissibility of five exhibits (PTX 84, 85, 89, 133, and 134) proffered by Pernix. Those exhibits consist of reports by two experts who were retained by a related Alvogen entity in connection with another case. That case,\n   <em>\n    Purdue Pharma L.P. et al. v. Alvogen Pine Brook LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 15-687 (referred to as \"the Hysingla litigation\"), recently settled, quite literally, on the eve of trial. Pernix seeks to use Alvogen's experts' reports to challenge Alvogen's claim that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C808%2C740\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 8,808,740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to Huang is an invalidating prior art reference in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three of the exhibits in question are reports prepared by Alvogen expert Michael Mayersohn for the Hysingla litigation. To begin with, it is clear that statements by Dr. Mayersohn in those reports may be used to impeach Dr. Mayersohn if he testifies in this case in a manner that is inconsistent with any of the statements he made in the reports he prepared for the Hysingla litigation. That much is not in dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 613.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   What\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in dispute is whether the expert reports of Dr. Mayersohn and another of Alvogen's experts, Fernando Muzzio, in the Hysingla litigation are admissible as substantive evidence over a hearsay objection. Pernix's argument is that those statements are non-hearsay statements of an opposing party and are admissible under\n   Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Alvogen contends that the statements do not satisfy the requirements of any of the categories of party admissions that are covered by that Rule. The Court agrees with Alvogen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rule 801(d) defines certain statements as non-hearsay. The second subsection of that rule, Rule 801(d)(2), lists five types of statements that are attributable to an opposing party and are admissible if offered in evidence against the opposing party. Only three of the five are arguably pertinent here. Rule 801(d)(2)(B) refers to a statement that \"is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true.\" Rule 801(d)(2)(C) refers to a statement that \"was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject.\" And Rule 801(d)(2)(D) refers to a statement that \"was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There is substantial case law dealing with the admissibility under Rule 801(d)(2) of the testimony, depositions, or reports of an expert against the party that retained the expert. The case law on this subject is mixed, however, with courts reaching different results under a variety of different factual circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Admissibility Under Rules 801(d)(2)(C) and (D)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The leading Third Circuit case in this area,\n   <em>\n    Kirk v. Raymark Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308386\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/147/\">\n    61 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1995), held that testimony from a previous, unrelated trial by an expert retained by a party was not admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(C). The court based its ruling on its analysis of the role of expert witnesses in general. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In theory, despite the fact that one party retained and paid for the services of an expert witness, expert witnesses are supposed to testify impartially in the sphere of their expertise. Thus, one can call an expert witness even if one disagrees with the testimony of the expert. Rule 801(d)(2)(C) requires that the declarant be an agent of the party-opponent against whom the admission is offered, and this precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an expert witness where, as normally will be the case, the expert has not agreed to be subject to the client's control in giving his or her testimony. Since an expert witness is not subject to the control of the party opponent with respect to consultation and testimony he or she is hired to give, the expert witness cannot be deemed an agent....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Because an expert witness is charged with the duty of giving\n   <em>\n    his or her\n   </em>\n   expert\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   regarding the matter before the court, we fail to comprehend how an\n   expert witness, who is not an agent of the party who called him, can be authorized to make an admission for that party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308386\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308386\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/147/\">\n    at 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   specifically addressed only Rule 801(d)(2)(C), which deals with statements by a person authorized to make a statement on behalf of a party, the court predicated its ruling on a finding that the expert in that case was not an \"agent\" of the defendant. In light of that language,\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   has been interpreted as applying equally to Rule 801(d)(2)(D), which deals with statements by a party's agent on a matter within the scope of the relationship and while it existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A number of cases have followed\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   in applying Rules 801(d)(2)(C) and (D), including several from this district.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    AVM Techs., LLC v.

The leading cases holding that an expert's prior testimony, deposition, or report is admissible as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(C) are\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Wayne Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482359\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/621/777/\">\n    621 F.2d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1980), and\n   <em>\n    In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064590\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/986/\">\n    534 F.3d 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , a products liability action brought against Wayne, a bus manufacturer, following a collision involving one of Wayne's buses, Wayne hired a Mr. Greene as \"an expert in the field of automobile collision investigation\" to analyze the accident. Mr. Greene was deposed and prepared a report. At trial, the plaintiff wished to use Mr. Greene's deposition testimony and argued it was admissible as a statement of a person authorized by Wayne to make a statement on the subject matter under Rule 801(d)(2)(C). The Fifth Circuit held that Mr. Greene's testimony was admissible on that ground, as Wayne had \"hired Greene to investigate the bus accident and to report his conclusions. In giving his deposition he was performing the function that Wayne had employed him to perform. His deposition, therefore, was an admission of Wayne.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482359\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/621/777/\">\n    621 F.2d at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Hanford Nuclear Reservation\n   </em>\n   case, the plaintiff had called an expert, F. Owen Hoffman, in an earlier bellwether trial, where he testified about causation. When the defendants sought to cross-examine Dr. Hoffman regarding his testimony on that subject at the earlier trial, the plaintiff objected. The Ninth Circuit held that \"Dr. Hoffman's testimony at the first bellwether trial was an admission of a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(C). Plaintiff cannot now exclude trial testimony that she, herself,\n   proffered.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064590\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/986/\">\n    534 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A number of district courts have followed those decisions in varying circumstances.

The statement in\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   that \"normally\" an expert witness \"has not agreed to be subject to the client's control in giving his or her testimony,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308386\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/147/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11308386\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/147/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   clearly applies to statements offered under either the \"authorized statement\" subsection (C), or the \"agent or employee\" subsection (D) of Rule 801(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Therefore, under the analysis employed by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that neither Dr. Muzzio nor Dr. Mayersohn is (or was at the time they prepared their reports in the Hysingla litigation) an \"agent or employee\" of Alvogen. Although Alvogen has retained them, their role is to serve as independent experts, and there is no evidentiary basis from which to conclude that either of them is an agent or employee of Alvogen, such that any statement made by the experts within the scope of their employment or agency should be attributable to the principal, Alvogen. The Court regards the\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   case as dispositive in holding that experts in a case such as this one will ordinarily not be deemed to be agents or employees of the party that retained them, and ordinarily will not be deemed authorized to make statements on behalf of the party that retained them as to the subject matter of their testimony. The Court therefore rejects Pernix's argument that the Muzzio and Mayersohn reports from the Hysingla litigation are admissible in this case as substantive evidence under Rules 801(d)(2)(C) or 801(d)(2)(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Admissibility Under Rule 801(d)(2)(B)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A more difficult question is whether the statements by Drs. Muzzio and Mayersohn are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(B), which applies to \"adoptive admissions,\" i.e., statements that the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true. The issue with respect to Rule 801(d)(2)(B) is whether the party has taken any action that indicates that it has adopted some or all of the statements in the experts' reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A number of cases have addressed the issue of the admissibility under Rule 801(d)(2)(B) of prior statements by experts, such as testimony or reports filed in other cases on behalf of the party against which they are offered. The\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   decision does not address that issue, and cases applying Rule 801(d)(2)(B) have admitted the experts' statements under various factual scenarios indicative of the party's adoption of the expert's statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auto-Dril, Inc. v.

Ala. Dec. 6, 2016) (expert retained by defendant in another case prepared a report; court rejected the plaintiff's argument, based on Rules 801(d)(2)(B) and 801(d)(2)(C), that the defendant's acts of hiring the expert in the earlier case, disclosing his opinions in that case, and making him available for deposition in that case meant that the defendant adopted or believed his statements to be true; \"a party does not, by the simple act of designating an expert witness, automatically and irrevocably adopt everything that witness may say in the case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The rationale underlying Rule 801(d)(2)(B) results in a much more restrictive scope for adoptive admissions than, for example, for admissions based on the agency of Rule 801(d)(2)(C). A statement is admissible as an adoptive admission only if the party against whom the statement is offered has specifically adopted that statement as its own. Thus, in the case of expert witnesses, admissibility under Rule 801(d)(2)(B) depends on a finding that the party has specifically adopted each statement at issue made by the expert, rather than treating as admissible any statement made by the witness within the scope of his agency. The rule that the Court derives from the cases construing Rule 801(d)(2)(B), as applied to statements of a party's expert witness that are offered as adoptive admissions of the retaining party, is this: The expert's statements, whether in the form of a deposition, an expert report, or testimony in another proceeding, will be regarded as an adoptive admission and thus not hearsay as to the retaining party if the circumstances in which the statement is made, used, or proposed to be used indicate that the party supports the statement as representing its position. For example, if the party has called the expert as a witness, in the same or another proceeding, to prove a particular\n   fact and the witness has so testified, the party will be held to have adopted the expert's testimony on that point as an admission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

As McCormick explains, \"circumstances may justify the conclusion that, when the proponent placed the witness on the stand to prove a particular fact and the witness so testified, the party has created an adoptive admission of the fact that may be admitted in a later suit.... [I]t would seem that a practical working rule would admit against the proponent the direct testimony of its own witness as presumptively elicited to prove the facts stated, in the absence of counter proof that the testimony came as a surprise to the interrogator or was repudiated in the course of argument.\" 2 Kenneth S. Broun,\n   <em>\n    McCormick on Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 261, at 303-04 (7th ed. 2013). On the other hand, McCormick adds that \"[i]n general, the opinion of an expert who was not called as a witness should not constitute an admission of the party that sought the opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487209\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/1349/#p1355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 303 n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, Alvogen submitted the reports of Drs.

As a result, it is not clear to the Court what portions of their expert reports would have become the subject matter of their trial testimony. The joint pretrial order, which provides a brief summary of the proposed witness testimony for each party's witnesses, does not provide sufficient detail for the Court to conclude that particular parts of the Muzzio and Mayersohn expert reports would have been replicated in their trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14, 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The burden is on Pernix to lay a foundation for the admission of the Muzzio and Mayersohn expert reports by laying a foundation to show that the statements that it wishes to introduce are non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    Lippay v.

In response to the argument that the evidence was barred by Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), the court stated that the district court had \"overlook[ed] the crucial fact that [plaintiff] sought to contradict specific testimony offered under oath, rather than simply to suggest that [the defense witnesses] had engaged in dishonest behavior on some occasion. In other words, [plaintiff] sought to engage in 'impeachment by contradiction,' which is not covered by Fed. R. Evid. 608.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739997\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/172/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739997\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/172/\">\n    at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That case, too, provides no support for Pernix's position. While\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   permits impeachment by contradiction by live witness, nothing in that opinion condones the use of extrinsic hearsay evidence to contradict a witness at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Pernix cites a passage from the district court opinion in\n   <em>\n    Matthiews v. Crosby Tugs, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 15-5985,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207048255\">\n    2016 WL 7048255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. La. Dec. 5, 2016). In that case, the plaintiff testified in his deposition that he had provided a written description of his accident to a claims adjuster. At\n   trial, the defendant sought to introduce documents from the adjuster that would show that the adjuster's file on the incident did not contain a written statement from that witness. The court permitted the use of the documents. The documents were relevant, the court held, because the absence of any record of the accident in the adjuster's file tended to show that the plaintiff did not in fact provide a written description of the accident to the adjuster. The documents were not objectionable on hearsay grounds, the court held, \"because the documents are not offered for the truth of any assertion contained in the documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Pernix's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Matthiews\n   </em>\n   is far wide of the mark. To begin with, although the district court in\n   <em>\n    Matthiews\n   </em>\n   made clear that the adjuster's documents were not being used to prove the truth of any assertion found in them-and thus the documents were not offered for a hearsay purpose-Pernix cites the case for the proposition that \"extrinsic evidence can be used to impeach a witness by contradiction even if it contains hearsay.\" Dkt. No. 233, at 6. Beyond that, there is no equivalence between the evidence in\n   <em>\n    Matthiews\n   </em>\n   and the evidence at issue in this case. While the evidence in\n   <em>\n    Matthiews\n   </em>\n   was relevant without regard to the truth of anything stated in the adjuster's documents, the statements in Dr. Muzzio's expert reports would be relevant only if the statements in those reports were taken as true. That is, they would they serve the purpose of contradiction for which they are being offered only if they were taken as true. If not for their hearsay use, the reports would be irrelevant. Thus, the reports at issue are clearly being offered for a hearsay purpose and are inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court therefore rules that Dr. Muzzio's statements cannot be used, either as substantive evidence or for impeachment of other witnesses at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on the supplemental briefing in which the Court gave Pernix the opportunity make the showing necessary to satisfy its burden to show that the Muzzio and Mayersohn expert reports from the Hysingla litigation are admissible over a hearsay objection or can be used for impeachment purposes at trial, the Court concludes that those reports are not admissible or usable for impeachment. Accordingly, the five exhibits at issue-PTX 84, 85, 89, 133, and 134-will not be admitted at trial. Dr. Mayersohn's report may be used to impeach Dr. Mayersohn to the extent that his testimony at trial is inconsistent with his prior statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    During a telephonic conference on this matter, the Court raised the question whether the different identities of the Alvogen entities in this case and in the Hysingla litigation rendered the analysis under Rule 801(d)(2) inapplicable. The defendant in this case is Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd., while the defendant in the Hysingla litigation was Alvogen Pine Brook LLC. Based on information provided in the supplemental briefs, it appears that Alvogen Pine Brook LLC and Alvogen Malta Operations Ltd. were previously sister corporations, and at some time between 2016 and 2018, Alvogen Malta became the parent of Alvogen Pine Brook. Pernix argues that the separate nature of the corporate entities is \"inconsequential\" because Alvogen Pine Brook is listed as the agent of Alvogen Malta in the FDA submissions that underlie this litigation. In light of the Court's decision to preclude Pernix from introducing the expert reports from the Hysingla litigation as substantive evidence in this case, it is not necessary for the Court to resolve the question regarding whether the separate corporate status of the two Alvogen entities defeats Pernix's argument under Rule 801(d)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Although in theory expert witnesses are independent actors and not agents of the party that retained them, the Court recognizes that in reality expert witnesses are typically aligned with the retaining party, at least by the time the retaining party presents the expert's views during pretrial and trial proceedings. As was well stated by Chancellor Chandler of the Delaware Court of Chancery in\n    <em>\n     ONTI, Inc. v. Integra Bank\n    </em>\n    , No. Civ. A. 14514,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20671263\">\n     1998 WL 671263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *2 (Del. Ch. Aug. 25, 1998) :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    [I]t seems intellectually dishonest for a court to fail to recognize that experts are more often than not hired hands, brought in by a party in order to propose the truth as that party sees it, or authorized by that party to represent the experts' own opinions as they conform to the party's position. While in theory an expert is meant to testify impartially as to his opinion, the fact that a party has control over whether or not to introduce the expert and testimony supported by him, and the fact that the party has the right to choose the expert in the first place, certainly adds credence to the theory that an agency relationship exists between the expert and his supporting party. Given that dynamic, it is unclear why a statement made by an expert in the course of his testifying on behalf of a party, which is adverse to that party, should not be admissible against that party.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Teva Pharm.
