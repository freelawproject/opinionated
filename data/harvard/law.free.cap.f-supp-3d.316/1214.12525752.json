Moreover, Claimant's stipulations comport with the standard for applying the single claimant exception. Claimant has stipulated to the district court's exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether PTS is entitled to limit its liability pursuant to the Act, and to determine all other limitation of liability issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Claimant further agrees not to enforce any judgment rendered outside the limitation proceeding that would expose PTS to liability in excess of the limitation fund, the value of which Claimant stipulates as equal to the combined value of the vessel and its pending freight, as determined by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505758\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/438/#p439\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because the Court defaults all non-appearing claimants, the single claimant exception applies to this Action, thus compelling the Court to grant Claimant's motion to lift the previously issued injunction and stay this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Claimant's motion.
