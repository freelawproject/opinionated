Because of how maritime law has developed, partly by common law and partly by statute, the answers to these questions require close analysis. But in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    557 U.S. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    174 L.Ed.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009), I am persuaded that such remedies are available to Plaintiffs. This is so because the claims they assert and the relief they seek are well established in general maritime law, and no act of Congress, including the Jones Act, eliminates their availability.\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   held that when a common law cause of action and remedy predate a statute, courts need not ratchet down common law relief to match statutory relief, unless Congress has explicitly legislated otherwise. Consequently, I hold that such damages are recoverable by Plaintiffs in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During a July 2014 outing on the water, Plaintiff Lisa Morgan's right pinkie and ring fingers were traumatically amputated in a boating accident. She was entering the water from the surface of a 2006 Bentley\n   Pontoon Boat when her hand caught in the boat's gate. The only dispute as to how the accident happened is over whether Ms. Morgan was jumping, stepping, or lowering herself into the water. Ms. Morgan's spouse, Edward Morgan, was on a nearby boat at the time, and rushed to her aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant evidence in this case reaches back more than a decade to the original manufacture, sale, and recalls of the boat in question. The Bentley Pontoon boat on which Ms. Morgan was injured was owned by the Morgans' friend, Richard Spence. Spence bought the boat new in Delaware in early 2006 from Defendant Almars Outboards, Inc., an authorized dealer for Bentley, the boat's now-defunct manufacturer. There is no evidence in the record that Spence knew he was purchasing a boat with a dangerous design that had already been the subject of a safety recall and would soon be recalled again. Bentley designed its pontoon boats to have metal railings that curved down to the hinges where the railings met the gate. Bentley soon learned that this design created a \"pinch point\" where the curved corners of the gate and railing came together, allowing a passenger's fingers to become ensnared. On March 1, 2004, Bentley sent a Safety Recall notice to its dealers. It began:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   We have identified a safety risk associated with the design of our railings and gates. It is possible for a person's finger(s) to lodge between the points where a railing and gates meet on all of our models. The probability of this occurring seems greatest when entering into or exiting from the water. Possible injuries can range from laceration to dismemberment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pls.' Ex. G, ECF No. 47-1, at 36-38. In an effort to eliminate this hazard, Bentley developed a spherical guard that could be installed at the pinch point [hereinafter a \"ball guard\"]. Boat owners could choose to install the guards themselves or have a Bentley dealer do it, free of charge, with Bentley reimbursing dealers for their labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unfortunately, these ball guards did not fix the problem, and the pinch point on Bentley boats continued to injure passengers. On January 1, 2007, Bentley issued a second Safety Recall letter to its dealers. This second notice was much like the first, but added that the ball guards, in addition to the railings, were unsafe. The notice urged dealers to immediately install new \"gate replacement corner flat kits\" [hereinafter \"block guards\"] and to encourage customers to have the guards installed \"before the next use of their boat.\" The letter warned: \"This is very important and we do not want any further injures. Act Immediately.\" Pls.' Ex. L, at 93. In addition to these notices, there were several well-documented instances of finger injury and amputation on Bentley boats, and there is evidence that at least one Bentley dealer notified its customers of the danger and provided an effective guard well before either recall notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Almars contends that it had no knowledge of the safety hazard that Bentley's gates or ball guards posed until it learned of Ms. Morgan's injury. The owner of Almars, Albert Marinelli, testified that Almars sold Bentley boats for about two years, from 2004 to September 2006. He testified that, despite Almars's status as an authorized Bentley dealer that performed repairs under Bentley's warranty, Almars never received the 2004 or 2007 safety recall notices, and never heard of any customer or anyone else being injured by the gate. Marinelli took this position in spite of his testimony that a Bentley sales representative (Ed Butcher) regularly visited Almars, and that, on one occasion, Butcher \"dropped a bunch of those balls on our desk and said if any boats come in without\n   these, put them on.\" Marinelli Dep. 116:17-23, Pls.' Ex. I, at 45. But the boats Almars bought from Bentley came equipped with the ball guards already, so Marinelli never used the guards and \"never really paid much attention\" to them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117:17-23. The boat Spence bought from Almars in January 2006 arrived from Bentley to Almars equipped with these (ineffective) ball guards, which were in place at the time of Ms. Morgan's accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on these events, Plaintiffs filed this products liability lawsuit, which the parties agree is governed by general maritime law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs sued only Almars as the retail supplier of the product. Ms. Morgan makes claims based in negligence and two theories of strict liability-sale of a defective product and failure to warn-seeking punitive damages and other remedies. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-29, ECF No. 1. Mr. Morgan asserts a derivative claim of loss of consortium based on the injuries Ms. Morgan suffered, and an independent claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) based on his proximity to the accident. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties have filed cross motions for partial summary judgment. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 47 [hereinafter \"Pls.' Mot.\"]; Def.'s Mot. Partial Summ. J., ECF No. 49 [hereinafter \"Def.'s Mot.\"]. Plaintiffs seek summary judgment against Almars on both of their theories of strict product liability. Pl.'s Mot. 12-19. Defendant seeks dismissal on the merits of the Morgans' negligence and NIED causes of action, and asserts that their claims for punitive damages and loss of consortium must be dismissed as unavailable under general maritime law. Def.'s Mot. 10-18. Alternatively, Almars seeks dismissal of the punitive damages claim on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons that follow, and as set forth in my Order of May 4, 2018, both Motions are granted in part and denied in part. ECF No. 58. The Morgans are entitled to summary judgment on the issue of whether Almars supplied a \"defective\" product that was \"unreasonably dangerous,\" as those terms are defined in Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, when it originally sold the pontoon boat on which Ms. Morgan was injured-there is no dispute that it did. The remainder of Plaintiffs' Motion is denied, however, as those issues, including liability for failure to warn and causation, are appropriate for resolution by a jury. Almars's Motion is granted only as to Mr. Morgan's NIED claim, to which there is no opposition. It is denied as to the merits of Ms. Morgan's negligence claim, and as to the availability of her claim for punitive damages and Mr. Morgan's claim for loss of consortium, because the Morgans may access those remedies under general maritime law. Finally, Defendant's Motion is denied as to the merits of Ms. Morgan's punitive damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties' motions are governed by the well-established standard for summary judgment set forth in Federal Rule Civil Procedure 56(a), as amplified by\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corporation v. Catrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/\">\n    477 U.S. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Morgan's Motion for Judgement in her favor on Strict Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Preliminarily, it should be observed that it is rare for a party that bears the burden\n   of proof to prevail by summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Shager v. Upjohn Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534024\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/398/#p403\">\n    913 F.2d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (7th Cir. 1990). Plaintiff can prevail in part because she is proceeding under a theory of strict liability and the essential facts are not in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is clearly established that the Restatement of Torts' strict liability principles, which form the basis for Ms. Morgan's claims, apply to general maritime actions like this one.\n   <em>\n    Ocean Barge Transp. Co. v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929667\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/726/121/#p123\">\n    726 F.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (3d Cir. 1984). The parties agree on this point. Pls.' Mot. 14-18; Def.'s Resp. 16, ECF No. 52. Her first claim rests on Section 402A, which creates liability for the seller of a product in a \"defective\" condition that is \"unreasonably dangerous\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous ... is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To prevail on this theory, Ms. Morgan must establish that (1) the pontoon boat was defective; (2) the defect was a proximate cause of her injury; and (3) the defect existed at the time the boat left Almars's hands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavlik v. Lane Ltd./Tobacco Exporters Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11872658\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/876/#p881\">\n    135 F.3d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (3d Cir. 1998). There is no dispute that Bentley was the designer and manufacturer of the boat involved here and that, as its originator, Bentley concluded that the boat was defective and, later, that the ball guards were defective. Almars did not, undoubtedly because it could not, proffer an expert opinion from an engineer or design professional contesting the danger of the design. Both logic and common sense supports the conclusion that a recreational craft used for the pursuit of leisure cannot have a readily accessible pinch point. And this danger, which Bentley identified and inadequately sought to design around or warn against, fits exactly the harm suffered by Ms. Morgan. It is likewise undisputed that Almars was engaged in the business of selling Bentley pontoon boats, and that when it sold the boat on which Ms. Morgan was injured, the boat had a defective gate hinge (with an ineffective ball guard) that was unreasonably dangerous in that it created a risk of finger amputation. There is similarly no dispute that the boat was expected to and did reach Ms. Morgan without a substantial change in the condition in which it was sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 402A goes on to provide that \"[s]ubsection (1) applies although (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For that reason, Almars's contention that it was unaware of the defect and unaware of the danger does not suffice to prevent it from being held liable as a matter of law. Indeed, the essence of strict liability is that a supplier is the guarantor of its product's safety regardless of fault. Therefore, as to the issue of whether Almars supplied a defective product, summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Almars specifically disputes causation, and whether the defective gate hinge was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's injury. I am hard pressed to see any\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   disputes, as the details of how Ms. Morgan's hand came into contact with the pinch point would seem irrelevant to the danger it presented. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, I will leave that issue for resolution by the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs' second strict liability theory is failure to warn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert that Almars should have known of the risk posed by the defective gate and ineffective ball guards, and should have provided Spence with a post-sale warning of the danger so that he could warn his guests, including Ms. Morgan, or fix the problem. Pls.' Mot. 18-19. There is undisputed evidence that Almars knew that ball guards should be installed on the gates, but whether Almars knew or should have known the ball guards were ineffective remains in dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marinelli Dep. 115:3-118:3, Pls.' Ex. I, at 45. One aspect of this issue is whether Almars received the Bentley safety recall letters in 2004 and/or 2007 warning of dismemberment from the defective hinges and, later, ball guards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Exs. G, at 35; Pls.' Ex. L, at 92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion is denied as to failure to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion as to Mr. Morgan's Negligence Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In negligence claims under general maritime law, plaintiffs must generally prove the same elements as traditional common law: duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n   <em>\n    In re Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3793972\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/201/#p211\">\n    624 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 (5th Cir. 2010). The same evidence that supports strict liability would allow a jury to find negligence. Defendant's Motion is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Motion as to Mr. Morgan's NIED Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties agree that general maritime law applies the \"zone of danger\" test to NIED claims and that Mr. Morgan's NIED claim does not meet that test because he was \"not personally placed in immediate risk of physical harm\" as a result of the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Federal maritime jurisdiction derives from the United States Constitution, art. III, \u00a7 2, and is codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which states: \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of (1) [a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled....\" The scope of maritime jurisdiction may be straightforward, but the controlling substantive law can vary based on whether the plaintiff is a seaman,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a longshoreman, harbor worker, or, like Ms. Morgan, a passenger aboard a vessel. Maritime law also attaches significance to whether the injury occurred in coastal waters or on the \"high seas\" (beyond territorial waters). These are not mutually exclusive, and seamen often proceed on more than one basis.\n   <em>\n    Atl. Sounding Co. v. Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    557 U.S. 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    174 L.Ed.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Maritime law is a centuries-old, evolving area of federal common law that Congress has more recently supplemented with statutory protections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Plaintiffs' claims arise under general maritime law, some background about the statutory relief available to people injured at sea is necessary context to determine whether Plaintiffs' common law remedies here are affected by any legislation. In the first instance, federal common law historically provided causes of action for seamen based on negligence, a vessel's unseaworthiness, and a violation of the employer's \"maintenance and cure\" obligation-that is, to provide for the living expenses and medical costs of an injured seaman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calmar S.

Similar to Almars, the tugboat defendants argued that, under\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   , seamen who brought common law claims were limited to the damages available under the Jones Act, which did not include punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court cast aside this argument, holding that (1) the relief Townsend sought (punitive damages) has historically been available and awarded in maritime actions, \"including some in maintenance and cure,\" and (2) \"nothing in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   or the Jones Act eliminates that availability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court thus outlined a two-step framework to apply where a plaintiff seeks relief under general maritime law in an area where Congress has also legislated: first, determine whether the claim and relief sought are well established (historically available) in general maritime law; second, determine whether any statute eliminates that availability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To arrive at its first conclusion-that seamen plaintiffs in maintenance and cure common law claims had historically been entitled to punitive damages-the\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   Court identified three \"settled legal principles.\" First, it found that American courts have allowed punitive damages awards since at least 1784, and that the Supreme Court has likewise authorized punitive damages \"as a matter of common law doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing cases from 1859 and 1886). Second, it found that \"the general rule that punitive damages were available at common law extended to claims arising under federal maritime law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    at 411-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[P]rior to enactment of the Jones Act in 1920, maritime jurisprudence was replete with judicial statements approving punitive damages, especially on behalf of passengers and seamen.\").

Not surprisingly, most maritime cases involved seamen, who at the time truly were sea\n   <em>\n    men\n   </em>\n   , and the law did not allow female spouses to recover for loss of consortium on land or at sea. (In the two early cases cited above, it was men who sought loss of consortium for injuries to their child and wife, respectively.) Whereas \"a husband's right to the consortium of his wife was clear and definite,\" there was \"no clear authority\" as to the corresponding rights of a wife and, even if one existed, a woman could not effectively exercise that right because \"a married woman was incapable of suing except when her husband joined as plaintiff,\" and he \"was entitled to the proceeds of any suit brought.\" Evans Holbrook,\n   <em>\n    The Change in the Meaning of Consortium\n   </em>\n   , 22 Michigan L.

Instead, Almars cites to modern, pre-\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   cases in which courts have rejected a spouse's claims for loss of consortium, some under the Jones Act and some under general maritime law.

Thus, my own research reveals no case-and Defendant offers none-in which a court analyzing a passenger's Jones Act claim has suggested that punitive damages or loss of consortium should be unavailable to passengers under the Act. Moreover, in and of itself, the dearth of Jones Act cases brought by passengers is strong evidence that not only have general maritime principles been preserved, but they remain the primary basis for such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With no explicit direction from Congress and no case law applying the passenger provision, it is instructive to look more broadly to \"more than a dozen cases [in which] the Supreme Court has affirmed that the Jones Act did not take anything from seamen.\" Robertson,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 485 n.147 (citing,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garrett v.

Rather than arguing that the Act's passenger provision prohibits punitive damages or loss of consortium, Defendant insists that recovery under the Jones Act\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   is limited to pecuniary loss, and thus passengers must be so limited as well. Defs.' Mot. 14-15. In support, Almars cites a conglomeration of cases, mostly by seamen, involving common law claims and Jones Act claims, all decided before\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   and before the 2006 Jones Act amendment. Assuming for the moment that Almars is right, and that the Act limits recovery to pecuniary loss for passengers and seamen alike, it does not necessarily follow that the same limitations would apply to the Morgans' common law claims, because nothing in the text of the Jones Act signals that Congress intended to displace passengers' pre-existing common law right to those damages in general maritime law negligence cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    557 U.S. at 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation, and the available history suggests that punitive damages were an established part of the maritime law in 1920.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/#p29\">\n    498 U.S. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/#p29\">\n    111 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Furthermore, when viewed from a historical perspective, Defendant's initial premise-that a passenger can recover only pecuniary damages in a Jones Act claim-is itself on unstable footing. The Jones Act includes no general limit on damages. Rather, it limits damages for seamen by reference to FELA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30104 (incorporating the \"[l]aws of the\n   United States regulating recovery for personal injury ... to a railway employee\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , FELA). When Congress originally passed the Jones Act, the Supreme Court had already interpreted FELA to provide only pecuniary damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michigan Cent. R. Co. v.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Vreeland, Miles\n   </em>\n   later held that, since Congress \"incorporat[ed] FELA unaltered into the Jones Act,\" Congress must have intended to impose the same limitations on seamen's recovery under the Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/#p29\">\n    498 U.S. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217111\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/19/#p29\">\n    111 S.Ct. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But only the Jones Act's provision governing seamen incorporates FELA; the passenger provision does not. Seamen are of course employees, and FELA is a statute rooted in the employer-employee relationship. I can find no case, and Almars points to none, explaining why the passenger provision of the Jones act should also be limited by FELA when passengers are by definition not employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   's guidance, I find that the correct answer in this case is even more straightforward than in Mr. Townsend's. Given\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   's holding that seamen may recover non-pecuniary damages under general maritime law, even in the face of Jones Act provisions explicitly limiting their recovery to pecuniary damages, it becomes all the more clear that non-pecuniary damages should be available to passengers, to whom the limitations of FELA have no logical applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In conclusion, I hold that the Morgans may seek punitive damages and loss of consortium, because that recovery has historically been available and awarded in common law negligence and products actions, and because nothing in\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   or the Jones Act eliminates that availability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    557 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lobegeiger v.

But this position ignores evidence in the record from which a jury could determine that Almars did know of the defects, either from having been sent one or both of the safety recall letters or from its in-person interaction with the Bentley sales representative who delivered the ball guards. Thus this question, like so many in this case, will come down to whether a jury believes Mr. Marinelli's testimony that Almars did not receive either letter, and knew nothing of the defective hinge or ball guard. If a jury does not find his testimony credible, and concludes that Almars knew of the defect, then the jury could reasonably conclude that Almars's failure to cure the defect by installing block guards or warning its customers amounted to gross negligence or reckless indifference.
