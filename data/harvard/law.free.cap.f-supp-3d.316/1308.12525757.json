Parrish, United States District Court Judge\n   Ronald Gardner sued Delta Airlines and the United States of America based upon his interactions with an air marshal. He asserted a number of claims, including intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, false imprisonment, and assault. Before the court are motions for summary judgment filed by Delta and the United States and a motion to exclude an expert witness filed by Gardner. The court GRANTS Delta's motion for summary judgment and GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the United States' motion for summary judgment. The court DENIES without prejudice Gardner's motion to exclude an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gardner has macular degeneration, which eliminates his central field of vision and renders him legally blind. In 2011, he had some peripheral vision, which he could use to perceive the shape of a face and determine when a person is facing him. He could also see the color of clothing a person was wearing and perceive an individual's \"gross movements,\" like standing up, sitting down, or walking. Gardner is also hearing impaired and wears hearing aids. It is difficult for him to engage in conversation with someone behind him on an airline flight due to the ambient noise. On the date of the incident that is the basis of this lawsuit, Gardner was 59 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 20, 2011, Gardner was seated in the first class section of a Delta flight from Washington, D.C. to Salt Lake City. Two undercover federal air marshals (FAM1 and FAM2) were also aboard the flight. FAM1 was seated directly behind Gardner. FAM2 was seated in the row behind FAM1 on the other side of the aisle. FAM1 is 6 foot 2 inches tall, weighs 235 pounds, and is an active weightlifter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After take-off, Gardner began to slowly recline his seat. He felt a violent hit on the back of his seat that shoved it back into an upright position. Five to ten minutes later, Gardner began to recline his seat a second time. His seat was hit from behind even more violently, causing it to return to an upright position and causing Gardner to jolt forward in his seat. Gardner turned his head over his left shoulder and said, \"Hey, fella, we each have a ticket on this flight.\" FAM1 responded in a \"disgusted tone,\" but Gardner could only make out the word \"computer\" in his response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few minutes later, Gardner tried to recline his seat for a third time, but FAM1 again pushed the seat forward. Gardner's further attempts to recline the seat were futile because FAM1 was applying pressure to the back of the seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gardner went to the galley at the front of the airplane where the head flight attendant was located. The flight attendant noticed that Gardner was \"literally shaking,\" sweating, and taking shallow breaths. Gardner told the head flight attendant what had occurred and asked for assistance. The attendant responded that he would take care of it. The flight attendant then looked at a paper posted on the wall, which Gardner presumed to be either a\n   flight manifest or a list of passengers in first class, and mentioned to Gardner that it was odd that the man seated behind him did not have a frequent flier number. Gardner entered the bathroom to allow himself some time to calm down and to give the flight attendant time to deal with the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While Gardner was in the bathroom, the head flight attendant spoke with FAM1. FAM1 complained that if Gardner reclined his seat, he would not have enough room to use his laptop. Given FAM1's level of agitation during this discussion and the fact that he was armed, the flight attendant became instantly concerned for the welfare of Gardner and all of the other passengers on the flight. The flight attendant told FAM1 that he would ask Gardner to consider reclining his seat to a lesser degree, but that under no circumstances should FAM1 physically or verbally threaten Gardner. The Head flight attendant then returned to the galley at the front of the airplane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Gardner had waited in the bathroom for a couple of minutes, he returned to his seat. As he was sitting down, FAM1 stood up and angrily said, \"I was just looking for a little compromise.\" Gardner responded, \"Compromise is fine, bullying is not.\" FAM1 left his seat and went to the front of the airplane for one or two minutes and then returned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As FAM1 was sitting down, he grabbed Gardner's seatback and \"jostl[ed] the heck out of it.\" Gardner began to worry that the man seated behind him had found his name on the list posted near the front of the airplane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the flight attendants served drinks, the head flight attendant came to Gardner's seat, crouched down, and said to Gardner, \"It's okay. He's in a pile of shit. It's the federal air marshal.\" Gardner believed that the head flight attendant was attempting to reassure him by letting him know that FAM1 would be dealt with. But the revelation that the man seated behind him was a federal air marshal had the opposite effect. Gardner then knew that FAM1 was armed. He also worried that FAM1 would be able to discover his name, address, future flight plans, and whether his wife was flying with him or would be home alone. For the rest of the flight, Gardner was so nervous and upset that the woman seated next to him asked if he was alright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Near the end of the flight, the head flight attendant approached Gardner and said, \"You know, I have flown with you a lot, and I know how independent you are and that you don't need help getting off of the plane, but I want to help you off the plane tonight.\" Gardner said that he appreciated the offer and accepted it. The attendant said that he had to do some things after the airplane landed. He told Gardner to wait in his seat until he came to get him and that after the first class section was empty, he would escort Gardner off the airplane and through the airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When the airplane landed, Gardner waited in his seat for about ten minutes after he believed that everyone in first class had deplaned. At that point, he could no longer hear passengers in coach exiting the airplane and he decided to leave. Unbeknownst\n   to Gardner, FAM1 had waited on the airplane as well. As Gardner stood up and retrieved his briefcase and cane, FAM1 also stood up and moved to the aisle. When Gardner turned towards the exit, he found himself face to face with FAM1, who was blocking the aisle. Gardner, in shock, yelled \"What is he doing here?\" Gardner heard the lead flight attendant respond from the front of the airplane, \"Well, I guess he has as much right to get off the plane as anyone else.\" Gardner then asked whether the lead flight attendant was going to help him off the airplane. He responded that he had called someone from the airport to came and assist Gardner. Gardner than said to FAM1, \"Excuse me, I've got to get my suitcase.\" FAM1 did not move or say anything in response. Gardner repeated his request to get by FAM1 multiple times, but for about three minutes FAM1 remained motionless and silent. At some point, a Delta airport employee arrived to assist Gardner. When FAM1 turned to look at the airport employee behind him, Gardner pushed passed FAM1. The airport employee retrieved Gardner's bag from the overhead bin and the two of them exited the airplane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When they entered the airport, Gardner told the Delta airport employee that he wanted to hide to avoid any encounter with the man who was with him on the airplane. The airport employee led Gardner to a spot behind some type of divider or placard. Gardner then asked the airport employee to tell him when the captain walked by because he wanted to talk to him. When the Delta airport employee spotted the captain, the pair approached him. Gardner told the captain that he wanted to talk to him about what happened on the flight, and the captain responded that he had heard about it. At that point, Gardner realized that another man was standing next to the captain. Gardner asked the airport employee whether it was the man who was in first class, and he said yes. Gardner asked the captain to speak in private. The captained waived off FAM1, who moved a few feet away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Gardner, the captain, and the Delta airport employee began to walk through the airport. In response to Gardner's questions of what he should do, the captain said that he should call customer care. When Gardner expressed dissatisfaction with this option, the captain responded at least twice by saying \"Aw, I think you'll be all right.\" Gardner again noticed that a man was next to the captain, and the airport employee confirmed that it was FAM1. The captain then excused himself and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Gardner and the Delta airport employee began to make their way to the airport exit, and FAM1 followed a few feet behind them. In response to Gardner's inquiries, the airport employee continually updated Gardner on where FAM1 was walking and what he was doing. He told Gardner that FAM1 was following them and that he was looking over at them. Gardner believed that FAM1 was intentionally stalking him. When Gardner, the Delta airport employee, and FAM1 approached the security check area, Gardner intentionally allowed FAM1 to go past security first. Gardner and the airport employee then sprinted as fast as Gardner could to a different exit so that he could lose FAM1. Gardner exited the airport without further incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gardner sued both Delta and the United States based upon this incident. In his complaint, Gardner alleged that his encounter with FAM1 caused him to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder ; anxiety; depression; periodic, anxiety-related loss of the little remaining vision he has; panic attacks; fear of public places; insomnia; and recurring nightmares. Gardner voluntarily dismissed two of the causes of action he originally asserted, leaving claims against Delta for (1) negligence, (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   negligent infliction of emotional distress, (3) breach of duty of a common carrier towards a disabled passenger, (4) breach of duty towards a business visitor, and (5) a cause of action that Gardner labels as a respondeat superior claim. The parties dispute whether a sixth claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress survived Delta's motion to dismiss. Gardner also asserted claims against the United States for (1) negligence, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (4) false imprisonment, (5) assault, and (6) a cause of action that Gardner labels as a respondeat superior claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties have not engaged in a choice of law analysis to determine which state's substantive laws governs Gardner's various causes of action. But by citing Utah authorities, they appear to agree that Utah law controls. The court, therefore, applies Utah's substantive law to Gardner's state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court applies federal procedural law to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stickley v.

R. CIV. P. 56(a). \"A fact is material if, under the governing law, it could have an effect on the outcome of the lawsuit.

DELTA'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    A. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court must first determine whether Judge Kimball dismissed Gardner's intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against Delta. Delta argues that Judge Kimball dismissed this claim in his June 18, 2015 order; Gardner contends that he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his order on Delta's motion to dismiss, Judge Kimball concluded that the facts alleged in the complaint were sufficient to support a claim that the actions of Delta's employee's constituted intentional infliction of emotional distress. [Docket 30, p. 5]. But Judge Kimball further determined that Delta could not be held liable for this tort because \"to the extent that Gardner can prove a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against a Delta employee, such conduct would be outside the scope of that employee's employment and Delta would not be liable under respondeat superior.\" [Docket 30, p. 6]. Thus, Judge Kimball clearly found that Delta prevailed as a matter of law on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim and dismissed this cause of action. The intentional infliction of emotional distress\n   claim against Delta is no longer a live issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    B. Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Delta argues that Gardner's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and his negligence-based claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   are preempted by federal statutes governing airlines. Gardner asserts that Delta waived its preemption argument. He also contends that his claims are not preempted. The court will address each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1) Delta did not waive its preemption argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Gardner first argues that Delta waived its preemption argument because it did not assert it in the motion to dismiss. But it provides no authority for this proposition. The case Gardner cites states only that parties may not raise a new argument in a motion for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carvana v. MFG Fin., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:07-CV-00128DAK,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202468539\">\n    2008 WL 2468539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Utah June 17, 2008). Delta did not waive preemption by failing to raise it in the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Gardner also argues that Delta may not assert a preemption argument in its motion for summary judgment because it did not plead it as an affirmative defense. Gardner is correct that preemption is an affirmative defense that should be pleaded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    564 U.S. 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334435,12450499\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/604/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"Because pre-emption is an affirmative defense, a defendant seeking to set aside state law bears the burden to prove impossibility.\");\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

Thus the question before the court is whether Delta may raise its unpleaded preemption affirmative defense for the first time in a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[T]he substance of many unpleaded Rule 8(c) affirmative defenses may be asserted by pretrial motions, particularly in the absence of any showing of prejudice to the opposing party and assuming it has had an opportunity to respond.\" 5 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &amp; ARTHUR R. MILLER FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 1278 (3d ed. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahmad v.

Gardner has had an opportunity to respond to the preemption\n   argument. The issue that must be decided, therefore, is whether Gardner's has been prejudiced by Delta's failure to give notice of its preemption defense before the close of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court determines that Gardner has not been prejudiced. As described in greater detail below, Delta's preemption defense turns on whether Gardner's common law tort claims are \"related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). This analysis requires the court to examine the relationship between the substance of Gardner's claims and airline prices, routes, and services. No additional discovery would affect the court's resolution of this question because it rests on a broad view of the nature of these claims rather than a detailed examination of the evidence supporting the claims. Therefore Gardner was not prejudiced by Delta's failure to give notice of its preemption defense prior to the close of discovery and the court permits Delta to raise preemption through its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2) Gardner's claims against Delta are preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA) authorized broad federal regulation of the airline industry, including the regulation of interstate airfares. Pub. L. No. 85-726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Stat.%20731\">\n    72 Stat. 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958). In 1978, Congress amended the FAA with the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA), which undid government regulation of ticket prices. \"To ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own, the ADA included a pre-emption provision ....\n   <em>\n    Morales v.

Reasoning that it would make no sense to require air carriers to obtain insurance for bodily injury and property damage if they were immune to all tort liability, that circuit held that \"federal preemption of state laws, even certain common law actions \"related to services\" of an air carrier, does not displace state tort actions for personal physical injuries or property damage caused by the operation and maintenance of aircraft.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413412\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/44/334/#p338\">\n    44 F.3d at 336, 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Taken together, the above-mentioned cases suggest that some common-law claims, such as a claim for readmittance to a frequent flier program under a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing theory, are preempted.

The head flight attendant informed Gardner that FAM1 was an air marshal within the context of mediating a dispute between the two passengers.

Later, FAM1 shook Gardner's seat as he was sitting down in order to physically intimidate him. FAM1 concedes that he discovered that Gardner was blind before the airplane landed. And given that the head flight attendant and the passenger seated next to Gardner perceived that he was deeply shaken by FAM1's actions, a fact finder could conclude that FAM1 also knew that he had frightened Gardner to the point that he was shaking, sweating, and taking shallow breaths. Despite this knowledge, he waited with Gardner until the first class section had emptied. When Gardner attempted to exit the airplane, FAM1 intentionally blocked him by standing in the aisle for three minutes. During this time, FAM1 ignored Gardner's frantic requests that he move so that Gardner could get by. FAM1 then stalked Gardner through the airport in order to further intimidate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Taking these facts together, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that FAM1 should have realized that his conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing Gardner to experience emotional distress. Additionally, a factfinder could conclude that FAM1 should have realized that the distress might result in illness or bodily harm. The court, therefore, denies the United States' motion for summary judgment on Gardner's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim based upon FAM1's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2) Indirect Liability Theories\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Gardner's complaint alleges that unidentified individuals negligently inflicted emotional distress on him by breaching a \"duty to train their employees and agents about how to properly treat airline passengers.\" Gardner does not clarify precisely who was at fault for failing to properly train FAM1, how he was trained, or how he should have been trained differently. Absent this factual development, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that an unknown individual in charge of training FAM1 should have realized that his or her conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing airline passengers to experience emotional distress. Nor could a reasonable factfinder determine that this unknown individual, from facts known to him or her, should have realized that the emotional\n   distress might result in illness or bodily harm. Thus, the court grants summary judgment on Gardner's negligent training theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Gardner's complaint also alleges emotional distress caused by negligent supervision. In response to the United States' motion for summary judgment, Gardner clarifies that this claim is based upon the allegation that FAM2 failed to intervene and stop FAM1. But Gardner provides no evidence that FAM2 was FAM1's supervisor. Absent any evidence that FAM2 had a duty or the authority to supervise FAM1, Gardner cannot prevail on a negligent supervision theory of negligent infliction of emotional distress. Thus the court summarily adjudicates this claim in favor of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    B.

FAM1's conduct is dissimilar to the conduct described in cases where the Utah Supreme Court decided that the defendant clearly did not offend accepted standards of decency. Unlike rejecting a marriage proposal or firing an employee for cause, reasonable people could differ as to whether FAM1's conduct was outrageous, intolerable, and offensive to generally accepted standards of decency and morality.

It asserts that Gardner could have just pushed past FAM1 at any time. But the facts, taken in the light most favorable to Gardner's claim, do not support the United States' argument. According to Gardner's testimony, he was able to squeeze past FAM1 only when he turned sideways to look at the Delta employee behind him. It was this action that created the avenue of escape. Gardner presented evidence that FAM1, who is 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 235 pounds, effectively blocked the aisle of the airplane when he stood face to face with Gardner, leaving no reasonable avenue of escape.

The United States asserts, therefore, that FAM1's actions never caused Gardner to experience apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The court agrees that there is little evidence that Gardner ever apprehended imminent contact.

And although it is unclear whether Gardner saw FAM1 place his hand on his seatback as FAM1 was returning to his seat to sit down, the evidence indicates that Gardner did not anticipate that FAM1 would violently shake his seat. Gardner instead testified that FAM1 disguised his intent by acting if he was simply steadying himself as he moved to his seat to sit down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A factfinder, however, may infer from the evidence that Gardner apprehended that FAM1 would shove his seat when Gardner attempted to lower it for a third time. After FAM1 shoved his seat forward for a second time, Gardner and FAM1 exchanged words over the incident.

In\n    <em>\n     Hansen\n    </em>\n    , Justice Durham suggested that a plaintiff could prevail on a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim in the absence of bodily harm if the defendant's actions caused a mental illness.\n    <em>\n     Hansen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362446\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/858/970/\">\n     858 P.2d at 975\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Justice Durham opined that the mental distress must be severe to be deemed a mental illness: \"We emphasize, however, that the emotional distress suffered must be severe; it must be such that 'a reasonable [person,] normally constituted, would be unable to adequately cope with the mental stress engendered by the circumstances of the case.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362446\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/858/970/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citation omitted) (alteration in original). But the remaining justices held that there was no reason to adopt the mental illness exception to the bodily injury requirement because the plaintiffs in that case did not claim that they had suffered from a mental illness.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362446\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/858/970/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362446\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/858/970/\">\n     at 982-83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Zimmerman, J. concurring in the result). In\n    <em>\n     Harnicher\n    </em>\n    , Justices Howe and Zimmerman opined that even if the Utah Supreme Court were to adopt the mental illness exception, the plaintiffs in that case could not satisfy the elevated standard laid out in Justice Durham's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Hansen,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11692129\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/962/67/#p68\">\n     962 P.2d at 71-72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The other three justices, however, did not join this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The United States' reliance on the language from Justice Durham's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Hansen\n    </em>\n    and Justice Howe's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Harnicher\n    </em>\n    is misplaced for two reasons. First, the language quoted from these cases is not binding authority because it was never adopted by a majority of the Utah Supreme Court. Second, even if the language were binding authority, it refers to the heightened standard for proving a mental illness. This language has no application to this case because Gardner does not claim that FAM1's actions caused him to suffer a mental illness. He alleges that he suffered a bodily harm that would satisfy the Second Restatement test.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <strong>\n     III. GARDNER'S MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Gardner moves to exclude the defendants' joint expert, Dr. Moulton, under\n    Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, Gardner asserts that Dr. Moulton's opinions are not \"the product of reliable principles and methods\" because he did not examine Gardner before expressing opinions about his emotional distress, because his opinion that Gardner is malingering is improper, and because he expressed opinions about sleep apnea that are outside the scope of his expertise. See FED. R. EVID. 702(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Because the court grants summary judgment on all of Gardner's claims against Delta, the remaining claims against the United States will be tried before the court in a bench trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202402\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2402\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"[T]he usual concerns regarding unreliable expert testimony reaching a jury obviously do not arise when a district court is conducting a bench trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Attorney Gen. of Okla. v.

Therefore, \"a judge conducting a bench trial maintains greater leeway in admitting questionable evidence, weighing its persuasive value upon presentation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643055\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/769/#p779\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643055\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/769/#p779\">\n     at 780\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In this case, the court determines that the best course of action is to allow Dr. Moulton to give testimony at the bench trial. This will allow the court to better assess whether Dr. Moulton's opinions meet the Rule 702 standard. The court, therefore, denies Gardner's motion to exclude Dr. Moulton's testimony at this time. Gardner can reraise this issue at trial or move to strike his testimony after Dr. Moulton testifies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The court orders as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    (1) The court GRANTS Delta's motion for summary judgment. [Document 116].\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    (2) The court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART the United States' motion for summary judgment. [Docket 119]. The court grants summary judgment on Gardner's negligence and respondeat superior claims. The court also grants summary judgment on the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim to the extent that it is based upon negligent training or supervision. The court denies summary judgment as to the remainder of Gardner's claims against the United States.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    (3) The court DENIES without prejudice Gardner's motion to exclude expert testimony at this time. [Docket 120]. Gardner may raise his objection at trial or reassert this motion after the expert testifies.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The issues that remain for trial are Gardner's claims against the United States for (1) negligent infliction of emotional distress based upon the negligence of FAM1 (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) false imprisonment, and (4) assault.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
