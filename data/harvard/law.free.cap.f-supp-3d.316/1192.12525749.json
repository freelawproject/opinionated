(\"Employer\"), KerryAnne Anzalone (\"K. Anzalone\"), and Blase Anzalone, Jr (\"B. Anzalone\") (collectively, \"the Anzalones\") (collectively with Employer, \"Defendants\") for (1) Contributions to Employee Benefit Plans; (2) Specific Performance Compelling an Audit; (3) Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duties. Plaintiff also brought causes of action against Western National Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Western\"), Solpac Construction Inc. (\"Solpac\"), and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. (\"Liberty\") for Recovery Against License Bond (Western) and Recovery Against Payment Bond (Solpac, Liberty).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.) Defendants failed to respond to the Complaint, and the Clerk entered default on August 30, 2017 as to the Anzalones, and on September 5, 2017 as to Employer. (ECF Nos. 21, 23.) Plaintiff now moves for entry of default judgment against Defendants. (ECF No. 32.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is an administrator and agent for the collection of several employee benefit plans (\"Trust Funds\") and a fiduciary to the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Each one is an express trust, created by written agreements and qualifying as a multi-employer plan within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") \u00a7 3(37)(A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (37)(A). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) In order to work on projects for the San Diego Unified School District (\"SDUSD\"), Employer became bound by an agreement between SDUSD and San Diego Building and Construction Trades Council, and their signatory Craft Unions (one of which is Southern California District Council of Laborers and affiliated Laborers Local No. 89 (\"Union\") ) known as the \"SDUSD Project Stabilization Agreement Construction and Major Rehabilitation Funded by Proposition S\" (\"SDUSD PSA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to the SDUSD PSA, Employer is bound to the various Trust Agreements (\"the Agreements\"), which established each of the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The Agreements obliged Employer to submit monthly fringe benefit contributions (\"Monthly Contributions\") to the Trust Funds for each hour worked (or paid for) by employees performing services covered by the Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, Employer was required to submit monthly reports, detailing the name, address, social security number, and hours worked that month for each employee covered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These monthly reports were required even when there were no employees to report for the reporting period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Monthly Contributions constitute assets of the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a Trustee, it has a fiduciary duty to marshal those assets so they may be applied for the benefit of the participants and beneficiaries in accordance with the various Trust Agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the Agreements, if Employer fails to timely pay monthly fringe benefit contributions, then Employer is obligated to pay liquidated damages in the sum of $25.00 or 20% of the unpaid benefits to each of the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Employer would also be required to pay interest at the per annum rate of 5% over the rate set by the Federal Reserve Board,\n   effective on the date each contribution is due. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The Agreements provide Trust Funds with the authority to audit Employer payroll and business records, and Employer is liable for the costs of such an audit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Employer employed workers who are covered by the Agreements; however, Employer failed to pay the monthly fringe benefits to the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) It also refused to comply with an audit by the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of Employer's failure to pay the specified rates from October 2016 through January 2017, Plaintiff alleged damages of $24,630.24, consisting of $19,977.10 in unpaid Monthly Contributions, $3,995.44 in liquidated damages, and $577.70 in interest on the late and/or unpaid fringe benefits owed through June 2, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it, and its participants, have also suffered harm that is impractical to accurately quantify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) For example, it may have suffered\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he costs of collecting the Monthly Contributions from [Employer] or third parties (not including the cost of this litigation), cost of special processing to restore benefit credits because of late Monthly Contributions, the temporary loss of insurance coverage by employees (even if later restored)[,] and medical harm to participants and beneficiaries who may have foregone medical care when notified that medical insurance ceased because of their employer's failure to pay Monthly Contributions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that the purpose of the liquidated damages provisions of the Agreements was to compensate for this type of unquantifiable harm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although Plaintiff-as a Trustee-has the authority to waive part or all of the liquidated damages, it has chosen not to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Anzalones are fiduciaries and/or parties in interest to the Trust Funds under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14), 1002(21)(A), because they exercised discretionary authority or control respecting management or disposition of the Trust Funds' assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 41, 46.) Plaintiff further alleges that the Anzalones are majority shareholders and/or the beneficial owners of Employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) They acted on behalf of Employer in their dealings and relations with the Trust Funds and the Union and determined which employees and hours worked would be reported to the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-19.) Specifically, the Anzalones \"are responsible for running the day to day operations and day to day financial decisions of [Employer],\" and for \"decisions pertaining to the reporting and payment of contributions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The Anzalones \"personally maintained control of those funds which should have been turned over to the [Trust Funds].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Agreements provide that Employer is responsible for the Trust Funds' attorneys' fees related to any legal action necessary to compel an audit, and for the audit fees necessary to complete the audit of Employer's records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) The Agreements also require that Employer deduct monthly fringe benefits due to the Construction Laborers Vacation Trust Fund for Southern California (\"Vacation Fund\") from employees' weekly paychecks in the amount specified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff alleges that Employer and/or the Anzalones did not distribute the portions of the prevailing wage that Employer certified was to be paid to the Trust Funds from the employees' weekly paychecks and kept those amounts for their own use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Anzalones are responsible for preparing and issuing certified\n   payroll reports to public agencies under California Labor Code \u00a7 1776, and allege that the Anzalones had,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [D]iscretionary authority or control over sufficient, segregable funds to pay the amounts certified under penalty of perjury, that would be withheld from employees' weekly wages for contribution to the Trust Funds in order to meet prevailing wage obligations, including the authority to write checks on the accounts in which such funds were held, but instead kept them for his own use, or for the use of [Employer].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) Plaintiff alleges that Employer failed to timely account for and turn over the assets of the Trust Funds and further failed to apply such assets for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Employer instead used those assets for its own benefit, breaching its fiduciary duties to the Trust Funds within the meanings of section 404(a)(1)(A),(B),(D) or ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A),(B),(D). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff contends that the acts and omissions by Employer or the Anzalones constitute misuse, misappropriation, and/or conversion from employee benefit plans within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20664\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and breach of their fiduciary obligations within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 06. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to section 409 of ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201109\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that Employer and the Anzalones are personally liable to restore to the Trust Funds any losses to them resulting from the breach of their fiduciary duties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The monetary damages prayed for in the Complaint have been paid by third parties so the only remaining damages Plaintiff seeks against Defendants relate to attorney's fees and costs claimed in the first, second, and third Claims for Relief. (Decl. of Marsha M. Hamasaki in support of Mot. for Default Judgement and Final Order for Accounting (\"Hamasaki Decl.\") \u00b6 19, ECF No. 33.) Plaintiff now seeks to recover from both Employer and the Anzalones, jointly and severally:\n   <strong>\n    $3,813.25\n   </strong>\n   consisting of $2,043.15 in attorneys' fees; and $1,770.10 in costs. (Hamasaki Decl. \u00b6 20(B), (C).) Additionally, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), 1132(g)(2)(E), Plaintiff requests for the Court to order Employer to comply with its obligation under the CBA and ERISA to fully produce its books and records so that Plaintiff can complete an audit to determine if additional amounts are due. (Compl. \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against the Anzalones, Employer, Western, Solpac, and Liberty. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Solpac and Liberty were dismissed on June 29, 2017 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1). (ECF No. 10.) Plaintiff served the Anzalones on July 26, 2017 and Employer on July 31, 2017. (ECF Nos. 13, 14, 15.) Pursuant to a settlement agreement, Western was dismissed on August 18, 2017. (ECF No. 17.) The Anzalones and Employer failed to answer the Complaint, and the Clerk entered default against the Anzalones on August 30, 2017 and against Employer on September 5, 2017. (ECF Nos. 21, 23.) On September 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Order for Accounting, and the Court granted the motion on September 26, 2017, requiring Employer to submit to an audit of its books and records for the purpose of ascertaining the contributions due to the Plaintiff. (ECF Nos. 25, 29.) Plaintiff now moves for default judgement against Employer and the Anzalones. (ECF No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before a court can enter a default judgment against a defendant, a plaintiff must satisfy the procedural requirements for default judgment set forth in\n   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(c) and 55(a), as well as Local Rule 55-1. Local Rule 55-1 requires that the movant submit a declaration establishing: (1) when and against whom default was entered; (2) identification of the pleading entering default; (3) whether the defaulting party is a minor, incompetent person, or active service member; and (4) that the defaulting party was properly served with notice.\n   <em>\n    Vogel v.

Cal. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) authorizes district courts discretion to grant default judgment after the Clerk enters default under Rule 55(a).\n   <em>\n    Aldabe v.

When moving for a default judgment, the well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, with the exception that allegations as to the amount of damages must be proved.\n   <em>\n    Televideo Sys., Inc. v. Heidenthal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741410\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/915/#p917\">\n    826 F.2d 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 917-19 (9th Cir. 1987) (per curiam);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c) (\"[A] default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In exercising its discretion, the Court considers the\n   <em>\n    Eitel\n   </em>\n   factors: (1) the possibility of prejudice to plaintiff; (2) the merits of plaintiff's substantive claim; (3) the sufficiency of the complaint; (4) the sum of money at stake; (5) the possibility of a dispute concerning material facts; (6) whether defendant's default was due to excusable neglect; and (7) the strong policy underlying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure favoring decisions on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Eitel v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff has satisfied the procedural requirements for the entry of a default judgment against Defendants. The Clerk entered defaults against The Anzalones on August 30 and against Employer on September 5, 2017. (ECF Nos. 21, 23.) Plaintiff's counsel has declared that: (1) Defendants are not infants or incompetent persons; (2) Defendants are not covered under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and (3) Defendants were served with the Motion for Default Judgment. (Hamasaki Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 18.) Plaintiff has therefore complied with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(c) and 55, as well as Local Rule 55-1. In addition, the circumstances support entry of default judgment against Defendants in the amount Plaintiff requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Eitel\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Eitel\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of entering a default judgment. The Court will discuss each factor in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff Would Suffer Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Eitel\n   </em>\n   factor asks whether the plaintiff will suffer prejudice if a default judgment is not entered.\n   <em>\n    PepsiCo, Inc. v. Cal. Sec. Cans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9338461\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/238/1172/#p1177\">\n    238 F.Supp.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 (C.D. Cal. 2002). Defendants have failed to participate in this action, and without a default judgment, Plaintiff will have no other recourse for recovery. (ECF Nos. 21, 23.) Therefore, this factor favors entry of default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Merits of Plaintiff's Claim and, Sufficiency of Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second and third Eitel factors together \"require that a plaintiff 'state a claim on which [it] may recover.' \"\n   <em>\n    PepsiCo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9338461\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/238/1172/#p1177\">\n    238 F.Supp.2d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Complaint, Plaintiff asserted three claims for relief against Defendants: (1) Failure by Employer to contribute to Trust Funds per Agreements and ERISA, (2) Joint and Several Liability for Damages for Breach\n   of Fiduciary Duties in Violation of ERISA by Employer and Anzalones, and (3) Specific Performance compelling audit of Employer's books.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) The Trust Agreements require Employer to pay contributions to the Trust Funds for each hour worked by or paid to Employer's labor employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff alleges that Employer employed workers who performed services covered by the agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Therefore, Employer was required under ERISA to make the contributions to the Trust Funds as stipulated by the Agreements, which Defendants did not do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff thus properly alleged a meritorious claim against Employer under \u00a7 1132(d)(1) for violations of ERISA and the Agreements. Employer, by its default, admits liability for the claims asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Complaint also alleges that the Anzalones fall within the definition of fiduciary because as agents, managing officers, directors, managing employees, and/or beneficial owners of Employer they exercised discretionary authority or control in the management or disposition of the assets of the Trust Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.)

Plaintiff alleges however that the combined rate for wages and benefits for October 2016 totaled $46.69, a difference of $13.41, showing that the Anzalones failed to pay the proper rate directly to the employees, and also did not contribute those benefits to the Trust Funds.

The Court has previously recognized Plaintiff's right to an audit of Employer's records and entered an Interlocutory Order for Accounting on September 26, 2017. (ECF No. 29.) Moreover, the Trust Agreements require Employer to submit to an audit. (Higa Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, Exs. 3, 4, 6.) Further, based on Plaintiff's uncontested allegations, Plaintiff has pleaded a sufficiently meritorious claim, and the Court deems specific performance compelling audit an appropriate equitable relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As Plaintiff sufficiently stated three claims on which it could recover, the second and third\n   <em>\n    Eitel\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of entering default judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

As Plaintiffs have been able to recover the money owed to the Trust Funds from third parties, all they are requesting here are attorney's fees and costs, totaling $3,813.25. (Hamasaki Decl. \u00b6 21.) The awarding of attorney's fees and costs is mandatory following a finding of an ERISA violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2). The amount of attorney's fees was calculated using the schedule set forth Local Rule 55-3.

As discussed, Plaintiff has adequately alleged the facts necessary to establish the claims in its Complaint, and Defendants have not challenged the validity of Plaintiff's allegations.

Defendants were also served with the present motion on March 30, 2018. (ECF No. 37.) Furthermore Plaintiff's attorney communicated with an attorney for the Defendants multiple times in September 2017. (Hamasaki Decl. \u00b6 10.) Despite this Defendants failed to participate in this litigation in any meaningful way, and there is no evidence that Defendants' default was the result of excusable neglect. Accordingly, the sixth\n   <em>\n    Eitel\n   </em>\n   factor favors entry of default judgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

Under the Local Rules for this district, attorneys' fees awarded upon default judgment are generally calculated according to a fee schedule based upon the amount of judgement awarded. C.D. Cal. L.R. 55-3. Because Plaintiff recovered the principal amounts prayed for in the Complaint from third parties they are no longer asking the Court for a monetary judgement, and so would be entitled to $0 in attorney's fees. Plaintiff is therefore asking for fees in excess of the schedule, and may do so provided they \"file a written request at the time of entry of the default judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court \"shall hear the request and render judgment for such fees as the Court may deem reasonable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff is asking for an award of attorney's fees calculated off of the Local Rule 55-3 schedule, based on the amount originally prayed for in the complaint. (Hamasaki Decl. \u00b6 20(B).) The amount originally prayed for was $24,052.54. (Compl. \u00b6 29.) According to Local Rule 55-3, a judgement of this amount would entitle Plaintiff to attorney's fees of $1200 plus 6% of the amount over $10,000.00. C.D. Cal. L.R. 55-3. This results in an award of $2,043.15 for Plaintiff (6% of the amount over $10,000.00 ($1,4052.54) equals $843.15, plus $1,200.00). This amount is only in excess of the Local Rule schedule because Plaintiff was forced to recover the original amount from third parties due to Defendants delays and refusal to cooperate with the audit of Employer's records. Therefore the Court deems that an award of attorney's fees calculated off of the Local Rule schedule for the award originally prayed for is reasonable, and awards Plaintiffs $2,043.15 in attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Here, Plaintiff's fees for filing, service of process and document production are reasonable and recoverable, thus the Plaintiff may file a Notice of Application to the Clerk to Tax Costs within 14 days of the Court entering judgment.

Final Order of Accounting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court has already recognized Plaintiff's right to an audit of Employer's records and previously entered an Interlocutory Order for Accounting on September 26, 2017. (ECF No. 29.) Moreover, the Trust Agreements require Employer to submit to an audit. (Higa Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) The Court deems specific performance compelling audit an appropriate equitable relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2)(E). Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a final order for accounting and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants to submit to an audit of Employer's payroll and business records as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    The following documents relating to Defendant's work on all projects for the SDUSD covered by the SDUSD PSA\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (1) All payroll and employee documents including, but not limited to, Employer's payroll journals, employees' earning records, certified payrolls, payroll check books and stubs, canceled payroll checks, payroll time cards, state and federal payroll tax returns, labor distribution journals, any other documents reflecting the number of hours which Employer's employees worked, their names, social\n   security numbers, addresses, job classifications and the projects on which the employees performed their work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (2) All Employer's job files relating to its work including all documents, agreements, and contracts between Employer, and the general contractor, or any subcontractor, the daily work logs, supervisor's diaries or notes, employees' diaries, memoranda, releases and any other documents which related to the supervision of Employer's employees on all SDUSD PSA projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (3) All Employer's documents related to cash receipts, including but not limited to, the cash receipts journals, accounts receivable journal, accounts receivable subsidiary ledgers and billing invoices for Employer's work on SDUSD PSA projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (4) All Employer's bank statements for all checking, savings and investment accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (5) All Employer's documents related to cash disbursements, including but not limited to, vendors' invoices, cash disbursement journal, accounts payable journals, check registers, cancelled checks and all other documents which indicate cash disbursements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (6) All Monthly Report Forms submitted by Employer to any union trust fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (7) Documents, records, or other writings pertaining to and including the checks/payments issued to any person, company and/or subcontractor relating to work performed on Employer's construction projects, including but not limited to day laborers, or other non-union workers hired to work on Employer's project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Entry of Final Default Judgment. (ECF No. 32.) Additionally, the Court finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to a Final Order for Accounting and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants to submit to an audit of Employer's payroll and business records, as outlined above. Defendants, jointly and severally, shall pay Plaintiff the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    $3,813.25\n   </strong>\n   against Anzalone Masonry, Inc., consisting of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   ? $2,043.15 in attorneys' fees; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   ? $1,770.10 in costs\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    $3,813.25\n   </strong>\n   against KerryAnne Anzalone, and Blase Anzalone, Jr., consisting of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   ? $2,043.15 in attorneys' fees; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   ? $1,770.10 in costs\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court will issue judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The claims against Western, Solpac, and Liberty were previously dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement and Fed.
