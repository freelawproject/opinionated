The Court has reinstated Marketquest and BIC Corp.'s cross-motions for summary judgment filed in\n   2014, the merits of which the Court has not previously reached. Marketquest seeks partial summary judgment on all of Defendants' thirteen counterclaims and twelve of Defendants' twenty-two affirmative defenses. (ECF No. 205.) BIC Corp. has opposed the motion. (ECF No. 254.) BIC Corp. has cross-moved for partial summary judgment on five counterclaims, which Marketquest has opposed. (ECF Nos. 216-1, 259.) The Court has also reinstated Defendants BIC USA, Inc. (\"BIC USA\") and Norwood Promotional Products LLC's (\"Norwood\") motions for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's damages, which Marketquest has opposed. (ECF Nos. 214, 215, 258.) The reinstated motions and opposing papers, the record submitted, and the parties' evidentiary objections number several thousand pages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the reasons herein, the Court: (1) grants in part and denies in part Marketquest's motion; (2) denies BIC Corp.'s motion in full; and (3) grants in part and denies in part BIC USA and Norwood's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties and the Promotional Products Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The acts of alleged trademark infringement in this case arise in the context of the promotional products industry. A promotional product is a product used by a company to brand itself with its customers. (ECF No. 205-8 Decl. of Harris Cohen (\"Cohen Decl.\") \u00b6 16.) The industry supports the manufacture, imprinting, and distribution of promotional products to companies seeking to brand themselves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In this context, a distributor approaches a supplier which either manufactures or imports a promotional product and then imprints the company's brand and messaging on the product. The end company then gives the product away as part of a promotion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, Ex. I.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Marketquest, doing business as \"All in One,\" is a San Diego, California-based local supplier of promotional products, including pens, writing instruments and magnets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-12.) At issue in this case are Plaintiff's federally registered All in One and THE WRITE CHOICE trademarks. Marketquest's All in One marks, primarily for \"writing instruments, namely pens,\" include: (1) the word mark \"ALL-IN-ONE\",\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%202%2C422%2C976\">\n    Registration No. 2,422,976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 23, 2001) ('976 Registration); (2) the word mark \"ALL-IN-ONE LINE,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%202%2C426%2C417\">\n    Registration No. 2,426,417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 6, 2001) ('417 Registration); (3) the design mark \"ALL IN ONE,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C153%2C089\">\n    Registration No. 3,153,089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 10, 2006) ('089 Registration)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (a registration\n   which also covers services of \"dissemination of advertising matter\"); and (4) the design service mark \"ALL IN ONE,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C718%2C333\">\n    Registration No. 3,718,333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dec. 1, 2009) ('333 Registration)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , specifically for services including \"customized printing of equipment, merchandise and accessories for business promotion.\" (ECF No. 205-2, Request for Judicial Notice (\"RFJN\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 5, Exs. A-C, E.) Plaintiff also sues for alleged infringement of the word mark for goods \"THE WRITE CHOICE,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%203%2C164%2C707\">\n    Registration No. 3,164,707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 31, 2006) ('707 Registration). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4, Ex. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Defendant Norwood is one of the largest non-apparel promotional products suppliers in the industry. (ECF No. 205-22, Decl. of Michael Lane (\"Lane Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, Exs. J, K.) Plaintiff claims that Norwood has reached this size by acquiring and aggregating smaller suppliers, like Plaintiff, and retaining their trademarks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Exs. F.2, I.2.) BIC Corp. and BIC USA acquired Norwood in 2009 at a bankruptcy auction. (ECF No. 214-2, Decl. of Lori Bauer (\"Bauer Decl.\") \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Alleged Infringement of the Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff alleges Defendants used its \"All in One\" marks in their 2011 catalogue. (ECF No. 227-5, Lane Decl. \u00b6 32, Exs. Y, Z.) Plaintiff claims Defendants placed the mark on the cover of the catalog in the same location where Norwood placed its \"sub brands\" on the cover of its 2010 catalog, which Plaintiff contends implied that Defendants had acquired Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, Exs. S, N, O, P, Q.) Defendants contend that the phrase \"All in One catalogue\" signified that Defendants had merged multiple catalogues into one. (ECF No. 214-2, Bauer Decl. \u00b6 6.) Defendants also distributed promotional materials that featured an image of this 2011 catalogue, and directed customers to look for products or information in the \"2011 Norwood All in One catalogue.\" (ECF No. 227-5, Lane Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-38, Exs. X, Y, Y.2, AC, AD, AE, AF.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants distributed an on-line advertisement that said \"Put Your Drinkware Needs...in a Norwood All in One basket,\" which included a photo of a basket containing several types of drinkware. (Lane Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. C.2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges Defendants used \"the Write Pen Choice\" to promote the\n   30th anniversary of the BIC Round Stic pen. (First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") \u00b6 23; ECF No. 227-5, Lane Decl. \u00b6 43, Ex. K.3.) Plaintiff claims that this infringed the \"THE WRITE CHOICE\" mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Pre-Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 28, 2011, Marketquest brought suit against BIC Corp., BIC USA, and Norwood, alleging that (1) Defendants infringed the All in One marks in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) Defendants' conduct with respect to the All in One marks constituted unfair competition in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (3) Defendants infringed THE WRITE CHOICE mark in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (4) Defendants' conduct with respect to THE WRITE CHOICE mark constituted unfair competition in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (5) Defendants' conduct violated the California Unfair Competition Law, CAL. BUS. &amp; PROF. CODE \u00a7 17200,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and (6) Defendants were unjustly enriched. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff filed the FAC on May 5, 2011, alleging these same claims. (ECF No. 14.) On May 13, 2011, Defendants filed their Answer, raising thirteen counterclaims, broadly grouped into fraud, abandonment, and mere descriptiveness and ornamentality. (ECF No. 17.) Defendants also asserted some twenty-two affirmative defenses, including fair use, defenses related to the counterclaims, and multiple equitable defenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In August 2011, Marketquest moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from continuing their alleged infringement of the marks. (ECF No. 27.) Judge Sammartino, then presiding over this case, denied Plaintiff's motion on November 7, 2011. (ECF No. 41.) Judge Sammartino determined that Plaintiff was likely to show it has valid, protectable All In One marks, and rejected Defendants' defenses of fraud and abandonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9.) Although Judge Sammartino determined that there was \"some likelihood of confusion\" based on the eight likelihood of confusion factors elaborated in\n   <em>\n    AMF, Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"489285\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/599/341/#p348\">\n    599 F.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979), she also determined that Defendants were likely to succeed on a fair use defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-23.) Marketquest did not appeal the denial of the preliminary injunction motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Roughly three years later, after numerous discovery disputes among the parties requiring Court intervention on eighteen occasions (ECF No. 175), the case entered the summary judgment stage on October 27, 2014 when Marketquest filed its motion for partial summary judgment on Defendants' counterclaims and certain affirmative defenses. (ECF No. 205). BIC Corp. filed its motion for partial summary judgment on Defendants' fraud and abandonment counterclaims. (ECF No. 216-1.) BIC USA and Norwood each filed motions for summary judgment on the fair use defense and Marketquest's damages. (ECF Nos. 214, 215.) After submission of extensive briefing and a swelling record, the Court held oral argument on the parties' motions on February 9, 2015. (ECF No. 323, 324.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On April 17, 2015, the Court granted Defendants Norwood and BIC USA's motions on fair use. (ECF No. 327.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a\n   result of that decision, the Court denied Defendant BIC Corp.'s cross-motion (ECF No. 216-1) and dismissed Defendants' counter-claims (ECF No. 17). The Court terminated as moot Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment (ECF No. 205), Defendants' motion for sanctions (ECF No. 289) and several motions seeking to exclude testimony of experts and certain witnesses. (ECF Nos. 199, 217, 218, 219). Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants and the FAC was dismissed. (ECF No. 328.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Appeal and Post-Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff appealed this Court's summary judgment decision in favor of Defendants on May 15, 2015. (ECF No. 339.) Over two years later, the Ninth Circuit issued its mandate (the \"Mandate\") reversing this Court's order. (ECF No. 377.) With respect to the All in One marks, the Ninth Circuit determined that genuine issues of fact exist as to all elements of the fair use defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17.) The Ninth Circuit, however, left open to this Court to determine on remand the relevance of the degree of consumer confusion in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) As to THE WRITE CHOICE mark, the Ninth Circuit determined that this Court erred by applying the fair use analysis to Defendants' use when it had also found that \"there was no evidence of actual or potential confusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Ninth Circuit observed that \" '[t]he fair use defense only comes into play once the party alleging infringement has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that confusion is likely.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957275\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/596/#p608\">\n    408 F.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608-09 (9th Cir. 2005).) The Ninth Circuit remanded for this Court \"to consider Marketquest's trademark infringement claim regarding Defendants' use of the 'The Write Choice.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In view of the Mandate and after requesting the parties' positions regarding how the case should proceed (ECF Nos. 383, 386, 388, 390, 391), the Court reinstated the FAC, Defendants' counterclaims, and the motions at issue in this Order. (ECF No. 400.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Issues for Resolution Here\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With the procedural posture of the case set, the Court briefly outlines the issues for resolution in this Order. Marketquest and BIC Corp. both seek partial summary judgment with respect to Defendants' (1) Affirmative Defense 15 and Counterclaims 4, 8, 10, and 12 regarding fraudulent procurement of the marks, and (2) Affirmative Defense 16 and Counterclaims 3, 7, 9, and 11 regarding abandonment of the marks. Marketquest further seeks partial summary\n   judgment on (1) Counts 1 and 3 (trademark infringement claims) of the FAC with respect to whether Marketquest has valid and protectable marks; (2) Affirmative Defense 21 and Counterclaims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 13 regarding mere descriptiveness and ornamentality of certain marks; and (3) Affirmative Defenses 2 (acquiescence), 6 (laches), 7 (waiver), 8 (estoppel), 9 (unclean hands), 10 (statute of limitations), 11 (general invalidity defense), 17 (trademark misuse), and 20 (nominative fair use). BIC USA and Norwood seek summary judgment on Plaintiff's damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to these issues, the Court addresses the issue of likelihood of confusion regarding THE WRITE CHOICE mark, as instructed by the Mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Requests for Judicial Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Marketquest submits two requests for judicial notice. The first request seeks judicial notice of a certified copy of each mark's registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\"). (ECF No. 205-2 Exs. A-E.) The second request seeks judicial notice of a certified copy of each registration file wrapper for the marks, which includes information regarding the initial application for the marks, correspondence with the PTO, and related registration documents.

Marketquest also moves for summary judgment on Defendants' Affirmative Defense 21 and Counterclaims 1, 2, 5, 6, and 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-20.) Defendants assert that certain marks are invalid because they are \"merely descriptive\" and/or \"merely ornamental.\" (ECF No. 17.) Defendants' counterclaims thus intersect with the fundamental question of the protectability of Marketquest's marks. Because the claims and counterclaims intersect in this manner, the Court will consider them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The fundamental starting point of whether Plaintiff has valid and protectable marks is the nature of a trademark.

(ECF No. 205-1 at 15.) At the preliminary injunction stage, Judge Sammartino \"agree[d] with Marketquest that ALL-IN-ONE is at least a suggestive mark because it requires a mental leap from the mark to the product, and as a registered trademark it is inherently distinctive.\" (ECF No. 41 at 11 (internal quotations omitted).) In reaching this conclusion, however, the decision first determined that the needs aspect was \"plainly quite low\" because the phrase is not needed to describe a company that sells customizable business promotion merchandise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The decision determined that \"[c]orrespondingly, the mark's imagination aspect is high.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While recognizing that \"the phrase 'all in one' comes closest to describing the 'one-stop source' aspect of Marketquest's service,\" the decision reasoned that \"it does not explain how the phrase in any way describes customizable business promotion merchandise, which is in essence the heart of Marketquest's service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Marketquest contends that a different determination by this Court now would \"reverse\" the preliminary injunction ruling. (ECF No. 275 at 17.) The Court rejects Marketquest's argument for two postural reasons. First, a preliminary injunction ruling is premised on an inherently limited record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v.

Defendants raise arguments and evidence here that were not presented during the preliminary injunction stage.

Thus, the preliminary injunction order is not binding here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition to these postural reasons, the Court respectfully departs from the reasoning in the preliminary injunction order because relevant distinctions have come into play at this stage of the proceedings in which the ultimate merits are very much at issue. The preliminary injunction order treated Marketquest's All in One marks for goods and services together, blurring the line between the specific products named in the All in One mark registrations for goods with those for services. But as the Court has noted, a mark is assessed with particular \"reference to\n   <em>\n    the goods or services\n   </em>\n   that it identifies,\"\n   <em>\n    Entrepreneur Media, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398690\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1135/#p1142\">\n    279 F.3d at 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). A mark may be descriptive as to one but not as to the other, a point Marketquest expressly recognizes by arguing against descriptiveness of the All in One marks for goods\n   <em>\n    separately\n   </em>\n   from that for services. (\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 205-1 at 13-14 (goods)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   14-17 (services).) Whereas the Court agrees that the phrase \"all in one\" is not descriptive as applied to goods classes, the Court cannot say the same with respect to Marketquest's service marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Turning to the imagination test here, Defendants argue that the All in One mark merely describes an aspect of Marketquest's services.

Defendants argue that one does not have to take a mental leap from the mark to Marketquest's services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Given the absence of a comprehensive consumer survey in the record, the Court cannot say as a matter of law that the relevant purchasing public of Marketquest's services-distributors who engage on behalf of end companies-would or would not find that All in One \"describes\n   <em>\n    some aspect\n   </em>\n   of the\" service.\n   <em>\n    Fortune Dynamic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774972\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/1025/#p1033\">\n    618 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Zobmondo Entm't, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920842\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1108/#p1113\">\n    602 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (absence of survey precluded court from deciding how consumers would understand the mark \"Would you rather...?\"). In addition to enumerated goods classes, the '089 registration includes \"dissemination of advertising matter,\" as a service for which the All in One mark is registered. (ECF No. 205-5 RFJN Ex. C.) The '333 registration applies to \"customized imprinting of equipment, merchandise and accessories for business promotion.\" (205-7 RFJN Ex. E.) A reasonable jury focusing on the items aspect of the dictionary definition might conclude that Marketquest's services are descriptive because the services combine multiple items, such as pens, magnets, key chains, and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, Marketquest argues that the imagination\n   aspects are \"high\" because \"nothing in the phrase ALL IN ONE immediately conveys knowledge to a consumer that [Marketquest] offers customized imprinting services on the business promotion products it sells to distributors.\" (ECF No. 205-1 at 16.)

(ECF No. 310 at 17; ECF No. 254-4 Ex. 24, 24a.) On this point, Defendants' expert, Wingfield Hughes, states that sales representatives in the promotional products industry use the phrase to describe the assortment of their products.

In contrast, Defendants provide the deposition testimony of their expert, Wingfield Hughes, whose company was a customer of Marketquest but who could not recall Marketquest when referred to as \"All in One.\" In his role as an expert, Hughes further opines that suppliers and distributors within the promotional products industry would think of \"all in one\" as a descriptive\n   expression. (ECF No. 310-4 Ex. 23 at 4.) This evidence thus controverts deposition testimony Marketquest offers from other distributor-customers.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.)

Such evidence thus controverts Marketquest's claim of exclusive use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Lastly, Defendants also question Marketquest's advertising expenditures.

These marks include the incontestable '967 and '417 registrations and the '089 registration, which the Court finds to be functionally incontestable solely as to goods classes.

First, Defendants contend that such treatment is unavailable when the marks were never properly used in commerce. (ECF No. 254 at 13-14.) As set forth in the Court's analysis of Defendants' abandonment counterclaims herein, Defendants' argument that Marketquest has never properly used the marks in commerce fails as a matter of law. Thus, this reason carries no weight here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants further contend that the PTO does not permit an applicant to \"bootstrap\" incontestability from a prior registration when seeking an additional registration, pointing to a several regulations which they contend say nothing about \"such bootstrapping.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) In support of this argument, Defendants point to\n   <em>\n    In re Merrill Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747779\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1567/#p1568\">\n    828 F.2d 1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1987), in which the Federal Circuit determined that a prior incontestable registration did not entitle a registrant to seek registration of the same mark for services broader than those covered by the incontestable registration. Defendants' argument confuses the issue here, which is not about what requirements a registrant must satisfy to register a given mark with the PTO, but about whether it makes any practical sense to challenge a mark on \"merely descriptive\" grounds when other iterations of the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   salient feature of the marks for the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   goods cannot be so challenged. Here, the Court finds that doing so would be nothing more than an \"idle\" act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The most salient feature of the '967, '417, and '089 registrations is the \"All in One\" phrase. A review of the certificates for the All in One '967 and '417 registrations shows that these incontestable registrations cover the same goods set forth in the goods classes of the '089 registration. (ECF No. 205 RFJN Exs. A-C.) Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to Marketquest on Counterclaim 5 as it pertains to goods classes in the '089 registration and on Counterclaim 6 in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further, the Court grants partial summary judgment to Marketquest on Count 1 of the FAC as it pertains to the validity and protectability of the All in One mark '089 registration as to goods classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Write Choice Mark ('707 Registration)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In Affirmative Defense 21 and Counterclaims 1 and 2, Defendants allege that THE WRITE CHOICE mark is merely descriptive with no secondary meaning and its use is merely ornamental. (ECF No. 17 at 10-11.) Marketquest moves for summary judgment on the ground that Defendants have no evidence that the mark is merely descriptive or merely ornamental and that it lacks secondary meaning. (ECF No. 205-1 at 17-18.) The Court finds that a triable issue remains regarding whether the mark has acquired secondary meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   THE WRITE CHOICE mark is subject to a particular type of presumption given that the PTO required Marketquest to show that it acquired distinctiveness. (ECF No. 258-5 Supp. RFJN Ex. I (file wrapper for '707 registration).) When the PTO determines that a mark is descriptive, Section 1052(f) of the Lanham Act permits a party to register the mark if it has acquired distinctiveness through five years of continuous and exclusive.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201052\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). When a mark is registered under this provision, there are two implications relevant to the Court's analysis here. First, such a registration \"assumes that the mark has been shown or conceded to be merely descriptive.\"\n   <em>\n    Yamaha Int'l Corp. v.

(ECF No. 205-1 at 19.) The Court is not persuaded. \"Fanciful marks consist of coined phrases that also have no commonly known connection with the product at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surfvivor Media, Inc. v.

Coined phrases may be considered a fanciful mark entitled to the highest degree of trademark protection, but \"the mere fact that a mark consists of a coined term does not automatically render that mark fanciful.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1095750\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/406/625/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 632 ;\n   <em>\n    Interstellar Starship Servs. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11548570\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/184/1107/#p1109\">\n    184 F.3d at 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that the coined phrase \"EPIX\" for electronic pictures should not automatically be considered an arbitrary or fanciful mark). Here, even if the Court accepts that Marketquest coined \"THE WRITE CHOICE,\" the Court finds that that Marketquest has not overcome the presumption that it is descriptive. Marketquest recognizes that the phrase has a \"descriptive primary meaning.\" (ECF No. 205-1 at 19.) Indeed, the phrase, as it appears in written form, is descriptive in view of its association with \"writing instruments, namely pens.\" (ECF No. 205-6 RFJN Ex. D.) The use of the word \"write\" is immediately descriptive of the mark's association with writing instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In turn, Defendants' argument that the phrase is laudatory is persuasive when the phrase is taken in its auditory form. A self-laudatory term that \"extol[s] some feature of attribute of the goods or services\" \"fall[s] into the descriptive category.\" 2 J. THOMAS MCCARTHY , MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS &amp; UNFAIR COMPETITION \u00a7 11:17 (5th ed. 2018). Trademark law treats laudatory marks as descriptive because \"they simply describe the characteristics or quality of the goods in a condensed form.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Nett Designs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11172488\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1339/#p1341\">\n    236 F.3d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1341 (Fed.

Evidence submitted by Plaintiff's deponents recognizes this \"playoff\" on the term \"write.\" (ECF No. 205-27 Ex. C at 119:16-17.) Although Marketquest has altered how the mark appears in writing, its auditory meaning is necessarily of a laudatory nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That THE WRITE CHOICE is descriptive, however, does not end the issue of whether it is protectable.

However, certain arguments and evidence presented with the briefing permits the Court to undertake the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   analysis now. The Court is additionally aided by certain analysis in the preliminary injunction order's\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   analysis of the All in One marks, which would apply equally to THE WRITE CHOICE mark. In addition, Marketquest has briefed the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors in the joint status report submitted by the parties on remand. (ECF No. 388 at 6-7.) That briefing concedes that \"the jury must decide whether a likelihood of confusion exists at to 'THE WRITE CHOICE.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) With Marketquest's concession in mind, the Court agrees that the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors, when applied to the evidence in the record, show that there are triable factual issues regarding the likelihood\n   of confusion concerning THE WRITE CHOICE mark.

In contrast, Marketquest asserts that Defendants intended to adopt Marketquest's marks because they were aware of the mark's existence, yet still chose to use both marks at the same time. (ECF No. 258-1 at 3-4.) Marketquest has never pointed to any particularized evidence regarding Defendants' knowledge of THE WRITE CHOICE mark.

Although Defendants point to Cohen's February 2012 deposition testimony that he could not recall submitting the declarations (ECF No. 310-1 Amato Decl.

In the absence of any evidentiary basis beyond Defendants' bare allegations of fraud in the Answer and Defendants' apparent abandonment of such allegations here, Plaintiff's registered marks remain entitled to the presumption of the validity, insofar as the fraud charges are concerned.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201057\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; 1115(a).

Both parties seek summary judgment on abandonment and the bulk of the cross-motions are directed to this issue. (ECF No. 205-1 at 11-13; ECF No. 216-1 at 1-22.) BIC Corp. methodically argues that each of Marketquest's identifiable uses of the marks did not constitute use in commerce at the time the registrations were filed, nor for the three-year period preceding its cross-motion for summary judgment. Dressing its challenge in the label of abandonment, BIC Corp. also asserts that Marketquest's mark registrations for goods are void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because the applications for the marks were not supported by specimens showing actual use of the goods in commerce. (ECF No. 216-1 at 3, 7, 21-22.) Marketquest argues that each use identified by BIC Corp. constitutes a use in commerce under the law and, therefore, it did not abandon the marks and the corresponding registrations are not void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . The Court finds that Marketquest is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Section 1127 of the Lanham Act deems a mark to be abandoned when: (1) \"its use has been discontinued with the intent not to resume such use\" or (2) \"any course of conduct of the owner, including acts of omission as well as commission, causes the mark to become the generic name for the goods or services or in connection with which it is used to otherwise to lose its significance as a mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201127\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants' challenge is nominally premised on the notion that Marketquest's samples do not contain its own marks and are not resold by distributor-customers to end users. Defendants' own factual concessions, however, are at odds with their argument. As to Marketquest's purported failure to place its marks on samples, Defendants concede that Marketquest printed 51,330 promotional product samples in 2010, which in Defendants' words, \"likely had some form of a Marketquest mark.\" (ECF No. 216-1 at 18; ECF No. 216-29 Ex. 26 (record of Marketquest's 2010 samples distribution).) The record corroborates this. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 227-58 Ex. BE.)

Because Marketquest is a supplier, the relevant focus for the use in commerce requirement is on its sales to distributors, not end users who purchase from those distributors. Defendants treat the number of samples distributed in 2010 as part of Marketquest's overall sales in 2010. (ECF No. 216-1 at 18-20.)

Defendants provide no evidence disputing that such transportation is sufficiently public and the Court finds no basis to conclude otherwise.

First, Marketquest's declarations of use and/or excusable non-use of marks in commerce submitted to the PTO in connection with THE WRITE CHOICE and All in One marks show the marks associated with the goods for trade show booths as point-of-sale locations. (ECF No. 216-14 Ex. 12 ('089 registration), ECF No. 216-18 Ex. 16 ('707 registration), ECF No. 216-23 Ex. 21 ('707 registration substitute specimen.) Each application provides photographs of the booths and declares that the booths are point-of-sale presentations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A registrant's application showing use of the specimens in a trade show booth and declaration explaining the circumstances of that use is sufficient to show that the \"applicant's use is a 'display associated' with the goods.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Shipley Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 230 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) at 694. Defendants do not contend that these declarations were fraudulent and there is no basis for this Court to look beyond them now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Second, Defendants' contention runs counter to their burden to \"strictly prove\" abandonment. It is not Marketquest's burden to disprove allegations of abandonment that lack an evidentiary basis. All Defendants provide this Court to meet their burden is speculation that \"it is highly unlikely that any actual sales of products...were made from the booths.\" (ECF No. 216-1 at 15.) This speculative assertion, uncorroborated by evidence, cannot meet their burden now or at trial. In contrast, Marketquest has submitted evidence showing that its sales representatives attend the trade shows and Marketquest conducts sales transactions at the booths. (ECF No. 205-19 Ex. C.9 (photographs of trade show booths with samples of products for sale); ECF No. 258-7 Cohen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.) Based on the undisputed evidence, the Court concludes that Marketquest's trade show booth displays, which associate the marks with the relevant goods, constitute point-of-sale displays that qualify as use in commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Catalog Uses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Defendants challenge Marketquest's use of the marks in its catalogs. Defendants concede that \"[a]t various times Marketquest has displayed all five marks in its printed catalogs...\" (ECF No. 216-1 at 12.) Yet Defendants contend these uses are insufficient because the catalogs lack direct order forms. (ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   279 at 7-8.) The Court rejects Defendants' challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Catalog uses of a mark can qualify as use in commerce for goods if the catalog includes \"a prominent display of the alleged mark with the product\" and is \"point of sale [in] nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Lands' End, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3771304\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/797/511/#p513\">\n    797 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   514 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menashe v.

In particular, the record shows that All in One and THE WRITE CHOICE marks appear on the same page as the products with which they are associated in the mark registrations. (ECF No. 205-12 Ex. C.2; ECF No. 216-3 Ex. 1; ECF No 254 Ex. 27.) Contrary to Defendants' assertion that a catalog must provide a \"direct order\" format, all that is required is adequate information for placing orders for the goods. Adequacy is measured based on \"whether the purported point-of-sale display provides the potential purchaser with the information normally associated with ordering products of that kind.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Anpath Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 95 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) at 1381. As Defendants recognize (ECF No. 216-1 at 13), the catalogs expressly direct consumers to \"contact your distributor\" to place an order. (ECF No. 216-3 Ex. 1, ECF No. 216-4 Ex. 2;\n   <em>\n    see also e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 205-12 C.2 at MQ.02615, MQ.02714, MQ.02814; ECF No 254 Ex. 27.) While Defendants fault Marketquest for the absence of an order form with the catalog, Marketquest provides uncontroverted evidence regarding how promotional products are ordered: the nature of the promotional products industry supply chain in which distributors order from suppliers, like Marketquest, and in turn sell to end purchasers. (ECF No. 258-7 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 259 at 15 n.15.) Defendants' own expert, H. Wingfield Hughes, testified as to this relationship between suppliers, distributors, and end-consumers in the industry, expressly observing that \"it is not the norm for a supplier to sell directly to an end user.\" (ECF No. 205-45 Ex. I.3 at 86:9-18; 89:16-17.) Given the undisputed facts and in view of the applicable standard, the Court finds that Marketquest's catalog uses are sufficient to defeat Defendants' abandonment counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Website Uses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Defendants concede that \"Marketquest uses the 'All-in-One' and 'The Write Choice' marks on its website,\" but contends that these uses are insufficient because Marketquest \"does not offer any 'All-in-One' or 'The Write Choice'-branded products carrying those marks.\" (ECF No. 216-1 at 11.)

Here, Marketquest's website uses of the marks display the All in One marks and THE WRITE CHOICE prominently near the goods for which the marks are registered. (ECF No. 216-21 Ex. 19.) Thus, Marketquest's website uses of the marks satisfy this requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In addition to associating a mark with the goods, a website must provide information necessary to order the goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dell Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201725\">\n    71 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1727 (T.T.A.B. 2004) ; T.M.E.P. \u00a7 904.03(i). Defendants argue that Marketquest's website uses fail this requirement because there is no virtual cart to buy the goods offered, as with Amazon. (ECF No. 279 at 7.) But the requirement to provide information necessary to order the goods is not limited to the availability of a virtual shopping cart. The very provision of the T.M.E.P. on which Defendants rely indicates five means by which a website can provide ordering information any one of which may be sufficient to constitute use in commerce. These means include: \"[1] a sales order form to place an order, an online process to accept an order, such as 'shopping cart' functionality, or special instructions on how to order; [2] information on minimum quantities; [3] indication of methods of payment; [4] information about shipment of the goods;\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   [5] means of contacting the applicant to place an order.\" T.M.E.P. \u00a7 904.03(i)(C) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Anpath Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"368\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20U.S.P.Q.%202d%20%28BNA%29%201377\">\n    95 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1381 (T.T.A.B. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Quantum Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 94 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA) at 1379. As the very evidence submitted by the Defendants shows, Marketquest's website expressly provides detailed information regarding how to order the goods associated with the marks. (ECF No. 216-21 Ex. 19.) Marketquest also presents evidence showing that its distributors-the immediate consumers of its promotional products-have a secure login necessary to purchase goods from its website. (ECF No. 258-7 Cohen Decl. \u00b6 4.) Given the undisputed facts and in view of the applicable standard, the Court finds that Marketquest's website uses are sufficient to defeat Defendants' abandonment counterclaims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to raise any triable issues of fact regarding whether Marketquest's provision of sample goods, trade show booth displays, catalog uses, and website uses constitute use in commerce under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Abandonment Challenges to Particular Registrations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   In addition to their general abandonment challenges to Marketquest's uses of the marks, Defendants assert particularized abandonment challenges to the All in One marks in the '417 and '333 registrations. Both challenges lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    a. All in One Line '417 Registration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   First, Defendants argue that All in One line mark '417 registration has been abandoned because discovery has produced no evidence of any type of use of the mark in the three years preceding their cross-motion. (ECF No. 216-1 at 4.) They argue that the mark has only been used in Marketquest's domain name, www.allinoneline.com, which does not qualify as trademark use. (ECF No. 216-1 at 4-6.) Plaintiff argues that to establish abandonment of the '417 registration, Defendants must show that Marketquest has abandoned each form of its All in One marks. (ECF No. 259 at 6.) Plaintiff's argument prevails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   It is true that \"the use of a website address containing a trademark is not the same as use of the mark,\" particularly because it is generally used to identify the online location of a company's products or services.\n   <em>\n    Specht v. Google\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4175243\" index=\"369\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/758/570/#p591\">\n    758 F.Supp.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (N.D.

But Marketquest does not contend that its website domain name qualifies as a use in commerce of the All in One line mark, nor does the '417 registration identify Marketquest's domain name. (ECF No. 205-3 RFJN Ex. A; ECF No. 259 at 11.) Defendants raise a point to an issue that simply does not exist here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   More fundamentally, Defendants' challenge to the '417 registration disregards Marketquest's continuous use of the most salient feature of the mark in every All in One mark at issue in this case. Defendants emphasize the word \"line\" in the '417 registration and assert that it creates a commercial impression different from the impressions created by the other All in One marks. (ECF No. 279 at 9.). The Court recognizes that \"a change of format which alters the overall commercial impression of a mark\" may provide the basis for an abandonment challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iowa Health Sys. v. Trinity Health Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454966\" index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/177/897/#p923\">\n    177 F.Supp.2d 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (N.D.

THOMAS MCCARTHY , MCCARTHY ON TRADEMARKS &amp; UNFAIR COMPETITION \u00a7 17:26 (5th ed. 2018). The Court also recognizes that modifications to a mark are more likely to create a different commercial impression when the modification pertains to a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   type of good or service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

The record shows that between 1999 and 2001 Marketquest used \"All in One Line\" with the stylization applicable to the mark appearing in the later '089 registration. The only difference is that the word \"the\" precedes \"All in One\" and the word \"line\" appears thereafter, both in smaller lettering and set off from \"All in One.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 216-4 Ex. 2 at 1 (1999 catalog),\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (2000 catalog),\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (2001 catalog)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 205-5 Ex.

The change appears as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   (ECF No. 216-4 Ex. 2 at 1 (excerpt from 1999 Catalog).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   (ECF No. 216-4 Ex. 2 at 8 (excerpt from 2002 Catalog).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Nearly each iteration of the \"All in One\" mark on the front cover of the catalogs in 2002 and thereafter contains the salient feature of the '417 registration and its stylization. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 216-4 Ex. 2.) The record also shows that the goods classes in the '417 registration appear in the '089 registration, which was registered on October 10, 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 205-3 RFJN Ex. A ('417 registration)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 205-5 RFJN Ex. C ('089 registration).) This confirms to the Court that, at a minimum, the '089 registration is a continuing commercial impression of the salient feature of the '417 registration, as applied to goods. Because Marketquest has continuously used the\n   most salient feature of the '417 registration, the Court rejects Defendants' abandonment challenge to that registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    b. All in One '333 Registration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Defendants argue that the All in One mark '333 registration has been abandoned for lack of use in the three years preceding their motion by relying on (1) their rejected arguments regarding the sufficiency of Marketquest's uses and (2) May 3, 2012 testimony from Marketquest's Rule 30(b)(6) deponent, Stephanie Mills, that Marketquest no longer intended to use the logo. (ECF No. 216-1 at 6; ECF No. 226-5 Ex. 3 at 188:18-189:17).) This argument has no merit now that the Court has rejected the first premise. As Defendants have failed to show non-use, Defendants' reliance on Mills' testimony as proof that Marketquest intended not to resume use of the '333 mark is irrelevant because intent never comes into play if non-use has not been shown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Electro Source, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3388263\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/458/931/\">\n    458 F.3d at 937-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[U]nless the trademark use is actually terminated, the intent not to resume use prong of abandonment does not come into play.\");\n   <em>\n    KeyCorp. v.

Indeed, as part of the fair use defense, Defendants' employees have testified that they used the phrases, which Marketquest contends were its marks, to describe their own offerings. (ECF No. 205-22 Lane Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-91, Exs. P.4, BR.2, BS.) Moreover, the entire premise of two summary judgment motions filed by BIC USA and Norwood is that Defendants' uses were fair under the classic fair use doctrine, not that they were nominative uses. (ECF Nos. 214, 215.) At this stage of the proceedings, the Court finds that the normative fair use defense pleaded in the Answer is incompatible with the class fair use defense on which Defendants evidently intend to rely at trial and for which they have amassed evidence. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to Marketquest on this defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    L.

(FAC at 10.) In opposing summary judgment on damages, Marketquest clarifies that it further seeks (1) a reasonable licensing or royalty fee, or (2) compensation for injury to its good will\n   and reputation, including recovery of its lost profits from defendants' infringement along with corrective advertising. (ECF No. 258 at 31-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Marketquest presents the evidence of its damages expert David Drews to support its request for damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 232-1.) Drews first calculates Defendants' profits obtained from using the marks during the alleged period of infringement. Specifically, Drews attempts to isolate Defendants' profits from any sales made from the 2011 All in One catalogue and any sales of the Bic Round Stic pen associated with its 30th anniversary. Next, Drews attempts to calculate Marketquest's lost profits caused by Defendants' infringement by comparing Marketquest's historical sales and profits before and after the period of infringement. Drews then attempts to calculate reasonable royalties from a hypothetical negotiation between Marketquest and Defendants and tries to duplicate an arms' length agreement between a willing licensor and willing licensee. Drews is hampered in this effort by his admission that Marketquest does not have any outbound licensing program by which it licenses any of its marks to outside businesses. Nor does he find any evidence that indicates Defendants have ever licensed any marks for their corporate use. Finally, Drews determines the cost of corrective advertising to alleviate any market confusion caused by Defendants' use of the marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Defendants BIC USA and Norwood move for summary judgment on the issue of the damages for which Marketquest may seek recovery if Marketquest proves unlawful infringement of its mark.

Finally, at the same time that Defendants were presenting All in One on its catalogue (and presumably in its drinkware advertisement), it used Plaintiff's second mark THE WRITE CHOICE to advertise its pens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43, Ex. K.3.) A jury could find from these facts that Defendants were willfully using Plaintiff's marks to suggest that it had acquired Plaintiff and to cause confusion in the promotional products market. Although Defendants may certainly argue to the jury that this evidence does not support this conclusion, it is not appropriate for the Court to make a determination at the summary judgment stage regarding willfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Defendants argue that there is no evidence they profited from the use of the marks since they never sold articles bearing the infringing mark. (ECF No. 214 at 22; ECF No. 215 at 18.) Furthermore, Defendants claim they sold many items from multiple sources and it is impossible to determine if a buyer bought an item specifically from the 2011 catalogue or from some other source that had the infringing mark. (ECF No. 214 at 22; ECF No. 215 at 18.) These are appropriate and valid arguments the Court expects Defendants to make to the jury. At trial, Defendants must bear the burden of showing which sales are not attributable to the infringing activity. At this stage, however, Defendants have failed to establish the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
