Ayotte (\"Plaintiff\") filed this action in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleging claims against a host of defendants, including The Boeing Company (\"Boeing\"), arising from his exposure to asbestos. (R. 1-1, Compl.) Boeing removed the action to this Court. (R. 1, Notice of Removal.) Before the Court is Plaintiff's motion to remand the case to state court. (R. 240, Mot. to Remand.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In September 2016, Plaintiff was diagnosed with mesothelioma, and in September 2017, he filed suit against Boeing and other defendants asserting that his illness was caused by exposure to asbestos. (R. 1-1, Compl.) He alleged that he was \"exposed to and inhaled, ingested or otherwise absorbed asbestos fibers emanating from certain products he was working with and around that were manufactured, sold, distributed, marketed or installed by the Defendants[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) He claimed that his exposure occurred sometime between 1970 and 2004 while he was serving in the U.S. Air Force, working as a commercial airline mechanic, and/or engaging in home remodeling and other activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-14.) As to Boeing, he alleged that he was exposed to asbestos in Boeing's products \"during the course of his employment, non-occupational work projects (including, but not limited to, home and automotive repairs, maintenance, and remodeling) and/or in other ways[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Boeing was served with the complaint on September 21, 2017, and filed its answer on October 30, 2017. (R. 240-5, Docket at 71; R. 240-3, Answer.) In addition to denying the bulk of the allegations in the complaint, Boeing asserted 23 separate affirmative defenses, including that Boeing \"is immune from liability as a government contractor who manufactured the products to which Plaintiff claims to have been exposed pursuant to reasonably precise specifications of the United States government.\" (R. 240-3, Answer at 10.) In the ensuing months, Plaintiff amended his complaint several times, although the substance of the allegations against Boeing\n   remained the same.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 240-5, Docket at 14, 60, 122, 136; R. 240-6, Fourth Am. Compl.; R. 240-7, Fifth Am. Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2017, Plaintiff executed an authorization for release of his military records. (R. 1-2, Disc. Resp. at 8-19.) In November 2017, Plaintiff filed a disclosure of expected trial witnesses. (R. 240-4, Disclosure.) As to Boeing, he disclosed that he and several other witnesses intended to testify about his work at three different military bases during the 1970s, as well as his work as a commercial mechanic at three different airports between 1979-2004, during which time he claimed to have been exposed to asbestos in Boeing's products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 13, 2018, Boeing gained electronic access to Plaintiff's military records. (R. 1-4, Military Records.) Those records showed that while serving in the U.S. Air Force, Plaintiff worked on various Boeing airplanes, including B-52s and KC-135s, which, according to Boeing, were specifically manufactured by Boeing for the U.S. military. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; R. 1-7, Leatherman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-30.) On March 20, 2018, Plaintiff sat for the first day of his discovery deposition, and it was revealed that Plaintiff had worked on DC-3 aircraft during his time as a commercial airline mechanic. (R. 1-5, Pl.'s Dep. Tr. at 12.) According to Boeing, a significant number of DC-3 aircraft were Boeing C-47 and C-54 planes that were originally manufactured for the U.S. military, sold as military surplus after World War II, and converted for commercial use. (R. 1-7, Leatherman Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 12, 2018, Boeing removed the case to this Court on the basis of federal officer jurisdiction. (R. 1, Notice of Removal.) Boeing asserts that removal is proper because it is \"being sued for asbestos-related injuries arising from or relating to equipment that it manufactured and supplied to the United States government under the government's detailed direction and control[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) On May 11, 2018, Plaintiff moved to remand the case to state court. (R. 240, Mot. to Remand.) In Plaintiff's view, Boeing's notice of removal was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the date Boeing was served with the original complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Boeing opposes the motion to remand, arguing that its notice of removal was timely because it was filed within 30 days of the date Boeing obtained information providing the basis for its assertion of federal officer jurisdiction. (R. 296, Resp. at 5-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[A]ny civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)

Although Plaintiff amended his complaint several times, the substance of the allegations against Boeing remained the same. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 240-6, Fourth Am. Compl.; R. 240-7, Fifth Am. Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The pretrial disclosures Plaintiff points to were no more definitive. Plaintiff disclosed only generally that he had witnesses who would testify about his exposure to Boeing's products sometime over the course of four decades at any one of three airports or three military bases. (R. 240-4, Disclosure.) Regarding the specific products at issue, he again identified them only as \"[a]sbestos containing brakes, gaskets, heat shields, fire hoses, valves, and other asbestos containing products[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Nothing about these filings provided specific notice to Boeing that Plaintiff's alleged injuries were caused by products manufactured by Boeing for the U.S. military.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff seems to believe that Boeing should have pieced together from\n   his filings that the products at issue were military planes, but that is not the standard. \"[W]hat a defendant might have discovered by following up on clues or suggestions that federal jurisdiction may exist is irrelevant to the timeliness inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

As the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   , defendants like Boeing manufacture a variety of products, some of which involve government contracts and some of which do not.\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2780269\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/1247/#p1251\">\n    445 F.3d at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Until Boeing had information about the exact products that allegedly caused Plaintiff's injury, it could not know whether those products had been manufactured for the U.S. government and thus whether the predicates for federal officer jurisdiction were present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2780269\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/1247/#p1251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Mims v. 84 Lumber Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 13-298-SLR-CJB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204775306\">\n    2013 WL 4775306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Del. Sept. 6, 2013), for the opposite conclusion. (R. 304, Reply at 2.) In that case, however, the court found that the defendant failed to adequately explain \"what it was about the content of Mr. Mims' deposition that made its federal defense now ascertainable for the first time.\"\n   <em>\n    Mims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204775306\">\n    2013 WL 4775306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Here, by contrast, Boeing has clearly explained that it did not know until the specific planes at issue were identified that these products had been manufactured for the U.S. government, rather than for purely commercial purposes. (R. 296, Resp. at 7-8; R. 1-7, Leatherman Decl.) The court in\n   <em>\n    Mims\n   </em>\n   specifically noted that the defendant did not advance such an argument in its filings.\n   <em>\n    Mims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204775306\">\n    2013 WL 4775306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Pantalone v.

Conn. 2008), where the court determined that the defendant failed to demonstrate \"that it could not have reasonably ascertained the case's removability\" much earlier in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876689\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/576/325/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876689\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/576/325/#p334\">\n    at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in\n   <em>\n    Pantalone\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff clearly alleged in his complaint that he was exposed to asbestos in pumps made by defendant while he was working at a Navy shipyard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876689\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/576/325/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, by contrast, Plaintiff failed to name Boeing (whether inadvertently or otherwise) in the count arising from his military service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 1-1, Compl. at 9-14.) His pretrial disclosure was also vague, as he revealed only generally that he had witnesses who would testify about his exposure to Boeing's products at some point over the course of four decades at any one of six different locations, some of which were military bases and some of which were not. (R. 240-4, Disclosure.) He also identified Boeing's products very generally, referring only to parts rather than to\n   any particular aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Based on these distinctions, the Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's reliance on these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is true, as Plaintiff points out, that Boeing asserted an affirmative defense based on government contractor immunity months before removing the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 240, Mot. to Remand at 6; R. 240-3, Answer at 10.) The Court does not find this dispositive, however, because the standards governing assertion of an affirmative defense and the decision to remove a case to federal court are quite different. As the court in another asbestos case observed, an \"affirmative defense need not be plausible to survive, and must merely provide fair notice of the issue involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Bond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20657402\">\n    2014 WL 657402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citation, internal quotation marks, and alterations omitted). Thus, a defendant could assert a government contractor defense \"based only on the possibility that a federal contract would be at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20657402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, \"a defendant seeking to remove under Section 1442(a) must be able to muster more evidence than that-it must instead have identified concrete factual information that, viewed in the light most favorable to it, entitles it to a complete defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20657402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Boeing did not have that \"concrete factual information\" until it learned which specific aircraft had allegedly caused Plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20657402\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Had Boeing acted precipitously and filed a notice of removal based on incomplete information, \"it may well have subjected itself to fees and costs, and potentially Rule 11 sanctions, for filing a baseless notice of removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Durham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2780269\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/1247/#p1251\">\n    445 F.3d at 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on the above, the Court concludes that the 30-day deadline for removal did not begin to run until Boeing learned on March 13, 2018, that Plaintiff's exposure to asbestos occurred, at least in part, in connection with his work on planes manufactured by Boeing for the U.S. government. Boeing's notice of removal filed on April 12, 2018, was therefore timely. The motion to remand is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion to remand (R. 240) is DENIED. The parties are ordered to appear for a status hearing on July 3, 2018, at 9:45 a.m. They are directed to reconsider their settlement positions in light of this opinion and to exhaust all avenues for settling this action prior to the status hearing.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Plaintiff amended the complaint five times in state court, but in his motion to remand, he acknowledges that he failed to properly notice the fifth amended complaint. (R. 240, Mot. to Remand at 4.) He asserts, and Boeing does not dispute, that the fourth amended complaint is the operative pleading.
