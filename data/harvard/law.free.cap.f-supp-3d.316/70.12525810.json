After coming up empty in a congeries of cases filed before the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Northern District of Texas, the Eastern District of Texas, the Western District of Louisiana, and the Fifth Circuit, Vetcher brought an action in this Court alleging that Defendants-the United States Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS-oversaw actions and policies that are unconstitutional and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Government now moves to dismiss, contending that this Court lacks jurisdiction and that Plaintiff\n   has failed to state a claim upon which any relief can be granted. Agreeing as to both, the Court will dismiss some of the claims and order that the remainder be transferred to the Northern District of Texas, where Vetcher is currently detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

He successfully filed a motion to reopen proceedings on March 25, 2015, however, and the BIA then remanded the matter because \"the Immigration Judge had not given [him] a meaningful chance to contest the aggravated felony charge during his [\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ] initial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    at 2, 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Vetcher's case was remanded, DHS withdrew the aggravated-felony basis for removal and instead charged him as \"deportable\" as an \"alien who ... has been convicted of a violation of ... any law ... relating to a controlled substance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i). On September 2, 2015, the IJ held a hearing where Plaintiff was denied release on bond and ordered detained pending completion of removal proceedings.

The IJ also denied Plaintiff cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vetcher again appealed to the BIA, arguing that he had been \"denied access to court and due process.\" Compl., \u00b6 4. The BIA nonetheless affirmed the IJ's decision to sustain the removability charge but remanded for further factual findings as to the IJ's denial of his application for cancellation of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BIA Decisions at 5. On February 21, 2017, the BIA further denied Plaintiff's request for appointed counsel to assist him in accessing legal\n   information because \"there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in immigration proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 5.

First, he posits that the channeling provisions of \u00a7 1252 are contrary to fundamental fairness because \"DHS's mere allegations of removal charges subjects a non-citizen to mandatory detention.\" Opp. at 6. Congress, Plaintiff contends, could not have meant to authorize detention without providing the alien an opportunity to have a federal court rule on whether the removal order is valid\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 9, 13 (\"My case ping-ponged back between an IJ and BIA, without answering whether I should be subject to removal from the start.\"). This point, however, is now moot given the issuance of the final order of removal. In any event, consolidating all claims in the courts of appeals after a final order of removal is precisely what Congress intended. Indeed, for decades, Congress has amended the INA to streamline judicial review of immigration proceedings and channel all claims arising from removal proceedings to federal courts of appeals. Section 1252 was \"designed to make perfectly clear 'that only courts of appeals-and not district courts-could review a final removal order,' [and] that 'review of a final removal order is the only mechanism for reviewing any issue raised in a removal proceeding.' \"\n   <em>\n    J.E.F.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137377\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1026/#p1033\">\n    837 F.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting H.R.

That is simply untrue. The BIA may not have authority to decide constitutional questions, but after a final order and upon a petition for review, courts of appeals routinely address such issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Rosas v.

Although that would be true if Plaintiff were detained here, the Fifth Circuit (the only circuit under which he may bring a\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition) does not permit a plaintiff to use the writ to contest conditions of confinement.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417236\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/601/303/#p305\">\n    601 F.Supp.2d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases \"welcom[ing]\" conditions-of-confinement claims in this Circuit),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v.

The Court need not consider whether such a difference in circuit precedent strips Vetcher of an adequate remedy because this part of his suit fails on another score: the Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to establish that the complained-of conduct is final agency action, as required under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finality requires,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that a plaintiff exhaust all administrative remedies mandated by statute or agency rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munsell v.

Cir. 2007). Although Vetcher submitted several examples of his grievances,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exhs. A, E, the face of the Complaint does not plead facts from which the Court can discern which of his claims relate to \"final agency action.\" He generally alleges that Defendants' \"determination to detain non-citizens for punitive time in punitive conditions\" is \"final,\" but fails to identify to which policies he is referring and how he has administratively exhausted any grievance about those policies, if applicable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 8. A complaint need not include \"detailed factual allegations,\" but must at least have \"enough factual matter\" for a court to determine whether the plaintiff has raised \"a claim of entitlement to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff falls short of that bar here. Given that the case will be transferred to the Northern District of Texas, he may be able to amend his Complaint there to make out a conditions-of-confinement APA claim.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion in part and deny it in part. Plaintiff's challenge to the length of detention will be transferred to the Northern District of Texas, and he may seek leave there to amend his Complaint to challenge his conditions of confinement. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion will be issued this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
