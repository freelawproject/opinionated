Fein stated that the March 2007 Agreement with Reprise was intended to assign Reprise the \"ownership and interest\" in his inventions for \"low dose and sublingual and other routes of administration that could exploit the low dose hypothesis.\" Tr. 109:17-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated further that it was not his intention to retain rights in those inventions following the agreement. Tr. 109:23-110:7. Similarly, Fein stated that he had intended the Three-Way Agreement between Reprise, Serenity, and Allergan to convey to Allergan the same interests and rights that Fein conveyed earlier to Reprise. Tr. 110:11-112:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On cross-examination, Fein made additional statements as to the agreements. Fein testified that the Ferring Patents did not, at the time of the Three-Way Agreement, meet all the stated descriptions of the patent rights to be assigned by Reprise under the agreement. For example, Fein stated that, at the time of the agreement, the Ferring Patents were not in Reprise's \"sole and exclusive\" ownership as stated to be true under the agreement. Tr. 251:13-252:20. The transferred rights that were returned to Reprise and Serenity from Allergan following the 2017 Reprise Assignment included only certain enumerated patents and did not include the Ferring Patents or discuss the return of any \"inventions.\" Tr. 253:2-255:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During cross-examination of Fein, Ferring moved pursuant to Rule 52(c) to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims for lack of standing. Tr. 256:15-257:13. Defendants were given additional time at trial to introduce evidence or testimony on the issue of standing. Tr. 262:7-263:6. Both parties elected to have the issues determined based on the evidence already submitted, at which point a briefing scheduling was agreed upon. Tr. 272:2-276:14. On March 12, 2018, accompanying their motion papers, Defendants moved to join Fein as a Counterclaimant pursuant to Rule 17. Dkt.

Fein's intellectual property rights in the Ferring Patents, to the extent they existed, were assigned entirely to Reprise and Serenity in the 2007 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Three-Way Agreement, on the other hand, did not transfer the same set of property rights as did the initial transfer from Fein to Reprise. That agreement was considerably narrower in scope and unambiguous in substance. The intellectual property that was transferred in the Three-Way Agreement fell into two categories: enumerated patents and patent applications-which did not include the Ferring Patents-and other intellectual\n   property rights that were in Reprise and Serenity's exclusive control. Because the Three-Way Agreement did not transfer the rights Reprise and Serenity now claim in the Ferring Patents to Allergan, it follows that the Dissolution and Reversion from Allergan back to Reprise and Serenity is not germane to the instant motions. Reprise and Serenity were properly assigned Fein's full set of intellectual property rights-the precise scope of which has not yet been determined. Counterclaim Plaintiffs thus have a \"concrete financial interest\" in the Ferring Patents.\n   <em>\n    Chou v.

The Agreement \"assigns to [Reprise] ... the entire right, title and interest in and to (i) the patent applications listed on Appendix A attached hereto (the \"Applications\" and the inventions claimed therein are the \"Inventions\"),\" (D.I.294 at 7), constitutes evidence of intent to transfer more than just the listed patents from Appendix A. Inclusion of the expansive \"Inventions\" language militates against a narrow reading of the assignment and suggests that Fein intended to transfer the entirety of his intellectual property rights-both then-existing and not-yet-discovered-in low dose desmopressin.

Certain of those rights then transferred to Allergan in the Three-Way Agreement.

Thus, whatever rights Fein had in the Ferring Patents prior to the 2007 Agreement-if any-were transferred to, and are now held by, Counterclaim Plaintiffs Reprise and Serenity.
