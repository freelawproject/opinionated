And he claims that, without the residual clause, his conviction under \u00a7 924(c) cannot stand. In his view, while his other convictions may have qualified as crimes of violence under the residual clause, none of them fall within the elements clause because they do not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It points to two missed opportunities for Abu Khatallah to have raised this argument, each of which it believes constitutes waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the government claims that Abu Khatallah should have moved to dismiss the indictment's \u00a7 924(c) count as failing to charge an offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)(v) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Eshetu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276045\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/946/#p952\">\n    863 F.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 952 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (explaining that a challenge to the constitutionality of a criminal statute \"undoubtedly qualifies\" as a proper ground for a motion to dismiss for failure to charge an offense under Rule 12 ). This argument can be quickly dispensed with. While the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do provide for waiver of arguments not timely raised in pretrial motions, the Rules allow courts to consider any defense or objection \"if the party shows good cause.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3). Good cause exists here. The deadline for pretrial motions in this case lapsed in August 2015. That predated\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   by two-and-a-half years. The government suggests that the Supreme Court decision on which\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   relied-\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) -provided Abu Khatallah with a basis for challenging his \u00a7 924(c) charge before trial. Maybe so in the abstract. But\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   dealt with statutory text different from \u00a7 924(c)'s and, under binding D.C. Circuit case law at the time, \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause was constitutionally sound.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711218,22382\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/53/\">\n    133 F.3d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56-58 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (applying residual clause). Abu Khatallah's argument to the contrary would have almost certainly fallen on deaf ears, and thus good cause exists for his failure to raise that argument. Fed. R. Crim. P. 12 advisory committee note to 2014 amendments (describing good cause as \"a flexible standard that requires consideration of all interests in the particular case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Alternatively, the government claims that Abu Khatallah waived his \"crime of violence\" argument by not objecting to the jury instruction that \"[t]he crimes charged in Counts One through Seventeen are crimes of violence.\" The Court disagrees that this constituted waiver. The Court delivered jury instructions (1) shortly after the D.C. Circuit had reaffirmed the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eshetu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276045\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/946/#p952\">\n    863 F.3d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and (2) before the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   called that ruling into question. Abu Khatallah could not have credibly argued that the jury instruction misstated current law, and surely his failure to raise an argument anticipating\n   the Supreme Court's decision to change the law does not waive an argument relying on that change. Rather, Abu Khatallah correctly conceded that the charged crimes qualified as crimes of violence under the \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause under then-binding law. And, in light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , he is now able to argue for the first time that \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague and that his conviction cannot stand without it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Abu Khatallah's Conviction Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201363\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Is a Crime of Violence Under \u00a7 924(c)'s Elements Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That leads us to the first question on the merits: Does the Supreme Court's invalidation of \u00a7 16's residual clause in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   mean that \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause is also unconstitutionally vague? At first glance, the answer would appear to be an obvious \"yes.\" The texts of the two residual clauses are identical, and both are components of criminal statutes that define the term \"crime of violence.\" But the matter is not settled in the D.C. Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any case, this Court need not conclusively settle it because it ultimately concludes that Abu Khatallah's conviction under \u00a7 924(c) can stand even under \u00a7 924(c)'s elements clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To determine whether a particular predicate crime is a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s elements clause, the Court must use the \"categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eshetu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276045\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/946/#p952\">\n    863 F.3d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the categorical approach, the question is not whether Abu Khatallah\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   used, attempted, or threatened physical force against the person or property of another when committing the underlying offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

Rather, the Court must look only to the elements of the crime-\"the things the 'prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction' \" and \"what the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt\"-and decide whether those elements\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   involved the requisite use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In other words, the question is whether \"the least of the acts criminalized\" by the statute involves such force.\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p191\">\n    569 U.S. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p191\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p191\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, one way for a defendant to establish that a crime does not fall within the elements clause is to show that a person could be convicted of the crime despite not using, attempting, or threatening force against the person or property of another. But to succeed on that sort of argument, a defendant must do more than\n   <em>\n    hypothesize\n   </em>\n   conduct that would support a conviction. Rather, the defendant \"must at least point to his own case\n   or other cases in which the ... courts in fact did apply the statute in the ... manner for which he argues.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    549 U.S. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p191\">\n    569 U.S. at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p191\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[F]ocus on the minimum conduct criminalized by the [relevant] statute is not an invitation to apply 'legal imagination' to the ... offense.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    549 U.S. at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n    127 S.Ct. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Applying these standards, the Court finds that Abu Khatallah's \u00a7 924(c) conviction can stand because one of his other offenses of conviction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201363\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , categorically involves \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\" Section 1363 provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Whoever, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, willfully and maliciously destroys or injures any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property, or attempts or conspires to do such an act, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, and if the building be a dwelling, or the life of any person be placed in jeopardy, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   So, at a minimum, to be convicted under \u00a7 1363 a defendant must have intentionally injured federal property, or have attempted or conspired to do so. The question is whether a defendant's injuring, attempting to injure, or conspiring to injure federal property necessarily means that he used, attempted, or threatened force against that property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The short answer is yes. Injuring federal property categorically requires a use of force against the property of another. Likewise, an attempt to injure property categorically requires an attempted use of force against the property of another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abu\n   Khatallah contends that, for two reasons, the issue is much more complicated.

But it does not follow that a defendant can violate \u00a7 1363 without injuring the \"property of another.\" While there is scant authority on the meaning of that phrase in \u00a7 924(c), its legislative history suggests a broad understanding-one that covers all \"property in which a person or government has an interest upon which the actor is not privileged to infringe without consent, whether or not the actor also has an interest in the property.\" S.

LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 21.3(d) (3d ed. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, the context of the phrase \"property of another\" supports, if not\n   <em>\n    demands\n   </em>\n   , that the term carry a broad meaning-one that captures offenses even if a defendant could be convicted for harming property he owns. Remember that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) defines a \"crime of violence.\" Congress understandably wanted to exclude offenses from this definition that could be committed through pure self-harm; burning one's own property might be dangerous, but it is not categorically violent. But reading \"property of another\" restrictively would go a step further and, taken to its logical conclusion, would lead to a highly illogical result: A tenant who burns his rented rowhouse would have committed a crime of violence. A landlord who burns the rowhouse he rents out would not. Those offenses may be different in some respects, but they are equally\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   . Why would Congress intend \u00a7 924(c) to distinguish between them?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the Court's view, then, \u00a7 924(c)'s reference to \"property of another\" means property in which another party (other than the defendant) has a proprietary or possessory interest. That reading is consistent with the context, history, and purpose of the statutory phrase, as well as with the meaning given to it by the Model Penal Code and numerous states. Indeed, the Court is aware of no place where the phrase is used in the way Abu Khatallah suggests-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that a defendant\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   cannot damage the \"property of another\" if he owns the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A statute is thus excludable from \u00a7 924(c) on the basis of ownership only if it could be violated by an owner who damages property in which he has\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   interest. Under that reading, the only way Abu Khatallah could succeed on his argument is by showing that \u00a7 1363 could criminalize an owner's damage of wholly private property-that is, property in which another party does not have a right of control or possession. He has made no such showing. Rather, for property to fall within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) -and thus to sustain conviction under \u00a7 1363-it appears that the United States must hold\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   proprietary or possessory interest in the property. In other words, \u00a7 7(9) seems to require that the government have some right of possession or control over the property-akin to the lease in this case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Even if the argument were not forfeited, it would not alter the Court's analysis. The D.C.

And it is not beyond doubt that, if confronted with the issue again, the Circuit would continue to focus on the object of the conspiracy-as opposed to the minimum conduct required to be a conspirator-when evaluating crimes under the\n    <em>\n     elements clause\n    </em>\n    , as opposed to under the residual clause. The object of the conspiracy is clearly relevant under the residual clause: an agreement to commit a crime that (if completed) involves the use, attempt, or threat of force inherently creates a \"substantial risk\" that force will be used.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

But as the majority of courts to address the issue have recognized, a person can agree to use force-and engage in an overt act in furtherance of that agreement-without ever actually using, attempting, or threatening force.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Indeed, it appears that only one court of appeals avowedly focuses on the object of the conspiracy when evaluating crimes under the elements clause, and it does so based on a technical understanding of a criminal conspiracy as \"subsum[ing] the elements\" of the conspiracy's object.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Nevertheless, Abu Khatallah has not argued that the possibility of conviction based on conspiracy renders \u00a7 1363 outside the scope of the elements clause.

So to convict Abu Khatallah for violating \u00a7 1363, the jury necessarily found that the Mission fell within this limited part of the federal-territorial-jurisdiction statute-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , within subsection 9. Thus, in analyzing whether \u00a7 1363 falls outside the crime-of-violence definition on the ground that a defendant could destroy his own property, the Court is permitted to use the \"modified categorical approach\": it may ignore the possibility that\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    subsections of \u00a7 7's definition of federal territorial jurisdiction supported Abu Khatallah's conviction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Descamps v.

The 1981 bill was never enacted, but the Senate report accompanying a later bill-known as the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984-expressly indicates an intent to adopt the earlier bill's \"crime of violence\" definition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Sen. Rep. No. 98-225, at 307. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act was ultimately enacted and created the \"crime of violence\" definition that applies to \u00a7 924(c).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pub. L. No. 98-473, \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 1005(a) (1984).

Section 7(9) in typical cases will satisfy international-law principles because diplomatic property purchased or leased by the United States is commonly understood to be within at least the \"concurrent\" territorial jurisdiction of the United States and therefore within its power to prescribe.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Corey\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11160603\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1166/#p1177\">\n     232 F.3d at 1178\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (asking, with respect to property leased by embassy abroad, \"whether the United States enjoys such control over the area that the law should constructively regard it as United States territory\"); Restatement,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 402(1)(a). But if read to cover wholly private property-property over which the United States exerted no modicum of control-there would need to be some other basis supporting extension of U.S. jurisdiction. That's not a problem when the defendant is a U.S. national.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 402(2). By its terms, however, \u00a7 7(9) applies not just where the defendant is a U.S. national, but also where the\n    <em>\n     victim\n    </em>\n    is a U.S. national. And at least for run-of-the-mill crimes like \u00a7 1363, the nationality of the victim would not seem sufficient to support U.S. jurisdiction consistent with the law of nations.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rezaq\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11590129,3710919\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/1121/\">\n     134 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1133 (citing \"passive personality principle\" of jurisdiction over crimes against a state's nationals \"by reason of their nationality,\" but noting that principle \"has not been generally accepted for ordinary torts or crimes\"); Restatement,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 402 cmt. f (explaining \"protective principle of jurisdiction\" over \"offenses directed against the security of the state\" but citing \"espionage\" and \"counterfeiting\" as paradigmatic examples). So under the theory that statutes should be read so as to comply with the law of nations, \u00a7 7(9) should be interpreted to cover only property that is within U.S. territory. The Court does not see how private residences in which the United States has no proprietary or possessory interest could be considered within its \"territory,\" even if that term is given a broad, functional definition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
