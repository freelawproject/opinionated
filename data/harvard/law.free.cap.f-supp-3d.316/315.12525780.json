BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Wild Horse Freedom Federation (WHFF) brought this Freedom of Information Act suit seeking certain categories of documents associated with the Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and Burro Program (WHBP). Although BLM produced several hundred pages with and without redactions, WHFF believes that its search was inadequate and its withholdings overbroad. In response to the parties' Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court will grant a portion of Plaintiff's and deny much of Defendant's, mainly because BLM has neglected to respond at all to WHFF's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   WHFF \"is a non-profit public interest organization ... headquartered in Magnolia, Texas.\" Compl., \u00b6 4. In May 2017, it submitted a tripartite request to BLM, seeking weekly reports connected with BLM's WHBP, briefings from BLM's Assistant Director of Renewable Resources and Planning to BLM's Director, and briefings/reports from WHBP's Division Chief to the Assistant Director of Renewable Resources and Planning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1.

One month later, BLM released an additional 248 pages, of which 28 were redacted entirely and 115 were redacted in part.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dissatisfied with its haul, WHFF filed this action on October 30, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint), and the parties have now cross-moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 8 (Def.), 9 (Pl.).

WHFF here has no problems with BLM's search for items contained in the third part of its three-part request, but believes that the agency has been derelict in regard to the first two parts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 8-12. More specifically, in part one, Plaintiff requested all weekly reports connected to the WHBP. It now lists several reasons why it believes that BLM has not exhausted its search options, most prominently because the title of such reports varied depending on the sender, but the agency apparently searched only for documents entitled \"weekly report.\" Pl. MSJ at 11. Since BLM has never filed any opposition to WHFF's Motion, the Court has no information with which to refute Plaintiff's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Similarly, as to part two, WHFF points out that, although it requested\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   briefings from BLM's Assistant Director of Renewable Resources and Planning, it appears that briefings related only to the WHBP program - as opposed to topics including,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , livestock, grazing, or endangered species - were included.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 8-9. Once again, absent any rejoinder by the Government, the Court does not see why Plaintiff is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court, accordingly, will order BLM to conduct a new search in the areas WHFF delineates in relation to parts one and two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Exemptions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   BLM withheld all or part of numerous documents under FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6.

MSJ at 10. In response, WHFF asked the Court for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents, which the Court then ordered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of June 29, 2018. Although the Court ordered the submission of both clean and redacted copies, BLM complied only as to the 61 pages in Exhibit 11. As to the 248 in Exhibit 12, it provided only the redacted versions, leaving the Court to guess as to what information was actually on the pages. The Court will not, although it could, order all pages in Exhibit 12 released, but it certainly expects a clear and detailed explanation of the basis for BLM's withholdings and unredacted copies in the next round of briefing. Coupled with its failure to even file an opposition to Plaintiff's Motion, this performance is not up to the Government's usual standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In any event, as the Court is able to examine the six redactions on Exhibit 11, it can resolve that dispute. Of the six, three (labeled Int 1-6, 8, and 10) include precisely the same material, which appears to be sufficiently deliberative and predecisional to be covered by the exemption. As to 12, however, this is simply a factual statement regarding a litigation decision and should not be redacted. Similarly, 21 might be covered by the attorney-client privilege, but that has never been invoked, and so it must be turned over as well. Finally, 35 is a factual statement regarding litigation that is not covered by deliberative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the parties' Motions. A contemporaneous Order will require BLM to conduct a new search, unredact certain documents, and more fully justify the withholding of others.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
