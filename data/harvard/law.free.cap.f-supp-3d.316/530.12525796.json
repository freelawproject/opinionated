The ALJ made the following eleven findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The claimant last met the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act through December 31, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The claimant did not engage in substantial gainful activity during the period from her alleged onset date of January 1, 2008 through her date last insured of December 31, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   3. Through the date last insured, the claimant had the following severe impairments: hypothyroidism with euthyroid Graves orbitopathy and headaches.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Through the date last insured, the claimant did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   5. After careful consideration of the entire record, I find that, through the date last insured, the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work, as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(c) except: the claimant needed to avoid exposure to excessive noise (level four or above, as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles); and the claimant was limited to occupations requiring no more than occasional near and peripheral visual acuity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Through the date last insured, the claimant was unable to perform any past relevant work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   7. The claimant was born on March 23, 1956 and was 54 years old, which is defined as an individual closely approaching advanced age, on the date last insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   8. The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate in English.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   9. Transferability of job skills is not material to the determination of disability because using the Medical-Vocational Rules as framework supports a finding that the claimant is \"not disabled,\" whether or not the claimant has transferable job skills.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   10. Through the date last insured, considering the claimant's age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there were jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant could have performed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   11.

Dr. Miller's report is part of the administrative record. AR at 437-38. In his report, Dr. Miller's course of evaluation and treatment of the Plaintiff is plainly detailed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 438 (\"[patient with] worsening double vision with severe headaches [and] blurry vision resulting in difficulty to [sic] complete daily work\").
