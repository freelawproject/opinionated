Although SmarTEN argues without elaboration that there is no \"relationship between obviousness type double patenting and patent eligible subject matter,\" the conclusion by both SmarTEN and the Patent Office that its later-filed patents are \"not patentably distinct from\" the claims of the '640 patent only reinforces the Court's conclusion that Claim 1 of the '640 patent is representative of plaintiff's invention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Abstract Idea\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step addresses whether the asserted claims are \"directed to a result or effect that itself is\" a patent-ineligible abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    Smart Sys.

In analyzing this claim, the Federal Circuit began with the well-accepted rule that because \"[i]nformation as such is an intangible,\" \"collecting\" and \"analyzing information,\" as well as \"presenting the results of abstract processes of collecting and analyzing information,\" are all \"within the realm of abstract ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n    at 1353-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Federal Circuit recognized that an advance based on a \"particular assertedly inventive technology\" for \"gathering and analyzing information of a specified content, then displaying the results\" could be patent eligible, the asserted claims in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   were found to be \"clearly focused on the combination of th[e]se abstract-idea processes\" of gathering, analyzing, and displaying data and, as such, the Federal Circuit held that they were directed to an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n    at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Samsung argues that the asserted claims at issue in the present civil action\n   fall directly within the lines drawn in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group.\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees. Like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the claims here are primarily directed at collecting, analyzing, and displaying data. Specifically, Claim 1 of the '640 patent describes a set of subsystems that collect and store health, food, exercise, and weight data from the user and other sources; step-related data from a pedometer; and location data from a GPS receiver. '640 patent 89:1-52, 90:15-30, 91:14-21. The claim further describes how the subsystems can analyze the data to determine, for example, the calories contained in particular foods or burned by particular exercises, to evaluate user performance and the user's weight, and to provide feedback to the user about his progress toward his health goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:38-45, 90:23-54, 81:14-36. Lastly, the claim describes how the device can display nutritional ratings, a number of different symbols, and \"food-related and exercise-related information.\" as well as \"generate a visual depiction\" of the user moving in real time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89:9-33, 89:54-90:15, 90:42-49. Taken together, these descriptions make clear that Claim 1 is directed at collecting, analyzing, and displaying data, which is a patent-ineligible abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In response to this simple application of\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , SmarTEN primarily argues that the claims are not directed to an abstract idea but instead are \"directed to specific means for improving the claimed mobile weight and exercise management computing device.\" Pl. Opp. 13 (formatting altered). SmarTEN specifically cites as improvements the inclusion of a pedometer and GPS receiver,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15; the display of the user's path in real time using GPS data,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15; the ability to select GPS-based exercises directly from the initial user interface,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17; and the generation of lists of a user's favorite foods,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. This argument is unpersuasive. As Federal Circuit precedent makes clear, a claim is directed to the improvement of a device when it is focused on \"a specific improvement-[such as] a particular database technique-in how computers c[an] carry out\" a function, rather than on \"asserted advances in uses to which existing computer capabilities could be put.\"\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n    830 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1354 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smart Sys.

[T]he claims are directed to a specific implementation of a solution to a problem in the software arts.\"). SmarTEN does not claim either in its patent or its brief that the patent is directed to any technological advance or solution to a technological problem. Instead, it is clear that the claims in issue are directed to asserted advances in the uses to which already existing technology, particularly conventional mobile computing devices with built-in GPS receivers and pedometer functions, can be put. As a result, under the first step of\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the claims are directed at an abstract idea: the collection, analysis, and display of data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This conclusion is reinforced by the Federal Circuit's determination that claims are also directed to abstract ideas if they \"merely implement an old practice in a new environment.\"\n   <em>\n    FairWarning IP\n   </em>\n   , 839 F.3d at 1094. In\n   <em>\n    FairWarning\n   </em>\n   , the court confronted patent claims that were directed\n   to a computerized \"method of detecting improper access of a patient's protected health information\" that involved \"generating a rule for monitoring audit log data\" based on \"access in excess of a specific volume, accesses during a pre-determined time interval, [and] accesses by a specific user\"; applying the rule to the data to determine whether any such access had been achieved; storing, \"in a memory, a hit if the event has occurred\"; and providing a notification of the event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1092. The Federal Circuit held that these claims were directed to an abstract idea under\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   because the claimed rules reflected \"the same questions\" that \"humans in analogous situations detecting fraud have asked for decades, if not centuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1095. Although the claims required a computer, \"it is this incorporation of a computer, not the claimed rule, that purportedly improves the existing technological process by allowing the automation of further tasks,\" and although the claims \"purport[ed] to accelerate the process of analyzing audit log data, the speed increase comes from the capabilities of a general-purpose computer, rather than the patented method itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   SmarTEN's asserted claims function similarly. They reflect a practice that humans have been engaging in for decades, if not centuries: monitoring and improving one's health by managing nutrition and exercise. Although the claims require a mobile computing device and purport to enhance the process of analyzing health-related data, the purported advances come from the capabilities of a conventional mobile computing device, rather than from anything specific to the asserted device itself.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DietGoal Innovations LLC v.

Although the Federal Circuit has not produced an enumerated list of such \"inventive concepts,\" it has held that merely \"reciting the use of a generic computer ... cannot convert a patent-ineligible abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1338\">\n    874 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here, again, a comparison to\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   is useful. In that case, the Federal Circuit held that the claims were not sufficiently inventive: they \"d[id] not require a new source of type of information, or new techniques for analyzing it,\" nor did they \"require any nonconventional computer, network or display components, or even a non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1351\">\n    830 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They require gathering and storing data, but from sources such as a GPS, a digital camera, and a pedometer, as well as from the user inputting information. As the patent makes clear, all of these sources of information are conventional, and many mobile computing devices already contain the requisite GPS, digital camera, and pedometer capabilities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '640 patent 10:23-65, 44:62-64. Similarly, the claims do not provide for any new techniques of analysis, nor do they include any nonconventional structural components-or even nonconventional arrangements of conventional structural pieces. Instead, all of the necessary structural components are commonly included as part of a conventional mobile computing hand-held device, and the patent does not describe how the invention represents a \"critical advancement over the prior art\" or an \"unconventional technological solution ... to a technological problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Amdocs (Isr.)

Opp. 18-21. As discussed above, that the claimed device might have some advantages over prior health management applications is not sufficient to show an inventive concept. Instead, SmarTEN must identify something more that transforms the nature of the claim-for example, use of a new source of data or new techniques for analyzing that data, or use of nonconventional components or nonconventional arrangements of conventional components. For the reasons described above, SmarTEN is unable to identify any such inventive concept. In addition, the narrowing limitations in the claim do not demonstrate an inventive concept.
