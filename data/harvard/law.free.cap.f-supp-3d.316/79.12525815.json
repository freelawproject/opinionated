Mehta, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is back before the court on a motion by Defendants the U.S. Parole Commission and its individual Commissioners (collectively, \"Defendant\" or \"the Commission\"), to reconsider the court's decision of February 13, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op., ECF No. 99. That decision concerned a motion by Plaintiffs-individuals who remain incarcerated for D.C. Code offenses that occurred on or before March 3, 1985, but who have never received parole-to enforce a Settlement Agreement that requires\n   the Commission to conduct Plaintiffs' parole hearings using the guidelines that were in place at the time of their offenses. Plaintiffs had alleged that the Commission was not carrying out its obligations under the Agreement in good faith, both with respect to its actual parole decisions and the scheduling of any subsequent hearings following a denial of parole. The court agreed with Plaintiffs only as to the latter issue, finding that the Commission, by ordering set-offs of greater than one year for the lion's share of offenders, was violating the mandate that rehearings \"ordinarily\" be held within one year. The court ordered the Commission to hold rehearings as soon as practicable for all inmates who had no recent disciplinary actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant now asks the court to revisit its decision on grounds that the order is contrary to the terms of the parties' Settlement Agreement, improperly cabins the Commission's discretion, and assigns undue weight to Plaintiffs' evidence. Upon consideration of the parties' arguments and evidence, the court denies in part and grants in part Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. History of the Parole Guidelines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court begins with some historical background. Until 1997, the District of Columbia Board of Parole (\"Board\") made parole determinations for D.C. Code offenders. Between 1972 and 1985, the Board applied a set of guidelines that it had adopted in 1972 (\"1972 Guidelines\"). The 1972 Guidelines supplied non-exhaustive factors for the Board to consider when making parole determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 105.1 (1972). If the Board denied parole, the 1972 Guidelines provided a general rule for imposing \"set-offs,\" that is, the time period between the denial of parole and the next parole consideration hearing, or \"rehearing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 103 (1972). The rule stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All prisoners serving a maximum sentence of less than five years who were denied parole at their original parole hearing will ordinarily be granted a rehearing no later than six months after the Board's last action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Prisoners serving a maximum sentence of five years or more who were denied parole at their original hearing\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   will receive a rehearing one year after the last action taken by the Board....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In all cases of rehearings, the Board reserves to itself the right to establish a rehearing date at any time it feels such would be proper, regardless of the length of sentence involved or the time remaining to be served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Although the 1972 Guidelines granted the Board discretion to deviate from the \"ordinary\" one-year set-off, it was silent as to the factors that might warrant a departure.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Board adopted new parole guidelines in 1985, which came to be known as the \"1987 Guidelines,\" in reference to the year they were published.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Prisoners Serving Sentences Under the United States and District of Columbia Codes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C115\">\n    80 Fed.

The 1987 Guidelines contained a rule similar to that of its predecessor regarding rehearings. It, too, stated that individuals serving maximum sentences of five or more years \"ordinarily shall receive\n   a rehearing one (1) year after the last action taken by the Board,\" though the Board retained discretion to establish any rehearing date it deemed proper.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 28, \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Like the 1972 Guidelines, the 1987 Guidelines did not specify criteria the Board could consider in deciding whether to impose a setoff of greater than one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For decades, the Board made set-off determinations under the operative Guidelines, and those alone. But that changed in the early 1990s. In late 1991, the Board adopted, and then amended in early 1992, policy guidance that for the first time gave shape to the Board's discretion in scheduling rehearings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Board of Parole, Policy Guideline,\n   <em>\n    Reconsideration Hearings-Establishing Dates\n   </em>\n   , April 27, 1992 [hereinafter 1992 Policy Guideline]. The 1992 Policy Guideline enumerated multiple, non-exhaustive aggravating and mitigating factors that the Board could consider when determining whether to assign an offender a rehearing date that was later or earlier than the one-year norm.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 V.A.2, V.A.3. Aggravating factors included: that \"[t]he instant offense involved ongoing criminal behavior of leadership role in an organized, criminal venture\"; \"a lengthy history of criminally-related alcohol and/or substance abuse\"; \"an unusually extensive or serious prior record (at least five felony convictions)\"; \"[t]he instant offense involved unusual cruelty to victim(s) or involved especially vulnerable victims\"; and \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 V.A.2. Mitigating factors included: that the defendant \"has been [an] exceptional program participant\"; \"a record of exclusively trivial offenses\"; \"a substantial crime-free period since the last offense\"; and \"[t]here has been a substantial previous period in custody on other sentence(s) or the prisoner faces a substantial period of time on additional committed sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2028%2C%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 V.A.3. Thus, although one year remained the norm for a set-off under the 1992 Policy Guideline, the Board now had defined factors that would warrant a departure, including notably the severity of the offense conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Congress eliminated the D.C. Board of Parole in 1997 and assigned the Board's task of making parole decisions for persons convicted of violations of District of Columbia law to the United States Parole Commission. Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-33, \u00a7 11231(a)-(b). In 2000, the Commission adopted new guidelines for D.C. Code offenders (\"2000 Guidelines\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202.70\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The 2000 Guidelines required the Commission assign numerical values to aspects of an individual's pre- and post-incarceration history, and then use that number as a proxy for the risk posed by the offender in making paroling decisions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)-(n) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sellmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553908\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/551/66/#p85\">\n    551 F.Supp.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Origins of the New Regulation and the Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Before determining whether the court clearly erred in its decision enforcing the Settlement Agreement, it is worthwhile to\n   revisit how the parties arrived at their pact in the first place. This case began with constitutional challenges-one rooted in the Ex Post Facto Clause, the other in the Due Process Clause-to the Commission's use of the 2000 Guidelines to a class of offenders whose crimes were committed on or before March 3, 1985, and who had not received parole.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. Both claims focused primarily on the premise that applying the 2000 Guidelines retroactively created a significant risk of prolonging the terms of incarceration for this group of offenders.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894715,3772222\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/397/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By contrast, the Complaint made only a passing reference to there being a difference in how the 2000 Guidelines and the 1972 Guidelines approached the issue of set-offs, noting that under the 2000 Guidelines offenders would have to wait at least three years or more for a rehearing, as compared to one year under the 1972 Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 111. The Complaint did not seek specific relief to remedy that divergence. Thus, as pleaded, the set-off issue was, at most, an ancillary one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The D.C. Circuit's decision reversing the initial dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint reflects the set-off question's tangential quality. There, the Circuit held that Plaintiffs had stated a plausible Ex Post Facto claim because the 2000 Guidelines called for the use of factors that, in practice, increased an offender's presumptive parole date as compared to the 1972 Guidelines, which did not employ that methodology.\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    766 F.3d at 58-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Circuit made no mention of any difference in approach to set-offs between the two sets of Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201129,4110081\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/57/\">\n    766 F.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And then, on remand, Plaintiffs gave no greater attention to the set-off question than they had before the appeal.

With nothing more than the text of the rule before it, the Court could not conclude that the change lengthened the inmate's imprisonment or created a \"significant risk\" of extending his incarceration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    at 251, 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated that: \"Georgia law vests broad discretion with the Board, and our analysis rests upon the premise that the Board exercises its discretion in accordance with its assessment of each inmate's likelihood of release between reconsideration dates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, as it did in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that retroactive application of a potentially longer setoff period, in which the decision-maker retained discretion to adjust its timing, by itself, did not violate the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   supply an important frame of reference for this litigation. Those cases make clear that, when Plaintiffs filed this action, they faced an uphill battle to prove that the Commission's retroactive application of the 2000 Guidelines with regard to set-offs violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Indeed, like the policy at issue in\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , the 2000 Guidelines grant the Commission some discretion as to the length of time between parole hearings for D.C.

It did so for the first time through the rulemaking process. When the Commission first publicly issued notice and comment for what would become the New Regulation, its proposed text was silent as to any presumptive period of time between hearings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Prisoners Serving Sentences Under the United States and District of Columbia Codes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C111\">\n    80 Fed.

Defendant's Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Court Misconstrued the Plain Text of the New Regulation and Relevant Case Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant's primary argument centers on discretion. Defendant asserts that the court's ruling is contrary to the plain text of the New Regulation and precedent interpreting the 1972 Guidelines, both of which establish that the Commission has near-absolute discretion in setting rehearing dates on a case-by-case basis. Def.'s Mem. at 3-5. The Commission also insists that the court overlooked case law recognizing the D.C. Board's broad discretion to impose set-offs of greater than one year, citing five decisions: two from the D.C. Court of Appeals, one from the Third Circuit, one from the Seventh Circuit, and an additional decision from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   13-14 (discussing an additional D.C. Court of Appeals decision and a D.C. Circuit decision). In short, Defendant asserts that the court's decision is rooted in a clear error of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant's argument is not new, however. Defendant made the very same contention in its opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce, citing the D.C. Board's discretion to set rehearing dates \"at any time it feels such would be proper.\" Def.'s Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. at 8 (quoting 9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 103). The court's decision explained why that text did not save the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 14-16 (discussing the New Regulation's employment of a \"presumptive one-year set-off\" and its provision granting the Commission \"discretion in how long to fix a set-off\"). A motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate previously rejected lines of argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Shipping\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677373\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/471/\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   485 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677373\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/471/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and thus, the court rejects this argument outright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In any event, the court's ruling is in no way at odds with the text of the New\n   Regulation or the case law interpreting its older regulatory relative, the 1972 Guidelines. As the above history shows, the Commission, of its own volition through rulemaking, committed to \"ordinarily\" applying a one-year set-off to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   offenders who committed offenses when the 1972 Guidelines were in effect but had not yet received parole. And then, by entering the Settlement Agreement, the Commission agreed that it would \"ordinarily\" grant annual parole hearings to Plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    in this litigation\n   </em>\n   . No court compelled the Commission to do so. And while it is true that, as part of the New Regulation, the Commission retained some discretion to impose set-offs of more than one year, such discretion cannot swallow whole the one-year norm that it agreed to apply to this defined group of Plaintiffs. Indeed, under the Commission's reading of the New Regulation, the term \"ordinary\" has no meaning. What conclusion is there to draw, other than the one the court reached, when the Commission exceeds the adopted and agreed-upon one-year norm in 33 out of 37, or 90 percent, of Plaintiffs' cases? The term \"ordinarily\" simply cannot be disregarded. Yet, that is precisely what the Commission did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nor does the Commission's insistence that these offenders are the \"worst of the worst\" excuse it from imposing one-year set-offs. The Commission claims that it exercised its discretion on a case-by-case basis, and that the high rate of set-offs of more than one year can be explained by the fact that the offenders in question committed the most serious crimes and therefore \"are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   representative of the bulk of the many thousands of offenders to whom the 1972 regulations have applied over time.\" Def.'s Mem. at 8. The Commission made that same argument before,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. at 8, and the court rejected it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 16-17. Nevertheless, the court explains its decision here once more. The problem with this argument is that the Commission agreed to \"ordinarily\" hold annual hearings for\n   <em>\n    this very group of offenders\n   </em>\n   , not some nebulous set of prisoners. When it adopted the New Regulation and entered into the Settlement Agreement, the Commission well understood that these offenders had committed the most serious crimes. No one pulled the wool over its eyes. Still, the Commission\n   <em>\n    voluntarily\n   </em>\n   committed to apply a one-year set-off norm to\n   <em>\n    this group\n   </em>\n   of offenders. And, at no time did it ever expressly say or intimate that Plaintiffs would not qualify for a one-year set-off because of the seriousness of their crimes. The Commission's position is, in essence, that it engaged in rulemaking and settlement with its fingers crossed, only to back out of its promises when the ink was dry. The plain text of the New Regulation and the Settlement Agreement cannot countenance such an outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Commission also argues that the longer set-offs here were a proper exercise of its discretion when viewed relative to the application of the 1972 Guidelines to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   offenders who committed offenses, of any kind, prior to 1985. Def.'s Mem. at 6. As the Commission puts it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The fact that relatively fewer prisoners subject to the 1972 guidelines currently receive \"ordinar[y]\" set-offs is not a function of the Commission's disregard for the rules, but rather is a consequence of elapsed time: most \"ordinar[y]\" offenders who were sentenced while the 1972 Guidelines were in effect from 1972 to 1985 have been paroled or otherwise released. Most of the relative handful who remain are not \"ordinary[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677373\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Plaintiffs \"are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   representative of the bulk of the many thousands of offenders to whom the 1972 regulations have applied over time,\" the Commission continues, their set-offs need not be in line\n   with the norm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. This argument, however, misconstrues the relevant inquiry. The Commission agreed to \"ordinarily\" apply a one-year set-off to all offenders covered by the Settlement Agreement. Thus, whether the Commission acted in good faith in imposing setoffs is to be measured not against the hundreds or thousands of prisoners denied parole over the course of decades by the D.C. Board when applying the 1972 Guidelines. Rather, the relevant comparators are offenders subject to the Settlement Agreement, and only those offenders. When correctly viewed in this light, the Commission plainly did not comply with the terms of the Settlement Agreement because it did not \"ordinarily\" schedule rehearings within one year for those denied parole under the New Regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, the court rejects Defendant's contention that the court clearly erred in failing to recognize the breadth of the Commission's discretion with respect to setting dates for the reconsideration of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    2. The Evidence Relied upon by the Court was \"[I]nsufficient and [U]nreliable\"\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, Defendant criticizes the evidence that the court relied upon in reaching its decision, calling it \"insufficient and unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. First, Defendant attacks the relevance of the \"raw statistics\" cited by the court, i.e., that nearly 90% of Plaintiffs received set-offs of longer than one year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. According to the Commission, that statistic:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   fail[s] to account ... for the confounding factor that the cohort of prisoners still subject to the 1972 regulations have been winnowed over time to exclude nearly all but those convicted of the most serious crimes and/or those with the worst institutional misconduct. Nor do[es] [it] account for the extremely small sample size at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Thus, the Commission dismisses the data as having little probative value on the question of breach. Second, Defendant claims that the court gave undue weight to Ridley's declaration, when it was entitled to none.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12. Defendant challenges the basis for Ridley's testimony and also presents evidence to dispute his conclusions. Specifically, Defendant points to case law, which it asserts the court ignored, that purportedly contradicts Ridley's contention that the D.C. Board ordered set-offs of more than one year only in cases of recent institutional misbehavior. According to Defendant, the cited cases show that the D.C. Board under the 1972 Guidelines imposed longer set-offs because of the severity of a person's offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court rejects these contentions because, once again, the Commission is doing no more than relitigating arguments it already made or could have made. First, the court previously considered, and rejected, the Commission's argument that the \"raw statistics,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, cannot be relied upon because they do not take into account the seriousness of this group of offenders' crimes within \"the context of the larger group\" subject to the 1972 Guidelines,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 16-17. Second, as to Ridley, Defendant's attack comes too late. In its earlier pleading, the Commission barely even mentioned Ridley; in fact, the Commission cited his declaration favorably.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"Based upon the declaration of former Board member Walter Ridley, it is clear that the D.C. Board exercised [ ] discretionary authority\" to set rehearing dates.). It did not contend in its brief, as it does\n   now, that Ridley's testimony is of no probative value because it \"[speaks] merely in the most general of terms\"; \"[h]is recollections are from what appears to be, at worst, a scarcely relevant timeframe, and, at best, a non-representative-transitory one;\" and his \"declaration nowhere indicates that [he] consulted anything other than his 31 year-old memories to support his statements.\" Def.'s Mem. at 10-12. Ridley's declaration was Plaintiffs' evidence of the D.C. Board's practices, and the Commission let it stand unrebutted. The Commission cannot now mount the aggressive attack that it could have made earlier. Moreover, the case law that the Commission now marshals could have been used before to attack Ridley. Defendant previously cited as evidence of the Board's practices two of the cases it now touts-\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7366036\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/1047/\">\n    672 A.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 1996), and\n   <em>\n    Blair-Bey v. Quick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715512,11714733\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1036/\">\n    151 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1996) -but not as a direct challenge to Ridley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. at 8. The court considered these cases and discussed them during the hearing on Plaintiffs' Motion, even though the Memorandum Opinion did not expressly address them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the cited case law now used to undermine Ridley is not a valid reason to reconsider the court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In any event, the court once again rejects these arguments in substance, with one qualification regarding Ridley's declaration, as discussed below. First, it remains the fact that the \"raw statistics\" that the Commission discounts stand as the main evidence of the Commission's conformance with the Settlement Agreement. Indeed, there is little other evidence for the court to consider, and what evidence there is does not aid the Commission. At the court's direction, the parties submitted hearing records for 13 of the offenders who were recommended for parole by hearing examiners in their initial hearings pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, but who were denied parole upon further review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 20, 2017, Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 107 [hereinafter November Hr'g Tr.], at 35-36. Only one of the 13 individuals received a one-year rehearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Suppl. Filing Pursuant to Nov. 20 Hr'g, ECF No. 96 [hereinafter Joint. Suppl. Filing]. Of the remaining 12 cases, in only three did the Commission explain its reason for its longer-than-one-year set-off.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Suppl. Filing, Attach. 1, ECF No. 96-1, at 33, 43, 110. No reason was given for the longer set-off in the other nine cases.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715512,11714733\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1036/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Commission records that are before the court provide little explanation for the Commission's set-off decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Admittedly, as the Commission points out,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   April 13, 2018, Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 108 [hereinafter April Hr'g Tr.], at 11-12; November Hr'g Tr. at 33; Def.'s Opp'n to\n   Pls.' Mot. at 7, neither the New Regulation nor the Settlement Agreement require the Commission to explain its reasons for longer set-offs. And the Commission, of course, does not bear the burden of showing a breach of the Settlement Agreement. Yet, the Commission had ample opportunity to submit evidence to explain its decision-making in the face of Plaintiffs' statistical evidence, but simply chose not to offer any. For example, the Commission could have submitted a sworn declaration from commissioners or agency officials explaining the reasons for the set-off numbers, or it could have offered other notices of action that explained the longer set-offs. In the end, in response to the \"raw statistics,\" all the Commission put forth was the\n   <em>\n    litigation position\n   </em>\n   that it made set-off decisions on a case-by-case basis and imposed year-plus set-offs for 90% of those who were denied parole because of the severity of their offense conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November Hr'g Tr. at 33-35. An unsupported legal position is not sufficient to overcome overwhelming statistical evidence showing the Commission's persistent deviation from the agreed-upon one-year norm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nor has the Commission offered relevant evidence of the D.C. Board's actual practices under the 1972 Guidelines to show that the Commission's efforts to carry out the New Regulation are consistent with its predecessor's actions. Evidence of a parole board's actual practices can inform how the board interprets its governing regulations and policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    529 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508391\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/244/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Commission acknowledges, the only evidence it put forth when initially opposing Plaintiffs' Motion-\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   now in support of its motion to reconsider-is case law that it says shows that the D.C. Board considered the severity of a prisoner's original offense when the 1972 Guidelines were in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   These cases do not, however, support that argument. The Commission is of the view that that decisions applying the 1972 Guidelines are the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   relevant evidence of the D.C. Board's practices under the 1972 Guidelines. Therefore, according to the Commission, decisions made by the D.C. Board under subsequent guidelines and policies, including the successor 1987 Guidelines, shed no light on the D.C. Board's practices under the 1972 Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   April Hr'g Tr. at 18-22. It has taken the same position before the D.C.

In\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   -one of two cases cited in the Commission's opposition to Plaintiffs' motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. at 8-the D.C. Board applied the 1992 Policy Guidelines when it gave the offender a five-year set-off, on grounds that the offender had displayed cruelty to the victims and had negative institutional behavior.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7366036\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/1047/\">\n    672 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1049-52 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ). In the other previously cited case,\n   <em>\n    Blair-Bey\n   </em>\n   , the court did not specify the guidelines or policies that the D.C. Board applied when it gave the offender a five-year set-off in 1993.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715512,11714733\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1036/\">\n    151 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is likely, however, that the Board did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply the 1972 Guidelines, as the reasons that the court identified for the longer set-off track nearly verbatim two of the aggravating factors under the 1992 Policy Guideline.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715512,11714733\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1036/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715512,11714733\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1036/\">\n    at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047-48 (citing the offender's \"on-going criminal behavior\" and his \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional\n   behavior\" when describing the Board's decision),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   1992 Policy Guideline \u00a7 V.A.2 (providing that aggravating factors include \"ongoing criminal behavior\" and \"repeated or extremely serious negative institutional behavior\").

And, finally,\n   <em>\n    Glascoe v. Bezy\n   </em>\n   , a case from the Seventh Circuit, concerned \"the Commission's application of the 1999 guidelines, as opposed to those in effect at the time of Glascoe's conviction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932102\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/543/#p546\">\n    421 F.3d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546 (7th Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Glascoe\n   </em>\n   ). In summary, none of the cases cited by the Commission involve the 1972 Guidelines; all were decided under different regimes, which the Commission itself asserts are not relevant to demonstrating the Board's practices under the 1972 Guidelines. Therefore, the court did not clearly err in not relying on these decisions as evidence of the D.C. Board's set-off practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   That brings the court to Plaintiffs' declarant, Ridley. The only evidence that the Commission offers to undermine Ridley's statement are the above-cited cases. Defendant attacks Ridley's statement on other grounds-its use of \"the most general of terms,\" its failure to state what guidelines he refers to, and his brief and dated familiarity with the Board's practices-but insofar as evidence goes, the only proof presented is case law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10-11. For the reasons already explained, the cited authorities shed no light on the D.C. Board's practices under the 1972 Guidelines. Accordingly, they are not, as the Commission contends, \"definitive proof that plaintiff[s]' declarant's recollections are inaccurate and/or unrepresentative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Nevertheless, the court finds that it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   clearly err in relying on Ridley's observations to make findings about the D.C. Board's actual set-off practices under the 1972 Guidelines. As the Commission points out, Ridley's declaration does not identify the set of guidelines he uses as his point of reference to opine that the Commission's actions in this case deviate from the Board's historical approach to set-offs. A simple internet search reveals, however, that Ridley cannot possibly speak to the Board's practices under the 1972 Guidelines, at least based on first-hand knowledge, for a simple reason: He was not on the D.C. Board when those guidelines were in effect. As noted earlier, the parole regulations that are commonly known as the \"1987 Guidelines\" actually went into effect two years earlier than its moniker suggests, in March 1985.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 82. Ridley, however, began his tenure as chairman of the D.C. Board in June of 1985, three months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the \"1987\" Guidelines took effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sara Evans,\n   <em>\n    Barry Names New Head of Parole Board\n   </em>\n   , Wash. Post (June 5, 1985) (reporting that the mayor of the District of Columbia had appointed Ridley as the chairman of the D.C. Parole Board for a six-year term that would begin June 17, 1985).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the\n   court originally considered Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce, it incorrectly believed that the \"1987\" Guidelines actually went into effect in 1987, and not two years earlier. So, when Ridley indicated that he \"served as the chair of the former DC Board of Parole ... in 1985 and 1986,\" Ridley Decl. at 1, the court assumed that his two-year tenure encompassed a time when the 1972 Guidelines were in effect. That assumption was mistaken. The\n   <em>\n    1987\n   </em>\n   Guidelines supplied the governing rules for nine-plus months of 1985 and the full year in 1986, the very time period that Ridley served as the Board's chairman. Neither side noted this timing discrepancy in its initial briefing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, having found that Ridley did not serve on the D.C. Board when the 1972 Guidelines were in effect, the court retracts its reliance on Ridley's declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This confession of error does not, however, alter the court's conclusion that the Commission violated the Settlement Agreement. The uncontested statistical evidence marshalled by Plaintiffs provides compelling evidence, on its own, of the Commission's breach. The Commission agreed that this group of offenders \"ordinarily will receive a rehearing one year after [an original] hearing conducted by the U.S. Parole Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(5). Yet, in nearly 90% of cases, the Commission set a rehearing date more than one year into the future. No definition of \"ordinary\" can encompass such a dramatic deviance from the norm. And, for the reasons already discussed, the Commission's primary defense-that it applied the one-year standard on a case-by-case basis and imposed longer set-offs based on offense severity-is simply not supported by record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although the court's rejection of Ridley's testimony does not alter its conclusion that the Commission is in breach of the Settlement Agreement, it does require the court to amend an aspect of its Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce. Without Ridley's attestations, there is no record proof of the D.C. Board's practices with respect to imposing longer set-offs under the 1972 Guidelines. And, in the absence of such relevant evidence, the court will not speculate as to what the D.C. Board's practices were while those Guidelines were in effect. The court therefore will not limit the Commission's discretion in setting rehearing dates of more than one year to only offenders with recent, verifiable disciplinary problems. Accordingly, the court strikes the following sentence from its earlier Order: \"Only Plaintiffs who have had verifiable disciplinary problems since their original hearing are not subject to the presumptive scheduling of a rehearing after one year.\" Order, ECF No. 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The court recognizes that this modification removes any bright-line rule as to when the Commission may deviate from the one-year norm. While bright-line rules usually are preferable, particularly where liberty interests are at stake, the parties did not bargain for such a rule in the Settlement Agreement. The court is in no position to place definite restrictions on the Commission that are not called for by the text of the Settlement Agreement and\n   the New Regulation, and where there is no record evidence to support imposing clear limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Court's Decision Wastes the Commission's Limited Resources by Requiring\n   </em>\n   Pro Forma\n   <em>\n    Annual Rehearings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that the court's decision was erroneous because it grants\n   <em>\n    pro forma\n   </em>\n   annual rehearings for offenders who are not suitable for parole. It asserts that that the court's opinion \"misallocat[es] parole decisionmakers' resources away from more parole-suitable prisoners\" by mandating that the Commission \"go through the motions of needless annual hearings for prisoners for whom parole is not reasonably probable.\" Def.'s Mem. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.80\">\n    at 9-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both cases have been on the books for over 15 years, yet Defendant did not cite either when it opposed Plaintiffs' Motion. Nor did the Commission advance the argument that it makes now that the Settlement Agreement should be interpreted to preserve the Commission's resources. For that reason alone, reconsideration is not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patton Boggs LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894715,3772222\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/397/\">\n    683 F.3d at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   But the court disagrees with Defendant on the merits as well. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   both involve Ex Post Facto Clause challenges to retroactive application of law or policy that resulted in a longer time period between parole hearings than the prisoner would have faced under the rules applicable at the time of the offense. In both cases, the Supreme Court found there to be no Ex Post Facto Clause violation. Here, of course, the Ex Post Facto Clause is not at issue. The question presented is governed by contract law principles, not constitutional ones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Drake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286727\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/4/450/#p453\">\n    4 A.3d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (D.C. 2010) (stating that settlement agreements \"are construed under general principles of contract law,\" and that they are enforced \"just like any other contract\" (internal quotation marks omitted) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Makins v.

Cir. 2002) (\"Settlement agreements are in the nature of contracts.\"). Thus,\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   's focus on conserving resources in the Ex Post Facto Clause context has little bearing on the instant dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant tries to avoid this obvious disconnect by arguing that the Settlement Agreement \"does not permit the plaintiffs to sidestep case law interpreting the parole regulations, nor may they seek to impose requirements at variance with the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   and due process principles that undergird many decisions addressing prisoners' challenges on parole matters.\" Def.'s Mem. at 4 n.1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   April Hr'g Tr. at 5-6 (\"[T]he Commission obviously intended to act in conformity with all the jurisprudence governing ex post facto challenges to parole determinations.\"). In doing so, the Commission seems to suggest that it sought only to do the bare minimum required by the Constitution when conducting parole proceedings for Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   If that was the parties' intention it is not at all apparent on the face of either the Settlement Agreement or the New Regulation. Under the District of Columbia's \"objective\" law of contracts, \"a party's unexpressed intent is irrelevant if a contract is unambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Dyer v. Bilaal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292029\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/983/349/#p355\">\n    983 A.2d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (D.C. 2009) (internal citation omitted). In this case, the Commission agreed that it would act in \"good\n   faith\" to apply the New Regulation as written; nothing on the face of the Settlement Agreement or the New Regulation suggests, let alone states, that the parties thought themselves limited by existing Ex Post Facto Clause jurisprudence. If anything, the circumstances support the opposite conclusion. When it promulgated the final New Regulation, the Commission observed that, because of the broad discretion conferred by the 2000 Guidelines, \"federal courts have declined to find that [the] Commission's use of its revised guidelines violates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause.\" 80 Fed. Reg. at 63,115. The Commission nevertheless decided to apply the 1972 Regulations to offenders who committed crimes before March 3, 1985, but had not yet been granted parole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Settlement Agreement. The Commission later reaffirmed that position in this case, when its General Counsel represented that although in\n   <em>\n    Sellmon v. Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553908\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/551/66/#p85\">\n    551 F.Supp.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Judge Huvelle determined that \"not all retroactive application of changed rules implicates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause for all prisoners,\" the Commission decided to apply the 1972 Guidelines for \"administrative convenience and consistency.\" Krapels Decl. \u00b6 4. (citing\n   <em>\n    Sellmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553908\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/551/66/#p85\">\n    551 F.Supp.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). These statements demonstrate that the Commission, by agreeing to apply the law in effect at the time of Plaintiffs' offenses, viewed itself as going beyond the strictures of the Ex Post Facto Clause. It is bewildering that the Commission now says otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    4. Staying a Decision Pending Appeal of Related Matters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, if the court does not grant its motion in full, the Commission asks to delay any action on this case until the D.C. Circuit decides two pending cases-\n   <em>\n    Ray v. Smoot\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-5135 (D.C. Cir. docketed May 31, 2016), and\n   <em>\n    Ford v. Massarone\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-5298 (D.C. Cir. argued Apr. 26, 2018). According to Defendant, both pending appeals present issues substantially similar to this one. Because \"the Circuit may well further opine on the scope of the Commission's discretion concerning parole rehearing set-offs for D.C. Code offenders,\" Defendant asks the court to hold off on deciding this motion until the Circuit rules in those cases. Def.'s Mem. at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The court declines the Commission's invitation. There is no good reason to wait. The court ruled against the Commission on Plaintiffs' Motion to Enforce months ago, and Defendant's present motion has only prolonged this litigation. Meanwhile, offenders who \"ordinarily\" are supposed to receive hearings on an annual basis wait for a final order enforcing the parties' agreement. Any further delay is simply not warranted. The court therefore will not delay this matter pending the D.C. Circuit's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ray\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment in Part, ECF No. 102, is denied in part and granted in part. As explained in this Memorandum Opinion, the court reaffirms its decision that the Commission breached the Settlement Agreement by not scheduling the vast majority of offenders for rehearings within one year. The court, however, amends that portion of its Order that constrains the Commission's discretion to exceed the \"ordinary\" one-year set-off only in cases of recent, verifiable disciplinary problems.
