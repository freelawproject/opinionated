This is particularly true where the death was sudden and violent. How the claimant learned of decedent's death, and whether there was an opportunity to say good-bye or view the body can be a significant factor contributing to the claimant's anguish....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The calculations for mental anguish and loss of society share some common considerations. First, the calculation should be based upon the anticipated duration of the injury. Claims for mental anguish belong to the claimants and should reflect anticipated persistence of mental anguish in excess of that which would have been experienced following decedent's natural death....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The nature of the relationship between the claimant and the decedent is another critical factor in the solatium analysis. If the relationship is strong and close, the likelihood that the claimant will suffer mental anguish and loss of society is substantially increased, particularly for intangibles such as companionship, love, affection, protection, and guidance. Numerous factors enter into this analysis, including: strong emotional ties between the claimant and the decedent; decedent's position in the family birth order\n   relative to the claimant; the relative maturity or immaturity of the claimants; whether decedent habitually provided advice and solace to claimants; whether the claimant shared interests and pursuits with decedent; as well as decedent's achievements and plans for the future which would have affected claimants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, unlike lost wages, which can be calculated with a fair degree of mathematical certainty, solatium cannot be defined through models and variables.... This is the paradox of solatium; although no amount of money can alleviate the emotional impact of a child's or sibling's death, dollars are the only means available to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/#p30\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/#p30\">\n    at 30-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other courts have distilled the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   down to five factors to consider when awarding solatium damages.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In calculating damages for loss of solatium in the case of a deceased family member, this district court has considered a variety of factors to include: (1) whether the decedent's death was sudden and unexpected; (2) whether the death was attributable to negligence or malice; (3) whether the claimants have sought medical treatment for depression and related disorders resulting from the decedent's death; (4) the nature (i.e., closeness) of the relationship between the claimant and the decedent; and (5) the duration of the claimants' mental anguish in excess of that which would have been experienced following the decedent's natural death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Stethem v.

These opinions represent the judgments of colleagues that\n   <em>\n    Heiser\n   </em>\n   offers a useful calculus which each adopts in FSIA cases. The Court appreciates the advocacy of counsel but again declines to adopt\n   <em>\n    Heiser\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As they request, the Court contrasts the Fraenkels' claims to those of the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   and concludes that the public nature of the horrific beheadings in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   and the resulting trauma to the decedents' families from seeing, in graphic detail, the heartless nature of those killings and their decedent's pain and suffering, called for a high award of solatium damages. Without doubt, the Fraenkel family has suffered substantial and ongoing grief that has affected the entire family unit, including the very youngest child who was so young at the time of Naftali's murder that his parents spared him all discussion of it. The Court intends no disrespect to the family by saying that Naftali's death did not have the particularly painful aspects of the\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   killings. Solatium damages are damages for \"injury to feelings\" that result \"from the fact of decedent's death\" and, as described in\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   , the Court should consider how the family learned of the decedent's death.\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/#p30\">\n    999 F.Supp. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Gates\n   </em>\n   witnessed the video of the horrific beheadings of their loved ones is an additional \"fact\" of those decedents' deaths that weighed in favor of a greater award than in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Considering the entire record and the individual supplemental declarations from most of the Fraenkel family, the Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   factors favor an increase in their damages for loss of\n   solatium. The Court notes that siblings of victims generally receive less than spouses or parents and the Court should consider \"the relative maturity or immaturity of the claimants\" when fashioning a solatium award.\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282167\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/999/1/#p30\">\n    999 F.Supp. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court will award $2,000,000 in damages for loss of solatium to Abraham Fraenkel and Rachelle Fraenkel, and $750,000 in such damages to Tzvi Fraenkel, Ayala Fraenkel, A.L. Fraenkel, N.E. Fraenkel, N.S. Fraenkel, and S.R. Fraenkel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Drained of any impermissible considerations and focusing only on the\n   <em>\n    Flatow\n   </em>\n   factors and the Circuit's remand in light of the entire record, the Court concludes that the members of the Fraenkel family should receive higher awards than previously granted for loss of solatium. Therefore, the Court awards the following solatium damages:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-40\">Rachelle Fraenkel - $2,000,000 Abraham Fraenkel - $2,000,000 Tzvi Amitay Fraenkel - $2,000,000 Ayala Chaya Hinda Fraenkel - $750,000 A.L.Fraenkel - $750,000 N.E.Fraenkel - $750,000 N.S.Fraenkel - $750,000 S.R.Fraenkel - $750,000</pre>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The hearing transcript is set forth in two volumes, one for each day of the hearing.

Supp. Mem. at 37 (arguing that decedents were \"adult employees of a civilian contractor operating in Iraq in September 2004, just after four civilian contractors working for Blackwater USA in Iraq were killed and their bodies were burned on camera. They were knowingly working adjacent to an active war zone-a dangerous environment to say the least!-and had been correspondingly well paid.... Their kidnapping and beheading was certainly not expected by anyone, but it cannot be said that the\n    <em>\n     Gates\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs were without warning.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
