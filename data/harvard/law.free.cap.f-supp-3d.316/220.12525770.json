INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action involves a dispute over the standards an agency must meet when mailing notices to regulated individuals. Plaintiff Robert Oneal Bean sued Sonny Perdue, the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\"), claiming that USDA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by failing to notify him of certain key information related to his USDA loan. More specifically, Mr. Bean alleges that he did not receive a letter that summarized USDA's decision not to reconsider accelerating his loan, and that explained his rights to mediation and appeal of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   USDA has moved for summary judgment, asserting that it was not required by any regulation to send the letter at issue, and that regardless of the governing regulations, the record shows that the letter was sent. Although the Court finds that USDA regulations and internal handbook procedures required USDA to send the letter at issue, Mr. Bean has failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether it complied with those regulations and procedures. Accordingly, for the reasons stated below, the Court grants Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Murphy Oil USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   is particularly instructive, because it involved a similar summary judgment dispute over whether a notice was mailed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n    503 F.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2007). In that case, the plaintiff claimed that he did not receive a notice containing updates to his employee benefit plan, and therefore that there was a material dispute of fact regarding whether his employer violated statutory reporting and disclosure requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n    at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff argued that because the fact of receipt was in dispute, the court should apply the mailbox rule, which would allow him to rebut the \"presumption that [a properly and timely mailed] document has been received.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n    at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The court, however, chose not to directly apply the mailbox rule because the Department of Labor's regulations interpreting the relevant statutory requirements focused on whether the notice was\n   <em>\n    sent\n   </em>\n   via reasonable means and not on whether it was actually received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court instead referenced the mailbox rule as an evidentiary guidepost to determine whether there was a genuine dispute as to the fact of mailing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [W]e refuse to fully adopt [the] \"inverse mailbox rule\" in this setting, such that a plaintiff's bare assertion of non-receipt could create a genuine issue of material fact to survive summary judgment. To do so would essentially require proof of receipt on the employer's part where the regulations only require proof of mailing. But while proof of receipt is unnecessary, we cannot forget that proof of mailing is still required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n    at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court held that there was a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the notice was mailed because the employer did not provide any physical evidence of mailing, such as \"business records, a signed receipt from certified mail, or a post-marked envelope,\" and there was additional circumstantial evidence of non-receipt.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2920377\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/415/\">\n    at 419-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, USDA has provided both physical and testimonial evidence that it mailed the Response Letter. USDA's physical evidence consists of (1) a copy of the Response Letter's certified mailing envelope, sent on June 27, 2014 and returned on July\n   17, 2014; (2) handwriting on the same envelope which indicates that the letter was re-sent by First Class regular mail on July 17; and (3) a copy of the Response Letter dated June 27, 2014 and marked with a mailing number corresponding to the number on the certified mailing envelope. Def.'s Mot. Ex. 5. USDA also submitted written testimony by Officer Palmer, who stated that he sent the Response Letter by certified mail on June 27, and upon its return on July 17 immediately re-sent the letter by First Class regular mail.

Mr. Bean has not provided more than a bare assertion of non-receipt, and there is no circumstantial evidence indicating that the agency failed to send the Response Letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 2.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As explained above, there is no genuine dispute of fact regarding whether USDA sent the Response Letter, and the parties do not otherwise dispute that USDA complied with all relevant regulations and internal procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20766\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subpt.
