But unlike the agency there, here EPA did not defend its redactions throughout administrative proceedings and litigation; instead, EPA promptly conferred with EIP and sought to address EIP's concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Elizabeth White \u00b6 31.

Decl. of Elizabeth White \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. At the time, EPA faced a 1200% increase in FOIA requests compared with the same time period the previous year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. EPA also faced ten pending lawsuits on FOIA requests, over which the same three OEX employees presided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. During August and September of 2017, while EPA was preparing to produce the remaining calendar and travel records, the Chief of Staff's ability to review records was hindered by the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. All of these factors support the conclusion that unintentional administrative burdens and unavoidable outside factors delayed EPA's response, and that EIP's lawsuit did not cause the eventual release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The record also demonstrates that in the face of these unavoidable factors, EPA exercised due diligence to ensure the request was processed. Courts have held that a plaintiff's lawsuit was not the catalyst for an agency's delayed release of documents when the defendant made a good-faith effort to search for information and respond to the FOIA request, and the ultimate release was the result of a diligent, ongoing process that began before the initiation of the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Calypso Cargo Ltd. v.

Here, EPA conducted a search for responsive documents before EIP filed the complaint. Decl. of Elizabeth White \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20. On the same day EIP filed its FOIA request, EPA obtained a partially responsive version of Administrator Pruitt's calendar and then later sent it to EIP before litigation commenced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Also before EIP filed the complaint, OEX staff requested the remaining responsive calendar files from OA and received the travel voucher records from OEX.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19. These actions reflect a good faith effort to respond to EIP's request and a diligent ongoing process that began before the initiation of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   EIP points to statements made in the course of litigation to support its assertion that EPA was not in fact exercising due diligence. Because EPA asserted in its answer the affirmative defense that EIP's request was \"overbroad\" and EPA did not request clarification of the request, EIP claims EPA's searches for documents must not have been reasonable. Reply in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. for Att'ys' Fees and Costs [ECF No. 31] at 8. Failure to request\n   clarification could result in an ineffectual search not reasonably calculated to produce responsive results.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pinson v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166049\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/61/164/#p180\">\n    61 F.Supp.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 180-81 (D.D.C. 2015) (finding the government's search was not \"reasonable [or] adequate\" when it did not request necessary supplemental information before running the search). Here, however, nothing suggests that EPA lacked sufficient information or that its searches were not calculated to locate responsive documents. EPA had already released some calendar records to EIP before the filing of the lawsuit and then released responsive travel records before it filed its answer. Decl. of Elizabeth White \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21. It appears that clarification of EIP's request was unnecessary-and indeed was not provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   EPA's failure to use FOIA's statutory mechanisms to extend its time to respond to EIP's request also is not indicative of a lack of due diligence. An agency may extend FOIA's twenty-day statutory time limit by notifying the requester and providing the requester with an opportunity to either limit the scope of the request or arrange an alternate time frame.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(B)(i)-(ii).

Given that EPA has not relied on the administrative exhaustion requirement to bar this lawsuit and began processing and responding to EIP's request before EIP filed its complaint, EPA's failure to adhere to statutory mechanisms does not establish that EIP's lawsuit caused EPA's release of responsive documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     THE COURT'S AUGUST 21, 2017 ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   EIP also suggests that it has \"substantially prevailed\" because the Court's August 21, 2017 scheduling order constitutes a \"judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree\" through which it obtained relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 9;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(E)(ii)(I).
