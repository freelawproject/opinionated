In doing so, we are confronted with two competing principles for determining the lead plaintiffs-the presumptive lead plaintiff rule and the preference for appointing institutional investors. We must also choose the appropriate method for calculating who has the larger financial interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Even if we use the measure proposed by the two individuals seeking appointment, their aggregate financial interest is only minimally greater than the institutional investor. Under these circumstances, we conclude the institutional investor preference outweighs the presumptive lead plaintiff rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 14, 2017, Alexandre Pelletier filed a class action complaint asserting that the defendants, Endo International plc, its former and present CEOs, and its CFO violated Sections 10(b) and\n   20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. The complaint alleges that Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. (\"Par\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endo, conspired with several other pharmaceutical companies to fix generic drug prices in violation of the federal antitrust laws. It alleges that Endo and its officers made false or misleading public statements and failed to disclose or actively concealed material adverse facts about Endo's business, operations, prospects and revenue, artificially inflating Endo's share prices. The complaint asserts a fraud-on-the-market theory of loss causation, alleging that each of three corrective disclosures made on November 3, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   March 1, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and October 31, 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   caused the market value of Endo's securities to drop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contemporaneously with filing his complaint, Pelletier caused notice of the pending class action to be published on PR Newswire. On January 16, 2018, two motions for appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel were filed. Wayne A. Wingard and Nathan Joseph Dole moved for appointment as lead plaintiffs, and the appointment of Pomerantz LLP as lead counsel, and Pribanic and Pribanic LLC as liaison counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Park Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (the \"Fund\") moved for appointment as lead plaintiff and the appointment of Bleichmar Fonti &amp; Auld LLP as lead counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A court must appoint a lead plaintiff whom it \"determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members.\" 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i).

According to this formula, only those losses that are proximately caused by the defendant's fraud are recoverable. Consequently, losses incurred before disclosure of the relevant misrepresentation are not included in recoverable loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We agree with the Fund. What the plaintiffs lost is what they may recover. Including losses that were incurred before any disclosure could not have been caused by any disclosures and are not recoverable. Thus, those shares are not included in the \"largest financial interest\" calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Fund calculates its loss to be $187,000 and the Wingard-Dole group's loss at $132,000, giving the Fund the larger financial interest. Excluding from the calculation those shares purchased at inflated prices and sold at inflated prices before disclosure of the relevant misrepresentation, the Fund purchased 20,000 more shares of Endo stock than the Wingard-Dole group. Hence, applying a\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Fund's net loss is greater than that of the Wingard-Dole group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Lax\n   </em>\n   factors, adopted by the Third Circuit, are the (1) number of shares purchased during the putative class period; (2) the total net funds expended by the plaintiffs during that period; and the approximate losses suffered by the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Cendant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483272\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/201/#p262\">\n    264 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   262 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lax v.

The Wingard-Dole group purchased 65,605 shares during the class period, which is 4,769 more shares that the Fund purchased during the class period. However, the 65,605 shares purchased by the Wingard-Dole group include 38,730 shares that were not affected by the disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The PSLRA does not provide any guidance as to the method for calculating the largest financial interest. It speaks of the \"largest financial interest in the relief sought.\" It does not reference loss, but references damages-\"the relief sought.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The calculation of financial interest is impacted by the statutory limitation imposed on damages. In the PSLRA, Congress placed a cap on damages recoverable in a private securities fraud action. Section\n   21D of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 sometimes referred to as the \"look back\" or \"bounce back\" provision, states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   in any private action...in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, the award of damages to the plaintiff shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or received, as appropriate, by the plaintiff for the subject security and the mean trading price of that security during the 90-day period beginning on the date on which the information correcting the misstatement or omission that is the basis for the action is disseminated to the market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206145114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78u-4(e)(1). The \"mean trading price\" is defined as the \"average of the daily trading price of that security, determined as of the close of the market each day during the 90-day period\" following the disclosure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20461036\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78u-4(e)(3).

For those held at the time of the second disclosure, the 90-day period begins on March 1, 2017, and ends on May 29, 2017. Each of the movants sold some or all of their Endo shares prior to expiration of the applicable 90-day period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The movants have not submitted historical data about daily trading prices for Endo's shares during that period. Consequently, on this record, we cannot apply the \"bounce back\" calculation to accurately determine each movant's recoverable damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties do not dispute the mean trading price for Endo securities for 90 days following the second disclosure on March 1. The Wingard-Dole group estimates the mean trading price at $11.4006. We cannot calculate the mean trading price for securities sold before expiration of the 90-day period because the mean trading price is an average of the securities daily closing prices and movants have not provided the daily trading prices for Endo securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Movants cite and apply only the 90-day period following the second disclosure on March 1, 2017. The Wingard-Dole group's loss chart has a column headed, \"90-Day Mean Price $11.4006 Estimated Value,\" which is proffered as the estimated daily average mean trading price under the PSLRA \u00a7 78u-(e)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The chart shows the estimated mean price for the 90-day period following the second disclosure on March 1, 2017. Without further explanation, the chart applies the estimated mean trading price only to Dole's transactions and lists a sum-total figure of $29,927.00, used as a deduction from Dole's gross total losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, the Fund \"values\" its shares under the PSLRA's limitation of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the 49,274 shares that the Fund retained at the end of the class period on February 28, 2017, the Fund values those shares \"at the average price from March 1, 2017 to May 26, 2017.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fund sold those 49,274 retained shares on April 17, 2017, and the Fund values those sales \"at the maximum sale price and the average price up to the date of sale.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   For those shares, however, the Fund lists the actual sales price at $10.9285, which presumably would be adjusted separately to reflect the mean trading price under \u00a7 78u-4(e)(2),(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ending on the date of sale of the shares, April 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Fund and Wingard sold all the shares they held before the first disclosure on November 3, 2016. However, they reentered the market, the Fund purchasing Endo shares on November 3, 2016 and later, and Wingard purchasing and then selling them in December, 2016. Wingard later purchased shares on January 6, 2017, all of which he sold on May 19, 2017. As to Wingard's in-and-out transactions during December, 2016, made more than a month after the first disclosure, the price of Endo shares had already been corrected by the first disclosure and reflected in the market price that Wingard paid. In other words, the purchase price had adjusted for the first disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 17, 2017, the Fund sold all of its retained shares at prices lower than what it had paid to purchase the shares. The Fund sold at $10.9285 per share. Whether or not this is more or less than the PSLRA mean trading price is not clear. The Fund sold the shares before expiration of the 90-day period following the second disclosure and we do not have the average mean daily trading price for that period. On May 9, 2017, Wingard sold all of his remaining shares at $12.5200 per share, a price lower than what he had paid to purchase them. Again, whether this is more or less than the PSLRA mean trading price is not clear. Wingard sold his shares before expiration of the 90-day period following the second disclosure. He has not provided the average mean daily trading price for that period. However, in light of the Wingard-Dole group's estimated mean trading price for the full 90-day period, $11.4006, it appears that Wingard sold his shares on May 9, 2017, at prices above the PSLRA mean trading price, resulting in no recoverable loss on those shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Dole's loss is more complicated. Dole sold 650 shares before the first disclosure on November 3, 2016. On November 2, 2016, he held 3,300 shares. The following day, the date of the first disclosure, he purchased 3,875 more shares.

On March 15 and March 29, 2017, Dole sold 3,050 shares prior to expiration of the PSLRA's 90-day period for the second disclosure, which began on March 1, 2017. Accordingly, for the most part, Dole's losses are limited by a specific mean trading price for the period that begins on March 1, 2017, and ends on the date he sold his shares on March 15 and March 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Fund proposes that under the\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   analysis, \"all shares bought and sold prior to the November 3rd disclosure should be excluded from the movants' loss calculations as unrelated to the fraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fund also proposes that \"purchases and sales that occur in between the corrective disclosures should be excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512038\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/454/#p461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying these methods to the facts presented here, the Fund maintains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Wingard completely sold out of his Endo position before the November 3rd disclosure.

He had no Endo shares before the first disclosure on November 3, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Wingard purchased 43,000 shares during the period December 15, 2016, through January 6, 2017, before the second disclosure on March 1, 2017. He completed two \"in-and-out\" transactions before the second disclosure on March 1, 2017. On December 15, 2016, he purchased 10,000 shares, and sold them the following day. On December 21, 2016, he purchased another 10,000 shares and sold them two days later. After each in-and-out transaction, Wingard held no shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Fund contends that losses should be calculated using the traditional measure of out-of-pocket damages-that is, the difference between the purchase price and the true value of the securities after disclosure of the fraud, adjusted for the mean trading price under the PSLRA. The Fund uses FIFO/LIFO methods to match purchases with sales to derive losses. Specifically, the Fund first excludes all gains and losses on shares bought and sold before the first disclosure on November 3, 2016, resulting in excluding all gains and losses on its June 7, June 10, and June 24, 2016 purchases, all of which shares the Fund sold on August 9 and August 16, 2016. The Fund applies LIFO and FIFO accounting methods to the remaining\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   eligible purchases of 49,274 shares that it made during the class period between November 3, 2016, and December 22, 2017, all of which were sold on April 17, 2017. Those trades result in the Fund's\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   FIFO/LIFO loss of $187,273.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Whether we accept the Wingard-Dole calculation of loss as resulting in its having an approximately greater loss of $6,000 or the Fund's calculation that it has a greater loss of $55,000, we conclude the Fund's status as an institutional investor favors it over the two individual investors whose apparent aggregate loss, by their own calculations, is slightly greater than the Fund's. The Fund is more capable of representing the interests of the loss members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Individual Investor Preference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After Pomerantz LLP published notice of the class action on\n   <em>\n    Globe Newswire\n   </em>\n   , Wingard and Dole separately contacted the firm's New York office about joining the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pomerantz introduced Wingard and Dole to each other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512038\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/454/#p461\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither Wingard nor Dole had previously been a client of the firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   When the movant is a \"group of persons,\" we ask whether the way the group was formed would preclude it from doing its job.
