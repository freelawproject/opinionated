ECF Nos. 15, 18, 23, 37. Prout brings claims for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty against individual defendant Anne C. Vladeck and against Vladeck &amp; Vladeck, Raskin, Clark, P.C. (the \"Vladeck Firm\"). He alleges that defendants agreed to represent him in a dispute with his then-employer, Invesco, Ltd., advised him to reject a settlement offer of over $1 million in favor of litigation, and then failed to file any claims on Prout's behalf or otherwise preserve those claims. Prout contends that, as a result, the statutes of limitations applicable to his claims under the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act lapsed and he was forced to settle for substantially less than he could have received but for defendants' alleged misconduct. Prout also alleges that defendants have refused to return the $5,000 retainer fee he paid and failed to produce their file relating to his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prout filed the instant action on January 11, 2018. ECF No. 1. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint and to disqualify Sanford Heisler as counsel on March 21, 2018. ECF Nos. 15, 18. In response, Prout amended his complaint. ECF No. 21. The Court accordingly granted defendants leave to file a supplemental memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss (now deemed to be a motion to dismiss the amended complaint), which they did. ECF No. 23. At a hearing on defendants' motions held on May 1, 2018, counsel for plaintiff informed the Court that plaintiff was barred, under the terms of his settlement agreement with Invesco, Ltd. (\"Invesco\"), from advancing certain allegations supporting his claims absent a court order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 34 at 21:19-23:5. The Court therefore ordered Prout to file a Second Amended Complaint by no later than May 8 that included all allegations necessary to support his claims, including those allegations that he would otherwise be barred from disclosing under the terms of his settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:4-6; ECF No. 31. Following Prout's filing of the Second Amended Complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32, both parties submitted additional briefing on defendants' motion to dismiss (now deemed to be addressed to the Second Amended Complaint),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 37, 40, 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The pertinent factual allegations, drawn from the Second Amended Complaint and viewed in the light most favorable the plaintiff, are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Prout's Employment at Invesco, Ltd.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Alexander Prout worked for Invesco, a financial services firm, from 2003 to 2014. Second Amended Complaint (\"Second Am. Compl.\") at \u00b6 11, ECF No. 32. Throughout his time there, Prout received an annual compensation of approximately $1.5 million, including an annual salary of $436,000 and a bonus (in stock and cash) of approximately $1.1 million. Prout also received benefits such as a life insurance policy, health insurance, and a housing allowance (valued at approximately $10,000 per month).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prout first served as the CEO of Invesco Japan, in which capacity he reported to Andrew Lo, Invesco's Senior Managing Director of Asia Pacific.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. During Prout's tenure as CEO, Invesco\n   Japan's Sourced Revenue increased more than 600%; its Managed Revenue increased 300%; and its Assets Under Management grew from $2.4 billion to $28 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. In addition, the office expanded from 55 to 160 employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2011, an earthquake hit Japan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. After learning that nuclear material had leaked and that his daughters' school in Tokyo would not reopen for the remainder of the school year, Prout moved his family to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout himself remained in Japan to \"stabilize the business\" until Invesco could hire a replacement for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eighteen months later, Invesco hired Alex Sato as the CEO of Invesco Japan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prout agreed to remain at Invesco Japan, as Chairman, to oversee the operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He served in this role from the fall of 2012 until August 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As Chairman, Prout worked on Invesco's global business strategy and maintained offices at Invesco's Atlanta headquarters, which were a relatively short commute from his family, who were then based in Naples, Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, since Prout continued to spend significant amounts of time in Asia, he and his family decided that his wife and youngest daughter would move to Hong Kong in the summer of 2013, while his second daughter, Chessy, would attend the St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, which Prout's oldest daughter already was attending, beginning in the fall of 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the summer of 2013, Prout began his third, and final, role at Invesco as the company's Managing Director and Regional Head of Institutional Business. In this role, he again reported to Andrew Lo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Prout, two incidents in 2014 helped put an end to his career at Invesco. First, in April 2014, Prout learned that Sato had purchased a $4,000 bottle of wine for a senior executive of Japan Post Bank-a quasi-governmental institution in Japan-during a dinner in New York City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18. Prout also learned that Sato had bragged about having paid for the wine from his personal account-\"seemingly to throw off any internal investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Moreover, following Sato's purchase, Invesco received additional sales from Japan Post Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Concerned that this gift from an employee of Invesco (a publicly traded company) to a foreign official violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Prout reported the incident to Asha Balachandria, Head of Legal for Invesco Asia Pacific.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. After making the report, Prout asked Balachandria how he should escalate his concern. In response, she laughed and said, \"You know that if you report to Andrew [Lo] he'll shit on your head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Prout nonetheless reported the violation to Lo, whose response \"was, effectively, 'So what?' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Lo thereafter became \"increasingly hostile\" toward Prout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, in late May 2014, Prout flew from Hong Kong to New Hampshire for his oldest daughter's graduation from St. Paul's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at SI 24. That weekend, a male student raped Prout's second daughter, Chessy, who at that time was also a student at the school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout informed Mary Wang, Invesco's Regional Head of Human Resources based in Hong Kong, that he would need to remain in the United States to care for his daughter who had been sexually assaulted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He used vacation and personal days to take this leave, continuing to perform some work remotely and remaining in regular contact with Lo and his colleagues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A few weeks later, Lo demanded that Prout return to Hong Kong for a meeting to be held in late June.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. Prout did so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to the meeting, Lo became \"irate\" about formatting issues in a report that they were planning to discuss at the\n   meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout explained that the content was correct and that the formatting could be corrected before the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, Lo cancelled the meeting and stormed off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Approximately an hour later, Prout approached Lo and explained the reason for his leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. In response, Lo said, \"I certainly hope Chessy learns better judgment in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout raised these comments with Wong, who apologized for Lo's behavior, stating that Lo is not a \"family man\" and doesn't have daughters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the remainder of the summer, Prout cared for his daughter in the United States while working remotely and staying in regular contact with his team in Hong Kong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendants' Representation of Prout\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 13, 2014-after his report of Sato's gift but a few weeks before his daughter Chessy's assault at St. Paul's-Prout contacted Vladeck, seeking representation in his dispute with Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at I 22. He told Vladeck that he was seeking advice regarding separation options and communicated to her what had transpired with Lo and Balachandria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Vladeck and the Vladeck Firm agreed to assist him and they entered into an attorney-client relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At that time, Vladeck indicated to Prout that he had whistleblower retaliation claims that could form the basis for a negotiated settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 2, 2014, Vladeck, on behalf of herself and the Vladeck Firm, sent Prout an engagement letter outlining the terms of Prout's agreement with the Vladeck Firm, including the Vladeck Firm's agreement to \"advise [Prout] regarding an exit strategy\" from his employer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Defendant Vladeck stated that she would be \"primarily responsible for the work\" related to Prout's case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout signed and returned the letter, along with a $5,000 retainer, the following day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 21, 2014, Prout contacted Invesco's General Counsel, Kevin Carome, stating that he worried that \"certain issues will expose the firm to potential liabilities and risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Carome responded that \"it actually would be better for each of us if you and I do not engage directly at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Carome directed Prout to speak to Robert Rigsby, the Managing Director of Legal, and Washington Dender, the Global Head of Human Resources.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Prout followed up, reiterating that he wanted to speak to Carome, and the two spoke on July 25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. Carome sought to characterize Prout's complaints as a \"human resources\" issue. He also suggested that Sato's gift had been investigated and resolved as \"mere overspend.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, on July 29, Prout spoke with Dender, who characterized Lo's offensive comments as \"mere personality conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. Dender further told Prout that he had two options: take a job with Invesco in the United States or leave the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Dender also suggested that there might not be any jobs available for Prout in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 4, Vladeck wrote to Invesco stating that she and the Vladeck Firm represented Prout in \"his claims of, inter alia, retaliation for raising concerns about potentially unlawful conduct; retaliation for taking family leave; and claims relating to the inappropriate conduct of his immediate supervisor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. That same day, Dender communicated to Prout that if he continued to call in sick, his absence would be considered \"job abandonment\" and therefore grounds for termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Vladeck spoke with Rigsby, who was handling the matter for Invesco, the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. According to Rigsby's notes on the conversation, Vladeck requested\n   FMLA leave on behalf of Prout. Rigsby wrote that he would \"relate the same to HR who will determine if such request will be with our [sic] without pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Dender then told Prout that he could commence family leave-and also that Prout would be fired if he did not take family leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. If Prout were fired, he would be paid for four months of garden leave (approximately $145,000) and be given vesting of some stock (approximately $123,000) but would be required to repay approximately $748,000 in expenses. Prout wrote back that Invesco had \"given [him] no choice\" but to take leave without pay to care for his daughter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 8, Dender followed up to say that the expenses Prout would be required to repay would be only $383,922.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. Dender also stated that Prout's last performance appraisal concluded that Prout \"Needs Improvement\" and that this rating would \"have to weigh into any agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dender then encouraged that Prout take \"Invesco leave,\" which was not job-protected, rather than FMLA leave because FMLA leave would require substantial paperwork.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 10, 2014, Prout contacted Lesa Tucker, who worked in Invesco benefits, to ask some questions about leave policy options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Prout learned from Tucker that he had been placed on \"Personal leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout spoke with Tucker by phone on August 19, during which call Tucker explained the difference between FMLA leave and personal leave, \"including ... that personal leave would not guarantee Prout's job.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 20, 2014, Prout applied for FMLA leave, attaching notes from his daughter's medical provider to his application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Prout's application was approved on September 9, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. Invesco granted Prout FMLA leave through October 31, 2014, anticipating that he would return to work on November 3, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. However, during Prout's leave, Lo actively searched for someone to replace Prout and told Prout's colleagues that Prout would not be returning to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42. Sato told Prout's colleagues that he was not returning to work because of performance issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In mid-October 2014, Dender told Prout that when he returned from leave, he should report to Invesco's Atlanta headquarters instead of his office in Hong Kong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. On November 3, 2014, when Prout arrived at Invesco's Atlanta headquarters, Dender presented Prout with two options: resign and receive $1,133,479 in compensation and stock vesting plus dividends or be fired for cause and receive $71,271.80 in compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Prout asked what the cause for termination would be and Dender responded that it would be Prout's 2013 performance evaluation, in which Lo had stated that Prout's performance needed improvement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dender provided no explanation for why Invesco waited until after Prout's return from FMLA leave to terminate him for conduct that had allegedly taken place more than eleven months earlier and had been documented in a review delivered more than six months earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Moreover, Prout believed that this 2013 review was \"inaccurate.\" When Prout received it, he did not sign it and instead notified Invesco's Human Resources department in Hong Kong that the report was incorrect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Vladeck advised Prout to reject Invesco's settlement proposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. She stated that Prout should not \"settle for pennies on the dollar\" and that he could get more if he filed a lawsuit. Vladeck told Prout that she believed she could get him a settlement equal to the value of his unvested stock in Invesco-roughly $3 million-in addition to payment of all of her attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Relying on Vladeck's advice, Prout let the offer expire and he was terminated effective November 20, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. He was paid through early December 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. In addition, because Invesco deemed his termination a \"voluntary resignation,\" it denied him vesting of 53,294 shares of Invesco stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. On December 5, 2014, this stock was valued at $41.15 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the period between December 2014 and October 2017, Prout earned approximately $2 million from other employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Vladeck and the Vladeck Firm did not thereafter prosecute Prout's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Nor did they ever request that Invesco agree to a tolling agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96. They did not advise Prout of the applicable statutes of limitations, including the 180-day deadline to file a charge with the Department of Labor in order to preserve a claim of whistleblower retaliation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. As a result, Prout never filed a claim with the Department of Labor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prout was himself aware of the two-year statute of limitations that applied to his FMLA claims and so repeatedly attempted to contact Vladeck about the status of his case and to prepare to file a lawsuit within the two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81, 83-92. For example, on September 27, 2016, Prout texted Vladeck that he \"would like to fix plan for Invesco as SOL is approaching.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89. Defendants did not respond to these messages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. Defendants failed to take any action to preserve or otherwise prosecute Prout's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Prout, Vladeck did not even attempt to contact Invesco between late 2014, when Prout rejected Invesco's separation offer, and October 20, 2016, the eve of the expiration of the FMLA's two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. Nor did Vladeck produce a complaint for defendant to review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 20, 2016, Vladeck spoke with Rigsby but did not reach a resolution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. Vladeck assured Prout that the three-year deadline for willful violations of the FMLA would apply to his case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Throughout defendants' three-year attorney client relationship with Prout, they never produced an invoice to inform Prout of hours worked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. However, defendants did \"demand[ ]\" that Prout pay them for the work allegedly done on his behalf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Prout's Retention of New Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In June 2017, Prout contacted Sanford Heisler seeking new counsel in his claims against Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99. On June 27, 2017, Prout emailed Vladeck, asking her to send any files that she had regarding his case to Sanford Heisler. He reiterated his request on July 1, 2017. Defendants did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On July 17, 2017, Sanford Heisler and defendants spoke by phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101. On this call, Sanford Heisler repeated Prout's request for his case files. Vladeck responded that Prout should email her to confirm that she could speak with Sanford Heisler. Prout accordingly emailed Vladeck so stating. Defendants still did not produce Prout's case file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 2, 2017, Vladeck emailed Sanford Heisler a summary of defendants' representation of Prout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102.

Cambria also noted that the two-year statute of limitations for any non-willful FMLA claim had passed, writing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [I]n November 2014, consistent with his request, Invesco presented Mr. Prout with a very generous severance package. However, other than repeated requests to extend his deadline for accepting it, Mr. Prout did not engage in discussions with Invesco about the substance of the package or make a counteroffer. It was only after Invesco's numerous attempts to obtain a response were ignored that Mr. Prout's employment with Invesco was terminated. Thus, far from engaging in \"willful\" misconduct, Invesco went above and beyond any legal obligations it owed to Mr. Prout.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114. Invesco further expressed its view that Dodd-Frank is inapplicable to Prout and that Prout had failed to file a charge with the Department of Labor, as was necessary to exhaust his claims under the anti-retaliation provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 115-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In October 2017, Invesco and Prout agreed to mediate their dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.

In support of this defense, however, defendants cite sources outside the pleadings. Specifically, defendants point to evidence that they learned in October 2016, ten days before the non-willful FMLA claim statute of limitations was set to expire, that Prout (i) had taken proprietary information and documents from his employer upon the end of his employment; and (ii) had not been completely truthful with his subsequent employer during its investigation concerning his taking of the proprietary information and documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law Submitted on Behalf of Defendants in Support of Their Motion To Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (\"Def.

But aside from the fact that the summary order in\n   <em>\n    Offor\n   </em>\n   expressly recites that it is non-precedential, the brief discussion in\n   <em>\n    Offor\n   </em>\n   involved a very different factual context than is presented in the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The issue here is whether Prout's legal position, and therefore his bargaining power at settlement, would plausibly have been made materially stronger if defendants had not allowed his non-willful FMLA claim to lapse. The very fact that the standard for willfulness is a high one, and that it involves inquiries into subjective states of mind that are inherently more difficult to prove than the objective facts that establish negligence, illustrates that, as a practical matter, preservation of a claim of a negligent violation of the FMLA is plausibly a material \"bargaining chip\" that Prout here lost by defendants' allowing the relevant statute of limitations to expire. Although it might be unusual for the kind of violation of the FMLA here alleged not to be willful (though Congress clearly contemplated that the two could be different and hence provided different statutes of limitations), it ignores the realities of hard bargaining for defendants to assert that Prout would not have been in a materially better bargaining position as to his settlement negotiations if he had still been able to argue that he was not required to prove a willful violation of the\n   FMLA because he had preserved the non-willful claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nor is this point a matter of speculation. On the contrary, as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, Invesco, in correspondence concerning the parties' dispute, expressly argued that it had not engaged in any \"willful\" conduct. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, Prout has plausibly alleged that defendants' failure to preserve his non-willful FMLA claim was materially detrimental to his bargaining power. Nor can this be viewed in isolation of his SOX claim. The combination of bargaining detriments he suffered from the loss of his non-willful FMLA claim and the loss of his SOX claim, discussed below, effectively compelled him to settle his claims, and to settle for less than he would have settled but for defendants' malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

This appears to be an open question. SOX makes it unlawful for a publicly traded company to \"discharge, demote, suspend, ... or in any other manner discriminate against an employee ... because of any lawful act done by the employee to provide information, cause information to be provided, or otherwise assist in an investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of 1) section 1341, 1343, 1344, or 1348, 2) any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or 3) any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The parties have identified one case holding that reporting an FCPA violation is never protected under SOX, one holding that it sometimes is protected, and a third holding that it is always protected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Asadi v.
