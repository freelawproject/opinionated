COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The UnitedHealthCare Insurance Company challenges a formal rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). When CMS filed the administrative record, Plaintiffs protested the absence of two documents which had been released by CMS under the Freedom of Information Act in another matter. CMS contends that the two documents are not properly part of the administrative record for this rulemaking and that they are privileged by the deliberative process privilege. The Court concludes that the documents, as redacted upon release, are no longer privileged and should be made part of the record here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are Medicare Advantage organizations in the UnitedHealth Group family of companies, the nation's leading provider of Medicare Advantage\n   health benefits plans (United). Under the Medicare Advantage program (MA), also known as Medicare Part C, private insurance companies provide Medicare insurance coverage to eligible individuals and are reimbursed by CMS on a pre-set, per-member-per-month basis, pegged to a dollar value for health care attributed to each diagnostic code submitted by medical providers, and adjusted based on demographic data. CMS undertakes various efforts to review and audit these reimbursements to ensure their accuracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By law, CMS is to pay MA insurers at rates that ensure \"actuarial equivalence\" with what Medicare pays directly for similar health care to participants in traditional Medicare, also called \"fee-for-service\" or FFS Medicare, or Medicare Part A and Part B. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-23(a)(1)(C)(i). Codes covering all manner of diagnoses are used by Medicare and MA to identify the illnesses or conditions affecting the covered populations. Given the millions of participants in Medicare, it is only to be expected that some diagnostic codes will be reported in error for a patient who does not have that illness or condition; in addition, Medicare suffers from some rate of fraud whereby health care providers intentionally report erroneous diagnoses to increase their repayments. As a result of these two factors, it is inevitable that Medicare experiences an error rate-that is, a proportion of diagnosis codes that are unsupported in underlying medical charts-that can be actuarially calculated and/or predicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CMS sets the rates to be paid to MA insurers according to the amounts Medicare itself pays directly to providers for the same diagnoses, without regard to the Medicare error rate for unsupported diagnoses. In January 2014, CMS published a notice of proposed rulemaking to affect MA insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%201918\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 1918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01 (Jan. 10, 2014). \"The proposed rule also include[d] several provisions designed to improve payment accuracy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%201918\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%201918\">\n    at 1918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After receiving comments, CMS published a Final Rule concerning MA overpayments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029844\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. 29844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 23, 2014) (2014 Overpayment Rule). The 2014 Overpayment Rule, challenged here, requires MA insurers to return to CMS payments that were based on incorrect diagnostic codes once the insurer discovers, or through reasonable diligence should have discovered, the error in any individual patient's chart.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029844\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029844\">\n    at 29923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Failure to do so exposes an insurer to a charge of having violated the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which can lead to treble damages, civil penalties, and debarment from federal contracts. Since a similar no-error standard is not applied by CMS in paying traditional Medicare providers, United alleges that MA insurers are not being reimbursed on an actuarially equivalent rate and that the 2014 Overpayment Rule must, perforce, be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   CMS studied just such an issue in a separate 2012 rulemaking, which concerned an audit program to determine the diagnostic accuracy of medical charts for MA beneficiaries. In these \"risk adjustment data validation,\" or RADV, audits, CMS reviews the medical records of a small sample of the patients covered by an MA insurance contract and then extrapolates the error rate of the sample to the entire population covered by that contract to determine whether the insurer had received an aggregate overpayment. As explained by CMS, \"RADV audits determine whether the diagnosis codes submitted by MA organizations can be validated by supporting medical record documentation.... Diagnoses that cannot be validated contribute to a payment error rate.\" Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation Methodology for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation Contract-Level\n   Audits (Feb. 24, 2012) (Notice of Final Methodology), AR 005311. On December 20, 2010, CMS posted on its website a request for comments titled \"Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) Notice of Payment Error Calculation Methodology for Part C Organizations Selected for Contract-Level RADV Audits: Request for Comment.\" AR 005020. After receiving more than 500 comments, CMS determined that it needed to include a \"Fee-for-Service Adjuster\" (FFS Adjuster) in the RADV audit process: when an RADV audit results in a determination that an MA insurer was paid based on unsupported diagnosis codes, the repayment the MA insurer owes to the government is adjusted downwards based on an estimated traditional Medicare payment error rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   CMS explained the rationale for including an FFS Adjuster in auditing payments to MA insurers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The FFS adjuster accounts for the fact that the documentation standard used in RADV audits to determine a contract's payment error (medical records) is different from the documentation standard used to develop the Part C risk-adjustment model (FFS claims). The actual amount of the adjuster will be calculated by CMS based on a RADV-like review of records submitted to support FFS claims data.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Notice of Final Methodology, AR 005314-15. This explanation reflected that an RADV audit determines a payment error rate based on actual medical records while the risk-adjustment model on which per-diagnosis rates are developed and paid is based on unaudited FFS claims. In 2012, CMS apparently intended to develop RADV-like audits of its own FFS claims data. As far as the record shows, that has not happened yet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The fact that CMS considered and adopted the FFS Adjuster in the context of RADV audits forms the basis for the motion to augment the administrative record for the 2014 Overpayment Rule. United obtained two documents originally disclosed to a third party through a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking records comprised of meeting materials in the files of certain named individuals, all but one of whom served as senior decisionmakers at CMS between the years 2011 and 2014 when the RADV audit methodology was under consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Daniel Meron (Meron Decl.)

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   United asserts that the FFS Adjuster Documents meet the criteria for supplementation. It argues that these two documents, known to senior CMS decisionmakers, must have been considered at least indirectly by them in the course of developing the 2014 Overpayment Rule. Notably, the administrative record for the 2014 Overpayment Rule includes a plethora of material relating to the FFS Adjuster, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , CMS's December 2010 request for comments on its proposed payment-error calculation methodology for RADV audits; nearly 300 pages of comments it received on that proposal; and its February 2012 announcement of the final payment-error calculation methodology, in which it included the FFS Adjuster. United contends that \"[i]t is simply not credible to suppose that in 2014 CMS reviewed the public comments concerning the FFS Adjuster but not its own senior staff analysis of those comments....\" Mot. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CMS denies that the FFS Adjuster Documents were considered by any of its decisionmakers when promulgating the 2014 Overpayment Rule, and states further that, even if the documents had been considered, they are the product of internal deliberations and subject to the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365925\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/40/#p47\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"materials reflecting an agency's internal deliberations should not be part of an administrative record\" because it could \"discourage candid discussion within the agency\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A party moving to include additional documents in the administrative record \"must identify reasonable, non-speculative grounds for its belief that the documents were considered by the agency,\"\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264705\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/751/74/#p78\">\n    751 F.Supp.2d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pac.

Here, by limiting its request to two documents, obtained through a FOIA request targeted towards senior decisionmakers in the relevant CMS office, United has met the \"specificity\" requirements to support its request. The questions are whether CMS decisionmakers could be said to have considered the documents, directly or indirectly, and whether, nonetheless, they are privileged and properly excluded from the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CMS does not dispute that the Administrative Record for the 2014 Overpayment Rule includes the CMS original proposed RADV methodology, the public comments it received on that proposal, and its final decision that included an FFS Adjuster in RADV audits. The FFS Adjuster Documents at issue address important considerations involved in that final decision. Nonetheless, CMS insists that these FFS Adjuster Documents were not considered, even indirectly, during promulgation of the 2014 Overpayment Rule, and argues that \"[i]f the agency wanted the views of its senior staff as to issues involved in the earlier proceeding and their bearing on the later proceeding, it\n   could have just asked them.\" Opp'n at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   One assumes, of course, that senior staff of CMS\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   consulted before the 2014 Overpayment Rule was promulgated, at least in some fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (acknowledging that \"many of the same CMS staff members were involved in the creation of the RADV sampling methodology and the Overpayment Rule\"). These staff members' knowledge of the FFS Adjuster concept inevitably would have been informed by the recent work presenting the FFS Adjuster Documents to explain the identical issues to executive management, with which the 2014 Overpayment Rule arguably conflicts. There is no real dispute about the provenance of the FFS Adjuster Documents or that CMS chose to include in the Administrative Record the public comments that appear to have led to the agency's analysis reflected in the FFS Adjuster Documents. These facts strongly suggest that CMS at least considered the FFS Adjuster Documents indirectly when promulgating the 2014 Overpayment Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee Mem'l Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365925\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/40/#p47\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting an administrative record appropriately includes \"all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, a district court may need \"to supplement the record with background information in order to determine whether the agency considered all of the relevant factors ....\"\n   <em>\n    Dist.

The Court finds that this is the case here: either CMS naturally considered its recent analysis of the FFS Adjuster and omitted the documents in error or because they are adverse to its current position, or it failed to consider all of the relevant factors in adopting the 2014 Overpayment Rule.

The Court agrees that the questions at issue and the deliberations that give rise to the privilege in question may be completely separate from a FOIA analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State of Del.

This conclusion is not surprising because only materials considered directly or indirectly in rulemaking should be part of the record on review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On the other hand, a document that was privileged as part of the deliberative process can lose its privilege when revealed outside the agency.\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 741-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the White House \"waived its claims of privilege in regard to the specific documents that it voluntarily revealed to third parties outside the White House\").
