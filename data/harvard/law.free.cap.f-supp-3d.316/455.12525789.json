Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Unseal Opening Class Certification Papers (ECF No. 174 (\"Mot. to Unseal\") ), arguing that defendants' confidentiality designations as to materials produced during discovery are overly broad, and since defendants have failed to justify these designations, all documents should be unsealed and unredacted in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also at issue are defendants' several motions to seal documents (ECF Nos. 160, 163, 177, and 179), which plaintiffs oppose, as well as plaintiffs' two motions to seal documents (ECF Nos. 157 and 172), which plaintiffs filed in compliance with the parties' Stipulated Protective Order (ECF No. 48), but they argue against the sealing of these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The question is whether defendants' confidentiality designations justify allowing significant redactions to pleadings and related declarations, in addition to the complete sealing of hundreds of pages of exhibits. Last year, this Court addressed potential redactions in a judicial opinion\n   related to plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re McCormick &amp; Co., Inc., Pepper Prods. Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418284\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/218/\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2017). The Court, concluding that the public interest in access to judicial records outweighed McCormick's interest in avoiding reputational harm, overruled McCormick's objections and published its opinion without redactions.\n   <em>\n    In re McCormick &amp; Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-mc-1825,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202560911\">\n    2017 WL 2560911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.D.C. June 13, 2017). Now, pleadings and declarations associated with the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, the motion to unseal, and the joint motion to exclude plaintiffs' expert, Armando Levy, are at issue. In addition to the extensive redaction of multiple pleadings and declarations, defendants ask that hundreds of pages of exhibits attached to these declarations remain under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, who are purchasers of defendant McCormick's black pepper, allege in their complaint that defendants \"had a statutory duty to refrain from unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the promotion and sale of McCormick black pepper or store-branded black pepper,\" (Second Am. Compl. Consol. Class Action Compl. \u00b6 115, ECF No. 128), and that they \"violated this duty by selling black pepper in non-transparent containers containing nonfunctional slack-fill.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. CLASS CERTIFICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 21, 2017, plaintiffs moved to certify three multistate classes under the consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws of more than thirty states and the District of Columbia, claiming that McCormick and Wal-Mart violated these laws when they knowingly sold black pepper in non-transparent containers containing non-functional slack fill, intending to minimize or eliminate consumers' ability to notice the reduced quantity of pepper by maintaining the same price and container size. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Class Cert. at 1-15, ECF No. 157-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Redacted Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When plaintiffs filed their memo in support of class certification, they moved to file it under seal (ECF No. 157) pursuant to the parties' Protective Order, and they filed a redacted version on the public docket as well. (ECF No. 159.) Redactions appear in the Table of Contents and on the following pages: 1-2, 4-5, 7-15, 18, 21, 23-24, 35, and 37-39. McCormick also filed a redacted version of its opposition to class certification (ECF No. 161) and moved to file an unredacted version under seal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 160.) These redactions appear on the following pages: 1 n.2, 4-6, 10, 19, 23-25, and 25 n.29. Finally, plaintiffs filed a redacted reply to McCormick's opposition to class certification (ECF No. 168) and moved to file an unredacted version under seal. (ECF No. 172.) Plaintiffs' reply includes redactions on the following pages: 8-9 &amp; n. 10, and 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Apart from the class certification pleadings, Wal-Mart filed its opposition to plaintiffs' motion to unseal with redactions and attached two redacted exhibits (ECF No. 180) and moved to file an unredacted version under seal. (ECF No. 179.) Exhibit A is the letter Wal-Mart's attorney Andrew Klevorn wrote in response to plaintiffs' initial challenge to defendants' confidentiality designations. (\"Klevorn Letter,\" ECF No. 179-1.) Exhibit B is the Declaration\n   of Wal-Mart employee Kassie Keeter, which identifies and explains commercially sensitive information that appears in Wal-Mart's exhibits. (\"Keeter Decl.,\" ECF No. 179-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In sum, three redacted class certification pleadings are at issue-plaintiffs' motion, McCormick's opposition, and plaintiffs' reply to McCormick-as well as Wal-Mart's opposition to plaintiffs' motion to unseal and the two exhibits attached to the opposition. Plaintiffs challenge all redactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Declarations and Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both plaintiffs and McCormick attach declarations, reports, and exhibits to their class certification pleadings. Several of these documents are heavily redacted or filed entirely under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Fegan Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs' Fegan Declaration-describing plaintiffs' underlying merits case-was filed as an affidavit in support of the class certification motion. (ECF No. 157-3.) Large swathes of the Fegan Declaration are redacted (ECF No. 158), including portions of pages 2, 5-17, 20-26, and 30-32. Most of the redacted information comes from defendants' documents, produced in discovery, which were filed as Exhibits 101-143 to the Fegan Declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 157.) Defendants say very little about the Fegan Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Levy Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs also filed a sealed copy of the report written by their damages expert, Armando Levy, as Exhibit 100 to the Fegan Declaration. (\"Levy Report,\" ECF No. 157-4). McCormick does not object to unsealing the Levy Report so long as \"any references ... to confidential materials [are] appropriately redacted.\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 3 n.2, ECF No. 176.) Wal-Mart appears to adopt a similar position, but expresses concern that the report shows how many \"units of select McCormick-supplied black pepper products\" Wal-Mart sold in each state for each month over the course of more than two years, as well as \"Wal-Mart's net sales of those products in each state for the same period.\" (Wal-Mart Opp. to Unseal at 3, ECF No. 179-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (requesting that the Court maintain under seal \"Wal-Mart documents attached to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and referenced in Dr. Levy's report\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Schmitt Declaration Exhibits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   McCormick filed the Schmitt Declaration as an affidavit in support of its opposition to class certification. (ECF No. 162.) Though the Schmitt Declaration itself contains no redacted material, McCormick moved to file three attachments to it under seal. (ECF No. 160.) These include the Hester Declaration as Exhibit 16 (ECF No. 160-3 (hereinafter \"Hester Decl.\") ); the Johnson Expert Report as Exhibit 19 (ECF No. 160-4 (hereinafter \"Johnson Report\") ); and selected Levy Deposition Excerpts as Exhibit 20. (ECF No. 160-5 (hereinafter \"Levy Deposition Excerpts\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Hester Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To support its argument that the Hester Declaration contains confidential business information, McCormick relies on the Declaration of Richard M. Morse, McCormick's Vice President of Global Customers. (ECF No. 176-6.) McCormick cites Morse to show that the Hester Declaration contains \"information regarding the sourcing and density of McCormick pepper, packaging processes and strategy, and historical filling practices\" (McCormick's Reply to\n   Seal Opp. to Class Cert. at 4), and argues that its disclosure \"could harm McCormick\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 10), and that \"none of this information is already available to the public.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiffs respond that the Hester Declaration \"is devoid of any information that could harm Defendants,\" characterizing it as containing \"general, historical discussions.\" (Opp. to Sealing McCormick Opp. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Johnson Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Johnson Report receives limited attention from the parties. Plaintiffs oppose the motion to file it under seal and lump together their analysis of the Levy Report, the Johnson Report, and the Hester Declaration. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Opp. to Sealing McCormick Opp. at 5 (referring to all three documents and explaining that they \"were filed with the Court and introduced into evidence as part of the class certification briefing\").) Plaintiffs describe \"Dr. Johnson's report [as] focused on refuting the conclusions in Dr. Levy's report.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) McCormick states that the Johnson Report refers to \"market research on changes to the pepper containers and reaction to those changes, third-party sales data, McCormick documents discussing the qualities and sourcing of pepper, and filling practices, and fill weights of McCormick pepper containers.\" (McCormick's Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Seal Opp. to Class Certification at 5, ECF No. 175 (\"McCormick's Reply to Seal Opp. to Class Cert.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that no redactions to these documents (the Fegan Declaration, the Hester Declaration, the Levy Report, and the Johnson Report) are justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fegan Declaration Exhibits 101-143\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Attached to the Fegan Declaration, plaintiffs filed 45 sealed exhibits consisting of more than 200 pages. Forty-three of these are company documents that defendants produced in discovery and designated as \"confidential\" or \"highly confidential.\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 4-5; Wal-Mart Opp. to Unseal at 2.) McCormick produced forty of these documents, and Wal-Mart produced three.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 2.) As above, plaintiffs argue that defendants have failed to demonstrate that these documents are properly designated as confidential and therefore challenge all designations and oppose sealing all Fegan Declaration Exhibits. (Mot. to Unseal \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT REPORT &amp; OPINIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 28, 2017, defendants jointly moved to exclude the report and opinions of plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Armando Levy. (ECF No. 164 (\"Mot. to Exclude\").) Plaintiffs retained Levy to calculate class-wide damages. He relied on facts and data in defendants' documents to draw conclusions about pepper sales and fill levels in the pepper containers and to explain his damage calculations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 n.16 &amp; Ex. B-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Redacted Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants filed a redacted version of their memo in support of the motion to\n   exclude the Levy Report (ECF No. 164-1) and moved to file the unredacted version under seal. (ECF No. 163.) Redactions appear on the following pages: 2 &amp; n.4, 3-7. Plaintiffs filed a redacted version of their opposition (ECF No. 170) and moved to file an unredacted version under seal. (ECF No. 172.) These redactions appear on the following pages: 2-3, 5, 7 &amp; n.2, 9, 14. Finally, defendants filed a redacted reply (ECF No. 178) and moved to file an unredacted version under seal. (ECF No. 177.) Defendants' reply includes redactions on the following pages: 3-4, 7 n.6. As a result, three redacted pleadings relating to the motion to exclude are at issue. Plaintiffs oppose all redactions. (Pls.' Opp. to Defs.' Mot. to File Mot. to Exclude Under Seal, ECF No. 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Levy Deposition Excerpts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants also filed three sealed exhibits as attachments to the motion to exclude. Two of these are the Levy Report and the Hester Declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the deposition excerpts, certain excerpted pages were filed as Exhibit B to the motion to exclude (ECF No. 163-4) and narrower, but overlapping, excerpts were filed as Exhibit 20 to the Schmitt Declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 160-5.) Together, the sealed exhibits include the following excerpts from the Levy Deposition: 29-30, 40-41, 43, 51-60, 65-66, 74-77, 89-90, 108, 113, 115, and 120. As with the Levy Report, McCormick does not object to unsealing the deposition excerpts \"subject to the provision that any references ... to confidential materials be appropriately redacted.\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 3 n.2.) Wal-Mart has not clearly articulated its position as to the deposition excerpts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In their motion to unseal, plaintiffs argue that defendants' designations \"(1) contain[ ] information already available to the public, (2) concern[ ] business protections no longer applicable given the passage of time, and/or (3) [do] not fall under one or more of the categories permitted under the Stipulated Protective Order.\" (Mot. to Unseal \u00b6 8.) McCormick and Wal-Mart filed separate oppositions to the motion to unseal, and they maintain that their confidentiality designations are appropriate. Specifically, they argue that the confidentiality designations are appropriate under the protective order\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (McCormick Opp. to\n   Unseal at 6; Wal-Mart Opp. to Unseal at 3-4), that plaintiffs' objections are untimely (McCormick's Opp. to Unseal at 3, 4; Wal-Mart's Opp. to Unseal at 1-2), and that there is no heightened presumption of public access in the class action context. (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 6-8; Wal-Mart Opp. to Unseal at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To support its confidentiality designations of the forty sealed McCormick documents attached to the Fegan Declaration, McCormick relies on an index that lists each document and provides a description of the document and a generic explanation for the confidentiality designation. (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 5;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. D.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   McCormick argues that this index, in combination with the Morse Declaration, shows that the materials in question \"clearly contain information which, if disclosed, (1) would reveal a trade secret or other research, development, or financial information that is commercially sensitive and/or (2) would cause McCormick to suffer a significant competitive or commercial disadvantage by revealing trade secrets, 'know-how,' customer information, financial and marketing information, or other competitively sensitive commercial information (including, but not limited to, cost information, pricing, or sales information).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) McCormick repeats that \"the documents in question contain confidential and proprietary business information, the disclosure of which could harm McCormick\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10) and which is not already public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) (\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   note 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   By contrast, Wal-Mart has provided more detailed reasons to support the sealing of its three documents-Fegan Declaration Exhibits 127-29 (ECF Nos. 157-31-157-33). For example, Wal-Mart explains that these documents \"contain highly sensitive information about Wal-Mart's internal processes and systems for executing product changes; the names of Wal-Mart personnel who are involved in the aforementioned process; and the individuals with whom Wal-Mart transacts [business].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Moreover, Wal-Mart argues that if its \"internal processes are disclosed, competitors might be able to replicate or improve upon such processes to Wal-Mart's detriment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Wal-Mart uses the Keeter Declaration to support the contention that \"disclosure of these materials might cause Wal-Mart to suffer a significant competitive or commercial disadvantage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs characterize both oppositions as insufficient and conclusory and argue that defendants have failed to overcome the presumptive public right of access to judicial records. (Pls.' Reply to Defs.' Opps. to Unseal at 1, ECF No. 181 (\"Reply to Unseal\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Court's Conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Having reviewed the relevant unredacted documents and the parties' arguments, and for the reasons discussed herein, the Court concludes that many of defendants' confidentiality designations have resulted in overbroad redactions that do not comport with the presumptive right of public access. Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part plaintiffs' motion to unseal (ECF No. 174) and one of plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   motions to seal (ECF No. 157), but will deny the remaining motions to seal (ECF Nos. 160, 163, 172, 177, and 179).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Specifically, the Court will require the unsealing of the pleadings related to class certification, plaintiffs' motion to unseal, and defendants' motion to exclude. With respect to the Fegan Declaration, the Hester Declaration, the Levy Report, the Johnson Report, and all Levy Deposition Excerpts, the defendants will be required to file, by June 29, 2018, these documents with limited redactions and more detailed justifications of the proposed redactions. Finally, the Court will deny without prejudice plaintiffs' motion to unseal (ECF No. 174), insofar as it relates to Fegan Declaration Exhibits 101-143, to be revisited after the underlying motion for class certification has been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In\n   <em>\n    Friedman v.

Here, defendants fail to specifically identify commercially sensitive information, but instead, they make overbroad requests to maintain information in confidence that is relevant to the Court's decision-making, and which should therefore be presumptively accessible to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on the record before it, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factors favor disclosure of the class certification pleadings. The first factor is the need for public access to the documents at issue. Pleadings are the clearest expression of relevant evidence and argumentation on\n   any given disputed issue and necessarily influence a Court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275646\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/661/#p666\">\n    865 F.3d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Without access ... it is impossible to know which ... materials persuaded the court and which failed to do so.\"). The second factor considers prior public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Some redacted information is already available through the Court's prior opinion. For example, the motion for class certification quotes extensively from previously disclosed language.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re McCormick &amp; Co., Inc., Pepper Prods. Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418284\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/218/\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (D.D.C. 2017) (\"McCormick also 'feared that a unilateral reduction [in quantity of pepper in a tin] might be 'deceptive and could very well back fire on us.' \"); (June 13, 2017 Mem. Op., ECF No. 148 at 2 (\"Plaintiffs alleged that '[s]ince 2010 the cost of raw black pepper has increased by approximately 500%.' ... Although the containers noted the new weight, they were the 'exact same size' as before.\"). Defendants make no effort to distinguish what is publicly available from what is not. So, factors one and two weigh in favor of disclosure. By virtue of defendants' opposition to the motion to unseal and various motions to seal, the third factor, which considers the identity of a party objecting to disclosure, weighs in favor of closure.\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n    650 F.2d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   's fourth factor considers the strength of the property and privacy interests asserted in the class certification papers,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239947,5688262\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/650/293/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and points in favor of disclosure in large part because neither defendant gives any reason why particular redactions in the pleadings are necessary. The fifth \"considers whether disclosure of the documents will lead to prejudice in future litigation to the party seeking the seal.\"\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675141\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/672/54/#p58\">\n    672 F.Supp.2d at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Wal-Mart does not address this factor and McCormick argues that it favors McCormick \"because there is no prejudice to Plaintiffs.\" (McCormick's Opp. to Seal at 10.) The correct question is whether\n   <em>\n    defendants\n   </em>\n   will be prejudiced in future litigation if the class certification pleadings are unsealed. Nothing suggests defendants will be prejudiced.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Arguing that it \"has a strong privacy interest in the contents of the Opposition and might be harmed competitively if it were disclosed to the public,\" Wal-Mart cites the Keeter Declaration for the idea that disclosure, \"even by reference, poses a business risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) But the Keeter Declaration states only that \"[i]f the information contained in the four sealed Wal-Mart documents were released to the public, Wal-Mart's business and competitive standing would likely be harmed. Competitors and suppliers would be able to gain insights ... which they could utilize to Wal-Mart's competitive disadvantage.\" (Keeter Decl. \u00b6 5.)

Declarations and Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This category of documents consists of the Fegan Declaration, the Hester Declaration, the Levy Report, and the Johnson Report. As explained herein, defendants have indiscriminately redacted far more than is necessary to protect confidential information in each of these documents; they have failed to identify the specific proprietary information that should remain under seal and have failed to give particularized reasons for the withholdings. Without such a showing, defendants cannot overcome the presumption in favor of public access. Therefore, defendants will be required to refile these documents with limited redactions and an accompanying supplemental memorandum of law, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion, that justifies their withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Fegan Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants offer little justification to support the sealing of the Fegan Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For many of the reasons described above in relation to the class certification pleadings, the Court finds that the redactions of the Fegan Declaration are far greater than are necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Two differences, however, place the Fegan Declaration in a category separate from the pleadings. First, while the Fegan Declaration provides support for plaintiffs' reasoning and arguments in favor of class certification, it may be less crucial to the Court's certification decision. Second, though both defendants defend the Fegan Declaration redactions without specificity, the declaration draws from the attached exhibits extensively, portions of which arguably contain confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Some of the Fegan Declaration redactions are obviously overbroad.

The Hester Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Hester Declaration, as noted above, was filed as an exhibit to the Schmitt Declaration, which was in turn filed in support of McCormick's opposition to class certification. The Hester Declaration was, in other words, filed to oppose class certification in the same way the Fegan Declaration was filed to support it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   McCormick explains that the Hester Declaration \"contains confidential business information regarding the sourcing and density of McCormick pepper, packaging processes and strategy, and historical filling practices (not just for the relevant period)\" (McCormick's Reply to Seal Opp. to Class Cert. at 4), and provides the Morse Declaration as support for its assertion that \"public disclosure of such information would be harmful to McCormick's business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Morse Declaration suffices to establish that the Hester Declaration contains \"confidential and proprietary business information [that] ... would not be made available to the public in the ordinary course of business\" or shared with competitors (Morse Decl. \u00b6 7), it does not specifically identify that information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Platinum &amp; Palladium Commodities Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984333\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/828/602/#p603\">\n    828 F.Supp.2d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (denying plaintiffs' motion to file under seal without prejudice because the redactions were overbroad);\n   <em>\n    Pfizer, Inc. v.

The Levy &amp; Johnson Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   McCormick does not object to unsealing the Levy Report so long as \"any references ... to confidential materials be appropriately redacted.\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 3 n.2.) Wal-Mart implies a similar position. (Wal-Mart Opp. to Unseal at 7.) The Johnson Report refutes many of the findings in the Levy Report and McCormick discusses it only briefly. In fact, where McCormick mentions the Johnson Report, it specifically cites only six paragraphs and Appendix C as referring to potentially sensitive commercial information. (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 5 (describing confidential information in the Johnson Report at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 26-27, 30-31, and Appendix C).) While mere references to confidential materials cannot, as explained above, be redacted, the Court will accept defendant's offer to refile the reports with limited redactions and, consistent with this Memorandum Opinion, particularized argument explaining why the redactions are necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Exclude\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The parties have filed three pleadings in conjunction with defendants' joint motion to exclude Levy as an expert. Defendants suggest that these pleadings should remain redacted. (McCormick's Reply to Seal Opp. to Class Cert. at 2.) McCormick notes that the Hester Declaration is referred to twice in the motion to exclude (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4), and argues that the three redactions in defendants' reply in support of the motion to exclude constitute information derived from the Hester Declaration. (Defs.' Mot. to File Reply to Mot. to Exclude Under Seal at 1-2, ECF No. 177.) Otherwise, defendants offer no justifications for the redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The same reasoning applies to these pleadings as applied to the class certification pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fort Totten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836960\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/960/2/\">\n    960 F.Supp.2d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the documents at issue were \"judicial records subject to the common law right of access because they ... were filed with the Court and were the subjects of judicial action\"). Accordingly, the Court will unseal the pleadings related to the motion to exclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Levy Deposition Excerpts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The sealed excerpts of the Levy Deposition include the following pages as exhibits under seal: 29-30, 40-41, 43, 51-60, 65-66, 74-77, 89-90, 108, 113, 115, and 120. As with the Levy Report, McCormick does not object to unsealing the deposition excerpts \"subject to the provision that any references ... to confidential materials be appropriately redacted.\" (McCormick Opp. to Unseal at 3 n.2.) Wal-Mart has not made clear its position as to the deposition excerpts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Again, while mere references to confidential materials should not be redacted, defendants shall file the deposition excerpts with limited redactions and particularized justifications for these redactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fegan Declaration Exhibits 101-143\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants argue that the company documents attached as Fegan Declaration\n   Exhibits 101-143 should remain under seal. Although the Court does not find these arguments wholly persuasive, at this stage the Court lacks the necessary information to apply the\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   factors to these documents and will therefore deny plaintiffs' motion to unseal as to the exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R,\n   <em>\n    Aetna Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208739257\">\n    2016 WL 8739257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (\"With respect to the first and final [\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ] factors, namely, the need for public access to the documents at issue and the purposes for which the documents were introduced during the judicial proceedings, the Special Master lacks sufficient information to conclude that either factor outweighs the Defendants' interests in maintaining the confidentiality of these documents because the documents have not yet been used at trial.\"). Should it later become apparent that these documents are necessary to the Court's class certification decision, plaintiffs may renew their motion to unseal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court is aware, however, that these exhibits include some information that will be disclosed as a result of the Court's other rulings herein. But these documents present a more complicated question than do the pleadings and documents already discussed. First, significant portions appear to include sensitive business information (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fegan Decl. Ex. 132, at 4), while other portions are not proprietary. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fegan Decl. Ex. 104, at 5-7 (copies of news reports).) Second, much of the proprietary and non-proprietary information is interspersed-especially in emails-such that redaction would be inefficient and ineffectual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:12-cv-01173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203763904\">\n    2012 WL 3763904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2012) (finding that the parties' joint representation that \"the Administrative Record 'is replete' with personal identifying information ... and that redacting such information would be too burdensome, is considered sufficient to justify granting the parties' request under the good cause standard at this stage of the proceedings\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Search of Office Suites for World &amp; Islam Studies Enter.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7784147\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/925/738/#p743\">\n    925 F.Supp. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 743-44 (M.D. Fla. 1996) (finding that \"[r]edaction might protect the parties named in the affidavits, however, it offers no shield against revealing the other aspects of the Government's investigation\" and so maintaining the documents under seal for the time being). Third, many of the documents refer to details of internal operations that may not be revealing to a layperson's eye, but may be of use to defendants' competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, and importantly, disclosing original source documents, as opposed to pleadings and declarations, may be of less value to public's understanding of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyatt v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273975\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/251/181/#p185\">\n    251 F.Supp.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 (D.D.C. 2017) (concluding that \"having reviewed proposed redactions-including the Court's rulings on dispositive motions-the Court notes that [the first\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ] factor weighs heavily in favor of disclosing the Court's orders and those materials relied upon by the Court ... [but] it does not weigh as heavily for disclosing confidential patent information ancillary to the Court's orders or the parties' briefs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part plaintiffs' motion to unseal (ECF No. 174) and plaintiffs' related motion to seal (ECF No. 157), and will deny the remaining motions to seal (ECF Nos. 160, 163, 172, 177, and 179) as detailed in the Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Specifically, the Court finds that the presumptive right of public access in pleadings outweighs any privacy interest articulated by defendants. Accordingly, all\n   of the pleadings described above-related to class certification, plaintiffs' motion to unseal, and defendants' motion to exclude-will be unsealed. The Court will also require defendants to file narrowly redacted or unredacted versions of the following documents: the Fegan Declaration, the Hester Declaration, the Levy Report, the Johnson Report, and all Levy Deposition Excerpts. In other words, none of these shall remain entirely under seal, and only narrowly tailored, specifically supported redactions shall be permitted. In addition, the Court will grant motions to seal Fegan Declaration Exhibits 101-143 (ECF Nos. 157-5 through 157-47), without prejudice to revisiting that decision after the Court resolves the substantive motion to which these exhibits relate.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Defendants are McCormick &amp; Co.

The Hester Declaration may contain some sensitive business information, but the Court remains skeptical that the same argument applies with equal force to McCormick's opposition.
