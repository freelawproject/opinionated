[Dkt. # 1],\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Some of the disputed documents allegedly in USDA's possession that related to the dairy checkoff program were created by and received from an organization called Dairy Management, Inc. (\"DMI\"). The Court granted DMI's motion to intervene in the matter in order to resolve one narrow question: whether the documents created by DMI were \"agency records\" subject to FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Order (Dec. 23, 2013). Because the Court answered the question in the affirmative, defendant was required to process over 8,000 documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. &amp; Order [Dkt. # 32] at 13. The review and production of those documents took approximately three and a half years to complete, and on July 20, 2017, the parties voluntarily dismissed Claims 1 and 2 of the complaint that related to the dairy checkoff program. Stip. of Dismissal [Dkt. # 73],\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claim 3, the only remaining claim before the Court, pertains to records involving the beef checkoff program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 38-50. In the summary judgment motion now pending before the Court, plaintiff argues that the beef checkoff records created by another intervenor in this case, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (\"NCBA\"), qualify as \"agency records,\" and that defendant USDA has violated FOIA by refusing to search NCBA's files for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 77] (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"); Pl.'s Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of Pl.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 77] (\"Pl.'s Mem\") at 1-2. Both defendant USDA and intervenor NCBA have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, contending that NCBA's records are not \"agency records\" subject to FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def-Intervenor NCBA's Cross-Mot. for Summ.

So this factor weighs in favor of defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Second, while the agency may have a right to audit certain NCBA records, it is undisputed that it has not exercised that right.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    NCBA SOF \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-16; Pl.'s Resp. to NCBA SOF \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15-16. Further, the record is devoid of any evidence regarding the agency's ability to dispose of NCBA records, and plaintiff does not contend that the agency has such authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. at 13; Pl.'s NCBA Cross-Opp. at 12; Pl.'s USDA Cross-Opp. at 12.
