In conjunction with a plea agreement, the parties filed a joint motion for upward departure pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3(e) in which petitioner agreed to accept a 35-year term of imprisonment. In exchange, state and federal authorities agreed not to charge him with the beating of one rival gang member and the killing of another. In calculating the applicable guideline range, the sentencing judge found petitioner to be a career offender. He then allowed the joint motion for upward departure, and imposed its recommended 35-year term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner now moves for resentencing because his predicate offenses no longer trigger career offender enhancements after the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   \"). Specifically, he argues that he was willing to accept the upward departure only because he believed himself already exposed to high sentencing guidelines as a career offender; absent that status, he contends, the departure would no longer have represented a good deal. The government, on the other hand, insists that petitioner's sentence was entirely based on the joint motion for upward departure, which never contemplated career offender status. Accordingly, it avers, petitioner is not entitled to resentencing under\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons that follow, petitioner's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I examine several sources in an effort to better understand the basis for petitioner's sentence: (1) the presentence report (\"PSR\") prepared by the Probation Office; (2) the plea agreement; (3) the joint motion for upward departure; and (4) the transcript of the combined change of plea and sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Presentence Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Probation prepared a pre-plea PSR, dated April 23, 1998, to aid the court in sentencing. A May 13, 1998 addendum indicated that both parties had reviewed the report and made no objections. As of the date of the PSR's preparation, both parties had informed probation of petitioner's intent to plead guilty on all counts, \u00b6 205, but no plea agreement had yet been signed. \u00b6 271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Uncharged Criminal Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner admitted responsibility for two violent acts against rival gang members: the beating of Girard Giorgio on July 1, 1995, and the killing of William Michaels on July 29, 1995. In the first incident, petitioner and other Hells Angels members chased Giorgio-a member of the rival Devil's Disciples Motorcycle Club-down the highway as he rode his motorcycle. Having caught up with him, petitioner\n   and others beat Giorgio badly, stripped him of his \"colors\"-clothing attesting to his gang affiliation-and hung the clothing upside down as a \"trophy\" in the Hells Angels clubhouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the second incident, petitioner accelerated the car he was driving into William Michaels, a Devil's Disciples member riding his motorcycle at the time. The collision lodged Michaels's motorcycle in the grill of petitioner's car, rendering it inoperable. Michaels died as a result of the collision. Petitioner fled the scene and hid in the woods until nightfall; he then traveled to New York, where he stayed for several weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Guidelines Calculations for Charged Offense Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Probation calculated petitioner's base offense level at 32 based on a drug quantity equivalent to between 1,000 and 3,000 kilograms of marijuana. United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"USSG\") \u00a7 2D1.1 (1995). PSR \u00b6 209. A three-level increase was applied to reflect petitioner's managerial role in the offense. USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(b). PSR \u00b6 211. Finally, probation applied a career offender enhancement because petitioner had two prior convictions of either a crime of violence or an applicable controlled substance violation. The corresponding offense level was 37. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 217-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moving to petitioner's criminal history category, probation calculated that his criminal history score alone would yield a category of III, but that his career offender designation directed an ultimate category of VI. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. PSR \u00b6 228. The predicate convictions for the career offender classification are not entirely clear. The PSR refers to paragraphs 229 and 230, but those paragraphs detail the uncharged killing of Michaels. The government attributes this reference to \"a clerical error,\" Docket # 542 at 3, n.2, and the parties agree that the likelier predicates are \"presumably\" petitioner's convictions for assault and battery and assault and battery on a police officer. Docket # 540 at 18; Docket # 542, at 2-3. Those incidents occurred on December 27, 1993, and June 10, 1995. PSR \u00b6\u00b6 223-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Anticipating a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility at the time of plea, probation calculated a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of 262 to 327 months' imprisonment based on total offense level 34 and criminal history category VI. Probation further noted, without so recommending, that the uncharged conduct involving Giorgio and Michaels could serve as the basis for an upward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(e), appropriately applied when a defendant's criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of past criminal conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 288-290.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Plea Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plea agreement, dated May 18, 1998, makes no mention of a career offender designation. Rather, it identifies petitioner's base offense level as 32, citing USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) (setting offense level by drug quantity). The agreement further indicates a three-level increase for managerial role and three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, for a total offense level of 32. Critically, the parties\n   reached no agreement as to petitioner's criminal history category. In any event, the agreement did not posit a GSR. Instead, the offense level and criminal history sections are followed by the below provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (e)\n    <em>\n     Upward Departure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   As set forth in the joint motion for upward departure attached to this agreement, the parties agree that the undisputed facts contained in the Defendant's Presentence Report concerning the Defendant's participation in the assault and battery of Girard Giorgio on July 1, 1995 and the Defendant's responsibility for the death of William Michaels on July 29, 1995 warrant an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(e) of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Specifically, USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(e) provides: \"If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.

Similarly, in the event that the Court allows the parties' Joint Motion For An Upward Departure and sentences the Defendant to a 35-year term of imprisonment, the District Attorney will not charge the Defendant with the violation of any state law committed by the Defendant with respect to events occurring on July 29, 1995.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11-12.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Finally, the agreement explicitly preserves petitioner's right \"to petition the Court, pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at any time for application of any future decision, ruling, change in law or change in the Sentencing Guidelines, which may result in a reduction in the total time of the Defendant's incarceration.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     at 11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The below exchange followed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    GOVERNMENT: Under the plea agreement I think, I believe the total offense level would be 32, going up three points for role in the offense and down three points for acceptance of responsibility.

Prejudice\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In the ordinary\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    case, cause and prejudice are the twinned results of sentencing for offenses that no longer qualify as career offender predicates.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lattanzio\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268393\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/220/#p223\">\n     232 F.Supp.3d at 223-24\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (collecting cases rejecting procedural default in the\n    <em>\n     Johnson II\n    </em>\n    context). On facts far from the ordinary\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    case, however, the same change in status here does not so readily demonstrate prejudice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The transcript for the joint hearing on change of plea and sentencing suggests that the judge considered the drug quantity and career offender status in calculating the applicable GSR, but relied on neither in ultimately allowing the joint motion for an upward departure. The statement of reasons for the judgment only further entangles these threads, by citing the offense level attributable to the drug quantity\n    (\n    <em>\n     without\n    </em>\n    career offender enhancement) but the criminal history category and GSR attributable to the career offender enhancement. The government emphasizes that such ambiguity is irrelevant because the true basis for petitioner's plea, upward departure, and ultimate sentence was avoiding murder charges, and neither the plea nor the joint motion for upward departure was at all concerned with career offender designation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The government's position is more consistent with the record before me. Petitioner's draft plea agreement, identical to the signed final version but for new language preserving petitioner's \u00a7 2255 rights, predates the PSR and contemplates the same upward departure-indicating petitioner's assent irrespective of any career offender designation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Indeed, had career offender status never entered the equation, petitioner would have faced a choice between pleading to what amounted to about a 20-year upward departure and exposing himself to a life sentence on state and/or federal murder charges. That he opted for the former under the purported, and now erroneous, impression that it represented only an eight-year departure does not establish the requisite reasonable probability of a different outcome.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Strickler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p289\">\n     527 U.S. at 296\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p289\">\n     119 S.Ct. 1936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In other words, although petitioner has shown he no longer qualifies as a career offender, he has not shown that designation to be the basis for his sentence. Instead, at sentencing, the parties treated the guidelines as an afterthought to the governing motion for upward departure: first, the government noted there was no reason for the defendant to object to the PSR's career offender determination in light of the plea agreement and joint motion for upward departure. Docket # 542-3, at 16. Second, the judge stated, \"though I'm going to do the sentencing guideline calculations, I am disposed to depart upward on the grounds of the joint motion.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 23. Third, the defendant confirmed that his position was set forth in the joint motion for upward departure,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 25, and the judge inquired \"about this William Michaels thing, because that would be the basis for my upward departing.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. Satisfied that there was a factual basis, he then imposed the 35-year term of imprisonment for which the parties had jointly moved. Although petitioner's career offender status is discussed at sentencing and muddles the statement of reasons for the judgment, it is entirely absent in the plea agreement and joint motion for upward departure that ultimately determined the sentence. Petitioner has thus not shown a reasonable probability that, but for his career offender designation, he would have received a different sentence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    For the reasons above, petitioner does not qualify as a career offender. However, because he has not shown a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different absent that designation, his petition (Docket # 537) is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-81\">\n     As discussed in Section III(C) infra, these reasons further confuse matters because 32 is the offense level attributable to drug quantity, but the cited criminal history category and GSR correlate to career offender status.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-82\">\n     Petitioner's calculation of a total offense level of 29 and corresponding GSR of 108-135 months, Docket # 540, at 4, fails to account for the three-level role enhancement.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-83\">\n     Petitioner points to the magistrate judge's March 24, 1997 Memorandum and Order on the Government's Motion for petitioner's detention as the earliest basis for his expectation that he would be charged as a career offender: \"he has at least two convictions for violent crimes including assault and battery on a police officer. The latter offense occurred while he was on probation for a previous conviction for assault and battery.\" Docket # 540, at 5. But the quoted portion of the magistrate's decision does not support that view. Instead, her discussion simply informs her consideration of petitioner's dangerousness as a relevant component of the detention decision before her.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (e) ; 3/24/97 Memorandum at 9 (noting the government's entitlement to move for detention in a case involving any felony alleged to have been committed after the defendant has been convicted of two or more crimes of violence). Petitioner's prior violent conduct was relevant at that stage of the proceedings only for evaluating whether his presence in the community would pose a risk to public safety.
