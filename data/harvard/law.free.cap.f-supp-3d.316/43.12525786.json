This case, back to this Court on remand from the D.C. Circuit and presently before the Court on cross motions for summary judgment, concerns whether three former District of Columbia Department of Corrections (\"DCDOC\") officers meet certain statutory prerequisites to be considered \"qualified retired law enforcement officer[s]\" under LEOSA. Finding that Plaintiffs meet the statutory preconditions at issue in this case-including, that they each \"served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of 10 years or more\" and had \"statutory powers of arrest\" before separating from DCDOC,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 926C(c)(2), (3)(A) -the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denies the District of Columbia's motion for the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Statutory Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before 2004, a patchwork of state laws governed whether out-of-state current or former law enforcement officers could carry a concealed firearm within a particular state's borders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 108-560, at 3 (2004). Beginning in 1992, lawmakers introduced legislation aimed at permitting concealed carry nationwide for certain law enforcement officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. 218, 107th (2001); H.R. 218, 106th Cong.

As corrections officers, Plaintiffs were responsible for, among other things, the treatment, custody, counseling, and supervision of individuals incarcerated at DCDOC-operated correctional institutions, including the Lorton Correctional Complex in Lorton, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Position Descriptions, Exs. 12-14, Def.'s SUMF, ECF Nos. 53-31, 53-32, 53-33; Decl. of Robert Smith (\"Smith Decl.\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 59-5; Decl. of Ronald Duberry (\"Duberry Decl.\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 59-4; Decl. of Maurice Curtis (\"Curtis Decl.\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 59-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Beginning in November 2012, Plaintiffs individually sought to enjoy the concealed carry right that they believed LEOSA afforded them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr.

Compl. \u00b6 56-identification that they believe satisfies the requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A)-they focused on securing firearm certification to meet the requirement of subsection (d)(2)(B). In Prince George's County, Maryland (where Mr. Duberry and Mr. Curtis reside) and in the District of Columbia (where Mr. Smith resides), an individual must submit a prior employment certification form completed by the law enforcement agency for which he previously worked before seeking firearm certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corr.

The District contends that Plaintiffs are not entitled to such recognition, arguing that (1) they did not possess \"statutory powers of arrest\" prior to separating from DCDOC, (2) they were not \"law enforcement officers for an aggregate of 10 years,\" and (3) they lack suitable photographic identification necessary to avail themselves of LEOSA rights. As explained below, the Court finds that, contrary to the District's assertions-many of which were already rejected by the D.C.

Specifically, in the course of determining whether Congress intended LEOSA to benefit Plaintiffs, the Circuit explained that \"the reference to 'statutory powers of arrest'\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   means some statutory power of arrest such as a power to arrest parole violators, and not, as the District of Columbia suggests, only the police power to arrest upon probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Duberry I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citing Appellee's Br. at 25).

And, in practice, the only DCDOC officers who issued such warrants were members of a select group known as the Warrant Squad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 41-42. The Court finds the District's interpretation of the statutory text unpersuasive and finds that the text extended arrest authority to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the statute makes clear that it empowers a certain group of officers-those\n   \"hereinafter authorized\"-to execute warrants for the arrest of parole violators. It appears to this Court that the listed categories of officers have the authority to issue warrants under this provision even if the occasion to do so never arises. Second, the language of the statute extends this authority to \"[\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ny\n   </em>\n   officer of the District of Columbia penal institutions,\" not only to officers serving on the Warrant Squad or to any other designated group of DCDOC officers. Certainly, this Court cannot interpret \"any\" as meaning only \"a select few as designated by DCDOC officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ali v. Fed.

That the statute then restricts the authority to execute warrants to only certain \"designated civilian employee[s] of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia\" buttresses the notion that if the legislature had intended to statutorily authorize only certain DCDOC officers to execute warrants, it knew how to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Third, the District appears to read \"to whom such warrant shall be delivered\" as a limitation on the authority of every category of officer mentioned in the statute, denying power unless a warrant is issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 36-42. The Court disagrees. It seems that this language instead describes the final category of officers to whom a warrant may be issued-\"any federal officer authorized to serve criminal process within the United States to whom such warrant shall be delivered.\" Fourth, the Court finds unavailing any argument that Plaintiffs had to have utilized this authority to qualify for LEOSA benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 36-42. LEOSA requires only \"statutory powers of arrest\"; Congress did not include any requirement that a retired law enforcement officer must have exercised arrest authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, because the record shows that Plaintiffs were \"officer[s] of the District of Columbia penal institutions\"-a fact that the District does not contest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 22-25-the Court concludes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2024-405\">\n    D.C.

The District argues that they did not, maintaining that an individual serves as a law enforcement officer only on days that he or she is authorized to carry a firearm and explaining that DCDOC officers are only authorized to carry firearms while on particular assignments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 15; District of\n   Columbia's Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. &amp; Reply in Supp. of Its Cross-Mot. Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Reply\") at 6, ECF No. 57. The District asserts that Plaintiffs cannot show that they were each placed on assignments on which they would have been authorized to carry a firearm for a total of 3650 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-17; Def.'s Reply at 6 (suggesting that Plaintiffs must provide \"a calculation of the days their officials duties required the use of a firearm\"). The District also seems to suggest that to be a law enforcement officer, an employee must have had broad law enforcement authority and general duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that LEOSA features no requirement that retired officers must have been authorized to carry a weapon, let alone any requirement that involves demonstrating that they were so authorized each day for a total of ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 4, 34. Plaintiffs also assert that, in any event, they were trained to use and authorized to carry firearms as part of their job duties, even if they were not necessarily placed on ten years' worth of assignments on which they actually carried firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 36-37. In addition, Plaintiffs note that \"law enforcement officer\" is used differently in different statutory schemes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 36. And they assert that the LEOSA statute does not mandate that an officer have had general duties and broad powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 36. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have the better of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Except under circumstances inapplicable here, in order to be a \"qualified retired law enforcement officer\" under LEOSA, a former employee must have \"served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of 10 years or more\" before separating from a public agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(c)(3)(A).

According to the District, LEOSA conforms to this understanding of law enforcement officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 14. The District notes that \u00a7 926B of LEOSA explicitly requires that an active employee be authorized to carry a firearm to be considered a \"qualified law enforcement officer,\" and argues that this same requirement is implicitly applicable to retired officers seeking certification under \u00a7 926C too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 14.

But, to the extent that any daylight exists between the argument that the Circuit rejected and the one that the District offers here, this Court rejects the District's contentions. The plain text of \u00a7 926C includes no requirement that a retired officer must have been authorized to carry a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C. And, as mentioned above, this\n   Court will not \"read[ ] a phrase into [a] statute when Congress has left it out.\"\n   <em>\n    Jawad\n   </em>\n   , 832 F.3d at 370 (first alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Keene Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 508 U.S. at 208,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12197\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/200/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Interpreting the statutory language as written does not, as the District contends, produce an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 14. As the D.C.

Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). There is nothing remotely absurd about Congress requiring an active officer to be authorized to use a firearm without expecting the same from a retired officer who served in a law enforcement role for at least ten years. Furthermore, the schemes do not feature identical requirements, thus, the Court has no trouble imagining that Congress thoughtfully selected which requirements to include with respect to each category of officers. Indeed, as the Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Duberry I\n   </em>\n   , Congress enacted LEOSA in the face of dissenting statements on exactly the matter of the broad definition of qualified retired law enforcement officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duberry I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The practical concerns extended to the broad definition of a qualified retired law enforcement officer to include individuals whose jobs did not require them to carry a firearm and who therefore had not been trained by their employer in the use of a firearm.\" (citing S.

Congress addressed these concerns, the Circuit explained, \"by requiring annual firearms training to ensure that all retired officers eligible to carry concealed weapons received the same firearms training as active duty officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing H.R.

Second, while this Court hardly disagrees that \"law enforcement officer\" sometimes refers to officers with \"general duties and broad authority,\" this is not always the case. For example, LEOSA was amended to clarify that its definition of \"law enforcement officer\" includes the Amtrak Police, the Federal Reserve Police, and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

The Court rejects the District's argument that Plaintiffs must prove that they have photographic identification that satisfies subsection (d) before the Court can grant their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, such a determination is a logical extension of the Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Duberry I\n   </em>\n   . In its prior opinion, the Circuit explicitly rejected the notion that Plaintiffs might \"lack the [LEOSA] right until they obtain the subsection (d)(2)(B) firearms certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Duberry I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n    824 F.3d at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Circuit's view, \"the firearm certification requirement does not define the right itself but is rather a precondition to the exercise of [the LEOSA] right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310354,4321589\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/1046/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District appears to offer a different version of this argument, asserting that Plaintiffs must prove that they meet other preconditions for exercising LEOSA rights before they can be deemed \"qualified retired law enforcement officers\" to whom Congress conferred LEOSA rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 44-45. This Court thinks that, just as the firearm certification did not define the LEOSA right, the possession of a photographic identification that is required to exercise the right does not define the LEOSA right. Other district courts have reached a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But, of course, those courts were not bound by or acting in light of binding precedent from a higher court. Indeed, both of the district court opinions that the District cites rejected the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Duberry I.

The Court agrees that whether or not Plaintiffs have sufficient identification is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether they have met certain statutory preconditions to be considered \"qualified retired law enforcement officers.\" The Court concludes that each of the relevant disputed requirements is met and that Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The Court disagrees on all fronts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    First, the District's argument that \"statutory powers of arrest\" must mean that a \"statute itself provides the authorization to make a warrantless arrest,\" Def.'s Mem. at 34, is wholly unavailing. \"Warrantless\" appears nowhere in the statutory scheme, and this Court will not add statutory language that Congress omitted.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jawad v.

Furthermore, \"arrest\" can refer to the execution of an arrest warrant issued under the statutory authority of another.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-562\">\n     D.C.

Thus, the Court disagrees that \"statutory powers of arrest\" obviously excludes the authority to execute arrest warrants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Second, the Court is unpersuaded that the structure or language of LEOSA supports the District's construction. The District suggests, for example, that \"statutory powers of arrest\" must mean something akin to \"apprehension\" under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20807\">\n     10 U.S.C. \u00a7 807\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). Def.'s Mem. at 21. But the District fails to mention that the \"apprehension\" language was added by amendment years after the enactment of LEOSA, apparently in an effort to expand, not restrict, the group of people who may qualify as law enforcement officers under LEOSA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pub. L. No. 112-239. Finally, the legislative history of LEOSA does not offer much in the way of clear guidance regarding how to interpret \"statutory powers of arrest.\" The parties each cherry pick from the several statements made by witnesses or Congressmen and women that arguably supports their respective positions about the proper interpretation of this particular provision. If the legislative history reveals anything, it is what the Circuit already observed in\n    <em>\n     Duberry I\n    </em>\n    : that Congress wished for LEOSA to apply broadly and to upend any conflicting state and local laws, which lends support to Plaintiffs' construction of the terms used in the statutory scheme.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    For the same reason, the Court need not address Plaintiffs' contentions that in practice, they exercised \"police-like\" powers within the DCDOC correctional facilities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. at 38-45. Congress moored the LEOSA requirement to a statutory power, not to practical experience arresting alleged criminals.

Code \u00a7 24-405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -the statute that Plaintiffs have identified as conferring such power-authorized a particular officer to execute a warrant for the arrest of a parole violator turns on whether he or she falls into one of the enumerated categories of officers. Because there is no question that Plaintiffs were \"officer[s] of the District of Columbia penal institutions,\" factual questions that might arise with regard to purported members of other categories-for example, whether a civilian employee of the Metropolitan Police Department was \"designated\" to execute warrants pursuant to this statute-do not arise in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    A former employee who did not serve as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of 10 years or more nonetheless qualifies if he or she separated from service, after completing any applicable probationary period, due to service-connected disability.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 926C(c)(3) B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Though, as explained above, a retired law enforcement officer need not show that he was authorized to carry a weapon while on duty to be eligible for LEOSA rights, Plaintiffs offer persuasive evidence that they were so authorized. They note that to qualify for their corrections officer positions, they had to demonstrate proficiency in the use of firearms.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' SUMF \u00b6 7;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Ex. E-3, Job Description DC-007-09, ECF No. 55-8; Ex. E-4, Job Description DC-007-09, ECF No. 55-8. They also explain that, as DCDOC officers, they received \"extensive\" pre-service firearms training. Furthermore, throughout their respective tenures, they were each tested and qualified annually or semi-annually in the use of a pistol, a shotgun, and an M-14 semi-automatic rifle.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7. And they were authorized to carry firearms in responding to escapes and escorting prisoners.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6' 27-29, 32-34. As the above analysis of \"statutory powers of arrest\" demonstrates, the question of whether or not Plaintiffs had authority to carry a weapon does not necessarily turn on whether Plaintiffs exercised that authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    This Court does not conclude that Plaintiffs are unalterably \"qualified retired law enforcement officers\" for purposes of LEOSA. This is because some of the statutory preconditions for \"qualified retired law enforcement officers\" are mutable characteristics. For example, no court could accurately declare on the basis of motions and responses filed months prior that a retired officer certainly is not \"under the influence of alcohol or another intoxicating or hallucinatory drug or substance\" such that he meets the requirements of subsection (c)(7). Instead, this Court only concludes that Plaintiffs meet the requirements listed in subsection (c)(1)-(3). Specifically, Plaintiffs each separated from service in good standing with a public agency as a law enforcement officer; before such separation, they each were authorized to engage in or supervise the incarceration of persons and they had statutory powers of arrest; and before separation, they each served as a law enforcement officer for an aggregate of 10 years or more.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
