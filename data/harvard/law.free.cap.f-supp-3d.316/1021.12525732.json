The plant\n   that discharged the water contaminated with ammonium perfluorooctanoate (\"C-8\") is in West Virginia. Some of the plaintiffs reside in Ohio and some in West Virginia. Additionally, some of the plaintiffs have filed suit in the state in which they do not reside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The issue of which state law will be applied to the individual plaintiffs' claims that make up this MDL was initially brought before the Court in Plaintiffs' First Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 820.) In that motion, the plaintiffs requested that the Court apply the law of the state of West Virginia to all of the plaintiffs' who make such election. The defendant, however, argued that it is the law of the state in which the injury occurred that must be applied. The parties also discussed the issue at the oral argument on November 13, 2014. (ECF No. 1519.) The Court ordered simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issue in Pretrial Order No. 31. (ECF No. 2032.) The parties timely filed their briefs. (ECF Nos. 2284, 2285, 2416, 2417.) On May 6, 2015, the Court held oral argument on this issue. (ECF No. 3235.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the portion of Plaintiffs' First Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 820) related to the choice of law request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 31, 2001, a group of individuals filed a state court action in West Virginia against E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (\"DuPont\") captioned\n   <em>\n    Leach v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-C-698 (Wood County W. Va. Cir. Ct.) (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case\"). The plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case brought a variety of claims under West Virginia common law tort theories for equitable, injunctive and declaratory relief, along with compensatory and punitive damages, as a result of alleged drinking water contamination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2002, the West Virginia trial court (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court\") granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and certified a mandatory, non-opt-out class (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class\")\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   on behalf of a class of all persons whose drinking water is or has been contaminated with ammonium perfluorooctanoate (a/k/a/ \"C-8\") attributable to releases from DuPont's Washington Works plant (hereinafter \"the Class\") with respect to all issues relating to [DuPont's] underlying liability and Plaintiffs' claims for equitable, injunctive, and declaratory relief, including liability for punitive damages; all damage issues involving any determination of individual harm of the Class members and the amount of any punitive damages are hereby STAYED and RESERVED for later litigation ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Leach v.

Va. Cir. Ct. Apr. 10, 2002). The Class included approximately 80,000 individual residents of the communities served by certain public water districts and private water sources that had allegedly been contaminated with C-8 discharged from DuPont's Washington Works plant. The water districts and private water sources were all in either Ohio or West Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2004, the parties entered into a class-wide settlement of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\"). On February 28, 2005, following appropriate class-wide notice, objection opportunities, full opt-out opportunities, and a final fairness hearing, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court entered an order approving the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement and entering final judgment in the action. The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement provides for a process by which a determination would be made as to which individual class members, if any, would be permitted to file personal injury and\n   wrongful death actions, referred to as \"Conditionally Releases Claims,\" in the \"later litigation\" against DuPont based on any of the human diseases they believed had been caused by exposure to C-8. (\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement \"SA\" \u00a7 3.3; ECF No. 820-8.) Pursuant to this procedure, a Science Panel was tasked to issue either Probable Link Findings or No Probable Link Findings for human diseases the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class alleged were caused by C-8. The class members agreed \"not to file any action or proceedings against [DuPont] based on the Conditionally Released Claims unless and until the Science Panel delivers a Probable Link Finding ... with respect to the specific Human Disease at issue in the Conditionally Released Claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201270121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, the Science Panel delivered Probable Link Findings for six human diseases (\"Linked Diseases\"). Subsequently, the individual class members whose claims are based on one or more of the Linked Diseases began to file their Conditionally Released Claims in actions in West Virginia and in Ohio. Some of the plaintiffs lived in Ohio and were allegedly injured in Ohio when they drank the water contaminated with C-8 in Ohio (\"Ohio Plaintiffs\"), and some of the plaintiffs were allegedly injured in West Virginia when they drank C-8 contaminated water in West Virginia (\"West Virginia Plaintiffs\"). Some Ohio Plaintiffs filed their cases in Ohio alleging claims under Ohio law and some Ohio Plaintiffs filed their cases in West Virginia alleging their claims under West Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DuPont moved the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for centralization of these individual actions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Judicial Panel granted DuPont's request. On April 9, 2013, the Judicial Panel transferred the centralized action to this Court. In the Transfer Order the Judicial Panel described the individual cases that make up this multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All the actions are personal injury or wrongful death actions arising out of plaintiffs' alleged ingestion of drinking water contaminated with a chemical, C-8 (also known as perfluorooctoanoic acid (PFOA) or ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO)), discharged from DuPont's Washington Works Plant near Parkersburg, West Virginia. All of the plaintiffs in this litigation allege that they suffer or suffered from one or more of six diseases identified as potentially linked to C-8 exposure by a study conducted as part of a 2005 settlement between DuPont and a class of approximately 80,000 persons residing in six water districts allegedly contaminated by C-8 from the Washington Works Plant [ (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\") ].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leach v.

The plaintiffs offer the following as support for their position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) that all current MDL plaintiffs purport to be members of a class of plaintiffs; (2) whose claims were first filed against DuPont in August of 2001; (3) through the filing of a class action complaint in a West Virginia state court; and (4) which claims were all certified by that West Virginia court (the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court) to proceed against DuPont as class claims in April of 2002. (First MSJ at 2-4)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs further noted that, although the class included plaintiffs who may be living in jurisdictions other than West Virginia (such as Ohio), no party (including DuPont) ever challenged any non-resident class member's ability or standing to pursue the certified claims through the West Virginia state court under West Virginia law or the court's jurisdiction over any such non-resident class members. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) This remained true even after the parties entered a class-wide settlement and provided full \"objection\" and hearing opportunities before the settlement was approved and finalized by that West Virginia state court in 2005.

The plaintiffs maintain that these \"preserved\" claims have the same attributes as a claim filed in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case in that they are,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to be considered filed on the date the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case was filed and decided under West Virginia law, referring to the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case as the first phase of litigation and this MDL as the second phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DuPont responds that \"nothing in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Agreement supports the notion that 'preserving' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , not releasing) potential future claims that might be 'pursued' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 'filed') at a later time allows a plaintiff to backdate\" the filing date of those claims. (DuPont's Response to Pls' Supp. Brief at 12; ECF No. 2416.) DuPont maintains that the \"preserved\" claims cannot be \"revived\" in a \"second phase\" of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case, but instead they were \"carved out\" for preservation for potential future litigation after resolution of the Class claims, which is a common occurrence in class actions. (DuPont's Response to Pls' Supp. Brief at 12; ECF No. 2416) (citing as an example\n   <em>\n    Fresco v. Auto Data Direct, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 03-61063-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202330895\">\n    2007 WL 2330895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2037863\">\n    2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13-14 (S.D. Fla. May 11, 2007) ) (\"In exchange for the injunctive-relief program, the Settlement Agreement releases settlement class members' claims for equitable relief, statutory liquidated damages, and punitive damages predicated on such claims, but it preserves the right of individual class members to bring individual claims for actual damages, subject to a waiver of the class action\n   procedural device.\") DuPont's argument is well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As DuPont accurately points out, on April 10, 2002, the Leach Court entered an order certifying a liability and medical monitoring class, but expressly reserved all personal injury and wrongful death claims for future litigation \"after resolution of the Class claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Leach v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-C-608,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%201270121\">\n    2002 WL 1270121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 (W. Va. Cir. Ct. Wood Cty. Apr. 10, 2002) (emphasis supplied). And, although the 2002 class definition indicated that the Conditionally Released claims were stayed and preserved, that definition was modified in the Leach Settlement Agreement, which provides that the Agreement was entered into by DuPont and the Class Members as defined in the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SA at 1 \u00b6 1.) The Leach Settlement Agreement specifically indicates that the \" 'Certified Class' shall have the meaning provided in Section 2.1.1.\" (SA \u00a7 1.9.) That Section utilizes a portion of the definition from the April 10, 2002 Order of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court, quoted above, that granted the plaintiffs' request for class certification. Specifically, the class in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement was defined as \"all persons whose drinking water is or has been contaminated with ammonium perfluorooctanoate (a/k/a \"C-8\") attributable to releases from DuPont's Washington Works plant... with respect to all issues relating to Defendants' underlying liability and Plaintiffs' claims for equitable, injunctive and declaratory relief including liability for punitive damages.\" (SA \u00a7 2.1.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, DuPont contends that this redefined settlement class received immediate benefits provided in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, including \"a $70,000,000 cash payment by DuPont to the class; additional funds paid to class counsel; filtered drinking water to all Class Members from DuPont's construction or installation and ongoing maintenance of state-of-the-art water treatment facilities at a cost of many millions of dollars; and a promise by DuPont of medical monitoring for the class ....\" (DuPont's Response to Pls. Supp. Brief at 8; ECF No. 2416.) DuPont's assessment is supported in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court's Final Order captioned \"Order Approving Final Settlement and Notice Plan and for Entry of Final Judgment,\" in which the court adopted the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. In that Final Order, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court did not stay any individual action to be revived at a later point in time, or retain any jurisdiction over future individual lawsuits that may be brought, but instead provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   There are\n   <em>\n    no remaining issues to be litigated in this matter\n   </em>\n   , as the Settlement sets forth adequately the agreed upon mechanism to determine whether the Conditionally Released Claims will be dismissed by this Court or whether some Class members may pursue individual claims against DuPont.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (DuPont's Response to Pls' Supp. Brief, Ex. A; ECF No. 2416-1.) By this Order the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Court entered judgment in that class action. Since the entry of judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case, no MDL plaintiff has filed his or her action on the Conditionally Released Claims in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case. Rather, the plaintiffs have filed their actions separately in state and federal courts in Ohio and in West Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Additionally, if the Court were to accept the plaintiffs' position, it would render unnecessary the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement's provisions for tolling of the statute of limitation that would have been applicable to the Conditionally Released Claims. (SA \u00a7 6) (\"the Conditionally Released Claims, ... shall be deemed tolled from August 30, 2001 through and including the date on which the Science Panel delivers to the Administrator a Probable Link Finding with respect to the particular Human Disease(s) at issue in the Conditionally Released Claim\"). If the parties agreed that the Conditionally Released Claims would be considered first filed in August 2001, there would be no need to provide for tolling of the statute of limitations since the statute of limitations could not run on claims that were filed and remained pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   All that being said, the Court agrees with the plaintiffs' suggestion that this MDL may, in some aspects, be viewed as a second phase of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case. That is, the preserved claims are certainly impacted by the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement and in certain important respects governed by it. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dispositive Motions Order No. 1; ECF No. 1679.) It is, however, outside of the Agreement's reach to provide a mechanism for considering all of the Conditionally Released Claims as being actually accrued and filed at the same time that the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case was filed. The Court, therefore, declines to accept the proposed legal fiction that would present the individual claims in this MDL as being filed in August 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The\n    <em>\n     Leach\n    </em>\n    Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement's choice of law provision is applicable to the causes of action brought by each individual plaintiff in this MDL. The plaintiffs reason that \"the Parties already agreed on a choice-of-law provision to govern any question regarding what law applies under the terms of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Agreement.\" (Pls' Supp. Brief at 6; ECF No. 2285.) That provision is contained in the \"Miscellaneous Provisions\" section of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement and provides in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   14.3. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of West Virginia without giving effect to the conflict of laws or choice of law provisions thereof, except to the extent that the law of the United States governs any matter set forth herein, in which case such federal law shall govern.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   DuPont, however, argues that the plaintiffs \"are mistaken to the extent that they rely on the narrow choice-of-law clause contained in Section 14.3 of the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement to argue that West Virginia law should apply to all actions in this MDL, as that provision only addresses which state's law should govern interpretation of that contract, not which state's substantive law should apply in future individual tort actions.\" (DuPont's Supp. Brief at 9; ECF No. 2284.) DuPont continues, stating that \"Section 14.3 is plainly intended to address disputes that arise from performance of the Parties' obligations under that Agreement. There is absolutely nothing in the text of the Agreement or otherwise to suggest that Section 14.3 was intended to direct the choice of law analysis for future, individual personal injury lawsuits.\" (DuPont's Response to Pls' Supp. Brief at 2; ECF No. 2416.) This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Courts interpreting substantially similar contract provisions consistently find that the language relates to interpretation of the contract at issue and not to related tort claims. Those courts explain that the use of the limiting language \"this agreement\" or \"this contract\" does not encompass non-contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cavcon, Inc. v.

The Court is unclear how this statement causes the language in the choice of law provision to encompass the tort claims that are brought in this MDL. The language utilized in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement is routinely interpreted as relating only to interpretation of the contract, and not to subsequent related tort claims.

In\n   <em>\n    Nadler\n   </em>\n   as in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , application of Ohio law limited the damages available to the plaintiff. The\n   <em>\n    Nadler\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, an Ohio resident, brought suit in West Virginia against his motorist insurance provider following an injury accident. The plaintiff filed suit after the insurance provider, relying on Ohio law, refused to pay any amounts that exceeded his accident limitation of underinsured motorist coverage. Plaintiff contended that the West Virginia's public policy of \"full compensation for those injured\" precluded the application of Ohio law that limited recovery under his policy. The\n   West Virginia Supreme Court rejected this argument and upheld application of the Ohio damages cap. This was the result even though doing so resulted in the plaintiff not being able to fully recover damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further,\n   <em>\n    Paul v.

In\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   , West Virginia's highest court considered whether the lower court's application of Indiana's automobile guest statute violated West Virginia public policy, concluding that it did. The\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   court noted that application of the Indiana statute left the family of a woman killed in a car accident in Indiana without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cause of action. The court explained that \"West Virginia has never had an automobile guest passenger statute .... [and i]t is the strong public policy of this State that persons injured by the negligence of another should be able to recover in tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8579455\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/177/427/\">\n    177 W.

Application of the Indiana statute in that case contravened West Virginia public policy because it prevented any recovery in tort. It did not contravene public policy by\n   <em>\n    limiting\n   </em>\n   the recovery of the injured party, but instead by actually\n   <em>\n    eliminating\n   </em>\n   the cause of action. Moreover, the Court notes that West Virginia has a law that caps damages in medical malpractice actions, which indicates that the state is not opposed to damages caps as a general matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   West Virginia Code \u00a7 55-7B-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs cannot show that application of Ohio's tort reform statute is contrary to pure morals or abstract justice, or enforcement of it would be of evil example and harmful to the people of West Virginia.

In\n   <em>\n    Morgan\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was a resident of Kentucky, who was injured by the defendant's product in Kentucky and who filed suit in Ohio. The product was manufactured in Ohio by an Ohio corporation.

The court gave overriding weight to the factor of where the Bendectin was manufactured, which was Ohio, and applied Ohio substantive law.

First, as noted above, the\n   <em>\n    Bendectin\n   </em>\n   court's deliberation gave no weight to the rebuttable presumption as required under Ohio law, because the place of plaintiff's injury was \"often unknown.\" The facts in this case are different-Byers knows where he was exposed to defendants' products, so the rebuttable presumption applies. Second, it is notable that no other court in this Circuit has ever followed the\n   <em>\n    Bendectin\n   </em>\n   choice-of-law analysis in a products liability action.

The facts before this Court are different. The plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   where they were exposed to C-8, so the rebuttable presumption that the law of the place of injury applies. The rebuttable presumption is not overcome in this case for the reasons just stated above. The additional consideration of the \u00a7 6 factors does not change this conclusion. The Court finds particularly relevant the \u00a7 6 factors of certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, which weigh heavily in favor of application of the law of the place of injury. Applying the law of the place of injury will provide a predictable and uniform way to provide for the residents of each state. Otherwise, some of the Ohio Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs who live in Ohio and were injured in Ohio), would have Ohio law applied to them and some would have West Virginia law applied. This is because, as explained above, the Ohio Plaintiffs who filed their claims in West Virginia will have Ohio law applied to their personal injury claims. But if those same Ohio Plaintiffs had filed their cases in Ohio, then West Virginia law would apply. Indeed, finding that the Ohio presumption in favor of application of the law of the place of injury is overcome would require the Court to carve out one group of plaintiffs from this MDL for different treatment based on where they chose to file their case. Choice of forum, however, is not one of the Restatement factors this Court is required to consider to determine the state that has \"the most significant relationship to the occurrence\" that forms the basis of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See 1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conclusion - Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that regardless of where the case was filed, the West Virginia Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs who live in and were injured in West Virginia) will have West Virginia law applied to their claims and the Ohio Plaintiffs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs who live in and were injured in Ohio) will be subject to Ohio law. However, as the Court explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , determination of whether Ohio's damages caps\n   <em>\n    can be\n   </em>\n   applied does not answer the question of whether the caps\n   <em>\n    will be\n   </em>\n   applied. That issue is not yet ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at page 12, the Ohio tort reform statute does not apply retroactively. The application of the damage limitations hinges on the accrual date of the Ohio Plaintiffs' injury. If such date occurred prior to April 7, 2005, the effective date of the statute, the caps do not apply. The parties have not been directed to brief the question of when claims in this case actually accrued. This issue will be resolved\n   after each party has had an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' First Motion for Summary Judgment as it relates to its request that West Virginia law be applied to all of the individual cases within this MDL.
