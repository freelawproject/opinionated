Apparently, Burks \"misstated the law\" because he did not discuss the same Sixth Circuit law that the Government utilized in formulating its response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Regardless, the Court is (and was) fully aware of the requirements for establishing unlawful delay and understands that \"[t]he standard ... is nearly insurmountable.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is one thing to add the actual reason for the delay into the mix, quite another to require the Government to shoulder the burden of proving that the delay did not result in a tactical advantage.

It then spends four pages explaining how the facts in each of those cases was different. The short answer to this is twofold. First, virtually every case is distinguishable either procedurally or factually, but this does not mean that their general holdings or observations cannot be applied in other circumstances. Second, the Government has not negated the propositions that (1) a district court has \"wide discretion\" in determining what to consider in deciding a motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay,\n   <em>\n    Glynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202125082\">\n    2015 WL 2125082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, including \"hold[ing] a hearing,\"\n   <em>\n    Valona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10551718\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/834/1334/#p1340\">\n    834 F.2d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , or (2) that the failure to hold a hearing can hamper review, especially when the delay is long,\n   <em>\n    Farr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20141893\">\n    2007 WL 141893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. The Government\n   effectively concedes as much when it argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A district court considering a motion to dismiss due to pre-indictment delay may, of course, receive evidence in support of or against the motion in a variety of ways. In addition to holding an evidentiary hearing, the court may consider the representations of counsel in court, ... the representations in parties' filings with the court, ... stipulations entered into by the parties, or the court's impressions and understandings gleaned in the course of litigation .... There is no requirement, however, that district courts must hold evidentiary hearings on such motions. To the contrary: hearings only become necessary, if at all, after a defendant has met the heavy burden of establishing that an evidentiary hearing is warranted in the first place, by satisfying the two-prong test above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Doc. 453 at 11) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government's apparent position that a hearing cannot be granted unless or until a defendant establishes the two-prong test appears to be grounded on the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508898\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/466/#p477\">\n    118 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) which held that \"[t]o prove unconstitutional pre-indictment delay, the\n   <em>\n    defendant must first prove\n   </em>\n   'substantial prejudice' to his right to a fair trial.\" The Court does not read\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   or its progeny as requiring definitive proof of prejudice before considering the improper motive prong, or setting a hearing on pre-indictment delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit did not stop at the prejudice prong, even though that was not established.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Toaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1003000\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/59/94/#p99\">\n    59 F.

In fact, \"[b]ecause a defendant must meet both parts of the test to warrant dismissal of the indictment, [a court] need only address one part if the defendant's showing on that part is not sufficient,\" and that includes focusing solely on the second part of the test.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This seems particularly appropriate in a case where the Government has expressed concerns about witness safety and the pre-trial disclosure of evidence, and where the grand jury has found probable cause to believe that one or more of the Defendants have engaged in obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and the even murder of a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By way of summary, the Government's representations suggest the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For many years, local law enforcement agencies in and around the Clarksville, Tennessee area were faced with a rash of homicides, attempted murders, drive-by shootings, robberies, instances of drug trafficking, unlawful firearm possession, and witness intimidation allegedly committed by members of the Gangster Disciples. Oftentimes, state prosecutions went nowhere because (1) \"witnesses could not or would not come forward to testify,\" (2) \"the Gangster Disciples intimidated persons from testifying,\" (3) \"the gang creed prohibited any cooperation with law enforcement,\" and (4) \"gang members who did come forward were assaulted or murdered by members of the Gangster Disciples.\" (Doc. No. 453 at 15). Against this backdrop, the federal government entered the picture with a view towards \"secur[ing] additional witnesses and develop[ing] evidence to solve the homicides and other acts of violence that state prosecutors were not able to pursue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The federal investigation began in mid-2013 after agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\"ATF\") \"developed a source with intimate and substantial knowledge about the criminal activities of the Gangster Disciples in the Middle District of Tennessee[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Proffers from that source \"developed dozens of investigative leads into the criminal activities of the Gangster Disciples dating back over an approximately 15-year period, including instances of drug trafficking, assaults, robberies, burglaries, acts of obstruction of justice and witness tampering, and acts of murder and attempted murder, including dozens of potentially gang-related shootings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). After consulting with federal prosecutors, ATF agents sought out additional sources and evidence in an effort to confirm what they had learned. Their efforts included interviewing additional witnesses; reviewing numerous case files from state authorities, jail records, medical records of victims, and financial records; installing pole cameras for surveillance; and conducting surveillance of Gangster Disciples, both in and outside Clarksville\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Later in 2013, the government developed a second source who \"also had intimate and substantial knowledge about the criminal activities of the Gangster Disciples in the Middle District of Tennessee[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). That source recorded dozens of conversations with other gang members, provided details of their meetings to agents, permitted agents to surveil and photograph some of the meetings, and conducted controlled buys of illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Between 2013 and 2015, numerous Gangster Disciples were indicted on firearms and drug trafficking charges. Also during this period, agents in this jurisdiction and elsewhere conducted controlled buys from targets of the investigation, and some of those purchases serve as a basis of the racketeering and drug conspiracies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2015, after conducting more than 100 interviews with potential witnesses, and\n   securing the testimony of more than 70 of them, the Government was in a position to make a \"systematic and sustained\" presentation to the grand jury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). This was a lengthy process because the grand jury in this district only meets two days a month, and the Government needed to insure that cooperating witnesses would actually cooperate. This sometimes required the drafting of \"lengthy prosecution memoranda\" and plea agreements that required supervisory approval, both here and in Washington, D.C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18). Additionally, between the start of the investigation and the return of the Indictment, at least three different federal prosecutors had been assigned to the case, and \"ATF agents ... generated more than 800 reports of investigation detailing their investigative activities in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the grand jury returned a forty-five page, forty count Indictment against eleven Defendants. Since then, the Indictment has been twice superseded. The present charges are wide ranging and include murder in aid of racketeering, and a racketeering conspiracy that allegedly lasted twelve years. With regard to Burks, the Second Superseding Indictment charges conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity (Count One); conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, crack cocaine, Oxycodone, Methadone, Hydrocodone, and marijuana (Count 2); unlawful possession of ammunition by a convicted felon (Count Ten); murder in aid of racketeering (Count Eleven); using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (Count Thirteen); and murder resulting from the use, carrying, or possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (Count Fourteen), with Counts Eleven and Fourteen apparently relating to the death of Malcolm Wright. Because of the nature and scope of the charges, the Court has declared the case complex for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act. (Doc.

The decision to file criminal charges, with the awesome consequences it entails, requires consideration of a wide range of factors in addition to the strength of the Government's case, in order to determine whether prosecution would be in the public interest. Prosecutors often need more information than proof of a suspect's guilt, therefore, before\n   deciding whether to seek an indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/\">\n    at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2099\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/783/\">\n    97 S.
