KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Joseph Sellers, Jr., and Richard McClees serve as trustees of the SMART Voluntary Short Term Disability Plan (the \"VSTD Plan\" or \"Plan\"). The VSTD Plan is an employee welfare benefit plan regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), Pub. L. No. 93-406,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Stat.%20829\">\n    88 Stat. 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plan offers short-term disability benefits to certain rail and bus workers. From January 2010 through March 2016, Defendant Anthem Life Insurance Company (\"Anthem\") underwrote disability insurance that the VSTD Plan provided, and processed claims for benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Anthem overcharged the VSTD Plan for those insurance services. In the instant lawsuit, they bring claims against Anthem for violations of ERISA's prohibited-transaction provisions, as well as claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Anthem has moved to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). ECF No. 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15-1 (\"Def.'s Br.\"); ECF No. 17 (\"Pls.' Opp'n\"); ECF No. 18 (\"Def.'s Reply\"). For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiffs' ERISA claims will be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment, however, will be allowed to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The VSTD Plan was founded in October 2009 and was originally sponsored by the United Transportation Union (\"UTU\"). ECF No. 14 (\"Am. Compl.\") \u00b65, 7. In 2012, UTU merged into another union, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (\"SMART\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8. In 2014, Plaintiffs Sellers and McClees were appointed by SMART as trustees of the VSTD Plan, taking the seats formerly held by two UTU-appointed trustees, Malcolm Futhey (UTU's former president) and John Lesniewski.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b610, 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under both UTU and SMART, the VSTD Plan has provided short-term disability benefits to plan participants, who work for railroad and commuter-bus companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   12. The schedule of benefits differs for rail and bus employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13. Nonetheless, the essential features of the benefits are the same: the Plan offers short-term disability insurance to eligible employees, and premiums are automatically deducted from plan participants' paychecks unless they affirmatively opt out of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b614-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan engaged Anthem to provide short-term disability insurance to participating rail employees starting on January 1, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   18. The Plan paid Anthem the premiums deducted from participants' paychecks, and Anthem underwrote the benefits and processed claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b618, 22. Anthem offered its services through a series of one-year contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   45. In 2011, Anthem, arguing that it was not being adequately compensated, successfully negotiated with the Plan for higher premiums starting in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   31. Anthem also \"separately negotiated premiums to provide [short-term disability] benefits to bus industry participants\" starting in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Anthem \"knowingly receiv[ed] excessive compensation\" during the period from 2012 through 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b644-45. Specifically, they allege that the difference between the premiums Anthem received and the claims it paid ranged from $3.7 million to $7.1 million during those three years, representing \"profit margins\" of 26.2% to 49.8%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b634-43. Plaintiffs also complain that, while Anthem was all too eager to seek premium increases when its profits were supposedly low, Anthem did not offer lower premiums when its profits were high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Anthem, in addition to charging unreasonable premiums, also engaged in another form of misconduct. Specifically, they allege that Anthem paid \"kickbacks,\" disguised as commissions, to a former UTU employee named Edward Carney from 2010 through 2013.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b661-81. During the period in question, Carney allegedly had \"no business relationship with Anthem or the VSTD Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61. Nonetheless, Anthem allegedly paid Carney hundreds of thousands of dollars per year from the premiums it received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b662-65. Plaintiffs claim that Anthony Martella, who worked for a company that sold insurance to SMART members and \"was in the position to steer the commission business to Carney,\" helped \"to orchestrate the payments from Anthem to Carney\" (although how, exactly, is unclear).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b671-72. In return, Carney allegedly passed on tens of thousands of dollars from the \"kickbacks\" he received to Martella.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b666-70, 73. Plaintiffs also allege that, in 2011, Carney \"slipped $2,000 into the coat pocket of then president of the UTU, Malcolm Futhey,\" who was also a trustee of the Plan at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   74. Plaintiffs allege that the payments from Anthem to Carney \"were not reasonable commissions\" and \"increased, dollar for dollar, the amount of the premiums paid by VSTD.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b677-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After taking office as trustees of the Plan in 2014, Plaintiffs sought to negotiate better rates.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   51. Anthem responded by proposing what Plaintiffs characterize as a risksharing arrangement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   53. Until that point, Anthem had borne the risk of loss in the event that claims exceeded premiums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Anthem offered a deal under which Plaintiffs would pay higher premiums but receive quarterly refunds of 50% of the difference between premiums received and claims paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs evidently disliked this proposal but claim that, since it was too late to consider other offers, they accepted it by letter dated January 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   55 &amp; Ex. A. Plaintiffs allege that Anthem nonetheless failed to make any of the refund payments required under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Anthem subsequently took the view that the January 2015 letter had not caused a binding contract to form.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   92. Anthem sought to continue negotiating, proposing an agreement under which the refunds for 2015 and 2016 would not be paid quarterly, but in a lump sum in 2017.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   57. Anthem, for its part, claims that the parties ultimately did reach an agreement providing for a lump sum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 27. Anthem has provided what it asserts is the binding agreement, although it is signed only by the Plan and not by Anthem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. Ex. B (ECF No 15-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs assert five counts against Anthem. The first three arise under Section 406(a)(1) of ERISA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and allege that the payments Anthem received from the Plan constituted unlawful \"prohibited transactions.\" Am. Compl. \u00b682-102. Count IV alleges that Anthem breached its contract with the Plan by failing to make the quarterly refund payments that Plaintiffs claim are owed for 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    \u00b6103-109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Those claims, Anthem argues, are improper because they seek legal (as opposed to equitable) relief that ERISA does not afford in this context. Def.'s Br. at 9-12. Anthem also argues that Plaintiffs fail to state a prohibited-transaction claim, and that two of the three claims are time-barred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    at 12-26, 28-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether ERISA Prohibits All Furnishing of Services in Exchange for Payment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The core of the parties' dispute is whether ERISA categorically prohibits all provision of services to plans in exchange for compensation absent an exemption. Section 3, the definitional section of ERISA, defines a \"party in interest\" as including \"any fiduciary\" of a plan and any \"person providing services to such plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14)(A)-(B).

Neither party disputes that Anthem, by providing services to the Plan (some of which also caused Anthem to take on fiduciary responsibilities), became a \"party in interest\" under Section 3. Viewed in isolation, as Plaintiffs urge, these subsections\n   of Section 3 and Section 406 could be read to prohibit Anthem, a \"party in interest,\" from providing services to the Plan or being paid for those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But the flawed nature of Plaintiffs' interpretation becomes apparent when the Court looks-as it must-beyond the particular subsections they cite to the overarching text, structure and purpose of the statute. \"[T]o prevent statutory interpretation from degenerating into an exercise in solipsism, [courts] must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hearth, Patio &amp; Barbecue Ass'n v.

Subsection (E) is the first kind of prohibition: it prohibits plans from acquiring employer securities (that is, securities \"issued by an employer of employees covered by the plan,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201107\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ), under certain conditions, from\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   . Subsections (A) through (D), by contrast, are more limited. They do not categorically prohibit plans from engaging in certain types of transactions with any person or entity. They do not, for example, prohibit the \"furnishing of services to the plan in exchange for compensation,\" full stop. Rather, they only prohibit such transactions with \"a party in interest.\" If this limitation is to be given any meaning, Subsections (A) through (D) cannot be read to categorically prohibit the very transactions that cause a person to obtain the status of a party in interest. Otherwise, Subsections (A) through (D) would be just like Subsection (E): they would prohibit plans from engaging in certain forms of economic activity with\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   , regardless of that person or entity's relationship to the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Therefore, Section 406(a)(1) does not admit of Plaintiffs' interpretation, which is, as another court has observed, grounded in circular reasoning: the transactions were prohibited because Anthem was a party in interest, and Anthem was a party in interest because it engaged in the prohibited transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sacerdote v. N.Y.

Aug. 25, 2017). Rather, the statute only prohibits such service relationships with persons who are \"parties in interest\" by virtue of some other relationship-for example, with the employer who sponsors the plan. It does not prohibit a plan from paying an unrelated party, dealt with at arm's length, for services rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A close reading of ERISA's exemptions from these prohibitions further confirms that Plaintiffs' reading of Section 406(a)(1) is untenable. For example, Plaintiffs' reading fits poorly with the exemption codified by Section 408(b)(5). That exemption provides that plans may purchase life insurance, health insurance, and annuities from a licensed insurer if (i) \"no more than adequate consideration\" is paid and (ii) the insurer is the employer sponsoring the plan (or one of certain other interested entities).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). If all furnishing of insurance services in exchange for payment were prohibited, as Plaintiffs claim, then prong (ii) of this exemption would make no sense: why exempt\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   insurers that have a clear conflict of interest, allowing them to sell insurance for \"no more than adequate consideration,\" while completely prohibiting contracts with other, disinterested insurers? This exemption makes perfect sense, however, if Congress was specifically concerned that Section 406(a)(1) might steer plans away from prohibited (but potentially efficient) transactions with interested insurers, particularly employers that are insurers, and toward nonprohibited (but potentially less efficient) transactions with insurers that are not parties in interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Congress authorized the otherwise prohibited dealings with those interested insurers, provided that plans pay \"no more than adequate consideration\"-a safeguard plans do not need when contracting with disinterested insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Similarly, Section 408(b)(6)'s exemption underscores the conclusion that Plaintiffs' reading is not sustainable. That exemption covers \"any ancillary service by a bank,\" but only if that bank is a fiduciary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6). Such \"ancillary services\" may be offered only for reasonable compensation and if accompanied by certain other safeguards.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under Plaintiffs' reading, this exemption would be meaningless because the\n   <em>\n    core\n   </em>\n   service provided by the bank-that is, the service that caused the bank to become a fiduciary-would remain prohibited. Banks would never have occasion to provide \"ancillary\" services, because they would be prohibited from providing the\n   <em>\n    antecedent\n   </em>\n   core service. But Section 408(b)(6) makes perfect sense if Section 406(a)(1) allows the fiduciary to provide one service to the plan (and thereby to become a party in interest) and prohibits only the furnishing of other,\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs' reading also frustrates the well-accepted purpose of both Section 406(a)(1) and the statute as a whole. Section 406(a)(1) is intended to \"prohibit certain transactions that 'generally involve uses of plan assets that are potentially harmful to the plan.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Danza v.

Indeed, Plaintiffs' interpretation is \"potentially harmful\" to plans because it discourages service providers from contracting with them in the first place. A change of heart (or leadership) could easily inspire plans to claim that the service provider's bargained-for compensation was unreasonable, and because the Section 408 exemptions are generally considered to be affirmative defenses, service providers would be unable to ward off such lawsuits until after costly discovery, at the earliest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. The potential for strike suits would serve only to narrow the pool of available service providers, ultimately to the detriment of ERISA plans. These considerations confirm what the entire text and structure of the statute compel: that a plaintiff cannot allege a prohibited transaction merely by claiming that the defendant provided services to an ERISA plan in exchange for bargained-for consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The reading proposed by Plaintiffs would also create a conflict between ERISA's prohibited-transaction provisions and widely accepted law concerning the setting of fiduciary compensation. While the D.C. Circuit has not yet addressed the issue, other circuits have concluded that ERISA does not generally impose a duty on plan fiduciaries relating to the setting of their compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abraha v. Colonial Parking, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274650\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/179/#p185\">\n    243 F.Supp.3d 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185-86 (D.D.C. 2017) (collecting cases). That is, if a plan fiduciary negotiates the terms of its compensation with the plan at arm's length, and then adheres to those terms, its receipt of that compensation is unrelated to its fiduciary role and thus cannot be in breach any of its fiduciary duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274650\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/243/179/#p185\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' theory would effectively unravel this rule: because fiduciaries are \"parties in interest,\" plans could always seek to claw back fiduciaries'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   compensation under Section 406(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, it bears noting that the Court's reading of the statute does not render toothless ERISA's inclusion of service providers as parties in interest. For example, a prohibited transaction\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   occur when a service provider receives payments\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   its bargained-for compensation with the plan.

The only \"transaction\" alleged is that Anthem insured the short-term disability benefits for the Plan's participants. And Anthem, like all insurers, made money by collecting more in premiums than it paid in claims. That is not a prohibited transaction under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Whether ERISA Prohibits the VSTD Plan's Renewal of its Contract with Anthem\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that, even if the foregoing analysis is true, it does not warrant dismissal of Count I because Anthem engaged in additional transactions with the Plan after becoming a party in interest that: (1) renewed the contract at higher rates effective on January 1, 2012, and (2) expanded its insurance coverage to include bus workers in addition to rail workers, also effective on January 1, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 11-13. But on examination, neither of these theories alters the analysis set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs' first theory is that Anthem's renewal of the contract is a prohibited transaction even if the original contract is not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. This theory, however, suffers from the same flaw discussed above. But for the renewal agreement, Anthem would have ceased to be a party in interest at the end of the initial contract. Therefore, Plaintiffs seek, once again, to prohibit the same transactions that caused Anthem to be a party in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This theory appears to respond to cases holding that the absence of a \"prior relationship\" meant there was no prohibited transaction.\n   <em>\n    Fite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011556808\">\n    2010 WL 11556808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20Fed.%20Appx.%20120\">\n    533 Fed.Appx. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no prohibited transaction where the defendant \"was not a party in interest at the time the [relevant agreement] was signed\"). But the \"prior relationship\" formulation is imprecise. ERISA does not necessarily prohibit plans from dealing with persons they have dealt with previously. This is apparent from the definition of \"party in interest,\" which includes persons \"providing services\" to the plan but not persons who \"have provided\" such services in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (14). Nor does Section 406(a)(1) prohibit the plan from \"negotiating\" or \"signing\" services contracts with parties in interest. Rather, what it prohibits is the performance of those contracts: the \"\n   <em>\n    furnishing\n   </em>\n   of goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C) (emphasis added), and the \"transfer\" of plan assets to pay for them,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(D).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the performance of a renewal contract typically occurs\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the initial contract ends, and thus after the service provider has ceased to be a party in interest by virtue of the initial contract, signing the renewal contract does not cause a prohibited transaction to occur. And neither does performance of the renewal contract, since (as explained above) the furnishing of services to a plan cannot both cause the service provider to be a party in interest and constitute a prohibited transaction under Section 406(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Again, ERISA's purpose and structure confirm what its text provides. Prohibiting the renewal of agreements with service providers who have no other relationship to the plan would do nothing to prevent \"sweetheart deals\" of the type Congress sought to avoid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Fite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%2011556808\">\n    2010 WL 11556808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Such a rule would, however, encourage service providers to lock ERISA plans into long-term contracts, something that ERISA is generally understood to discourage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comerica Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012948705\">\n    2012 WL 12948705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 n.27 (\"[T]he legislative history reveals Congress was specifically concerned with the danger that a Plan would become locked into a long-term, disadvantageous service contract, and thus the DOL regulations define such contracts as unreasonable.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of all of the above, Plaintiffs' first theory does not save their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs' second theory is that the Plan engaged in a prohibited transaction when it expanded the scope of Anthem's services to cover short-term disability insurance for bus workers in addition to rail workers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 11. This theory also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs' second theory effectively posits that, even if Anthem's initial provision of insurance to rail workers was not prohibited because that transaction was what caused Anthem to become a party in interest, Anthem's provision of insurance to bus workers was a separate transaction, one prohibited by Section 406(a) because Anthem was already a party in interest by virtue of the rail-worker insurance. The Court has identified only one potential basis for this theory in the statute: a prohibition, suggested by ERISA's structure and legislative history, against providing \"multiple services\" to a plan. As discussed above, the exemption in Section 408(b)(6) suggests that, while fiduciary banks can provide one service to a plan, they cannot provide additional, ancillary services to that plan absent an exemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 35-36. ERISA's legislative history similarly suggests that fiduciaries cannot simultaneously provide \"multiple services\" that are qualitatively different.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 93-1280, at 309 (1974) (Conf. Rep.),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5038, 5090 (stating that \"brokerage houses\" would be prohibited from providing \"both discretionary investment management and brokerage services to the same plan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   But even assuming that a \"multiple services\" claim is cognizable under Section 406(a)(1), it cannot be based on a change in the quantity of a\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   service provided. That would require interpreting Section 406(a)(1) to mean that, because a service provider has furnished a certain amount of a service at a previous point in time, it cannot now furnish a greater amount of that service. Nothing in ERISA's text, structure, purpose, or legislative history suggests that result. To the contrary, as already explained, ERISA's prohibition against transactions with service providers is not based on prior relationships. The fact that a service provider previously furnished a different amount of the service in question is simply not relevant under Section 406(a)(1). Rather, unless one accepts Plaintiffs' flawed and circular reading of the statute, what matters is whether the service provider, at the time it is furnishing that service, has a separate relationship with the plan that makes it a party in interest. Under the \"multiple services\" theory, such a separate relationship would exist if the service provider were simultaneously furnishing a different service of a fiduciary nature. But it is not enough to\n   furnish a single service, even if the quantity changes over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' second theory fails because it rests on just such a quantitative change, not any allegation that Anthem simultaneously provided two qualitatively different services to the Plan. Plaintiffs claim that Anthem, when it renewed its contract with the VSTD Plan for the 2012 calendar year, agreed to provide the same type of insurance to a larger number of Plan participants. The only alleged difference between the insurance offered to rail and bus employees is that each had a different \"schedule of benefits\" and different premiums. Am. Compl. \u00b613, 32. The renewal thus left unchanged the nature of the services furnished: insuring plan participants' short-term disability benefits. Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves describe this change as merely having \"increase[d] the scope of [Anthem's] services.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' two alternative theories cannot save their claim. These theories ultimately rest on the same flawed interpretation of Section 406(a)(1): that Anthem, by providing disability insurance to the Plan, both became a service provider to the plan and engaged in a prohibited transaction. Therefore, Count I must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Count II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Count II alleges that Anthem's receipt of premiums for the 2015 calendar year was a prohibited transaction because it falls outside the scope of the exemption in Section 408(b)(2), which covers \"[c]ontracting or making reasonable arrangements\" for necessary services \"if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Specifically, Count II asserts that Section 408(b)(2) \"requires the existence of a contract or written agreement,\" meaning that Anthem cannot rely on Section 408(b)(2) if it is right that there was no binding contract in place at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b692-93.

Count III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Count III is different from Counts I and II: it arises from the payments made through Anthem to Carney.

And Anthem\n   continued to receive the VSTD Plan's business long after the payments to Carney ended.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b659, 61. There are, of course, cases where a kickback scheme draws the legitimacy of an entire contract into question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stuart Park Assocs. Ltd. P'ship v.

But Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged Anthem's participation in a scheme that tainted its entire contract with the Plan, such that it was not an arm's-length bargain. The Court notes that Carney (a former UTU employee) is not alleged to have been a party in interest to the VSTD Plan; nor is his alleged co-conspirator, Martella (who sold insurance products to SMART members).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.
