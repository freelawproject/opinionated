No. 1 at 2-3 (footnote omitted). Versata contends that \"Ford seeks to conduct a fishing expedition into Versata's litigation history without any showing of relevance,\" where \"[b]oth Ford and Versata have been involved in significant litigation,\" and that, \"[i]f parties were permitted to subpoena documents from unrelated lawsuits, discovery in this case would quickly spin out of control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

No. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ford responds that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Versata contends that the discovery sought in Ford's subpoena is \"totally irrelevant\" to the case pending in Michigan between Ford and Versata (the \"[Michigan case]\"). (Motion at 1.) As explained below, however, Ford's subpoena is narrowly tailored to Versata documents that are relevant to multiple claims in the [Michigan case]: trade secrets, invalidity, inequitable conduct, damages and others. The Special Master in the [Michigan case] has already determined that information Ford is seeking is relevant to Ford's claims, despite Versata's self-serving assertions to the contrary. [The parties stipulated to the Court's appointment of Larry Graham as a \"Special Master\" to handle all discovery disputes between the parties.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Versata also contends that compliance with the subpoena would \"require McKool Smith to produce confidential information that belongs to Sun.\" (Motion at 1.) Ford does not seek Sun documents. Regardless, Sun has confirmed that it does not object to production of Sun information that may be included in\n   the Versata documents (e.g., Versata expert reports and deposition transcripts) so long as the production is designated \"Confidential - Attorney Eyes Only\" pursuant to the Protective Order entered in the [Michigan case]. Ford has no objection to Sun's request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   McKool Smith has confirmed that it possesses responsive documents. Versata's motion to quash thus boils down to a relevancy dispute that only Versata has raised. McKool Smith (to whom the subpoena is directed) has not raised any relevancy objection. The only objection McKool Smith raised was the presence of Sun information in some of the requested documents. But that objection is resolved with Sun's approval described above. Versata's motion should be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Dkt. No. 9 at 1-2 &amp; n.1 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ford reports that, \"[o]n September 30, 2016, Ford served Document Request Nos. 106-109 on Versata seeking documents in Versata's possession, custody or control concerning the Sun Litigation\"; that \"Versata objected to Ford's document requests with boilerplate objections and refused to produce responsive documents\"; and that, \"[w]hen Ford and Versata held a telephonic meet and confer to discuss Ford Document Request Nos. 106-109, Versata indicated that it no longer possessed responsive documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Accordingly, \"[o]n January 4, 2017, Ford served a document subpoena on McKool Smith, Versata's counsel in the Sun Litigation,\" which \"subpoena seeks production of: (1) Versata's document production from the [Sun Litigation]; (2) Versata's technical and damages expert reports from the Sun Litigation; and (3) deposition transcripts for Versata witnesses\" but \"did not seek Sun documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   According to Ford, \"[d]uring a telephone call on January 16, 2017, McKool Smith attorney Michael Fritz informed Ford that McKool Smith currently possesses: (1) Versata's expert reports from the Sun Litigation, and (2) Versata deposition transcripts for Versata witnesses\" but that McKool Smith no longer possesses Versata's document production or trial exhibits from the Sun Litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Ford reports that, \"[o]n January 18, 2017, McKool Smith served objections to Ford's subpoena\" and that \"McKool Smith's responses did not include a relevancy objection\" but rather \"focused on the fact that the responsive documents in its possession were subject to the Protective Order entered in the Sun Litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"Ford respectfully requests that the Court deny Versata's motion to quash, and permit McKool Smith to produce the responsive documents in its possession pursuant to the Protective Order entered in the Michigan Litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Versata replies that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Ford makes a desperate effort to argue relevance for deposition transcripts and expert reports from a decade old case unrelated to the pending case in Michigan. But there is no relevance. First, with respect to the SalesBuilder software - which Ford contends is a prior art system relevant to some of the patents asserted in the Michigan case - Versata has already produced hundreds of relevant documents and responded to Ford's interrogatories. There is nothing more that Ford can glean from deposition transcripts and expert reports from the [Sun Litigation] relevant to Ford's SalesBuilder based invalidity claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, Ford argues that it needs the Sun materials for its damages case, but fails to explain a rational damages theory that would requires those documents. Likewise, Ford's argument that it needs deposition testimony about Versata's internal documents from 2002 discussing other Versata customers to establish the\n   nature [of] Ford's business relationship with Versata is simply illogical.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Ford's relevance arguments fail because transcripts from a decade old litigation involving entirely different patents/trade secrets and different products from different industries can hardly be relevant. The only common element here are a handful of Versata witnesses that Ford intends to harass with prior testimony on entirely unrelated issues. Allowing Ford this discovery will lead to further discovery disputes, requiring the parties to waste each other's time and resources on irrelevant sideshows - time and resources that the parties cannot afford to waste with important trial deadlines coming up in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Ford's subpoena is nothing short of a fishing expedition and goes far beyond the bounds of legitimate discovery permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, it requires McKool Smith to violate a protective order entered in the [Sun Litigation] and produce confidential information that is unrelated and irrelevant to the issues in the Michigan case. For these reasons, Ford's subpoena should be quashed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dkt. No. 18 at 1-2 (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Versata respectfully requests that the Court quash Ford's subpoena to McKool Smith and enter a protective order prohibiting production of documents from the Sun litigation to Ford\" but that, \"[t]o the extent the Court is inclined to grant discovery to Ford, it should be limited to only those materials that reference SalesBuilder - the only issue that has been ruled relevant in any way by the Michigan court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Motion to modify subpoena\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, a party may serve a subpoena commanding a nonparty \"to whom it is directed to ... produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control.\" FED.

Specifically, Ford explains that the Subpoena \"seeks the following categories of documents from the Sun Litigation: (1) Versata's document production, (2) Versata's expert reports, and (3) deposition transcripts of Versata witnesses\"; that \"McKool Smith indicated that it possesses documents in categories (2) and (3)\"; and that \"Versata's expert reports and witness testimony in the Sun Litigation are relevant to several material issues in the [Michigan case], including: invalidity (and inequitable conduct), trade secrets, damages, and the historical business relationship between Ford and Versata.\" Dkt. No. 9 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Ford further explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   With respect to invalidity and inequitable conduct, Ford contends that at least one Versata patent asserted against Ford is invalid and unenforceable in view of Versata's prior art \"SalesBuilder\" software sold for several years before Versata filed its patent application. Ford recently filed an amended complaint explaining in great detail how this patent should not have issued in view of Versata's prior art SalesBuilder software - software that Versata did not tell the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office about during examination. (Ex. 5, Appx. at 172-185.) The trial testimony in the Sun Litigation indicates that SalesBuilder was a focus of that litigation - a case which also involved alleged trade secrets and patent infringement. (Ex. 7, Appx. at 212.) In the Sun Litigation, SalesBuilder was described as Versata's \"flagship\" software, and several witnesses testified about Salesbuilder in detail. (Ex. 7, Appx. at 210.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Yet, in the [Michigan case], Versata has not produced any documents pertaining\n   to its SalesBuilder software. The expert reports and transcripts in McKool Smith's possession, however, clearly pertain to SalesBuilder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   In the [Michigan case], Versata recently argued - unsuccessfully - that Ford should not be permitted to take discovery of Versata's SalesBuilder software because it is \"irrelevant\" and because Versata had moved to dismiss Ford's inequitable conduct counterclaim. The Special Master appointed to manage discovery issues in the [Michigan case] rejected Versata's contention that Ford's discovery of SalesBuilder is \"off limits.\" On the contrary, the Special Master found Ford's discovery to be relevant on multiple grounds....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis removed; footnoted omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Ford further contends that \"[t]he discovery Ford seeks from the Sun Litigation is also relevant to damages,\" where \"[t]he Sun Litigation, much like the [Michigan case], involved a Versata software licensee (Sun) who ultimately elected to replace the Versata-licensed software\" and where, \"like the [Michigan case], Versata asserted that its ex-licensee committed patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. The trial transcript in the Sun Litigation indicates that Versata's damages claim for patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation was based largely on Versata's historical licensing fees with Sun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. According to Ford, \"[d]espite having a 10-year licensing history with Ford at a fixed annual license fee, however, Versata seeks damages over 100 times that annual fee in the [Michigan case]. Versata's damages expert report in the Sun Litigation is therefore relevant as it (i) supports Ford's theory that damages should be based on the relevant historical license fee, and (ii) undermines Versata's '100X' windfall damages theory in the [Michigan case].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   And Ford contends that the discovery that it \"seeks from the Sun Litigation is also relevant to the business relationship between Ford and Versata\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   As Ford explained in its complaint, Versata requested that Ford increase the annual fees Ford was paying Versata to use the software at issue. (Ex. 5, Appx. at 157, \u00b6 53.) Ford alleges that during one negotiation, a Versata sales representative stated \"we could have extorted a lot more money out of you three years ago.\" (Ex. 5, Appx. at 153, \u00b6 34.) Versata disputes that allegation. During the Sun Litigation, however, Versata's CEO Mr. Joseph Liemandt testified regarding a Versata Board of Directors meeting memo which stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Customers believe [Versata] is practicing extortion, but they can't replace us, although they'll keep trying, and then they give you SUN and IBM, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (Ex. 7, Appx. at 208.) Ford was a Versata \"customer\" at the time this memo was created. This internal memo supports Ford's allegation in the complaint, but Versata apparently destroyed it following the Sun Litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Another internal Versata document raised in the Sun Litigation (but since destroyed by Versata) states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Customers perceive [Versata] as expensive and inflexible with a poor history of delivering on promises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (Id. at 63.) This document, like the previous document, supports Ford's allegations in the case, and provides some explanation for Ford's decision to stop working with Versata.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   It is likely that the deposition transcripts will address these internal Versata documents, and others, that support\n   Ford's claims and allegations in the [Michigan case].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   And Ford contends that \"Versata witnesses, who were deposed during the [Sun Litigation], are directly relevant to the Michigan case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. \"For instance, John Lynch and David Franke testified to being the 'inventors' of the Versata 'Salesbuilder' software.

According to Ford, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Truswal\n   </em>\n   that a determination of relevance implicates the substantive law of patent validity and is thus governed by Federal Circuit law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689716\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/1207/#p1211\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   And, Ford argues, there is no other means for Ford to acquire the documents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Ford is not engaging in some \"fishing expedition\" into unrelated and irrelevant prior litigation. Ford has instead sought discovery from a single prior litigation where the facts, witnesses and evidence is relevant to Ford's claims and defenses in the Michigan Litigation. In addition, Versata never demonstrates why or how the allegedly \"irrelevant\" discovery would be burdensome for McKool Smith to produce. On the contrary, Ford counsel has spoken with Michael Fritz and agreed to work with him on ensuring that production can be done in a way that does not unreasonably burden McKool Smith. (Rondini Decl., Appx. at 235, \u00b6 15.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Versata's counsel in the [Michigan case] told Ford that neither it, nor Versata, possessed any documents relating to the Sun Litigation. Based on Versata's representation, Ford had no recourse other than to subpoena McKool Smith, Versata's former counsel during the Sun Litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (footnote omitted). And, \"[i]f Versata does possess the discovery sought, it would be required to produce it pursuant to Special Master Graham's February 6th order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Versata contends that the Subpoena subjects McKool Smith to an undue burden under Rule 45(c)(3)(iv), Ford contends that Versata has not made an adequate showing under the six\n   <em>\n    Wiwa\n   </em>\n   factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   With respect to Factor (1), Ford has identified multiple claims, defenses and fact issues that the discovery sought is relevant to. With respect to Factor (2), Versata has indicated that it does not possess the requested documents, and McKool Smith has indicated that it does. Thus, the subpoena is the only vehicle for Ford to secure the discovery at issue. With respect to Factors (3), (4) and (5), Ford has requested specific documents from the Sun Litigation that McKool Smith has in its possession: expert reports and deposition transcripts. With respect to Factor (6), little if any\n   burden will be imposed on McKool Smith. The materials presumably exist electronically and producing them should be relatively easy. In addition, because Sun has indicated that it is not opposed to producing the requested materials subject to the Protective Order in the [Michigan case], (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4, Appx. at 30-146), McKool Smith does not have to redact any included Sun information in advance of the production. As indicated above, however, Ford is willing to cooperate with McKool Smith to minimize any burden.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ford contends that the Court should deny Versata's MPO and permit McKool Smith to produce all responsive documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Versata replies that it has already produced SalesBuilder documents to Ford and that nothing else from the Sun Litigation is relevant to Versata's dispute with Ford, where documents from the Sun Litigation are irrelevant to Ford's damages arguments and where documents from the Sun Litigation about other customers are in no way relevant to Ford's relationship with Versata. According to Versata,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Ford's primary basis of relevance as to the subpoenaed documents is that some of these documents may relate to SalesBuilder - an early Versata product that Ford just this month asserted as prior art and as a basis for inequitable conduct against one family of patents in the Michigan case. Setting aside the fact that SalesBuilder is an entirely different software, that was developed, patented and sold many years before the patents and trade secrets asserted in the Michigan case, Ford now has what it needs with respect to that software. As Ford itself points out in its response (Opp. at 4), after Versata filed its motion to quash with this Court, the Special Master in the Michigan case ordered Versata to produce all SalesBuilder documents to Ford and to respond to Ford's related interrogatories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., Ex. 9. Versata has complied with the Special Master's ruling, providing Ford with interrogatory responses and producing over 800 documents. This production occurred after Ford filed its response in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (2/24/17 Email from Versata's counsel to Ford's counsel). Ford's argument that it needs additional SalesBuilder documents from the [Sun Litigation] is therefore now without merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Importantly, and as Ford concedes, McKool Smith did not retain the trial exhibits or Versata's document production from the [Sun Litigation], i.e., any SalesBuilder documents produced in that case. Opp. at 2. McKool Smith only possesses expert reports and Versata witness deposition transcripts from that case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is questionable that either of these categories of documents contain materials relevant to Ford's invalidity contentions. Contrary to Ford's claim, it is unlikely that these expert reports pertain to Versata's own SalesBuilder software, but rather to Sun's accused W5C software and its infringement of Versata's patents. Moreover, any Versata trade secret information that may be contained in these documents would be irrelevant to Ford's invalidity arguments. Ford's invalidity grounds for seeking any and all documents that McKool Smith may possess from the [Sun Litigation] should therefore be rejected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Dkt. No. 18 at 2-4 (footnote omitted; emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   And, Versata contends,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Ford's other basis for relevance of Sun documents - to prove Ford's damages positions - is also meritless. There are simply no common issues between the\n   [Sun Litigation] and this action. None of the patents, trade secrets, or copyrights overlap. The accused software programs - Ford's PDO software for automotive configuration and Sun's W5C software for computer systems - are completely different. Sun was a computer company that had nothing to do with the automotive industry, has never practiced automotive configuration, and has no relationship to Ford's accused PDO software. The damages expert reports from the [Sun Litigation] pertain to the issues at dispute in that case, as do the deposition transcripts. There is nothing from the [Sun Litigation] that can be relevant to Ford's damage's case. Ford's argument that positions taken by a different damages expert almost a decade ago on damages calculations for infringement of entirely different patents and trade secrets under reasonably different damages law would somehow be relevant to Ford's damages case in Michigan today is indeed farfetched.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   Likewise, Ford does not need documents from Sun to make a case about its business relationship with Versata. There are thousands of documents already produced in the Michigan case that detail that relationship over fifteen years - Versata alone has produced about 850,000 pages of documents. It is improbable that testimony from the [Sun Litigation] about documents relating Versata's relationship with Sun and dating back twelve years before Ford's dispute with Versata would in any way be relevant to the Michigan case. See Opp. at 6-7; Ex. 7, at 208-09. After all, Ford continued its business relationship with Versata for more than decade after those documents were created. More importantly, those documents discuss Versata's relationship with customers other than Ford back in 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ford is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition into Versata's litigation history to find tidbits in unrelated documents from unrelated cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayes v. City of Oak Park\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20187941\">\n    2007 WL 187941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 22, 2007) (granting defendants a protective order against plaintiff's non-party subpoena directed at documents that were not relevant to the claims or defenses asserted in Plaintiff's complaint). Moreover, from its brief, it is evident that Ford already has access to publicly available information from the [Sun Litigation] in form of trial transcripts and exhibits to the various filings in that case. Ford's sole goal in seeking additional documents is simply to muddle the issues in the case and create a sideshow on unrelated issues from more than a decade ago. With deposition transcripts from the [Sun Litigation], Ford intends to harass Versata witnesses in the Michigan case about statements they may have made - on entirely unrelated topics - in their Sun depositions. Allowing this discovery will only lead to further discovery disputes and detract from work that parties already have to do in a case that is highly complex and multi-faceted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 5-6 (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Versata further replies that this Court is not required to resolve disputes over relevance in Ford's favor. Versata contends that, \"in a later case, the Federal Circuit explained that\n   <em>\n    Truswal\n   </em>\n   does not preclude relevance consideration by an ancillary court 'where there are serious relevancy questions that have not been given meaningful consideration in the main litigation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Micro Motion, Inc. v.

Cir. 1990) ). According to Versata, \"[s]uch is the case here\" where, \"[a]side from the SalesBuilder documents - which Versata has already produced - none of the [Sun Litigation] documents that Ford requests from this Court have been ruled\n   relevant in any way by the Michigan court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540379\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/1318/#p1325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Court has considered whether the Motion to Modify presents \"exceptional circumstances\" that warrant a transfer to the Eastern District of Michigan under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(f), but, consistent with counsels' stated views on this question at oral argument, the Court determines that this matter does not warrant a Rule 45(f) exceptional-circumstances transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Further, the Court determines that it can appropriately address the relevance arguments raised by Versata consistent with the governing precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As Ford explained in its response and at oral argument, orders in the Michigan case have determined that materials regarding Versata's SalesBuilder software are relevant to claims or defenses in the Michigan case. The Court determines that Versata has not met its burden to show that the Subpoena should be quashed or a protective order entered to preclude discovery of materials that reference SalesBuilder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Likewise, the Court determines that Versata has not met its burden to show that materials from the Sun Litigation that reference or discuss the Versata Board of Directors meeting memo and other Versata internal document specifically discussed in Ford's response to the Motion to Modify are not relevant to claims or defenses in the Michigan case. In its response and at oral argument, Ford has persuasively explained those materials' relevance and likelihood of being included in Versata witnesses' deposition transcripts and deposition exhibits from the Sun Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   And the Court determines that the requested materials from the Sun Litigation that explain or discuss the theory or method of calculation for Versata's damages claim for patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation in that matter are relevant as to Versata's damages claims in the Michigan case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   But the Court finds that Versata has persuasively asserted that every Versta expert report and every page of every Versata witness's deposition transcript from the Sun Litigation is not likely to include materials relevant to claims or defenses in the Michigan case, and Ford has not shown otherwise. Whatever force\n   <em>\n    Truswal\n   </em>\n   and other decisions exert on this determination, they do not go so far as to simply taking the subpoenaing party's bare word for it that it really needs everything it is asking for. The Court further determines that every page of deposition testimony by Versata witnesses in the Sun Litigation who are also disclosed as or may be witnesses in the Michigan case is not, based on that overlap alone, relevant to a claim or defense in the Michigan case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Accordingly, the Court MODIFIES the Subpoena to (A) limit its documents requests to portions of the Versata expert reports produced in the Sun Litigation and portions of the deposition testimony, including associated exhibits, of Versata witnesses given during the Sun Litigation that (1) reference or discuss Versata's SalesBuilder software; (2) reference or discuss the Versata Board of Directors meeting memo and other Versata internal document specifically discussed in Ford's response to the Motion to Modify,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 9 at 5-6; or (3) explain or discuss the theory or method of calculation for Versata's damages claim for patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation in the Sun Litigation and to (B) require the redaction or exclusion of any Sun Microsystems confidential information that may be included within those specified portions of the Versata expert reports produced in the Sun Litigation and portions of the deposition testimony, including\n   associated exhibits, of Versata witnesses given during the Sun Litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   At oral argument, McKool Smith's counsel and Versata's counsel agreed that any modification or limiting of the Versata expert reports and Versata witness deposition testimony that the Court orders will be undertaken by Versata, not McKool Smith, and the Court accepts and adopts that agreed arrangement. To clarify, then - as a practical matter, to comply with the Subpoena as modified, McKool Smith must only produce to Versata all Versata expert reports produced in the Sun Litigation and in McKool Smith's possession, custody, or control and all deposition testimony, including associated exhibits, of Versata witnesses given during the Sun Litigation and in McKool Smith's possession, custody, or control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Trade secrets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Versata contends that the Subpoena \"to McKool Smith also threatens Versata's confidential information from the [Sun Litigation]\"; that \"Ford has no legitimate interest in discovering confidential information about unrelated Versata software and business activities\"; that, \"[a]lthough the Court in the Michigan case has entered a protective order, that is not a license to conduct irrelevant discovery into irrelevant trade secrets and unrelated business activities\"; and that, \"[e]ven with a protective order in place, that would unnecessarily risk compromising Versata's trade secrets with no corresponding benefit to this case.\" Dkt. No. 1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Ford responds that compliance with the Subpoena does not jeopardize Versata's confidential information or trade secrets. According to Ford, \"[b]ecause that information is relevant in both cases, however, the assertion that it is confidential is not a basis for withholding discovery,\" where the Subpoena \"instructed McKool Smith that all production should be designated as 'Confidential' or 'Confidential-Attorneys' Eyes Only' pursuant to the Michigan protective order already in place between the parties\" and where \"[a]ny Versata documents produced by McKool Smith will have the same protection and therefore will not result in any unnecessary risk or compromise to Versata.\" Dkt. No. 9 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Versata replies that the Subpoena does put unrelated Versata trade secrets at risk and that McKool Smith has objected to the production of Versata's trade secret information. According to Versata, \"Ford fails to meaningfully address the fact that its subpoena to McKool Smith threatens Versata's confidential information from the [Sun Litigation], including confidential information about unrelated Versata proprietary software and business activities,\" and \"Ford's citation to the protective order (Opp. at 9) provides no assurance of confidentiality - it is unclear how the protective order treats documents produced by a third party which contain Versata's confidential information.\" Dkt.

Apr. 15, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As modified, the Subpoena's document requests now exclude any Sun Microsystems confidential information. But McKool Smith, as Versata's counsel in the Sun Litigation, is subject to the Sun Litigation Protective Order, which remains in effect even after the Sun Litigation's termination and under which the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas retains and has continuing jurisdiction over Versata, Sun, and McKool Smith for enforcement of the provisions of the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Even with Sun's consent (or stated lack of opposition), the Sun Litigation Protective Order, by its terms, prohibits McKool Smith from disclosing Protected Information subject to that order to Ford for purposes of the Michigan case. Modification or termination of the Sun Litigation Protective Order appears to be necessary for that to occur. Ford cites the Court to a decision by a judge in the Eastern District of Texas that notes that \"courts may vacate protective orders issued by another court where the case has been closed or otherwise dismissed\" but that, \"when the other matter is ongoing, courts have held that any request necessitating the modification of the protective order be directed to the issuing court.\"\n   <em>\n    Mugworld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202229568\">\n    2007 WL 2229568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Holland v.

This Court will not take the extraordinary step of modifying or terminating this order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas - at least not until there has been an effort to file a motion with that court to modify or terminate its order. And the Court will not order McKool Smith to undertake any efforts in connection with such a motion, nor will the Court endeavor to predict how the Eastern District of Texas will receive such a request or whether Ford will be able to establish standing.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deus v.

The Subpoena does not seek the materials directly from Versata, where - whatever argument could be made that these materials are within Versata's control under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(a)(1) - Versata and its counsel in the Michigan case do not possess copies of them. But the Sun Litigation Protective Order - or, for that matter,\n   Texas Disciplinary Rule of Professional Conduct 1.05 - does not prohibit McKool Smith from providing these materials to its former client Versata, which remains subject to Sun Litigation Protective Order. (The same perhaps may not be said for providing the materials to Versata's counsel in the Michigan case.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As other courts have noted in related circumstances, this situation calls out for a practical solution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99311\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/191/495/#p501\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"99311\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/191/495/#p501\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The best that this Court can come up with is this: The Court further MODIFIES the Subpoena to require McKool Smith to, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(a)(1)(A)(iii), produce the responsive materials - all Versata expert reports produced in the Sun Litigation and in McKool Smith's possession, custody, or control and all deposition testimony, including associated exhibits, of Versata witnesses given during the Sun Litigation and in McKool Smith's possession, custody, or control - to Versata by\n   <strong>\n    March 23, 2017\n   </strong>\n   , at which point McKool Smith's obligations under the Subpoena (as modified) will be satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   What, if anything, happens after that production is for the parties to address in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and possibly the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Versata's motion for a protective order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Ford finally contends that Versata is not entitled to a Rule 26(c)(1) protective order where Versata does not explain why this Court should grant a protective order. \"For example, Versata does not assert any of the reasons for a protective order authorized under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26,\" and, \"[a]s the party seeking such an order, Versata bears the burden to show the necessity of the protective order and support its position with a particular and specific demonstration of fact, as distinguished from boilerplate and conclusory statements.\" Dkt. No. 9 at 9, 10. Ford argues that \"Versata does not claim that any of Ford's requests would cause it to suffer annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense; nor could Versata make such a claim as the subpoena is directed to non-party McKool Smith\" and that \"the primary ground for Versata's motion is that the discovery sought is not relevant\" but that \"[t]his argument, standing alone, is insufficient to support a motion for protective order under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Ford asserts that \"Versata has therefore not articulated any injury, let alone set forth specific facts showing a clearly defined and serious injury as required by law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Court agrees that Versata has not shown the need for a Rule 26(c)(1) protective order in this miscellaneous matter as to the Subpoena as now modified as explained above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Award of expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Considering all of the circumstances here and the Court's ruling above, the parties will bear their own expenses, including attorneys' fees, in connection with Versata's Motion for Protective Order and to Quash Ford Motor Company's Subpoena to Third Party McKool Smith to Produce Documents [Dkt.
