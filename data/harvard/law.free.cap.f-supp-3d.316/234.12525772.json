According to Defendants FedEx and John O'Reilly, their former supervisor, Plaintiffs were terminated for failing to follow internal policies regarding loss of packages while in transit. In December 2016, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against FedEx alleging, among other things, employment discrimination on the basis of race in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and defamation. Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to name O'Reilly as a defendant. Following the court's ruling on Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint, Plaintiffs' remaining claims are employment discrimination under \u00a7 1981 as to both Defendants and defamation as to FedEx only.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court are Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment as to these claims.

The\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework follows three steps: first, the court determines if the employee can establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination; if she can, the burden shifts to the employer to put forth a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for firing the employee; finally, if the employer does put forth a legitimate reason for the employee's termination, the employee must offer evidence to show that reason offered by the employer is a pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    at 802-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When an employer asserts a legitimate reason for firing an employee, \"as an employer almost always will do by the summary judgment stage of an employment discrimination suit,\" the prima facie case becomes an \"unnecessary sideshow,\" leaving the court with one central inquiry: \"[W]hether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Adeyemi v.

Opp'n, Mem. in Supp., ECF No. 39-1 [hereinafter Pls.' Mem.], at 8-30. None of these reasons, alone or taken together, warrant sending this case to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs' first argument does not support an argument of pretext. \"Custodial loss of ... customer property\" is clearly stated as one of the violations listed in FedEx's Acceptable Conduct Policy and it plainly means that a courier cannot lose packages while under his control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Howard Depo. at 132. Neither Plaintiff disputes having received the Acceptable Conduct Policy. Howard Depo. at 13-16; Cain Depo. at 25. And neither Plaintiff claims any confusion about the meaning of the prohibition against \"custodial loss of ... customer property.\" Cain Depo. at 26. That comes as no surprise. After all, a delivery company like Federal Express cannot effectively function if its couriers lose customers' packages with impunity. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' first proffered reason does not establish pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs' comparator evidence provides no help. Plaintiffs point to three other couriers-Randy Baldwin, Glennis Cole, and James Snyder-who lost packages while on their routes, but who were not fired, as evidence that Plaintiffs were treated differently because of their race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 22-23; Howard Depo. at 67, 70. Plaintiffs, however, fundamentally misunderstand how comparator evidence works. A plaintiff may prove that an employer had a discriminatory motive by producing \"evidence suggesting that the employer treated other employees of a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   race ... more favorably in the same factual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (emphasis added). Here, Baldwin, Cole, and Snyder are all of the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   race; they are African-American, just as Plaintiffs are. Howard Depo. at 67, 70. Accordingly, none of them are comparators who received differential treatment to support a claim of race discrimination. Therefore, Plaintiffs' second proffered reason does not show pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, O'Reilly's vulgar statements and profanity do not supply sufficient evidence of pretext. \" '[M]any bosses are harsh, unjust, and rude,' \" but \"Title\n   VII only protects against invidious discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston v. Clough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346753\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/224/#p237\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation omitted). O'Reilly's language may have been crude, but it is not sufficient to show racial animus. Moreover, O'Reilly's anti-Semitic comment might support a claim of religious discrimination, but it does not support Plaintiffs' claims of discrimination based on race. O'Reilly was not an ideal supervisor, but that alone cannot support an inference of pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the above reasons, no reasonable jury could find that Defendants' reasons for firing Plaintiffs were pretext for race discrimination.

A plaintiff must present \"affirmative evidence suggesting that the defendant intends or endorses the defamatory inference\" through \"the particular manner or language in which the true facts are conveyed.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

In Plaintiffs' view, by publicly announcing their firings FedEx insinuated that Plaintiffs had stolen the lost packages or were somehow responsible for the lost packages. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 179-80. Plaintiffs' theory of defamation is fatally flawed. Although the District of Columbia recognizes a cause of action for defamation by implication, \"[c]ourts in the District refuse, as a matter of law, to find defamatory meaning where the claim of defamation is based on the interpretation third parties place upon the termination of an at-will employee.\"\n   <em>\n    LeFande v.

This is because \"terminations of at-will employees can occur for any reason, or for no reason at all,\" rendering \"any message conveyed by a termination standing alone\" too ambiguous to sustain a claim of defamation.\n   <em>\n    Clampitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204585\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/957/23/#p40\">\n    957 A.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

Therefore, the mere announcement of their firing cannot support a claim of defamation by innuendo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Howard's separate defamation claim fares no better. Howard alleges that Lyers defamed him when he told Nolan \"[f]orget about Al. You don't know the whole truth about Al,\" when discussing Howard's termination. Am. Compl. \u00b6 57. The problem with this claim is that there is no admissible evidence to support it. To survive a motion for summary judgment, a\n   plaintiff must rely on evidence that is \"capable of being converted into admissible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Gleklen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753274,3671922\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1365/\">\n    199 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Gleklen\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit disregarded the plaintiff's evidence of a conversation for the purposes of summary judgment because the only mention of it on the record was from the plaintiff relaying what she had been told about the conversation from someone who was present for the conversation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753274,3671922\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1365/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the only evidence of the conversation between Lyers and Nolan on the record comes from Howard himself, who testified to what Nolan relayed to him about the conversation with Lyers. Howard Depo. at 100. Neither Lyers nor Nolan were deposed. Just as the conversation in\n   <em>\n    Gleklen\n   </em>\n   was disregarded for its lack of admissibility, so too is Howard's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gleklen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753274,3671922\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1365/\">\n    199 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
