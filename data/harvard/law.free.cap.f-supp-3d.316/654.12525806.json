Kaplan, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on defendants' joint motion seeking \"an Order granting Defendants' Motion to Compel the Government to Review Evidence in its Possession for\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   Material\" [DI 81].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Prior Briefing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The notice of motion misstated the nature of defendants' request. Defendants' initial memorandum of law made clear that the real object of defendants' motion was not to compel review, but rather to compel production, specifically of \" 'any written or recorded statement,' or the 'substance of any oral statement provided to the Government,' including statements made by an attorney for any individual or entity, that would be 'material' to preparing Defendants' defense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   But defendants' motion, as initially drafted, was beset by two issues. First, as this Court explained at oral argument on March 22, 2018, the motion, which provided a list of examples of information that defendants asserted would be material to their defense,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   effectively was an attempt to \"serve interrogatories and Rule 34 notices that would [do] credit to a plaintiff in a securities class action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, defendants sought the government's \"whole file.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, defendants' requests arguably were, at best, premature, and at worst, without a basis in law. The government had already made numerous\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   disclosures and had maintained consistently that it \"recognize[d] its obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), and its progeny\" and would \"provide timely disclosure if any such material [came] to light.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It represented also that it would \"provide material under\n   <em>\n    Giglio v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    405 U.S. 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    92 S.Ct. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    31 L.Ed.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government's disclosures to date then included descriptions of statements made by certain individuals, including student-athletes and NCAA coaches, with whom the government had\n   met. Defendants' motion nonetheless asked that the government go further and promptly disclose the actual statements made by these individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During oral argument, in an effort to resolve at least the first issue, defendants requested an opportunity to submit a supplemental brief to narrow their disclosure requests. The Court granted their request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The supplemental briefing having concluded, defendants' motion now is ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    This Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The title of defendants' supplemental brief now characterizes their motion as one to \"compel the government to produce exculpatory and impeaching witness statements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   They ask the Court, \"in the interests of justice, to compel the Government to promptly disclose the actual statements made to the Government by certain witnesses regarding a narrow set of critical topics,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as delineated in the supplemental brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants argue that the government should be compelled to disclose these witness statements for three independent reasons: (1) to comply with their obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   , (2) to comply with their ethical obligations as prosecutors, and (3) as a matter of sound case management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brady v. Maryland\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   , the government \"has a constitutional duty to disclose favorable evidence to the accused where such evidence is 'material' either to guilt or to punishment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Favorable evidence includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   does not, however, compel the routine or wholesale disclosure of witness statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is undisputed that the government timely has disclosed information sufficient to inform defendants of potentially exculpatory information that they may wish to investigate further, which in essence is what\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   requires. Among other things, the government conveyed that [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, the government has represented that it has and will continue to comply with its obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   as well as\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   . There is no reason to think that the information that the government has provided to this point has been insufficient for these purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To conclude otherwise would be to ask the Court to decide\n   in advance of trial whether the government's non-production of specific documents or categories of evidence would violate its\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligations-a premise that is flatly contrary to the law in this Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, defendants' motion, insofar as it is premised on\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   , fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Ethical Obligations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants next argue that \"[t]he Government's duty to disclose exculpatory evidence is not limited to its\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   obligations; professional conduct rules require the Government to disclose favorable evidence 'as soon as reasonably practicable,' regardless of whether the evidence is 'material' in the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   sense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants refer to New York Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8(b), which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"A prosecutor or other government lawyer in criminal litigation shall make timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant ... of the existence of evidence or information known to the prosecutor or other government lawyer that tends to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the sentence, except when relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of a tribunal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This argument is similarly unavailing. Although prosecutor's obligations under this rule and under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   appear to be distinct to some extent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendants fail to provide any legal basis for the argument that this or any other rule of professional conduct compels the disclosure of the witness statements defendants seek in the present context of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Sound Case Management\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants' final argument is that the Court should compel production of the aforementioned witness statements \"as a matter of sound case management.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Trial courts in this Circuit indeed have the latitude to require pretrial disclosure of evidence as a matter of sound case management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As this Court has stated before:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Sound case management involves consideration of many factors. Certainly one is whether pretrial disclosure is likely materially to reduce the risk of either a mid-trial delay occasioned by the need to pursue important evidence that could have been disclosed earlier or, in the event of a conviction, the need for a new trial to remedy an otherwise avoidable Brady violation. Another is the extent to which pretrial disclosure of otherwise undiscoverable materials would delay and complicate the trial without materially serving the cause of a just outcome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Stein\n   </em>\n   , this Court declined to compel the production of certain requested items because the disclosures that had already been made left defendants \"well able to pursue the matter without additional disclosure\" if indeed they found it helpful to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that they \"suspect that the Government has no intention of calling Mr. Augustine, the student-athletes, their family members, or any of the Universities' coaches as trial witnesses,\" in which case the witness statements that defendants seek might never be disclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, however, there is no legal basis under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to compel the government to disclose the witness statements themselves if the government has disclosed information sufficient to notify defendants of the potentially exculpatory material. Indeed, as the government argues, it \"has put the defendants on notice, as much as 10 months before trial, of issues they may wish to investigate further, including the existence of witnesses they may seek to interview, and prospective testimony they may seek to elicit at trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To the extent that defendants are concerned that the aforementioned individuals will not be willing to discuss the case or, if called to testify, would invoke the Fifth Amendment, their request is premature at best. Defendants assert that \"there is a strong possibility that they will need to ask the Court to compel the Government to immunize certain individuals,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the circumstances in which a court may compel the government to grant immunity are limited. \"The government is\n   under no general obligation to grant use immunity to witnesses the defense designates as potentially helpful to its cause but who will invoke the Fifth Amendment if not immunized.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, defendants have not yet found themselves in circumstances that conceivably would warrant requesting an order of immunity. Defendants' assertion that they may need the FBI 302 reports in order to build their case for immunity is speculative and unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants argue also that the statements they request \"will assist [them] in developing the specific defenses they intend to present at trial\" and in reflecting such defenses in their proposed jury instructions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   which this Court has instructed the parties to submit by August 15, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is without merit. Parties regularly submit proposed jury instructions ahead of receiving Jencks Act and\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   material, and receive ample opportunity to request or object to jury instructions during trial. The Court sees no reason to compel production of the requested witness statements on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court declines to compel production of the requested witness statements, at least at this time. For the foregoing reasons, defendants' joint motion [DI 81] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    DI 82 at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 15-17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    DI 130 (\"Tr.\") at 47.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836321\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/473/597/#p603\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    DI 82-2 at 3, DI 82-3 at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836321\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/473/597/#p603\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Tr. at 51.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    DI 133 (capitalization omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     United States v.
