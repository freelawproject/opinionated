DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action springs from a dispute between an insured-Plaintiff Frank Ayers (\"\n   <strong>\n    Ayers\n   </strong>\n   \")-and his insurance company-Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"\n   <strong>\n    State Farm\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 2.) The clash centers on competing interpretations of State Farm's obligation under a car insurance policy (\"\n   <strong>\n    Policy\n   </strong>\n   \") to provide its insureds with counsel before the initiation of third-party bodily injury lawsuits (\"\n   <strong>\n    Coverage Issue\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58.) On February 15, 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the Coverage Issue (Docs. 85, 87 (\"\n   <strong>\n    SJ Motions\n   </strong>\n   \") ), which have been fully briefed (Docs. 98, 99). The Court heard argument on May 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103.) On review, the Court finds that State Farm's SJ Motion is due to be granted, and Ayers' SJ Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Doc. 85, \u00b6 1; Doc. 98, \u00b6 1.) Graham suffered injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 87-12, p. 8.) At the time of the accident, Ayers was insured by State Farm and his Policy provided liability coverage for bodily injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Insuring Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1.

(Doc. 85, \u00b6 2; Doc. 98, \u00b6 2.) On January 10, 2017, Graham contacted State Farm, demanding that State Farm tender the $100,000 policy limit due to her injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 87-12, p. 8.) State Farm then forwarded the pre-suit demand to Ayers and included a pre-suit personal asset affidavit and a letter informing Ayers that \"if [he] wish[ed] to have [his] personal attorney review this information, [he should] please feel free to do so.\" (Doc. 87-12, p. 3.) At that point, State Farm did not hire counsel to represent Ayers, and it rejected Graham's pre-suit demand. (Doc. 85, \u00b6 13; Doc. 98, \u00b6 13; Doc. 87-3, p. 28.) So Graham filed suit against Ayers in state court on March 22, 2017 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Graham Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n   \"). (Doc. 85; \u00b6 3; Doc. 98 \u00b6 3.) Once filed, State Farm retained counsel to defend Ayers. (Doc. 87, \u00b6 6; Doc. 99, \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Instant Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Displeased by State Farm's failure to settle the Graham Claim and the initiation of the Graham Lawsuit, Ayers went on the offensive. He filed this putative nationwide class action in state court and asserted, among others, a class action claim for breach of contract against State Farm based on: (1) the failure to provide counsel to Ayers before the Graham Lawsuit was filed; and (2) the failure to reimburse him for expenses he incurred for forwarding lawsuit documents to State Farm. (Doc. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 95-116 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Class Claim\n   </strong>\n   \").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Invoking the Court's diversity jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act, State Farm removed the action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1, 31.) Following removal, the Court found that the majority of Ayers' individual claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to satisfy supplemental jurisdiction, so it severed and remanded them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 76.) After whittling down Ayers' claims, what remains pending are the Class Claim and the declaratory judgment claim to the extent it turns on the Coverage Issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n.5.) To resolve the Coverage Issue, the Court directed the parties to submit the instant cross-motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 58.) The Court then heard argument on May 1, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103), and the matter is now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 85-2, p. 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 87-7, p. 14.) In contrast, State Farm points to internal guidance it provides to claims representatives which, it contends, supports the discretionary nature of the right to hire pre-suit counsel. (Doc. 87, p. 5-7, 14-16.) Because the language of the Defense Provision is clear and unambiguous, the Court cannot consider the parties' extrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phila. Am. Life Ins.

(Doc. 85, p. 11-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 99, pp. 3-5.) In true Lewis Carroll fashion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ayers essentially urges the Court to imbue the Policy with whatever meaning supports his position.

That the Policy does not define \"right\" does not alter the Court's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124104\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/845/161/#p165\">\n    845 So.2d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his final effort to get around the Defense Provision's unambiguous language, Ayers contends that reading the Policy to not impose a duty on State Farm to hire pre-suit counsel renders it illusory. (Doc. 85, pp. 15-16.) According to Ayers, the Policy permits State Farm to say, in effect, \"I will hire counsel if I want to,\" while it obligates Ayers to cooperate with State Farm's control of that defense, prohibiting him from hiring his own counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Such contradiction is purportedly an absurd result. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As previously explained, an insurer may permissibly relieve itself of a duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E. Fla. Hauling, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8905945\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/913/673/#p677\">\n    913 So.2d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And courts construing similar insurance policy language have enforced an insurer's right, not duty, to provide a defense to insureds.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8905945\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/913/673/#p677\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Great W. Cas. Co. v. Flandrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202986\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/605/955/#p977\">\n    605 F.Supp.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 977-78 (S.D. Ohio 2009) (collecting state and federal district court opinions). So the discretionary nature of State Farm's right to defend a claim does not render the\n   Policy illusory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flandrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202986\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/605/955/#p977\">\n    605 F.Supp.2d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To hold otherwise would effectively rewrite the Policy, which the Court has previously explained it cannot do. Rather, the Court concludes that the Policy as written is enforceable. Although Ayers wants to mandate\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   State Farm defends a claim brought against an insured (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 85, pp. 15-16), that is not the policy he chose to buy. He can no more change that choice now than he can alter the unambiguous terms of the Policy. Because the Court concludes that the Policy does not obligate State Farm to hire pre-suit counsel for Ayers, State Farm's SJ Motion is due to be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
