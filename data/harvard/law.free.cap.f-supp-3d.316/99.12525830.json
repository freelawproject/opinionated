BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2009, White House Counsel Gregory Craig issued a memorandum advising \"all federal agency and department general counsels to consult with the White House on all document requests that may involve documents with 'White House equities.' \" Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-3; Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Pl.'s SUMF\"), ECF No. 55-2 \u00b6 1. Concerned about the White House's involvement in the FOIA process, Cause of Action requested the following records from the IRS:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   All records, including but not limited to e-mails, letters, meeting records, and\n   phone records, reflecting communications between IRS FOIA staff or IRS Chief Counsel's office and the White House Counsel's office concerning records forwarded by the IRS for White House review in connection with document requests by Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, or FOIA requesters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 17; Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The request, which was submitted on May 29, 2013, sought records from \"January 2009 to the present.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The IRS acknowledged receipt of Cause of Action's request on June 25, 2013, but then proceeded to ask for numerous extensions of time to respond. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-23; Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. When Cause of Action filed this action on August 18, 2014, the IRS had not yet produced any responsive records or provided a final determination as to plaintiff's FOIA request. Pl.'s SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the declarations submitted by the IRS in support of its motion for summary judgment, the IRS first began searching for records responsive to Cause of Action's request on August 21, 2013, approximately three months after the date of plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of A.M. Gulas (\"Gulas Decl.\"), Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 1, ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6 5. The IRS interpreted Cause of Action's FOIA request as \"seeking records reflecting communications between the IRS FOIA staff, or Chief Counsel, and the White House Counsel's office, relating to records forwarded by the IRS FOIA staff, or Chief Counsel, to the White House Counsel's office to review before such records are provided to Congress, GAO or FOIA requesters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this interpretation and her knowledge of \"the IRS's functions and procedures,\" Ms. Gulas determined that three offices were the most likely to have potentially responsive records: (1) the Office of the Chief Counsel; (2) the Executive Secretariat Correspondence Office (\"ESCO\"); and (3) the Office of Disclosure, which is within the Office of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure (\"PGLD\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As an initial matter, although Cause of Action asserts that the agency should have searched PGLD, the declarations make clear that PGLD\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   searched for responsive records. As Ms. Gulas explained, \"[w]ithin PGLD, the Office of Disclosure is responsible for responding to requests made pursuant to FOIA.\" Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6 9. Accordingly, records within the Office of Disclosure were searched. Moreover, the Deputy Associate Director of the Headquarters Office of Disclosure-who is the \"highest ranking official within PGLD from the period covered by plaintiff's FOIA request\" that has relevant knowledge and is currently still employed at the agency-specifically attested that the Office of Disclosure \"would have handled any FOIA request that impacted, in any way, 'White House equities.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of John H. Davis (\"Davis Decl.\"), Def.'s Reply Ex. 4, ECF No. 59-2 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. To the extent that Cause of Action intends to argue that the IRS should have searched other components of PGLD, Cause of Action fails to offer any factual basis that other components would be reasonably likely to possess responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Likewise, although Cause of Action complains that the IRS did not search records contained by \"sub-components of the Office of Chief Counsel,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 55-1 at 7-8, that argument also fails. After all, the IRS\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   search the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration), which is a sub-component of the Office of Chief Counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6 27. Moreover, as Ms. Gulas attested, the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration) \"has responsibility for disclosure, privacy and FOIA issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418904\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/277/1/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although\n   that office has seven branches, the attorneys who handle matters involving FOIA requests are \"located in branches 6 and 7.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Cause of Action offers no basis to suggest that other sub-components of the Office of Chief Counsel may have had responsive records. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the IRS's decision to limit its search to certain branches within the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel was reasonably calculated to discover responsive documents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The IRS's Searches Were Adequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The IRS's Search of the Office of Chief Counsel Was Adequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Cause of Action contends that the IRS's search of the Office of Chief Counsel was inadequate for two reasons: (1) because the scope of the search was unduly constrained; and (2) because the IRS confused the terms \"coordination\" and \"consultation.\" Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 55-1 at 8-9. Both arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, as previously explained, the affidavits submitted by the IRS offer compelling justification for the agency's decision to limit its search to the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B. Likewise, the agency explained why it chose to limit its search to two branches of that division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Gulas is a \"technical expert\" on FOIA matters based on her twenty-one years of experience as a disclosure attorney in the Office of Chief Counsel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 32-33, and her affidavit is to be accorded a \"presumption of good faith\" in the absence of evidence to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    SafeCard Servs., Inc. v.

Cir. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Cause of Action accuses the two senior counsels who provided affidavits in support of IRS's motion for summary judgment of confusing the terms \"coordination\" and \"consultation\"-which, according to plaintiff, have a different \"technical meaning\"-in responding to plaintiff's FOIA request. According to Cause of Action, these declarations, which explain that there was no \"practice in the office to\n   <em>\n    coordinate\n   </em>\n   responses to FOIA requests, GAO or Congressional inquiries with the White House or White House Counsel's office,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6 33 and Decl. of Jennifer Black, Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. 2, ECF No. 51-4 \u00b6 19, are inadequate to establish that there was no practice to \"consult\" with the White House. Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 55-1 at 8-9. Ms. Gulas's declaration, however, confirms that she included the search terms \"consultation\" and \"consult\" in searching for records responsive to plaintiff's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29. As such, the Court concludes that any purported confusion between \"coordination\" and \"consultation\" did not affect the adequacy of the agency's search for records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The IRS's Search of the Executive Secretariat Correspondence Office Was Adequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With respect to the IRS's search of ESCO, Cause of Action complains that it is unable to determine whether the search was adequate because the IRS's affidavits contain insufficient information regarding the E-Trak database, which is ESCO's document management system that tracks certain correspondence. Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 55-1 at 9-10. In particular, Cause of Action states that it requires additional information regarding \"the individual employees or IRS components whose correspondence is stored in E-Trak.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In response, the IRS offers the supplemental declaration of Jennifer Black.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Decl. of Jennifer Black (\"Black Supp. Decl.\"), Def.'s Reply Ex. 8, ECF No. 59-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Black explains that \"[a]ll communications\" addressed to the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, as well as to the Director of Legislative Affairs, were recorded in E-Trak.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. In addition, correspondence addressed to, among others, the President and then referred to the Office of the Commissioner or the Director of Legislative Affairs was also recorded in E-Trak.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Cause of Action does not make any arguments with respect to the adequacy of the IRS's search in light of this information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross-Motion for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 63 at 7-9. In any event, the Court notes that Cause of Action only requested communications between the White House and \"IRS FOIA staff or IRS Chief Counsel's office\"-and not with the Commissioner or others whose correspondence is handled by ESCO. Accordingly, in light of the IRS's searches in E-Trak using appropriate terms, the Court concludes that the agency has carried its burden to demonstrate that its search was reasonably calculated to discover documents responsive to Cause of Action's FOIA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The IRS's Search of the Office of Disclosure Was Adequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, Cause of Action argues that IRS's search for records within the Office of Disclosure was inadequate for two reasons: (1) because of the IRS's \"unwillingness to search individual employee e-mail from that office\"; (2) because the search terms used were \"inadequate to capture potentially responsive records.\" Pl.'s Opp., ECF No. 55-1 at 10-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, whether IRS was required to search the individual email accounts of each employee in the Office of Disclosure depends on whether such a search was reasonably necessary to discover documents requested by Cause of Action's FOIA request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safecard Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546712,3488360\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1197/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the IRS's declarations make clear, the agency determined that searching employee emails was unnecessary in light of Deputy Associate Director Davis's representation that he was not aware of any consultations between the Office of Disclosure and the White House Counsel's Office with respect to FOIA requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gulas Decl., ECF No. 51-3 \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Davis Decl., ECF No. 59-2 \u00b6 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By insisting that the IRS was required\n   to search each employee's individual email account, Cause of Action misunderstands the standard for adequacy of an agency's search under FOIA. An agency is only required to show that \"it has conducted a search\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   calculated to uncover all relevant documents,\"\n   <em>\n    Weisberg v.
