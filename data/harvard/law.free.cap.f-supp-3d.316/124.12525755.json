INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter arises from a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") investigation\n   of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (\"Siemens\") conducted by the United States Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). As a result of the investigation, in 2008 Siemens pleaded guilty to violating the FCPA's internal controls and books and records provisions. The plea agreement imposed a large fine on Siemens and three subsidiaries, and it required Siemens to hire an independent compliance monitor to ensure that it implemented an effective corporate governance system and complied with all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Siemens hired Dr. Theodore Waigel (the \"Monitor\") to serve as its compliance monitor. Pursuant to his mandate under the plea agreement, the Monitor conducted a multi-year review of Siemens' compliance programs. Over four years he provided more than 150 recommendations to Siemens for ways to improve its compliance programs, and he submitted several written reports to DOJ, including work plans at the start of each year, summary reports at the end of each year, and status reports and other correspondence on an ongoing basis. Each year, he also certified that Siemens was in compliance with the plea agreement's terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, Plaintiff 100Reporters LLC, a non-profit dedicated to investigative journalism, submitted a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request to the DOJ seeking records related to the monitorship. DOJ denied the request and an administrative appeal. In 2014, 100Reporters brought this FOIA action before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DOJ has produced redacted documents falling within the scope of 100Reporters' request, while withholding others in full under certain FOIA exemptions. 100Reporters objects to those withholdings. In 2016, DOJ and 100Reporters filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and this Court granted DOJ's motion in part and denied it in part, and it denied 100Reporters' motion. The Court's ruling ratified DOJ's withholdings under FOIA Exemption 4 and the attorney work product privilege incorporated into Exemption 5, and it directed DOJ to provide additional factual support for the other exemptions on which it relied, including a representative sample of documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Now before the Court are DOJ's renewed motion for summary judgment and 100Reporters' opposition.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. U.S. Dep't Justice's Renewed Mot. Summ. J. (\"DOJ Mem.\"), ECF No. 83-2; Pl.'s Opp'n (\"100Reporters Mem.\"), ECF No. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that DOJ's Exemption 4 withholdings are overbroad, and that while DOJ has justified the withholding of certain information under Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C), DOJ's withholdings under those Exemptions are also overbroad. The Court will therefore grant in part DOJ's motions for summary judgment with respect to the Exemptions, but will deny DOJ's motion for summary judgment with respect to its obligation to segregate and disclose non-exempt material. Finally, the Court will grant in part and deny in part 100Reporters' cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2013, 100Reporters submitted a FOIA request to DOJ for records related to\n   <em>\n    Aktienengesellschaft, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 1:08-cr-367-RJL (D.D.C.), the criminal prosecution of Siemens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts (\"DOJ Statement\") \u00b6 1,\n   ECF No. 83-1. In February 2014, 100Reporters narrowed its request to the following records:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 \"Corporate Compliance Statements\" that Siemens filed with DOJ under Siemens' plea agreement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Documents relating to the Monitor's evaluation of the effectiveness of Siemens' anticorruption compliance program;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Documents relating to steps taken by the Monitor to confirm compliance by Siemens;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Information, records, and facilities requested by the Monitor that fell within his mandate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The Monitor's work plans, reviews, and reports; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Disclosures made by Siemens to the Monitor concerning corrupt payments and related books, records, and internal controls violations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DOJ Statement 4; Decl. of Suzanna Moberly (\"Moberly Decl.\") \u00b6 9, ECF No. 59-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Months later, in July 2014, 100Reporters brought this suit seeking to compel the production of documents that are responsive to its request.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. DOJ's Answer raised one affirmative defense-that the requested documents were exempt from disclosure under FOIA-and it relied on FOIA Exemption 4, Exemption 5, Exemption 6, Exemption 7(A), Exemption 7(C), and Exemption 7(D) in support of that defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Answer at 6, ECF No. 11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2015, during the pendency of the litigation, DOJ produced two sets of responsive materials to 100Reporters totaling two videos and approximately 500 pages of documents, many of which were redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moberly Decl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Status Report &amp; Proposed Briefing Schedule at 2, ECF No. 49 (\"Federal Defendant provided Plaintiff with some of the documents previously withheld entirely, largely redacted on December 4, 2015.\"). DOJ continued to withhold in full six video presentations and 4,293 pages of documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Moberly Decl. \u00b6 19. These materials are encompassed in: (1) four annual Reports prepared by the Monitor setting forth the Monitor's assessment of Siemens' compliance program and his recommendations for improvement of the same, and presentations and correspondence submitted about or in conjunction with the Monitor's reports and reviews; (2) four annual Work Plans prepared by the Monitor detailing the manner in which he intended to perform his reviews (some of which were attached as exhibits to the Monitor's annual reports), and associated correspondence, documents, and presentations; (3) Siemens training materials, internal presentations, and compliance policies; and (4) additional correspondence between the Monitor, DOJ, and SEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Statement \u00b6 27; Decl. of Joel Kirsch (\"Kirsch Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 16, 22, 25, 27, ECF No. 58-2; Declaration of F. Joseph Warin (\"Warin Decl.\") \u00b6 25(a)-(e), ECF No 57-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In March and April 2016, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment regarding relevant information that DOJ did not disclose. In their motions, the parties argued over whether DOJ was obligated to disclose four categories of information: (1) documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 4 as confidential commercial information; (2) documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 5's attorney work product privilege; (3) documents withheld pursuant to Exemption 5's deliberative process privilege; and (4) documents redacted pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) as records implicating the privacy interests of government employees, monitorship\n   team members, Siemens employees, and third-party witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    100Reporters LLC v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DOJ continues to withhold certain documents-some in part and some entirely-pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, 6, and 7(C). 100Reporters argues that (1) DOJ has failed to show that it properly withheld information under Exemptions 5, 6, and 7(C); and (2) the documents at issue contain segregable non-exempt information that should be disclosed. For reasons explained below, the Court holds that DOJ withheld information under Exemption 4 that is not within the scope of that Exemption. The Court also holds that DOJ has justified the withholding of certain information pursuant to the deliberative process privilege contained in Exemption 5, and certain personal information pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), but that it\n   similarly applied those Exemptions in an overbroad manner. Accordingly, the Court holds that DOJ failed to fulfill its obligation to segregate and disclose non-exempt information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Exemption 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first issue before the Court is whether DOJ's Exemption 4 withholdings are appropriately tailored. Having completed its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Court holds that certain withholdings are overbroad because they cover material that is not commercial in nature. Exemption 4 states that \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person\" that are \"privileged or confidential\" may be withheld from disclosure.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4).

Year Three Work Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   DOJ and Siemens characterize the Work Plans as containing reams of information relating to Siemens' operations. For instance, Mr. Kirsch stated that the Plans detail \"Siemens' operations, contracts, projects, and bids that the Monitor intended to review.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kirsch Decl. \u00b6 22. He also stated that they reflect \"Siemens' business operations, structure, and compliance controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Similarly, the Amended\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index states that the Monitor's Year One Work Plan describes \"the number of Siemens employees in each country, new orders, new government orders, joint ventures and business partnerships, and Siemens' business development strategy across different sectors of the economy.\" DOJ_0000001, Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, however, has revealed that the Year Three Work Plan consists mostly of general descriptions of the Monitor's past and future activities with very few details about Siemens' business operations. The Plan is broken into eight sections, which the Court has analyzed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 Section I is the Work Plan's Introduction. It has been produced un-redacted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \u2022 Sections II and III, entitled \"The Year One Review\" and \"The Year Two Review,\" contain summary statistics and general descriptions of the Monitor's activities in prior years, noting, for instance, that the Monitor \"collected, reviewed, and analyzed approximately 10,000 Company documents totaling approximately 140,000 pages,\" and that the Monitor \"observed more than twenty regularly\n   scheduled compliance-related meetings.\" They contain no information about Siemens' business operations, competitive landscape, or compliance programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u2022 Section IV, entitled \"The Compliance Monitor's Mandate and Year Three Review,\" describes the obligations of Siemens and the Monitor under the plea agreement, and it generally describes the Monitor's \"risk-based approach,\" again without providing any information about Siemens' operations or compliance programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \u2022 Section V, entitled \"Substantive Structure of the Year Three Review,\" describes the seventeen \"thematic focus areas\" that guided the Monitor's evaluation. One paragraph in this Section, on page 12 of the Plan, lists Siemens' purchasing volume, number of supplier relationships, and number of supplier accounts. Aside from this business information, however, this Section lays out each thematic focus area without reference to Siemens' business operations or its compliance policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 Section VI, entitled \"Methodology of the Year Three Review,\" describes the Monitor's tools for conducting his evaluation, including document inspection, on-site observation, informational meetings, analyses, studies, and testing. Again, while this Section describes the type of employees the Monitor planned to interview, it does not include specific employee names, nor does it list specific Siemens sectors and business units that were targeted for interviews.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 Section VII, entitled \"Countries of Interest,\" describes the specific countries targeted by the Monitor for analysis. It includes, for each country, \"the number of Siemens employees in each country, new orders, new government orders, joint ventures and business partnerships, and Siemens' business development strategy across different sectors of the economy.\" DOJ_0000001, Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 Finally Section VIII, the Monitor's \"Proposed Schedule,\" lays out specific deadlines for the Monitor's evaluation. Again, it contains no commercial information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Other than the \"Countries of Interest\" Section, the Work Plan does not reveal \"basic commercial operations\" that \"relate[ ] to the income-producing aspects of [Siemens'] business.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.

And unlike the types of information held to be commercial in this Circuit's more expansive reading of Exemption 4, for instance letters describing market conditions, or \"documentation of the health and safety experience of [a company's products],\" the descriptions of the Monitor's activities do not elaborate on Siemens' business or describe its competitive landscape.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP\n   </em>\n   , 473 F.3d at 319 ;\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Year Three Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To a lesser degree, the Monitor's Year Three Report also contains subsections wholly unrelated to Siemens' commercial operations. Chapter Four of the Report, entitled \"The Monitor's Year Three Review and Recommendations,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   provides the Monitor's analysis, opinions, and recommendations for each thematic focus area identified in the Work Plan. Unlike in the Work Plan, much of this chapter in the Report was properly withheld under Exemption 4 because it contains detailed analyses of Siemens' business operations, and how those operations addressed each focus area. However, the chapter also includes subsections covering \"General Principles and Good Practices,\" which contain analyses of industry best practices and guidance obtained from FCPA decisions involving different companies. Those subsections do not discuss Siemens' business operations. Nor do they relate to the Monitor's actions with respect to Siemens. They are summaries of third party behaviors, useful as a reference source. They do not \"reveal [Siemens'] basic commercial operations,\" and DOJ has failed to demonstrate that Siemens otherwise has a commercial interest in the information related to other companies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641988,1854766\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/704/1280/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They may not be redacted under Exemption 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   DOJ properly redacted the remaining portions of the Report. Chapter One is an introduction describing specific Siemens compliance initiatives and business decisions. Chapter Two contains details of the Monitor's Year Three activities, with references to specific Siemens business operations. Chapter Three, entitled \"Financial Controls in Times of Crisis,\" describes Siemens' response to geopolitical crises in various countries, including specific steps taken by specific business units.

More specifically, DOJ assessed (1) whether the Monitor's work plans would enable the Monitor, DOJ, and SEC to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of Siemens' compliance with anti-corruption laws in the coming years; and (2) how successfully the Monitor had discharged his mandate over the course of the previous year. Mendelsohn\n   Decl. \u00b6 10. In making this determination, DOJ analyzed, among other factors, (1) whether the Monitor's work plans were appropriately detailed to provide Siemens notice of the Monitor's movements within the company; (2) whether the Monitor's work plans and reports focused on Siemens' past improper conduct; (3) the Monitor's use of available resources and the evolution of his approach year-by-year. Duross Decl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The DOJ's supplemented materials show that each deliberative process involved sub-decisions after each year of the monitorship. Specifically, DOJ decided (1) whether Siemens breached its obligations under the resolution; (2) whether the monitorship should continue; (3) whether the monitorship should be extended; or (4) whether the monitorship should be terminated because Siemens complied with its obligations. Helou Decl. \u00b6 12. Mr. Mendelsohn and Mr. Duross stated that these sub-decisions arose from meetings between the Monitor, DOJ, and SEC to discuss the Monitor's Work Plans and Reports, status reports supplied by the Monitor, exchanges of drafts and written feedback, and email discussions.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Mendelsohn Decl. \u00b6 26; Duross Decl. \u00b6 33; Helou Decl. \u00b6 11. DOJ made the decisions \"with significant input from the monitor and significant reliance on the information [provided by the Monitor]\". Helou Decl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Mendelsohn and Duross Declarations also identify approximately when sub-decisions were made. For instance, Mr. Duross stated that after receiving the Monitor's Year Two Report on October 13, 2010, reviewing presentation materials from a December 9, 2010 meeting between DOJ, SEC and the monitorship team, and deliberating upon additional materials and conversations with the Monitor, he \"concluded that Siemens was making significant progress towards complying with its plea agreement.\" Duross Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-24. Similarly, Mr. Mendelsohn stated that after \"reviewing the Year One Work Plan, consulting with Mr. Warin, SEC staff, and others, taking part in the April 1, 2009 monitorship meeting, and reviewing the other information and records available to me, I concluded that the Year One Work Plan was reasonable in fulfilling that part of the plea agreement, that the Monitor's Year Two Review should proceed, and that the Monitor was faithfully discharging his mandate.\" Mendelsohn Decl. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   This evidence is sufficient to define the deliberative processes involved in DOJ's oversight of the monitorship. As DOJ noted in its reply brief, courts in this District have upheld deliberative process assertions on the basis of less detailed showings. For instance, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wisdom v.

DOJ Mem. at 9-12. For instance, the Amended Deliberative Process Chronology indicates that Mr. Warin sent a draft of the Year Two Work Plan to Mr. Mendelsohn on February 8, 2010 in advance of a February 23 presentation of that plan involving DOJ and SEC.

The Reports, and the monitorship team's related communications with DOJ and SEC, were generated to assist the primary DOJ decision-makers in deciding, on a yearly basis, whether to (1) inform the court that Siemens had breached the terms of its plea agreement; (2) continue the monitorship as planned; (3) extend the monitorship; or finally (4) inform the court that Siemens had complied with its obligations and no longer required the Monitor's oversight. Helou Decl. \u00b6 11. Mr. Duross and Mr. Mendelsohn stated that only after considering the Monitor's certifications, Reports and related materials, and correspondence from all prior monitorship years did they make this decision.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   Duross Decl. \u00b6 33, Mendelsohn Decl. \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   DOJ's factual submissions, in combination with the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, indicate that the Reports and related materials were generated before the agency's yearly sub-decisions regarding Siemens' compliance, and that they then played a key role in facilitating those decisions.

First, several declarants stated that disclosure of correspondence and documents exchanged between and among the monitorship team, DOJ, and SEC relating to whether Siemens was complying with the plea agreement could chill such deliberations. Lipton Decl. \u00b6 6; Mendelsohn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Warin Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-30.

That consideration weighs in favor of withholding the Reports here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   While much of the Year Three Report was properly redacted under Exemption 5, the \"General Principles and Good Practices\" subsections, which summarize industry best practices and guidance obtained from FCPA decisions involving different companies, are not deliberative.
