Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2016) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ), a Second Amendment challenge to the law, and is now ripe for decision. He argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him because it bars him from gun ownership based only on a \"non-serious\" crime. His challenge highlights the serious implications of what the Third Circuit left unresolved in the splintered\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   decision: what constitutes a \"serious crime\" for Second Amendment purposes when a felon challenges the applicability of \u00a7 922(g)(1). When he was charged, Hunt Irving had a single, non-violent felony conviction-a conviction that, when subjected to the various tests advanced in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   would lead to different outcomes in his case. Indeed, as set forth below, the Defendant essentially relies upon the concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   as the principal basis for his argument. But the legal test Hunt Irving asks me to apply in support of his Second Amendment challenge did not command a majority of the Court, and his Motion to Dismiss the Indictment, together with his other motions, will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a wiretap and indictment, federal agents obtained arrest warrants for Defendant Raphael Hunt Irving and several co-defendants who allegedly conspired to purchase cocaine for distribution. The agents executed the warrants at the same time on September 26, 2014. Before dawn, a group of eight to ten agents arrived to Hunt Irving's residence, a two-story building that housed his funeral home business on the first floor and his residence on the second. According to the agents' testimony, they knocked loudly and announced their presence. A few minutes later, Hunt Irving came to a second floor window and\n   asked what was going on. The agents identified themselves as police and told him to open up. What happened next is disputed. DEA Agent Glenn testified that the agents waited another \"five to seven minutes,\" then breached the door using a crow bar and battering ram. Hr'g Tr. 24:5-7, 25:3-9, May 24, 2017 [hereinafter \"Hr'g Tr. A\"]. Hunt Irving disputes this amount of time and says he came downstairs without delay, but before he got to the door the officers had forcibly entered. Hr'g Tr. 5:24-6:7, May 30, 2017 [hereinafter \"Hr'g Tr. B\"]. There is no dispute that when the agents broke the door in, Hunt Irving was standing right inside, unarmed, about ten feet from the door. The agents ordered Hunt Irving to the ground and handcuffed him. The testifying agents agreed that he was cooperative and did not resist arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Agent Glenn, the team leader, asked Hunt Irving if there were any other people, or any weapons, in the home. Hr'g Tr. A 27:9-28:4. Meanwhile, the team of agents immediately began a \"protective sweep of the entire building.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant replied that there was no one else there, and said he had a hunting rifle upstairs in his bedroom closet. Agents testified that Hunt Irving \"hesitated\" before answering the weapons question. Hr'g Tr. B 95:11-16. The agents found an AK47-style semi-automatic rifle in the bedroom closet where Hunt Irving had indicated. When agents suggested to Hunt Irving that the gun was not a hunting rifle, he responded that he used it to hunt wild boars or hogs. Hr'g Tr. B 98:17-25. After the sweep was completed-about fifteen minutes later-Agent Glenn read Hunt Irving his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and the agents asked for his consent to a search of the property. He agreed. In that subsequent, more intensive search, agents found a digital scale, a large amount of cash (about $15,000), and a second gun (a handgun). Only the cash and scale would later be entered as evidence in Hunt Irving's drug conspiracy trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was eventually charged in a Third Superseding Indictment [hereinafter \"the Indictment\"] with multiple drug distribution conspiracies (Counts One, Seven, and Eight), attempted drug possession (Count Two), and a \u00a7 922(g)(1) violation for being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count Six) [hereinafter \"felon-in-possession\"]. As to the felon-in-possession charge, Hunt Irving does not dispute that he owned the rifle and handgun the agents found in his residence. He likewise concedes that he had prior felony convictions; four years before his arrest in this case he had pled guilty to two counts of Tampering with State Records. Those charges arose from an investigation into the financial practices of his funeral business in its interactions with the state's Victim Compensation Assistance Program (VCAP), which reimburses victims and their families for crime-related losses, including murder victims' funeral expenses. The investigation uncovered four instances over the course of seven years in which Hunt Irving had overbilled the state for funeral costs or did not pass on to the family the full refund he received from the state. Because of these claims, he was charged with Tampering with Public Documents with intent to defraud, 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 4911. In Pennsylvania, this crime is designated a third-degree felony,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , punishable by up to\n   seven years in prison, 18 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 1103. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Hunt Irving received two years' probation with no jail time and had to pay restitution of $7,125 ($3,325 to one family, $2,638 to another, and $1,162 to the VCAP), donate $500 to Dauphin County, and complete 250 hours of community service in Chester County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before trial, Hunt Irving moved to dismiss the felon-in-possession charge, arguing that it did not sufficiently allege that the guns had affected interstate commerce, and alternatively, that the charge was unconstitutional based on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090467\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/168/\">\n    633 F.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2011),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the district court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Binderup v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204764424\">\n    2014 WL 4764424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *31 (E.D. Pa. 2014).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Dismiss Indictment, ECF No. 114. Because the parties agreed to sever that charge for trial, a ruling on that motion was deferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial in June 2017, the jury found Hunt Irving guilty of two conspiracies (Counts One and Eight) and attempt (Count Two), and not guilty on Count Seven, relating to a 2012 conspiracy. Jury Verdict Form, ECF No. 200; Order, ECF No. 204. In September 2016, the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court's\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   decision in a plurality opinion,\n   <em>\n    Binderup v. Att'y Gen. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   \"], and last year the Supreme Court denied\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Binderup\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12606733,12606734,12606735,12606736,12606737,12606738\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2323/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605106,12606733,12606734\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/198/746/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Following those decisions, Hunt Irving, through new counsel, has filed a Motion for a New Trial and/or Arrest of Judgment, ECF No. 209 [hereinafter Def.'s Mot. New Trial], reasserting his\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   challenge to the felon-in-possession charge,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, and asserting several other arguments, including that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 the Court erred in its pre-trial denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 181, and Mem., ECF No. 211, both because the \"protective sweep\" of the second floor was unsupported by articulable facts, Def.'s Mot. New Trial \u00b6 2, and because his subsequent consent to search was not voluntary,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 the conspiracy counts (One and Eight) in the Indictment were multiplicitous, \u00b6 4; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 the jury's verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and a new trial is appropriate in the interest of justice, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8, 10, 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Suppl. Memo, ECF No. 217 [hereinafter \"Def.'s Mot.\"]; Def.'s Sur-Reply, ECF No. 231.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant does not reassert the interstate commerce argument articulated in his pre-trial Motion to Dismiss the Indictment, but I nevertheless address it as it is technically still pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, I conclude that even if one assumes that the sweep of the second floor violated the Fourth Amendment, it did not taint Hunt Irving's subsequent consent to search, and his pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence seized from his building was therefore properly denied. His Second Amendment challenge also fails, as the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   yielded no new test for as-applied challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(1), and the felon-in-possession charge is clearly lawful under pre-\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   law. Hunt Irving's remaining arguments fail because the indictment\n   adequately alleged that his guns affected interstate commerce, his multiplicity challenge is both waived and meritless, and the jury's verdict was far from a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Fourth Amendment Challenge: Sweep of Second Floor and Consent Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant Hunt Irving asserts that the agents' initial protective sweep of the second floor was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and thus tainted his subsequent consent to a search of the building, during which agents found the digital scale and cash, both admitted at trial, and the handgun. Def.'s Mot. 4-5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    371 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450611\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/471/\">\n    9 L.Ed.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963) ). I previously ruled that Hunt Irving voluntarily consented to the search, and rejected his testimony to the contrary as lacking credibility. Suppress. Mem., ECF No. 211. The current motion advances a different basis for suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Preliminarily, the government contends that the issue is waived. Gov.'s Resp. 4-5, ECF No. 230 (citing Suppress. Mem., ECF No. 211). Hunt Irving disagrees, and reserves the right to assert ineffective assistance of counsel in the event that the issue is deemed waived. I therefore first address this threshold issue of waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the suppression hearing, counsel's argument touched, but did not focus on, the permissibility of the security sweep. Hunt Irving's trial counsel-different from his current counsel-made an argument similar to the one Hunt Irving now makes, asserting that the sweep would have occurred regardless of the circumstances: \"... if you look at the situation, the search in its totality ... it's clear that these agents were going to search, Your Honor. They searched the second floor, they searched the funeral parlor. They searched the entire building initially.\" Hr'g Tr. B 131:21-132:2 (repeated words omitted). Responding to the Court's question about whether it was reasonable for the agents, once Hunt Irving told them he had a rifle in the house, \"for purposes of safety, to take that step of securing the weapon,\" trial counsel replied: \"I think they can secure the weapon, but I don't think that that gives them probable cause to do anything else. I mean I think the fact they're saying, hey, we discovered a weapon in the house and because we discovered the weapon, we now have some reason to search for what?\" Hr'g Tr. B 138:5-139:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on this transcript, Hunt Irving's trial counsel certainly conceded the validity of the officers securing the rifle for safety purposes. I see no indication, however, that defense counsel conceded his more general point-that a broader security sweep of the second floor was impermissible. Hr'g Tr. B 131:21-132:2, 139:8. I therefore find that the issue of the constitutionality of the sweep of the second floor in general is not waived. Nonetheless, the motion to suppress lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Moving to the merits of the Fourth Amendment challenge, the parties agree that\n   <em>\n    Maryland v. Buie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5456\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/325/\">\n    494 U.S. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5456\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/325/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5456\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/325/\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), provides the relevant standard for the agents' sweep of Hunt Irving's funeral home and residence.\n   <em>\n    Buie\n   </em>\n   analyzed an exception to the general rule that a residence cannot be searched without probable cause and identified the permissible bounds of a warrantless search of a residence incident to arrest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [I]ncident to the arrest the officers could, as a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.

The record is not well-developed, in part because the argument Defendant advances now is significantly different in emphasis from the theory advanced at the suppression hearing. But there is no need to reach the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Buie\n   </em>\n   argument, or further develop the record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because any violation of its precepts would still not entitle Hunt Irving to relief, for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, the scale, the cash, and the handgun were not recovered as part of the agents' sweep.

As a threshold matter, because there is no challenge to the seizure of the rifle, the only evidence gathered before Defendant consented to the search, it is difficult to discern why the sweep would have had any bearing on Defendant's decision to consent to a full search. Hunt Irving does not argue that the second floor sweep was a \"but-for\" cause of his consent to search, let alone that it was the critical element in his decision to consent. He agreed to a search knowing that the agents had thus far seized only his rifle, something he freely admitted owning, with the further knowledge that a handgun, digital scale, and cash remained undiscovered after the protective sweep. Even if one were to posit that seizure of the rifle was unlawful, and might have undermined Hunt Irving's resolve to resist discovery of the handgun, the fact that he was already facing a firearms offense would not have changed his incentive to avoid discovery of drug-related evidence such as the scale and cash. I have already held that his consent was voluntary, motivated by his desire to limit the impact of his arrest and the search on his funeral business, especially the funerals scheduled for that day. Suppress. Mem. 2, ECF No. 211 (crediting the testimony of Agent Schmidt, who \"explained to Defendant that agents would need to secure his property while waiting for a search warrant to issue-a practical reality of law enforcement that would have motivated Defendant to consent to a search\"). The protective sweep of the second floor does not alter that analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   I conclude that that the sweep is both legally and factually irrelevant to Defendant's consent to the search, rendering the scale, cash and handgun admissible in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Here, the parties agree that Hunt Irving's guilty plea to Tampering with Public Records with an intent to defraud, which Pennsylvania's legislature classifies as a third-degree felony punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment, falls within \u00a7 922(g)(1), making it a federal crime for him to possess a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit considered civil challenges to the constitutionality of the felon-in-possession law as applied to two Pennsylvania men who wanted to own guns but could not legally do so under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plurality posits that, although \"there are no fixed criteria for determining whether crimes are serious enough to destroy Second Amendment rights,\" the relevant considerations are: (1) the state legislature's classification of the offense as a misdemeanor or felony; (2) whether the elements of the crime include actual or attempted violence\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (3) the actual sentence imposed; and (4) any \"cross-jurisdictional consensus\" as to the seriousness of the crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 351-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Applying these factors to Hunt Irving's underlying state felony, the \"state classification\" factor would likely doom his challenge, even though his crime was non-violent and he received no jail time. That is so because Judge Ambro's formulation considers the state legislature's classification and maximum sentence a \"powerful expression\" of its belief in the seriousness (or lack thereof) of a crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 351. Thus, although Judge Ambro acknowledged that some state misdemeanors can\n   rise to the level of being \"serious,\" conversely, his opinion all but foreclosed the possibility that a state\n   <em>\n    felony\n   </em>\n   could be non-serious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 353 n.6. On its face, this approach adopted by the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   came close to limiting the ability to bring an as-applied challenge exclusively to state-law misdemeanants. But the plurality went on to raise a \"remote\" possibility that a state-law felon could succeed in a challenge, even as it emphasized that the challenger's burden would be \"extraordinarily high-and perhaps even insurmountable.\" Judge Ambro's approach thus invites Hunt Irving to argue that his prior conviction was not \"serious\" because his crime was non-violent, he received no jail time, and there is no strong cross-jurisdictional consensus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   And although the plurality garnered only three votes, as set forth below, it remains relevant because of the lack of a majority consensus as to what constitutes a serious crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The other votes for preservation of the\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   test came from the dissent, which concluded that any challenge to the application of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is easily resolved by a bright line test: all crimes currently within the law's scope are \"serious.\" The dissenting judges-the largest single bloc on this question-posited that \"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   itself tells us that felons are disqualified from exercising their Second Amendment rights,\" and that as-applied challenges to the current law are therefore impermissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 388.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this approach, there is no need to analyze the prior conviction (as the plurality would require), because such an analysis is legally irrelevant. Necessarily, by the\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   dissent's formulation of the test, Hunt Irving's challenge would also fail, because he cannot contest that his prior crime is covered by \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In contrast, the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , supported by five judges, approached the definition of \"serious crime\" by reference to\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 366.\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   sought to carve out an exception to the absolute bar against felon gun possession where the challenger could \"present facts about himself and his background that distinguish his circumstances from those of persons in the historically barred class.\"\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   362 (citing\n   <em>\n    Barton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090467\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/168/\">\n    633 F.3d at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2011) ).

Tennessee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301453\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/451/#p456\">\n    532 U.S. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301453\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/451/#p456\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301453\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/451/#p456\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), making the Government's proposal even more problematic. The Government's need to resort to such an argument graphically underscores the difficulties that follow if indictments brought under \u00a7 922(g)(1) must be evaluated according to the accused's general worthiness to bear arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In this same worthiness analysis, the Government also asks that I attach significance to the fact that \"firearms, of which AK-47 type assault rifles are especially nasty examples,\" are recognized tools of the drug trafficking trade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov.'s Resp. 3 n.1, ECF No. 216. I am again concerned that the validity of the initial Indictment cannot and should not be evaluated by Defendant's subsequent drug trafficking conviction. As to the nature of the firearm, the weapon seized was not set to fully automatic, and in that respect is not different from other non-assault-style rifles. Thus, with the exception of Hunt Irving's prior felony, his possession of the rifle was lawful. I would note, however, that although not legally relevant to the validity of the Indictment, Defendant's possession of both weapons has relevance to the policy considerations served by \u00a7 922(g)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the Government presented various\n   studies attempting to show that a person with a prior conviction is more likely to commit a subsequent offense than a member of the population at large. Neither the plurality nor the concurrence found them persuasive. What cannot be disputed, however, is that when recidivism\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   occur, it falls to law enforcement to respond, and given the legality and general availability of powerful weapons like assault-style rifles, whether a previously convicted felon has access to firearms has profound significance for agents executing an arrest warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Returning to\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   's two-step analysis remains controlling in the Third Circuit, albeit with some uncertainty in its application. Under step one, a court must first determine if the statute in question burdens conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707189\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/85/\">\n    614 F.3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is so because, even though no definitive test emerged from\n   <em>\n    Binderup\n   </em>\n   , the majority that endorsed\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   as the controlling case was comprised of seven judges from the dissent and three from the plurality. And although these ten judges endorsed\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella's\n   </em>\n   two-step test, they would apply it differently. The three judges from the plurality would entertain the possibility that even a felon might retain Second Amendment rights under certain, unspecified circumstances. As a result, Hunt Irving's argument could be said to fall within the plurality's approach as well as that of the concurrence. This difference, embodied in the plurality's conclusion as step \"5\",\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 356, appears to require separate consideration of whether a felony conviction like Hunt Irving's was \"serious\" for Second Amendment purposes. I therefore return to the plurality's approach, to determine if Defendant's felony conviction for records tampering presents the \"remote\" scenario the three-judge plurality contemplated as an exception to the general rule that felons may not possess guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Preliminarily, I find some ambiguity in the plurality's model. Presumably, if the underlying offense had a violent element, it would represent a \"serious\" crime without further analysis. The plurality appears to suggest that this requires a categorical analysis, borrowing concepts from the Supreme Court's jurisprudence under the\n   Armed Career Criminal Act, which focuses on the elements of an offense rather than the way it was committed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 352 &amp; n.4 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Skoien,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707616\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/638/#p642\">\n    614 F.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (7th Cir. 2010), which, in rejecting a challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(9)'s prohibition on gun ownership for people convicted of \"misdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence,\" applied the categorical approach as expressed in ACCA cases). Simultaneously, however, it observes: \"[t]hough, as explained, it is possible for non-violent crimes to be serious, the lack of a violent element is a relevant consideration,\" noting on the same page that the length of sentence is relevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 352. To what then, should the court look in determining the seriousness of non-violent crimes? If the approach is categorical, does it look to the other elements of the underlying offense in determining seriousness? And if so, to what characteristics should the court look in analyzing those elements? Suffice it to say that analyzing the elements of a statute to determine whether they encompass violent conduct focuses on a far more specific question then a consideration of \"seriousness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the Pennsylvania statute that criminalizes tampering with public records, different potential sentences apply depending upon the nature of the defendant's conduct. The statute specifically provides that the crime is generally a second degree misdemeanor punishable by no more than two years' imprisonment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204911\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 1104(2). But if \"the intent of the actor is to defraud or injure anyone,\" the offense converts to a third degree felony and the maximum sentence jumps to seven years. \u00a7\u00a7 4911(b), 1103(3). Here, Hunt Irving pleaded guilty under the felony portion of the statute, because his violation was not simply technical in nature, but rather was done with the intent to defraud. Proceeding categorically (to the extent it is possible to do so), it seems clear that the additional element required to elevate the charge to a felony-an intent to harm third parties-represents a determination by the Pennsylvania legislature that such conduct is objectively more serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As to the sentence imposed for his prior offense, a consideration which the plurality deems relevant, Hunt Irving argues that the lack of jail time counts against the seriousness of his offense. Given his subsequent criminal conduct, little weight should be placed on the leniency of the prior sentencing court. Putting to one side the realities of plea bargaining, a judge imposing a lenient sentence for a first offender acts in part on an assumption that the defendant's law-breaking was an aberration. Binderup and Suarez vindicated the confidence shown by their sentencing courts; Hunt Irving has not. Although I have rejected the Government's argument that Defendant's later conviction on the drug conspiracy necessarily validates the gun charge in the Indictment, I need not ignore it in deciding how much significance to attach to his prior sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that it is proper for me to make an independent determination of the nature of Defendant's conduct, as the district courts did for both Binderup and Suarez,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   352 n.4, I find it significant that Hunt Irving's unlawful acts came at the expense of victims of violence who were entitled to payments from Pennsylvania's Victims Compensation program. It was a crime that was both calculated and callous-calculated because it required the deliberate manipulation\n   of claims to the Commonwealth, and callous because it victimized families who had lost loved ones to violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In conclusion, as a felon convicted of a serious crime, Hunt Irving fell outside the protection of the Second Amendment, and his indictment under \u00a7 922(g)(1) was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Interstate Commerce\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   When Hunt Irving originally filed his Motion to Dismiss the Indictment in 2015, he argued that the Indictment did not adequately allege that the firearms in question had travelled in interstate commerce, one of the requirements of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Although he has not returned to that argument in subsequent briefing, in the event that he has not dropped that challenge, it is now denied. The Indictment alleges that the firearms in question were knowingly possessed \"in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce.\" Indictment 9, ECF No. 154. The Third Circuit has already upheld the sufficiency of nearly identical language, without more. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12, motions based on \"a defect in the indictment,\" including multiplicity, \"must be raised by pretrial motion if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3). Hunt Irving's multiplicity challenge therefore appears untimely, and, although Rule 12(d) authorizes a court to consider an untimely motion if the defendant shows good cause, Hunt Irving has not even attempted to make a showing of good cause here.

Exercising my own judgment, having presided over Hunt Irving's ten-day trial, which included extensive wiretap evidence, I conclude that justice does not require a new trial. His all-consuming interest in the Federal Express package intercepted by federal agents was compelling evidence of his participation in the conspiracy to import the drugs it contained, and his explicit discussion of the need to find a new source, captured on a wiretap, was equally compelling. There is no danger that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.
