On either side of the shield are representations of grapes and grape leaves and a ribbon scroll extending across the bottom tip of the shield. Over the shield in prominent letters appears the name \u201cViviano\u201d (disclaimed apart from the mark as shown) and under the shield are the. words \u201cGold Crest.\u201d Appellee\u2019s registered trade-mark, upon which the opposition is based, is \u201cCresta Blanca.\u201d Tne goods of both parties, being wines, are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">The contention of appellee has been and is that the marks of the parties are dominated by the word \u201cCrest.\u201d It is argued that that word is the dominant feature in appellant\u2019s mark and has the same meaning as the word \u201cCresta\u201d in the mark of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">The examiner was of opinion that the word \u201cCrest\u201d was not the dominant feature of appellant\u2019s mark and that when such mark is considered as a whole together with the whole of appellee\u2019s mark that they are not similar in appearance or sound. He, held, therefore, that when considered in their entireties the marks of the parties were sufficiently different as to obviate any likelihood of confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">The commissioner in his decision was of opinion that based on the ornate appearance of appellant\u2019s mark and the simple mark of appellee, that the difference between the marks in appearance is so great that there would be no confusing similarity in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">The commissioner was of opinion that appellant\u2019s mark would be referred to as\u201d \u201cViviano Gold Crest\u201d but that since \u201cViviano\u201d was disclaimed the trade-mark significance in sound would be in the expression \u201cGold Crest.\u201d The commissioner stated that when the words \u201cCrest\u201d and \u201cCresta\u201d are spoken that they would make more of an impression on the hearer than the accompanying words \u201cGold\u201d and \u201cBlanca.\u201d The commissioner thought that because the words \u201cCrest\u201d and \u201cCresta\u201d are somewhat similar in sound that there would be likelihood of persons to mistake one for the other and therefore confusion would ensue. In effect he held that the words \u201cCrest\u201d and \u201cCresta\u201d were the dominant features of the marks of the parties. He then' said that sound of itself is sufficient upon which to base confusing similarity of the marks as applied to goods of the same descriptive properties, citing the case of Skol Co., Inc., v. Olson, 151 F.2d 200, 33 C.C.P.A., Patents, 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">We can not agree with the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The sole question here is whether or not the marks of the parties are confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">We can not see, in considering a mark so well known as that of appellee, how it can be reasonably concluded that the word \u201cCresta\u201d is its dominant feature. Neither can we understand how it could be contended that the word \u201cBlanca\u201d would be considered as dominating the mark. In our opinion there is no separate dominant feature to the mark \u201cCresta Blanca.\u201d As far as appellee\u2019s wines are concerned, the words must be used together or the mark would lose its very nature. It is an old and exceedingly well known mark among those who are accustomed to the use of wines. The name apparently means \u201cwhite crest,\u201d but surely, if it were translated from Spanish into English, no one could reasonably think that \u201cWhite Crest\u201d wine was the wine with which the mark \u201cCresta Blanca\u201d is used.</p>\n<p id=\"A1b\">We are of opinion that \u201cCrest\u201d is not 'he dominant feature of appellant\u2019s mark. Its dominant feature clearly is \u201cGold Crest,\u201d which neither looks like nor sounds like, n'or has any parallel or suggestive meaning as \u201cCresta Blanca.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We have held many times that in trade-mark cases, precedents are of no great aid to decision. In re Dutch Maid Ice Cream Company, 95 F.2d 262, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1009. Nevertheless, appellee has cited and earnestly discussed several cases decided by this court as sustaining his contention' that the marks are confusingly similar, and we deem it proper to briefly distinguish between those cases and the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Appellee reasons that if appellant is allowed to register the word \u201cCrest\u201d in the combination mark \u201cViviano Gold Crest\u201d that many others might follow suit and we would witness such combinations as \u201cCervantes Purple Crest,\u201d \u201cRossini Crestadi Vini,\u201d \u201cCrest of Creation,\u201d \u201cPuccini Crest of Happiness,\u201d and the like, and thus a condition might arise such as we stated would be likely in the case of Bielzoff Products Company v. White Horse Distillers, Limited, 107 F.2d 583, 27 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In that case appellant sought to register the mark \u201cRed Horse\u201d as applied to alcoholic beverages. Appellee was the owner of the trade-marks \u201cWhite Horse\u201d and \u201cBlack Horse\u201d for alcoholic beverages. We stated that if appellant could register \u201cRed Horse\u201d some third party might be entitled to register \u201cBay Horse\u201d or other similar mark on such beverages and thus destroy the value of appellee\u2019s registered marks. We can see no- possible parallel between the facts of the Bielzoff Products Company case, supra, and those before us here. If in that case the name appellant sought to register was \u201cCaballo Colorado\u201d or \u201cCaballo Rojos,\u201d we might have a situation somewhat similar to the one before us. In the instant case if the mark appellant seeks to register were \u201cCarta de Oro,\u201d the facts might be considered to be somewhat similar to that of the Bielzoff Products Company case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">We find no precedent in the case of J. S. Ivins\u2019 Son, Inc., v. United Biscuit Co. of America, 158 F.2d 397, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 739, where the marks \u201cGate blouse Cookies by Ivins,\u201d the last three words being disclaimed, and the expression'\u201cTown House\u201d were held to be confusingly similar as applied to goods identical in part. We there held that in the marks \u201cGate House\u201d and \u201cTown House\u201d the words Gate and Town were distinctive and the expression \u201cHouse\u201d was the part of the mark which was the chief factor in 'directing the purchaser\u2019s attention' to the origin of the goods. We quoted with approval the decision of the commissioner that a town house and a gate house are both houses differing only in style, location, or purpose. In the instant case we have no identity of words in the involved marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Similarly in the case of J. S. Ivins\u2019 Son, Inc., v. Lamont, Corliss &amp; Co., 158 F.2d 399, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 737, 72 USPQ 120, appellant sought to have registered its trade-mark \u201cGate House Cookies by Ivins.\u201d It was opposed by appellee, basing its opposition on its registered mark \u201cToll House\u201d for chocolate and for cookies. We approved the reasoning in the decision of the commissioner, in which it was stated, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>was pointed out by the Examiner of Interferences, that the expression \u201cGate House\u201d and \u201cToll House\u201d have precisely the same meaning. Clearly there is nothing in the facts of that case to give it any controlling effect here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The cases of Macleay Duff (Distillers), Ltd., v. Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., 129 F.2d 695, 29 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1160, involved the word \u201cDuff\u2019s\u201d as applied to Scotch Whiskey. Appellee was the owner of the marks \u201cDuffy,\u201d \u201cDuffy\u2019s,\u201d \u201cDuffy\u2019s Malt,\u201d \u201cDuffy\u2019s Malt Whiskey,\u201d and \u201cDuffy\u2019s Whiskey.\u201d We agreed with the tribunals of the Patent Office in holding that the notation \u201cDuff\u201d is the more prominent spoken symbol and the one by which purchasers would ordinarily buy appellant\u2019s goods. We reasoned that the goods of the parties would be sought as \u201cDuff\u2019s\u201d or as \u201cDuffy\u2019s.\u201d Clearly the difference in appearance and sound between those two words is so very slight that we held their concurrent use was likely to confuse the mind of the public or deceive purchasers as to origin. It is obvious that there is nothing in that case that can apply to the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Appellee has also cited the case of American Brewing Company, Inc., v. Delatour Beverage Corporation, 100 F.2d 253, 254, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 778. That was a cancelation proceeding in which it appeared that appellants had used a trade-mark upon beer and ale, which consisted of a reproduction of the Statute of Liberty and the word \u201cLiberty.\u201d Appellee was the owner of the mark \u201cAmerica Dry Ginger Ale.\u201d In reversing the decision of the commissioner, we held that the representation of the Statue of Liberty was the dominant portion of the mark sought to be canceled and that when considering the mark as a whole it was confusingly similar to that of appellant which consisted of the. Statute of Liberty and the word \u201cLiberty,\u201d as aforesaid. Clearly there is nothing in that case which would even \u201csquint\u201d toward the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In the case of Jacob Ries Bottling Works, Inc., v. Coca-Cola Co., 138 F.2d 56, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 706, the issue was stated to be between the word \u201cKola\u201d which appeared in appellant\u2019s mark \u201cRock Spring Kola\u201d sought to be registered and \u201cCola\u201d appearing in the \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d mark of appellee. The goods of the parties were of the same descriptive properties and the marks considered as a whole were held to be confusingly similar. In the instant case no word of the mark of appellee is idem sonans with any word in the mark of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The commissioner in his decision cited the case of Skol Company, Inc., v. Olson, supra. It was also cited here by appellee. We there held by a divided court that the goods of the appellee, a charged mineral water which had been advertised as having a therapeutic effect, possessed the same descriptive properties as appellant\u2019s goods, which were lotions for preventing sunburn, for use after shaving, and for relief of such complaints as cold sore, ringworm, athlete\u2019s foot, hives, burns, abrasions, scalds, and other skin irritations, and for eye glasses, to all of which was applied the trade name \u201cSkol.\u201d The term sought to be registered was \u201cSkoal.\u201d There the names were the same in sound, and might be considered by some the same in meaning. For the reason that a majority of the court held that the goods of the parties were of the same descriptive properties, the decision of the commissioner was reversed. It is clear that that case has no pertinence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">In our opinion appellant does not seek to take anything from the value of appellee\u2019s trade-mark. Therefore, the case of Bon Ami Co. v. McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc., 93 F.2d 915, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 826, 36 USPQ 260, is not at all in point as contended by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">In the case of Ex parte Crest Laboratories, Inc., 55 U.S.P.Q. 233, the Commissioner of Patents refused to register the word \u201cCrest\u201d as applied to a sh\u00e1mpoo preparation in' view of three prior registrations, \u201cAlice Dale\u2019s Crest,\u201d \u201cGold Crest,\u201d and \u201cVel Crest,\u201d as applied to goods of the same descriptive properties. The commissioner properly stated that, \u201cAll of the marks cited carry conspicuously or dominantly the word \u2018Crest,\u2019 which is the sole feature of the applicant\u2019s mark.\u201d It can not, in our opinion, be reasonably held that the word \u201cCrest\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark is a conspicuous or dominant feature, any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>than we could hold that \u201cCresta\u201d is the dominant feature of the mark of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In the case of McKesson &amp; Robbins, Incorporated, v. California Growers Wineries, 60 U.S.P.Q. 147, the mark \u201cGolden Bear\u201d was held to be confusingly similar to the mark \u201cBear Club.\u201d Both marks were applied to liquor and both appeared in association with a shield design. The word \u201cBear\u201d was admittedly the dominant part of the words \u201cGolden Bear\u201d and the commissioner held that for the same reason the word \u201cBear\u201d dominates the mark \u201cBear Club.\u201d We have no such situation before us in this case. No word of the mark sought to be registered is the same as any word in appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Viewing the issue as narrowly as it reasonably can be considered, i. e. that the words \u201cGold Crest\u201d alone should be considered with appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCresta Blan'ca,\u201d we find nothing in those expressions as applied to the goods of the parties that can reasonably be held to be likely to cause confusion in trade or to deceive the mind of the public. Therefore, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
