However, the Regional Director has refused to issue any notice of hearing upon the application, and the Board has sustained his refusal \u201con the ground that compliance with the Board\u2019s order as enforced by the Circuit Court of Appeals * * * has not yet been effected.\u201d The employer now moves us to modify our- order so as to allow the Board to proceed with the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-20\">So far as the Board\u2019s position may rest upon the notion that our order as such precludes it or its officers from proceeding with the petition, we need only say that we did not intend it to have any such effect; and that the Board is entirely free to take any action which it chooses: either to withdraw the present certification or to substitute a new \u201cbargaining representative.\u201d We are not aware that it thinks otherwise; but we say this to lay any doubts. On the other hand, so far as the Board refuses to act upon the petition until the employer has complied with our order, it is for the Board to decide whether noncompliance is a reason for refusing to consider the employees\u2019 petition. Finally, we refuse to modify our order, so far as it directs the employer to deal with the present representative. Even though it may be true that the Amended Act has now made lawful the conduct of Maier on which the order was in part based, the refusal to deal with the duly selected \u201cbargaining representative\u201d remains an \u201cunfair labor practice\u201d which still supports the Board\u2019s order and our order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-21\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-22\"> \u00a7 159(e) (1) (A) (ii), Title 29 \u00dc.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
