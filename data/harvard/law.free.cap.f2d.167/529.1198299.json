Their complaint asked the District Court to declare that a certification, by appellee National Mediation Board, of a bargaining representative was null and void. The court rightly dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-26\">The Supreme Court decided in 1943 that certifications of bargaining representatives under Sec. 2, Ninth of the Railway Labor Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are not subject to judicial review. The Court said in effect that the statute precludes review: \u201cthe intent seems plain\u2014 the dispute was to reach its last terminal point when the administrative finding was made. There was to be no dragging out of the controversy into other tribunals of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-27\">The Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of 1946 provides that \u201cExcept so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion \u2014 (a) * * * Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action * * * shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But since the Supreme Court had decided that the Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>way Labor Act precludes judicial review, the quoted clause leaves the situation unchanged. The point seems obvious. However, legislative history confirms it. When the Administrative Procedure Act was pending in the Senate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator McCarran, said \u201cIf a statute denies the right of review, the bill does not interfere * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reports of both Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the bill indicate that when statutes \u201cwithhold\u201d judicial review they \u201cpreclude\u201d it. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is immaterial here that the House report also says: \u201cTo preclude judicial review under this bill a statute, if not specific in withholding such review, must upon its face give clear and convincing evidence of an intent to withhold it. The mere failure to provide specially by statute for judicial review is certainly no evidence of intent to withhold review.\u201d The Railway Labor Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, upon its face gives clear and convincing evidence of intent to withhold judicial review. It is as true today as it was before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed that in such a case as this \u201cAny decision on the merits would involve the granting of judicial remedies which Congress chose not to confer.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-17\"> 48 Stat.
