Since neither the petition for review nor the application for rehearing was filed within the time allowed by the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, 831, Sec. 19, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r, we lack jurisdiction to review these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-21\">The petition also asks us to review and set aside recent statements of the Commission to the effect that the 1945 order has a designated meaning, that petitioner and the Pipe Line Company have violated it, and that the Commission plans \u201cto proceed in accordance with the legal remedies available to it under the Natural Gas Act to enforce compliance.\u201d These statements of the Commission are not orders within the reviewing authority that Congress has conferred upon appellate courts. What the 1945 order means, and whether petitioner has violated it, are questions not for this court but for the District Court in which the Commission may attempt to enforce the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">The Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review is therefore granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-23\">Petition for review dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
