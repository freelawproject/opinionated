The sentence did not impose any fine, but was for imprisonment only. The statute touching burglary, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 315, provides that the violator shall be fined not more than $1,000 and imprisoned not more than five years. That touching the stealing is 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 100, and provides a punishment by a fine or five years imprisonment. The sentence to seven years imprisonment is justified for the two offenses. The omission to add a fine for the burglary is in appellant\u2019s favor, and while it is an error it is one that he could not complain of, certainly not by this collateral attack by habeas corpus. The sentence is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
