His services were procured in preparation for the trial of a patent case. The information obtained by Dr. Sachs is not deemed to fall within the attorney-client privilege protecting the \u201cwork product of the lawyer.\u201d This information appears to be essential to a vital issue in the case and. is evidentiary in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-24\">We think, therefore, that, as correctly reasoned by the district judge, Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, does not sustain the position of appellant that the witness, Sachs, was privileged to decline to divulge the requested information by refusing to answer the questions put to him. The obvious purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, to broaden the scope of inquiry of an adverse witness or party without vouching for his credibility gain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>says the thought that the attorney-client privilege should be liberally extended to cover information sought of one who is not a lawyer, but has merely been retained by an attorney-at-law as an expert in a scientific field. The primary concern of courts of justice is to elicit truth essential to correct adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
