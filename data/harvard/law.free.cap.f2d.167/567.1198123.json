HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">This is an appeal from a judgment, dismissing a petition, demanding $38.60 \u2014 vacation pay for one week \u2014 alleged to be due under \u00a7 8(e) of the Selective Training Act of 1940.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United Steelworkers of America, CIO, and Philip Murray, its president, have intervened as co-plaintiffs. The facts as stipulated were as follows. Since December 8, 1941, the respondent, a manufacturing corporation, and the United Steelworkers of America, CIO, had been parties to a series of collective bargaining agreements, one of which was in force in the year 1946. The petitioner, Dwyer, a member of the union, had, from July 21, 1941,. been in the employ of the respondent \u201cas a stamping operator\u201d; on April 16, 1943, he enlisted in the United States Army; he was honorably discharged on December 20, 1945; and within ninety days thereafter, that is, on January 7, 1946, he was \u201crestored\u201d to his former \u201cposition.\u201d He demanded one week\u2019s vacation pay which Article VII of the union contract gave to all those \u201cin the employ\u201d of the company for twenty-six weeks before July 1, 1946, but the respondent refused the demand; hence the action.. The only parts of the contract contained in the record we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The respondent\u2019s position is that the word \u201cemploy\u201d as used in \u00a7 1 of Article VII means only \u201ctime worked\u201d; and in support of this it relies upon the last two sentences of the section, which speak of \u201cemployees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>who are working,\u201d and of a past period, during which the men were on strike, as one \u201cto be considered time worked.\u201d The judge took this view and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Subdivision (b) of \u00a7 308<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> presupposes that a discharged veteran, who \u201cleaves a position * * * in the employ of an employer,\u201d shall not be deemed to have left his \u201cemploy.\u201d The language is (subsection B) : \u201cif such position was in the employ of a private employer, such employer shall restore such person to such position\u201d; it is the \u201cposition,\u201d not the \u201cemploy,\u201d to which the veteran is to be \u201crestored.\u201d In confirmation of this is the language of subdivision (c) that a veteran <em>so </em>\u201crestored to a position * * * shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence,\u201d for an employee \u201con furlough or leave of absence\u201d is still in his \u25a0employer's \u201cemploy.\u201d Nevertheless, subdivision (c) does recognize that by entering the Army the veteran leaves his \u201cposition,\u201d and that he is entitled only to such \u201cbenefits\u201d as are \u201coffered by the employer pursuant to established rules or practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence.\u201d Hence, although it was unlawful to attempt by contract to provide that a veteran should be deemed not to be \u201cin the employ\u201d of the company while he was serving in the Army, it was not unlawful to deny him vacation, unless it was an \u201cestablished rule of the \u25a0company\u201d to give vacation to those who were on \u201cleave of absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Turning then to' the contract, although \u00a7 1 of Article VII gives vacation pay to \u201ceach employee who prior to July 1, 1946, has been in the employ of the company for at least twenty-six (26) weeks,\u201d it nowhere even intimates that the prescribed period may include any part of the time during which the employee has been \u201con leave of absence\u201d; and there is not the least antecedent reason to ascribe such a purpose to the parties. Indeed, a priori it would seem highly improbable that they should have thought a man \u201con leave of absence\u201d entitled to a vacation; for vacations ordinarily presuppose relief or release from work. Be that as it may, it was an essential element of the case that the company have a rule or practice treating employees \u201con leave of absence\u201d as entitled to include their leave within the twenty-six weeks, and it was not proved. Perhaps indeed, the respondent\u2019s position gets some faint support from the fact that it was thought necessary to provide especially that the out-of-work period of the strike should count as \u201ctime worked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">If it appeared elsewhere in the contract that the parties had intended all employees \u201con leave of absence\u201d to be entitled to include their leave in the computation of their right to vacation, the petitioner would be right in invoking subdivision.c. There is nothing of the kind. Apparently he supposes that \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of Article V have that meaning; if so, he is wrong. The article relates only to rights of seniority, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>should have no warrant for extending it in any way to cover vacations; obviously the considerations which might make it proper that service in the Army should not affect a man\u2019s seniority are utterly different from those which should count in computing vacations. Indeed, the statute expressly secured him his seniority, and the provision in \u00a7 5 of Article V was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\"> \u00a7 308(e) Title 50, War Appendix, U.S, C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-14\"> \u201cArticle V * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">\u201cSeniority</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">\u201c4) Continuous service is considered broken by:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-17\">\u201cTwenty-four (24) consecutive months of unemployment due to any cause shall terminate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-18\">\u201cResignation by the employee. \u201cDischarge of the employee by the Company for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-19\">\u201cFailure to report for work when recalled from layoff within seven (7) days after sending notice by registered mail. \u201cAbsence from work without notification for seven (7) consecutive days.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-20\">\u201c5) Continuous service shall not be broken by the following incidents, nor any deductions made for time away from work because of such incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-21\">\u201cDisability because of Industrial Accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">\u201cVacation as stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">\u201cLeave of absence not exceeding twenty-four (24) months because of illness or incapacity not due to industrial accident. \u201cJury duty or legal summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-24\">\u201cEmployees entering Military or Naval Service under orders terminated by Honorable Discharge will be considered as on leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-25\">\u201cOn expiration of such leave of absence employee will be taken back at former position and Seniority or one of like-status and pay provided the Corporation\u2019s circumstances have not so changed as to-make it impossible to do so and if qualified to perform his duties and applies for reemployment within the time specified by the Selective Service Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-26\">\u201cAbsence with consent of the Company not exceeding thirty (30) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-27\">\u201cReduction of force or layoff not exceeding twenty-foUr (24) months.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-28\">\u201cDuring any layoff the employee shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>report to the Employment Department at least once each calendar month either in person or by letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201cNames o'f employees failing to report during a calendar month will be submitted to the Union Committee for their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\u201cThe Union Committee shall be allowed two weeks from date of receiving list of names to investigate and make final report to Management.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">\u201cFailure to report is deemed an interruption of an employee\u2019s continuous service.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">\u201cDischarge for cause if employee so discharged is re-instated within ninety (90) days after discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Article VII</p>\n<p id=\"Afm\">Vacations</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">\u201c1) Each, employee who prior to July 1, 1946, who has been in the employ of the company for at least twenty-six (26) weeks shall receive during such year one week\u2019s vacation consisting of 44 hours\u2019 pay and every employee who has been in the employ of the company for five or more years shall receive two weeks\u2019 pay at the rate of 88 hours.
