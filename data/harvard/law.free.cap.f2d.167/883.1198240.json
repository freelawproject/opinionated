Harry L. Cohen, Albert Cohen, and David G. Freedman each owned a % interest and Rose Cohen owned <em>Vi. </em>In 1943 each of the three men gave his wife half his interest. Thereafter the four former partners owned <em>\u00a5t (\u00a5i </em>each) and the three new partners <em>% Qfy </em>each). A new partnership agreement. provided that the three men should have entire supervision and management of the several departments of the business and their wives should engage in \u201cthe sale of merchandise, and such other duties as they may be called upon to perform from time to time by the other partners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">The Unemployment Compensation Act of the District of Columbia requires employers to pay contributions at different rates based on differences in experience. In a business as well as a popular sense, Cohen\u2019s was the same employer before and after the admission of the three wives to</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>the firm. But the Unemployment Compensation' Board ruled that Cohen\u2019s became a new employer, required to pay contributions at a new rate, and the District Court sustained the Board. We think the Unemployment Compensation Act should be interpreted in accordance with its purpose. Its purpose is to protect employees. The admission of the new partners caused no change in management and no change in risk. This, we think, makes it irrelevant that a partnership is not for all purposes a legal entity. Karlson v.

It is immaterial that the statute enables \u201ctwo or more employing units\u201d to combine their experience, on timely request, after \u201ca change in legal identity or form,\u201d D.C.Code (1940), Supp. V, \u00a7 46 \u2014 303(c) (7), 57 Stat. 107, \u00a7 3(c) (7), and that no timely request was made. Since there was only one employing unit, this provision of the statute was not pertinent and <em>no </em>request was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
