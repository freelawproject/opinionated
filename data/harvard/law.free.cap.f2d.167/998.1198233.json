This fact we recognized in our opinion. From this fact appellant concludes that it was established that remuneration of the insured\u2019s employees were \u201cnot available to the company\u201d (insurer), hence that the policy dictated application of the 50% of contract cost provision. We do not agree. Testimony of the Government\u2019s witness at the rehearing that he could not then accurately break down certain of the payroll figures was not the equivalent of nor a substitute for appellant\u2019s establishing that the remuneration was \u201cnot available\u201d to the insurer within the meaning of the policy. Appellant\u2019s argument in attempting to give effect to one provision of the policy, completely ignores the other provision limiting the policy coverage to a certain defined part of the Alaska highway. As we have heretofore observed, appellant\u2019s formula for arriving at the premium base is contrary to, whereas the formula used by the trial court is in accord with, the law of this case established on the first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-25\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is bottomed upon the indisputable principle that res judicata applies not only to matters presented and decided in a prior action, but also to matters which might properly have been therein presented and decided. The argument in this regard postulates that on the first appeal of this case we affirmed, at least in part, the judgment of the lower court, and merely remanded for the taking of evidence on specified issues. On the first appeal we unconditionally reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the cause for disposition <em>in </em>accordance with the views which we expressed. Our implied approval of the $90,053.81 amount as part of the premium base did not, as appellant assumes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>work a mutation of an express reversal into an affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment. The above mentioned rule of res judicata, urged on us by appellant, applies in a situation where a second action is on the same cause of action and between the same parties as a first action; it does not apply where a controversy on appeal has not been concluded and no second action is being brought, but where there has been a reversal and remand for further proceedings in the same litigation. The latter was the situation in the instant case. The principle here applicable is that a judgment of reversal by an appellate court is an adjudication only of matters expressly discussed and decided, which become the law of the case in further proceedings on remand and re-appeal.
