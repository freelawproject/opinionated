Appendix. This copy, as was held by the tribunals of the Patent Office, constituted prima facie evidence of appellant\u2019s ownership but it cannot be accepted as evidence of other facts alleged in its notice of opposition but challenged by appellee. Appellee presented testimony bearing upon the researches made on its behalf before filing the application for registration, but this testimony, except to the extent that it tends to support the statement of the application that the merchandise is a shampoo, is of no particular aid in determining the issue here involved, which briefly stated, is whether the concurrent use of the marks upon the goods of the respective parties would be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers as to origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">In the course of his decision the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences said: \u201cApplicant\u2019s application and the testimony adduced on applicant\u2019s behalf indicate that applicant sells a shampoo. Opposer\u2019s registration, on the other hand, indicates that it deals in a preparation for falling hair, dandruff and itching scalp. Doubtless these goods are specifically different in their composition, nevertheless, both are hair preparations sold over the same counters to the same class of purchasers and they are believed to be so intimately related in their trade appeal as to constitute clearly goods of the same descriptive properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">With respect to the marks, he expressed the belief that \u201cthe similarities predominate to such an extent that the concurrent use of these marks on the goods in question is reasonably likely to result in confusion in trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">The First Assistant Commissioner pointing out that \u201cthere is no evidence on the subject,\u201d and citing Lever Brothers 'Company v. Butler Manufacturing Company, 88 F.2d 842, 24 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1000, expressed doubt as to the \u201cpropriety\u201d of the examiner\u2019s finding that the goods are sold over the same counters to the same class of purchasers, but said further: \u201c * * * in any event, the specific differences between applicant\u2019s product, which is essentially a cleansing agent, and opposer\u2019s product, which is essentially a medicinal preparation, must be considered in resolving the question of possible confusion. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">As to the words themselves, the First Assistant Commissioner was of opinion that the words \u201cStran\u201d and \u201cStim\u201d \u201chave very little in common\u201d and, in effect, he held that because of the differences in the goods and the difference in the words their concurrent use would not result in confusing the public or deceiving purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">We find ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the First Assistant Commissioner. In the absence of any evidence introduced by appellant except the registration upon which it relies, nothing can be determined as to the actual chemical properties of its goods, but we think it not improper to say that a preparation for the treatment of dandruff and the like is generally regarded as Something different from a mere shampoo preparation applied as a hair cleanser. In any event, we feel confident that the marks themselves are so lacking in resemblance as to appearance, sound or meaning that there is no likelihood of confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-11\">The decision of the First Assistant Commissioner, reversing that of the Examiner of Trade-Mark Interferences, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, J.r was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
