The judge properly denied the motion for a directed verdict or a new trial. The evidence was sufficient to justify the jury in concluding (a) that defendant directed plaintiff to work in the manner and at the place in which he .worked, and (b) that defendant was negligent, in requiring plaintiff to perform such services when defendant had not cleared the snow and ice under the car. Since the judge properly charged with respect to a deduction for contributory negligence, pursuant to the Act, we must assume that the jury made such a deduction. On the record before us, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>say that, after a reasonable deduction, a verdict of $30,000 was excessive (assuming that we have the power to consider that question).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">2. Defendant argues that the judge erred in denying its request for a special verdict. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Undeniably, the verdict affords no satisfactory information about the jury\u2019s findings. But almost every general verdict sheds similar or even greater darkness. Such verdicts account for much (not all) of the criticism of the civil jury. Some revaluation of the jury system seems not unjustified in the light of the fact that ours is the only country in the world where it is still highly prized. Lauded as essential to individual liberty and democracy, and imported in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from England and the United States, trial by jury was adopted in criminal cases on the European continent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but subsequently ceased there, in pre-Hitler days, to maintain its popularity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor can that attitude be explained as a symptom of decreased interest in democracy and individualism. For Scotland, surely long a land of liberty-loving individualists, having in the sixteenth century virtually rejected the civil jury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> re-adopted it in 1815, and, still later, all but gave it up. In England, whence trial by jury came to us, it is now seldom employed in civil suits, has been abandoned in criminal prosecutions other than for major crimes, and even there is used decreasingly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the United States, the number of jury-waivers indicates the jury\u2019s slowly waning popularity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But here, especially in the federal courts, the civil jury, in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>cases, cannot be eliminated except by constitutional amendments. We must, then, as to some kind of cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> assume that it will long be with us.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">But what many persons regard as its major defects can be mitigated. One device which will help to achieve that end is the special or fact verdict. Those who resent any reform which invades the jury\u2019s province should be reassured by the historians who teach that the special verdict is no new-fangled idea, but one almost as old as the jury itself, older indeed than the modern jury. In those early days, Morgan tells us, jurors often successfully insisted upon the right to render such verdicts against the desires of the judges who wanted general verdicts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To be sure, in this country, during the latter part of the eighteenth and the early part of the nineteenth centuries, the right to return a general verdict was highly esteemed as the jury\u2019s prerogative, especially in criminal cases; the judges then instructed the juries that they were to decide both \u201cthe law\u201d and the facts, not being bound by the opinion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Most jurisdictions later repudiated that doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The courts and legal writers declared that, if juries had the right to ignore the judges\u2019 instructions as to the applicable legal rules, the \u201claw\u201d would \u201cbecome as variable as the prejudices, the inclinations and the passions of men\u201d; \u201cthe parties would suffer from an arbitrary decision\u201d; \u201cdecisions would depend entirely upon juries uncontrolled by any settled, fixed, legal principle,\u201d and would be \u201caccording to what the jury in their own opinion suppose the law is or ought to be\u201d; our government\u201d would \u201ccease to be a government of laws and become a government of men\u201d; \u201cjurors would become not only judges but legislators as well\u201d; the \u201claw\u201d would \u201cbe as fluctuating and uncertain as the diverse opinions of different juries in regard to it\u201d; jurors would be \u201csuperior to the national legislature, and its laws * * * subject to their control\u201d so that a \u201claw of Congress\u201d would \u201cbe in operation in one state and not in another.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">Yet no amount of brave talk can do away with the fact that, when a jury returns an ordinary general verdict, it usually has the power utterly to ignore what the judge instructs it concerning the substantive legal rules, a power which, because generally it cannot be controlled,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>distinguishable for all practical purposes, from a \u201cright.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Practically, then, for all we may say about the jury\u2019s duty when it renders a verdict, we now do have the very conditions which we were warned would result if the jury ha'd the right to decide legal pro-positions: cases are often decided \u201caccording to what the jury suppose the law is or ought to be\u201d; the \u201claw,\u201d when juries sit, is \u201cas fluctuating and uncertain as the diverse opinion of different juries in regard to it\u201d; and often jurors are \u201cnot only judges but legislatures as well.\u201d Indeed, some devotees of the jury system praise \"it precisely because, they say, juries, by means of general verdicts, can and often do nullify those substantive legal rules they dislike,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> thus becoming ad hoc ephemeral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(un-elected) legislatures <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (a state of affairs singularly neglected by most writers on jurisprudence,<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark> who would do well to modify their ideas by recognizing what might be called \u201cjuriesprudence\u201d). Surprisingly, that sort of defense of the general verdict is not seldom voiced by lawyers who, in the next breath, demand strict adherence to the legal precedents.<footnotemark>14b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u201cCompetent observers,\u201d writes Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Rossman, \u201cwho have interviewed the jurors in scores of jury trials, declare that, in many cases where the general verdict was employed, principal issues received no consideration whatever from the jury.<footnotemark>14c</footnotemark> The general verdict, then, has some strange characteristics. As Sunderland puts it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cThe peculiarity of the general verdict is the merger into a single indivisible residuum of all matters, however numerous, whether of law or fact. It is a compound made by the-jury which is incapable of being broken up into its constituent parts. No judicial reagents exist for either a qualitative or a quantitive analysis. The law supplies the means for determining neither what facts were found, nor what principles of law were applied, nor how the application was made. There are therefore three unknown elements which enter into the general verdict; (a) the \u25a0 facts; (b) the law; (c) the application of the law to the facts. And it is clear that the verdict is liable to three sources of error, corresponding to these three elements. It is also clear that if error does occur in any of these matters it cannot be discovered, for the constituents of the compound cannot be ascertained. No one but the jurors can tell what was put into it and the jurors will not be heard to say. The general verdict is as inscrutable and essentially mysterious as the judgment which issued from .the ancient oracle of Delphi. Both stand on the same foundation \u2014 a presumption of wisdom. The court protects the jury from all investigation and inquiry as fully as the temple authorities protected the priestess who spoke to the supplient votary at the shrine. It is quite probable that the law is wise in not permitting jurors to testify as to how they compoundT ed their verdict, for all stability would disappear if such inquiries were open.<footnotemark>15a</footnotemark> * * * As to 'the second element in the general verdict, the <em>law, </em>it is a matter upon which the jury is necessarily ignorant. The jurors are taken from the body of the coucty, and it is safe to say that the last man who would be called or allowed to sit would be a lawyer. They are second-hand dealers in law, and must get it from the judge. They can supply nothing themselves; they are a mere conduit pipe through which the court supplies the law that goes into the general verdict. But while the jury can contribute nothing of value so far as the law is concerned, it has infinite capacity for mischief, for twelve men can easily misunderstand more law in a minute than the judge can explain in an hour. Indeed, can anything be more fatuous than the expectation that the law which the judge so carefully, learnedly and laboriously expounds to the laymen in the jury box become operative in their minds in its true form? One who has never studied a science cannot understand or appreciate its intricacies, and the law is no exception to this rule. The very theory of the jury and its general verdict is thus predicated upon a premise which makes practically certain an imperfect or erroneous view of the principles of law which are to be compounded into the verdict. The instructions upon the law given by the court to the jury are an effort to give, in the space of a few minutes, a legal education to twelve laymen upon the branch of the law involved in the case. Law cannot be taught in any such way. As to this element, accordingly, the general verdict is almost necessarily a failure. As to the third element in the general <em>verdict </em>\u2014 the <em>application of the law to tlve </em>facts, we find the same difficuly as in the case of the first element \u2014 a merging of the law into the verdict in such a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that it is impossible to tell how or whether the jury applied the law. They may have applied it in a wholly wrong way, or they may have failed to apply it at all. No analysis of the verdict can be made which will throw any light on the process. Since the case can ordinarily go to the jury only if a verdict either way is legally possible, whatever the jury does is presumed to be right, and this presumption excludes any inquiry from the jurors themselves. Cases may arise where the verdict shows on its face a failure to properly apply the law, usually as relating to the measure of damages, but in the vast majority of cases the verdict is a complete mystery, throwing a mantle of impenetrable darkness over the operations of the jury. Whether the jurors deliberately and openly threw the law into the discard, and rendered a verdict out of their own heads, or whether they applied the law correctly as instructed by the court, or whether they tried to apply it properly but failed for lack of understanding, \u2014 these are questions respecting which the verdict discloses nothing. So far, therefore, as the third element goes, the general verdict is an unknown and unknowable mystery, with the balance of probability against it. * * * We come, then, to this position, that the general verdict * * * confers on the jury a vast power to commit error and do mischief by loading it with technical burdens far beyond its ability to perform, by confusing it in aggregating instead of segregating the issues, and by shrouding in secrecy and mystery the actual results of its deliberations. * * * The record must be absolutely flawless, but such a result is possible only by concealing, not by excluding mistakes. This is the great technical merit3 of the general verdict. It covers up all the shortcomings which frail human nature is unable to eliminate from the trial of a case. In the abysmal abstraction of the general verdict concrete details are swallowed up, and the eye of the law, searching anxiously for the realization of logical perfection, is satisfied. In short, the general verdict is valued for what it does, not for what it is. It serves as the great procedural opiate, * * * draws the curtain upon human errors and soothes us with the assurance that we have attained the unattainable.<footnotemark>15b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The general verdict enhances, to the maximum, the power of appeals to the biases and prejudices of the jurors,<footnotemark>15c</footnotemark> and usually converts into a futile ritual the use of stock phrases about dispassionateness almost always included in judges\u2019 charges.<footnotemark>15d</footnotemark> Many books on trial tactics, written by experienced trial lawyers, which give advice as to how to arouse juries\u2019 emotions, make the point that a jury tries the lawyers rather than the case, and that the lawyers, in jury trials, must recognize themselves as actors or stage-managers engaged in theatrical performances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In a series of pamphlets on trial practice, recently published under the auspices of the American Bar Association, one author writes that \u201cthe advocate * * * must always recognize that the jury is judging the lawyer as well as the witnesses, quick to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sides because of the protagonists rather than their opinion of the testimony\u201d ;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> another says that the jurors\u2019 reaction to trial counsel \u201cmay be more important than the reaction to the client, for the client appears on the stand only during a relatively brief period, while the lawyer is before the jury all the time\u201d; this same author gives detailed suggestions of means by which a lawyer may \u201cingratiate himself\u201d with the jury.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A court has solemnly decided that \u201ctears have always been considered legitimate arguments before a jury,\u201d that such use of tears is \u201cone of the natural rights of counsel which no court or constitution could take away,\u201d-and .that \u201cindeed, if counsel has them at command, it may be seriously questioned whether it is not his professional duty to shed them whenever proper occasion arises. * * * \u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Harris, in his well known book on advocacy, says, \u201cIt may be that judgment is more easily deceived when the passions are aroused, but if so, you [the lawyers] are not responsible. Human nature was, I presume, intended to be what it is, and when it gets into the jury-box, it is the duty of the advocate to make the best use of it he fairly can in the interests of his client.\u201d <footnotemark>19a</footnotemark> This is no laughing matter. For prejudice has been called the thirteenth juror, <footnotemark>19b</footnotemark> and it has been noted that \u201cMr. Prejudice and Miss Sympathy are the names of witnesses whose testimony is never recorded, but must nevertheless be reckoned with in trials by jury.\u201d<footnotemark>19c</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6\">Small wonder that Thayer commented that jury trials are \u201ca potent cause of demoralization to- the bar,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or that Morgan, well versed in trial tactics, in reviewing a book on jury trial techniques, recently wrote :<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cIf only some lawyer could rise up and honestly denounce Mr. Gold-stein as a defamer of his profession. * * * If only a reviewer cotjld assert that this book is a guide not to the palaces of virtue but to the red-light districts of the law. But a decent respect for the truth compels the admission that Mr. Gold-stein has told his story truly. He has told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>it calmly, without a pretense of shame and [God save us!] without the slightest suspicion of its shamefulness. He has shown by his own unperturbed frankness with what compliance the profession, which would smile the superior smile of derision at the suggestion of a trial by battle of bodies, accepts trial by battle of wits. In all innocence, he has produced a volume which is a devastating commentary upon an important aspect of our administration of justice.\u201d Not that lawyers, trying to protect their clients, should be censured for employing the strategems described in such a book \u2014 as long as we retain the general-verdict jury system. But, with the general verdict in operation, and those strategems as its usual concomitants, it should not be surprising that one of the members of this court said, \u201cI am by no means enamored of jury trials, at least in civil cases * * *<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>\u201d, and that Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for the Supreme Court, remarked, \u201cFew would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without\u201d trial by jury.<footnotemark>22a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">That is not to say that, by way of contrast with juries, all trial judges are free of all susceptibility to emotional appeals, or that \u2014 although most trial judges, because of experience, are more skilled in fact-finding than juries and better armored against the seductive wiles of lawyers <footnotemark>22b</footnotemark>\u2014 any trial judge can (or should) slough off all predilections.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Lord Bramwell observed, \u201cOne third of a judge is a common law juror if you get beneath his ermine\u201d; and Mr. Justice Riddell added that \u201cthe other two thirds may not be far different.\u201d <footnotemark>23a</footnotemark>) Nor is it to say that, where con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>stitutional or statutory provisions require jury trials, judges do not have the highest obligation to see that such trials are conducted in accordance with the basic principles which govern such proceedings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But, as reasonable modifications of the jury system are not thereby precluded,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a vigorous revival of a traditional adjunct of that system, i.e., the special verdict, represents no deviation from judicial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Perhaps the least desirable feature of the general verdict, a feature which the fact verdict wipes out, is this: The theory of the general verdict involves the assumption that the jury fully comprehends the judge\u2019s instructions concerning the applicable substantive legal rules. <footnotemark>25a</footnotemark> Yet, often the judge must state those rules to the jury with such niceties that many lawyers do not comprehend them, and it is impossible that the jury can. Judge Bok notes that \u201cjuries have the disadvantage * * * of being treated like children while the testimony is going on, but then being doused with a kettleful of law during the charge that would make a third-year law-student blanch.\u201d <footnotemark>25b</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the patently fictitious assumption that the jurors have more legal wisdom than third-year law-students requires the upper court to reverse when a trial judge fails- to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the pertinent substantive rules with sufficient particularity. Such faulty instructions, it has been said, \u201care the greatest single source of reversible error.\u201d <footnotemark>25c</footnotemark> Judge Rossman says: \u201cThe general verdict is responsible for the elaborate instructions given to the jury. * * * The necessity for [these] instructions creates pitfalls which may trap the trial judge and which in turn may result in new trials, appeals and reversals.\u201d <footnotemark>25d</footnotemark> In many instances, such a reversal means merely another trial at which the judge will intone to another uncomprehending jury a revised version of those legal rules.<footnotemark>25e</footnotemark> There results an enormous waste of time and money. Indeed, the prospect of a prolonged new trial undoubtedly often induces a litigant of modest means to accept an unfair settlement. The fact verdict provides an obvious escape from these wasteful or unfair consequences of the general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The finding of facts, says Sunderland, \u201cis much better done by means of the special verdict. Every advantage, which the jury is popularly supposed to have over the court as a trier of facts, is retained, with the very great additional advantage that the analysis and separation of the facts in the case which the court and the attorney must necessarily effect in employing the special verdict, materially reduces the chance of error. It is easy to make mistakes in dealing at large with aggregates of facts. The special verdict compels detailed consideration. But above all it enables the public, the parties and the court to see what the <em>jurf </em>has really done. * <em>* </em>* The morale of the jury also is aided by throwing off the cloak of secrecy, for only through publicity is there developed the proper feeling of responsibility in public servants. So far, then, as the facts go, they can be much more effectively, conveniently and usefully tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>by abandoning the general verdict and substituting the special verdict. * * * The special verdict is devised for the express purpose of escaping the sham of false appearances.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL6\">When using a special verdict, the judge need not \u2014 should not \u2014 give any charge about the substantive legal rules beyond what is reasonably necessary to enable the jury to answer intelligently the questions put to them.<footnotemark>26a</footnotemark> As, accordingly, the jury is less able to know whether its findings will favor one side or the other, the appeal to the jurors\u2019 cruder prejudices will frequently be less effective. \u201cA perverse verdict may still be returned, granted a jury clever enough to appreciate the effect of its answers, and to shape them to harmonize with its. general conclusions. But it is much more difficult * * * and by requiring the jury to return, the naked facts only we may fairly expect to escape the results of sympathy, prejudice and passion.\u201d <footnotemark>26b</footnotemark> That may be too sanguine a hope; but the fact verdict may often reduce the more undesirable sway of emotions. It is suggested, too, that a special verdict \u201csearches the conscience of the individual juror, as a general verdict does not,\u201d because \u201csuch are the contradictions in human nature that many a man who will unite in a general verdict for a large and unwarranted sum of money will shrink from a specific finding against his judgment and sense of right and wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>26c</footnotemark> Judge Rossman writes, \u201cBearing in mind that in the judge-jury relationship both members of the team are entitled to fair treatment, may we not ask ourselves: Is it fair to require a jury to employ a general verdict? Since recourse to the special verdict is available, is it right to demand that a juror swear that he will obey the instructions (which the lawyers frequently say they are not sure of until they have been transcribed) and return a general verdict in obedience thereto ?\u201d <footnotemark>26d</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1\">True, the common-law type of special verdict, when utilized in this\" country, frequently caused so many complications that it fell into disrepute <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> But in three states, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Texas, the special-verdict practice in civil cases wa.s so modified as to avoid most of those complications.<footnotemark>27a</footnotemark> The Wisconsin and Texas procedures, apparently the most effective,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> seem to -have been the model for Rule 49(a) of the Federal Civil Rules of Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, which authorizes the trial judge to dispense with a general verdict and, instead, to require the return of special written findings. Rule 49(b) also authorizes the judge to call for a general verdict accompanied by written interrogatories.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But, unlike the Texas trial judge, the federal district judge, under the Rule, has full, uncontrolled discretion in the matter: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>He may still require merely the old-fashioned general verdict.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Accordingly, we cannot hold that a district judge errs when, as here, for any reason or no reason whatever, he refuses to demand a special verdict, although we deem such a verdict usually preferable to the opaque general verdict.<footnotemark>30a</footnotemark> Perhaps some day soon Rule 49 will be amended to make compulsory either special verdicts or written interrogatories in civil jury cases. Meanwhile, we can but hope that, in such cases, the district judges will require one or the other, on their own motion or when asked to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">The fact verdict will furnish no panacea.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Among other things, as previously noted, it will still be true that, in a rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tively simple case, the jury will still be able to foresee what answers to the questions will produce a judgment for the side it favors. There is this, too, to consider: Some persons oppose the requirement that trial judges in non-jury cases shall file special findings of fact. <footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As such findings' <em>closely </em>resemble a jury\u2019s special verdict,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it is therefore pertinent here that some of those opponents suggest, in effect, that a trial judge\u2019s decision is a unique composite reaction to the oral testimony, a composite which ought not \u2014 or, rather, cannot without artificiality \u2014 be broken down into findings of fact and legal conclusions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Back of this suggestion there lurks something like the notions of gestalt psychology:<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> A judge\u2019s reaction to the evidence at a trial is apparently considered a \u201cwhole\u201d (a \u201cgestalt\u201d or \u201cpattern\u201d) which cannot adequately be analyzed. Separation of a decision into \u201claw\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d components, it seems to be asserted, will be \u201ctoo logical,\u201d in the sense that it excludes the \u201cintuition of experience which outruns analysis and sums up many unnamed and tangled impressions, impressions which may lie beneath consciousness without losing their worth.\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Some sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>port for this position might be sought in recent writings to the effect that logic stems from language<footnotemark>36a</footnotemark> which, in turn, because of its inherent character, cannot fully express or symbolize \u201cfeelings,\u201d and that feelings have a rational validity, expressive of \u201cwordless knowledge,\u201d which must not be disregarded.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> While, on net balance, however, a logical assaying by a trial judge of his decision has immense value, so that in a non-jury case special findings of fact by a trial judge are eminently desirable,<footnotemark>37a</footnotemark> the argument against special findings of fact by trial judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>might perhaps be applied with somewhat greater effectiveness against fact verdicts <em>by </em>juries: It might be said that some <em>one </em>person or body, either a trial judge or a jury, should be entrusted in each case with reaching a composite reaction to the evidence, and that therefore a division of functions into explicit fact-finding by a jury and \u201claw-finding\u201d by a judge will yield an undesirable artificiality.

(1929) 166: \u201cLaw and Justice are from time to time inevitably in conflict. That is because law is a general rule (even the stated exceptions to the rules are general exceptions); while justice is the fairness of this precise case under all its circumstances. And as a rule of law only takes account of broadly typical conditions, and is aimed at average results, law and justice every so often do not coincide. Everybody knows this, and can supply instances. But the trouble is that Law cannot concede it. Law\u2014 the rule \u2014 must be enforced \u2014 the exact terms of the rule, justice or no justice. \u2018All Persons Are Equal before the Law\u2019; this solemn injunction, in large letters, is painted on the wall -over the judge\u2019s bench in every Italian court. So that the judge must apply the law as he finds it alike for all. And not even the general exceptions that the law itself may concede will enable the judge to get down to the justice of the particular case, in extreme instances. The whole basis of our general confidence in the judge rests on our experience that we can rely on him for the law as it is. But, this being so, the repeated instances of hardship and injustice that are bound to occur in the judge\u2019s rulings will in the long run injure that same public confidence in justice, and bring odium on the law. We want justice, and we think we are going to get it through \u2018the law,\u2019 and when we do not, we blame \u2018the law.\u2019 Now this is where the jury comes in. The jury, in the privacy of its retirement, adjusts the general rule of law to the justice of the particular case. Thus the odium of inflexible rules of law is avoided, and popular satisfaction is preserved. * * * That is what jury trial does. It supplies that flexibility of legal rules which is essential to justice and popular contentment. And that flexibility could never be given by judge trial. The judge (as in a chancery case) must write out his opinion, declaring the law and the findings of fact. He cannot in this public record deviate one jot from those requirements. The jury, and the secrecy of the jury room, are the indispensable elements in popular justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">See Pound, Law In Books and Law In Action, 44 Am.L.Rev. (1910) 12, 18, 19: \u201cJury lawlessness is the great corrective law in its actual administration. The will of the state at large imposed on a reluctant community, the will of a majority imposed on a vigorous and determined minority, find the same obstacle in the local jury that formerly confronted kings and ministers. * * * What is the purpose and what the occasion of the extensions of the powers of juries to which I have referred? Practically the purpose is, in largest part, to keep the letter of the law the same- in the books, while allowing the jury free rein to apply different rules or extra-legal considerations in the actual decision of causes \u2014 to create new breaches and widen existing breaches between law in the books and law in action. The occasion is that popular thought and popular action are at variance with many of the doctrines and rules in the books, and that the law is trying to save the latter and accommodate itself to the former. * * * If the ritual of charging the jury on the law with academic exactness is preserved, the record will show that the ease was decided according to law, and the fact that the jury dealt with it according to extra-legal notions of conformity <em>to the </em>views of the community for the time being, is covered up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">Mr. Justice Chalmers stated this position thus: \u201cAgain, there is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. So they do when there ' is no jury. The Judge is anxious to do justice to the particular parties before him. To meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>a particular hard case he is tempted to qualify or engraft an exception upon a sound general principle. When a judge once leaves the straight and narrow path of law, and wanders into the wide fields of substantial justice, he is soon irretrievably lost. * * * But hard cases tried with a jury do not make bad law, for they make no law at all, as far as the findings of the jury are concerned. The principle is kept intact while the jury do justice in the particular case by not applying it.\u201d See Frank, Law and the Modern Mind (1930) 174: \u201cBy such use of the jury, you can eat your cake and have it too. You can preserve your rules and principles unswerving and unyielding \u2014in the form of the judge\u2019s instructions \u25a0 \u2014 and you can have a jury\u2019s decision (which determines the rights of the parties to the case) that is based upon scant respect for those abstractions as against emotional appeals. The rules and principles remain pure and unsullied \u2014 because, while clearly enunciated, they are not applied. * * * \u2018It cannot be doubted,\u2019 says Chamberlayne, \u2018that a principal claim of the jury to popular favor is its traditional ability to defy, in a general verdict, the law of the land as announced by the judge.\u2019 \u201d See Ohamberlayne, Evidence (1911) \u00a7 73; Thompson, Trials, 2d Ed., \u00a7 2133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\"> See Frank, Words and Music: Some Remarks on Statutory Interpretation, 47 Col.L.Rev. (1947) 1259, 1274-1276; Frank, If Men Were Angels (1942) 87, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In support of this defense of the general verdict, an oft-cited illustration is the refusal of many juries to apply the harsh fellow-servant rule. But it is not unlikely that the judges themselves failed to abolish that judge-made rule precisely because jury verdicts made it seem unnecessary to do so. And, since some juries doubtless did apply that rule, the result was an unfair lack of uniformity in the decisions. Aside from its episodic and capricious character, such \u201claw making\u201d by juries seems an unnecessarily clumsy method of nullifying undesirable precedents. The same can be said of the argument that general verdicts provide desirable individualization of cases which some legal rules, were they applied, would prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">It is notable that, in cases where, for historical reasons, juries do not sit \u2014 as in equity and many admiralty suits \u2014 the judges have been less reluctant to contrive flexible rules and to revise undesirable precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">If any legal rules are too harsh or otherwise undesirable, and the judges are unwilling, or (where the rules are statutory) unable, to modify them, recourse should be had to the legislatures which today are less tardy in acting than once they were. It seems unwise to pretend to keep legal rules alive and leave their amendment or nullification to a series of legislatures, each consisting of twelve men or women, casually selected as jurors. It may be, moreover, that reliance on jury nullification of legal rules has retarded desirable remedial legislation by the elected legislatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">More important, the theory that juries legislate undesirable substantive rules out of existence rests on the false assumption that the jurors, with full understanding of the rules announced in the judge\u2019s charge, deliberately and consciously nullify them. In truth, the jurors often have no understanding of that part of the judge\u2019s charge but (frequently on the basis of prejudice) simply bring in a general verdict for the party they favor. The jurors\u2019 legislation is thus often blind and unintentional.

Calling one determination an opinion and the others a verdict does not * * * make that uniform and certain which from its nature must remain variable and uncertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">Nevertheless, the trial judge has distinct advantages. So far as he is a juror, his experience with many trials gives him a training for his job: the distractions and interruptions do not confuse him as they are likely to confuse the ordinary juryman. And obviously, the trial judge is far better able to understand the legal rules and the method of applying them to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-19\">Moreover, the character of a trial is different when only a trial judge sits. Says Green, \u201cIf the jury is taken out of the courthouse, the drama is gone. The court-room is not the same place. There is no tenseness. The lawyers are not the same; they no longer glare at one another. Even the parties are docile. The judge returns to himself. The attendants drop back into their humdrum ways. The crowd is made up of a few parties at interest and the habitual loungers. The place is dead. There is no haranguing in choosing the arbiter, nothing more than a brief statement of the issues, and seldom that; the examination of the witnesses proceeds with calmness, barring the most exceptional case; objections to evidence are seldom made, and when made, if there is the slightest uncertainty, the judge hears the evidence and states that if it appears to be inadmissible he will ignore it in his findings. The argument on the issues is brief and pointed. There are no instructions to prepare, no verdict, no motion for a new trial except in the rarest instance. The judge either announces his conclusion, or else takes it under advisement for further study and later announcement. He may then file the findings which support his decision. The whole process is deflated until there is little left to do save get down to business. The trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>same case before a judge and before the same judge witb a jury, with the same lawyers, reflects the most startling differences. * * * \u2019* Green, Judge and Jury, 403, 404.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"> The writer of this opinion has expressed his own views on this subject in a dissenting opinion in United States v.

I do not understand that criticism. It is the sworn duty of judges to enforce many statutes they may deem unwise. And so, when on the bench, our private views concerning the desirability of the jury system are \u2018as irrelevant as our attitudes towards bimetallism or the transmigration of souls.\u2019 Consequently, as long as jury trials are guaranteed by constitutional or statutory provisions, it is the obligation of every judge, no matter what he thinks of such trials, to see that they are fairly conducted and that the jury\u2019s province is not invaded. That does not mean that a judge may not freely express his skepticism about the system, may not seek to bring about constitutional and statutory changes which will avoid or reduce what he considers its unfortunate results as it now operates.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\"> Ex parte Peterson, 253 U.S. 300, 40 S.Ct. 543, 64 L.Ed. 919.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25a\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> Note, for instance, the following statement in a charge to a jury: \u201cIt would be a violation of your duty to attempt to determine the law or to base your verdict upon any other.view of the law than that given you by the court\u2014 a wrong for which the parties would have no remedy, because it is conclusively presumed by the court and all higher tribunals that you have acted in accordance with these instructions as you have been sworn to do.\u201d 3 F.R.D. 118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25b\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\"> Bok, I, Too, Nicodemus (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">There are at least three theories of how the general-verdict-jury-system works: (1) According to a naive theory, the judge conclusively determines the pertinent substantive legal rules, and the jury confines itself to finding the facts. (2) A more sophisticated theory runs thus: The judge has one function and the jury two. The judge announces authoritatively the pertinent rules of law. The jury (a) ascertain the facts and (b) apply to these facts the rules of law laid down by the judge and (c) thus arrive at their general verdict. The judge, that is, supplies the major premise, consisting of the abstract rules of law; the jury determine the minor premise from the evidence, and then work out the syllogism to its logical condusion in the verdict which they report to the judge. Some of those who accept this theory assert that juries often circumvent the legal rules by misfinding the facts; the facts, it is said, are \u201cfound in order to reach the result.\u201d [See, e. g., Pound, Introduction to the Philosophy of Law (1921) 133; cf. 121.] That thesis assumes that the jurors, understanding what the judge told them about the substantive legal rules, proceed with consummate skill and cunning to devise the exact finding of facts which, when correlated with those rules, will logically compel the judgment the jurors desire. (3) A more realistic theory maintains that jurors often do not understand the judge\u2019s instructions and simply bring in an unexplained verdict for the party they favor.

Perhaps, \u2018however, a defender of that thesis believes that a jury ought to know the substantive rules before it nullifies them.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Since lawyers use the trial judge\u2019s instructions about the substantive rules (instructions often unintelligible to the jurors) as traps for the judge, it is manifest that the substantive rules in general-verdict jury cases often are in large part but procedural devices. See Prank, A Plea Por Lawyer-Schools, 56 Tale L.J. (1947) 1303, 1317,</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">It is a curious fact that many courts which refuse to reverse for (1) so-called \u201cprocedural\u201d errors they call \u201charmless\u201d nevertheless will be prompt to reverse for (2) errors in the charge to the jury about the substantive rules \u2014 although the first kind of errors (such as, e.g., improper remarks of one of the lawyers) are often matters well within. the comprehension of the jurors and may have influenced their verdict, while the second kind. frequently are putside the jurors\u2019 comprehension and therefore could not have affected their judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25e\">\n<p id=\"b119-16\"><em> </em>Here is where some persons believe that much law-school teaching about the substantive rules remains deficient.

To law students, the field of torts, for example, is largely made up of the words which appellate courts have permitted trial judges to say to juries; the extent to which these words have any connection with juries\u2019 decisions has so far remained a question which most professors of the \u2018law of torts\u2019 have made no attempt to answer. We do not suggest that there is no connection..

As Wignore says, it means \u201csolva complex mass of evidence in contentious litigation,\u201d and requires the coordination of evidence heard under distracting circumstances. See Wigmore, Principles of Judicial Proof (1913) 3, 747, 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">This coordination plainly has peculiar difficulties for men untrained in that art, men placed, as jurymen are, in unaccustomed conditions \u2014 in the jury-box and and jury-room \u2014 by no means conducive to calm deliberation. Twelve judges would not find it easy to reach a satisfactory joint conclusion were they treated as we treat jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Recognizing the difficulties, Judge Knox said that, \u201cto accomplish justice,\u201d we must have jurors \u201cwith intelligence, sound judgment, and courage that will enable them to decide intricate questions of fact * * * \u201d See testimony, June 12 and 13, 1945, before House Committee on the Judiciary (on H.R. 3379, 3380 and 3381) 9, 12. Judge Otis insisted that the task calls for jurors who have the \u201ccapacity quickly to comprehend the applicable law and intelligently to apply it.\u201d See Otis, Selecting Federal Court Jurors. Both those judges suggested that jurymen with such capacities will be procured by providing higher standards for jury service and in \u201chand-picking\u201d those eligible for that service.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">One may well be skeptical of the efficacy of such a remedy. Nor will it do the trick to distribute brief handbooks for jurors or to have the judge briefly lecture the panel about jurors\u2019 functions. The system adopted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, is more promising. There prospective jurors receive a written test; they must pass this test and also show their aptitudes in oral interviews. But, even that device would seem insufficient. A more thoughtful proposal is that we establish detailed courses in \u201cschools for jurors.\u201d See Judge Galston, Civil Jury Trials and Tribulations, 29 Am.Bar Ass\u2019n, J. (1943) 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-20\">Nor can juries come near ascertaining the actual facts of cases as long as we retain the numerous exclusionary evidence rules. Judge Learned Hand (loe. cit.) after stating that he was \u201cnot enamored of jury trials, at least in civil cases,\u201d went on to say, \u201cbut it is entirely inconsistent to trust them as reverently as we do, and still surround them with restrictions which, if they have no rational validity whatever, depend upon distrust.\u201d Says Boston: \u201cBut our law * * * requires that all matters for consideration of the jury shall be, as it were a sort of predigested food for mental invalids; and so it strains this food * * * through the most highly developed rules of evidence, which have been evolved by reflections of party trained metaphysicians on the operations of the human mind * * * In short, we recognize in every imaginable way that the jury is the weakest element in our judici&amp;l system, and yet we ponder to it as a sacred institution.

But strangely enough, the so-called \u2018mental sciences\u2019 have gained very little from the great adventure. One attempt after another has failed to apply the concept of causality to logic and aesthetics, or even sociology and psychology. Causes and effects could be found, of course, and could be correlated, tabulated and studied; but even in psychology, where the study of stimulus and reaction has been carried to elaborate lengths, no true science has resulted. No prospects of really great achievement have opened before us in the laboratory. If we follow the methods of natural science our psychology tends to run into physiology, histology, and genetics; we move further and further away from those problems which we ought to be approaching. That signifies that the generative idea which gave rise to physics and chemistry and all their progeny \u2014 technology, medicine, biology-does not contain any vivifying concept for the humanistic sciences. The physicist\u2019s scheme, so faithfully emulated by generations of psychologists, epistemologists, and aesthetieians is probably blocking their progress, defeating possible insights by its prejudicial force. The scheme is not false \u2014 it is perfectly reasonable \u2014 but it is bootless for the study of mental phenomena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">Pascal, Pensees (1670); \u201cThose who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and are not used to seek for principles.

HAND, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ARV\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">I concur in holding that there was evidence to support the verdict, and that it was not an error to refuse to take a special verdict along with the general verdict. I also concur in thinking that it would be desirable to take special verdicts more often. True, it would often expose the general verdict to defeat by showing how irrational had been the operation of the juror\u2019s minds. However, like my brother Frank, I am not among those who appear to esteem the system just because it gives rein to the passional element of our nature, however inevitably that may enter all our conclusions. I should like to subject a verdict, as narrowly as was practical, to a review which should make it in fact, what we very elaborately pretend that it should be; a decision based upon law. In criminal prosecutions there may be, and in my judgment there are, other considerations which intervene to make such an attempt undesirable.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b124-9\">SWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Acx\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">I concur in affirmance of judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
