The Unemployment Compensation Act of the District of Columbia requires employers to pay contributions at different rates based on differences in experience. It provides that for the purpose of determining the rate, \u201ctwo .or more employing units which are parties to or the subject of a merger, consolidation, or other form of reorganization effecting a change in legal identity or form, shall be deemed to be a single employing unit if (a) the successor unit requests a transfer of the predecessor\u2019s experience within six months from date such change in legal identity or form occurred, * * * and (c) immediately after such change such successor is owned or controlled by substantially the same interests as the predecessor employing unit or units. If the Board shall deem two or more employing units to have become a single employer, it shall combine their experience, if any, with pay rolls, contributions and benefit charges * * D. C.Code (1940), Supp. V, \u00a7 46 \u2014 303(c) (7), 57 Stat. 107, \u00a7 3(c) (7). The Unemployment Compensation Board declined to \u201ccombine the experience\u201d of the National Brick Company, Inc., with that of appellant partners, because the Board found that appellants failed to prove they made a request for a \u201ctransfer of the predecessor\u2019s experience within six months from' date such change * * * occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Appellants applied to the District Court for review. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s finding as supported by substantial evidence. D.C.Code (1940), Supp. V, \u00a7 46 \u2014 303(c) (10). We agree. Appellants had the burden of proving that they made a timely request. The only evidence in their favor was the testimony of one man that he had included such a request in a letter he wrote to the Board three years before the time of his testimony. Neither the original nor a copy of the letter was produced. Even if no adverse testimony had been presented the Board\u2019s adverse finding would not have been unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The action of the Board and of the court was right for other reasons also. The corporation and the partnership were not \u201cparties to or the subject of a merger, consolidation, or other form of reorganization.\u201d The change effected was not a mere \u201cchange in legal identity of form\u201d; it was a complete change in the substantial as well as the formal ownership of the business. The successor was not \u201cowned or controlled by substantially the same interests as the predecessor.\u201d The fact that appellants retained their predecessor\u2019s manager and employees is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The Board was not estopped by the fact that, before it discovered the change of ownership, it collected contributions from the new owners at the old rate. We think it unnecessary to discuss appellants\u2019 other contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
