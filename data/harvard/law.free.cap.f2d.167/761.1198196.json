No. 123, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 Stat. 188; Pub.L. No. 237, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 61 Stat. 425. The Board\u2019s decision is plainly within its discretion. We regret the resulting hardship to the appellants, but we have no authority to substitute our discretion for that of the Board and no reason to assume that our discretion, if exercised, would lead to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
