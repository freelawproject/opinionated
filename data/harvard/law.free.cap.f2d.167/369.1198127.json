The case was tried to a judge, and the defendant consented that the judgment should be entered against it on the first contract; but there remained for decision the remaining three: a claim under each being set up in a separate count in the complaint. The judge dismissed the second count because the plaintiff had not performed as agreed, and the third and fourth counts, because all four, contracts \u201cdovetailed, and might well be considered as one agreement divided into four parts. A breach of the agreement at any stage of any one of the contracts seems to me to give power to the defendant to suspend or cancel the balance of the contract at that time.\u201d The facts were as follows. The first contract was to instruct students who had already had the primary and secondary courses in the civilian pilot training program, and had signified their \u201cwillingness and ability to devote\u201d their \u201centire time to this course of instruction until it is completed\u201d ; and the other three contracts assumed that the student had had the training provided for in the preceding contracts. The first two contracts together made up what was called the \u201cCross. Country Course\u201d; the first being for \u201cground instruction\u201d; the second \u2014 for \u201cflight instruction\u201d \u2014 being itself divided into four \u201cStages\u201d \u2014 A. B. C. D. The second two contracts made up what was called the \u201cInstructor Course,\u201d this too being divided into two parts: the first for \u201cflight instruction,\u201d and the second for \u201cground instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">The- first two contracts were executed on July 1, 1941; and the Civil Aeronautics Administrator assigned six student flyers to take the \u201cCross Country Course\u201d; who by September 2, 1941, had, not only finished the \u201cground instruction\u201d of that course, but \u201cStages A. and B\u201d of the \u201cflight instruction,\u201d and-all of \u201cStage C,\u201d except that : three still needed,\u201can extra hour or something.\u201d A short time before -that day Daitz, the, plaintiff\u2019s president, notified the Administrator that, the three who had completed \u201cStage C\u201d were ready for what was known as \u201cflight testing,\u201d preparatory to \u201cStage D,\u201d and the Administrator sent two inspectors \u2014 Fluet, and Seal- \u2014 to test them. Before letting Fluet test the students Daitz insisted that he must be satisfied that Fluet was competent to fly the plaintiff\u2019s plane, and together they took a trial flight on.September 2nd., Daitz was not satisfied, and refused to let Fluet test the students. In his report to his superiors on September 3rd Fluet acknowledged that in flying the plane he \u201cassumed the attitude of a student for the purpose of checking Daitz\u2019s ability and attitude as an instructor. Naturally, he found fault with all phases of my flying * * * I' did not change my attitude as a student.\u201d Daitz, not being' aware that Fluet was deliberately flying badly, wired the Administrator that Fluet had not flown the plane properly, and that Seal had said he had little experience with the kind of plane used; and he asked that some competent \u201cexaminer\u201d should be sent. The Administrator replied by a telegram, ordering the plaintiff to \u201csuspend all flight and ground training\u201d until further notice; and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>third he revoked Daitz\u2019s \u201cdesignation\u201d as instructor, which the contract required for the \u201cCross Country Course.\u201d No other person in the plaintiff\u2019s employ was ^ ever so designated. On the fourth, however, another official of the Administrator wrote, extending the time for the completion of the second contract until September 15th. So matters stood without change until January 26, 1942, when the Administrator sent to the plaintiff copies of papers directing the students to complete their training elsewhere. That was a rescission of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The defendant first excuses this action on the ground that it was a breach of contract for Daitz to refuse to let Fluet use the plane to \u201cflight-test\u201d the three students who had completed \u201cStage C\u201d; but that is patently untenable. The plaintiff, not only had an interest in protecting its own plane, but, quite aside from any decent regard for life and limb, it had agreed to \u201chold and save any student harmless from liability\u201d for any damage he might do, and to do the same as to all governmental \u201cofficers an employees\u201d which might result from their use of its \u201cequipment.\u201d Fluet willingly submitted to \u201ccheck out\u201d the plane, but by his own confession he made no effort to fly it properly, and seized upon the chance merely to try out Daitz\u2019s composure, when -faced with his apparent incompetence. In spite of Fluet\u2019s pitiful attempts upon the stand to put another meaning upon his report, the facts are not debatable and the finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d that Daitz \u201crefused without cause or justification and arbitrarily and capriciously to permit an authorized and specially competent flight examiner * * * to flight test the students.\u201d On the contrary he would have been grossly negligent, had he not demanded a substitute, and his refusal was no excuse either for suspending, or later for rescinding the contracts. It remains to consider the other excuses offered for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> In the second count the plaintiff asked judgment for the hours of instruction given to the six students under \u201cStage C,\u201d and also damages resulting from the rescission; in the third and fourth counts it asked judgment for damages only. Recovery for the instruction given depends upon whether the plaintiff performed in accordance with, the contract. The defendant invokes as evidence that it did not do so, the judge\u2019s finding which we quote in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will not say that there was no evidence in the record to support so much of this finding as concerned Daitz\u2019s difficulties with his students; but we cannot discover anything to justify the conclusion that the students had not in fact been properly instructed in \u201cStage C.\u201d The testimony concerns only three of them in any event, and all that appears as to two of these is that after a lapse of some five months they required some \u201crefresher\u201d training before they were able to fly their planes again. That was no evidence that the plaintiff had not properly instructed them originally. The third had been an unpromising student, and in January or February, 1942, he proved to be unable to fly even a primary airplane, something which he should have learned before he was assigned to the plaintiff at all. His inability t\u00a9 do so had no bearing whatever upon his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>struction in \u201cStage C.\u201d While it is true that the plaintiff has the burden of proving performance, we think that it made out a case, after it appeared that the only suggested deficiencies were without substance, for confessedly instruction had been given. Daitz\u2019s temperamental defects may have been an excuse for rescinding, but that is another matter: the plaintiff proved itself entitled to recover for all the hours of instruction given in \u201cStage C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">There remain the claims for damages. The defendant asserts that the contract was unilateral \u2014 \u201cillusory\u201d\u2014because Article Seventh relieved the Administrator of all compulsion. We quote that article in the margin, so far as it is relevant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The argument is that, since it empowered the Administrator to direct the \u201ccontractor\u201d to \u201ccease giving instruction to\u201d one student, he was free to direct the plaintiff to \u201ccease giving\u201d it to all the students, and that this amounted to a privilege to rescind the whole contract, as he did on January 26, 1942. That is a misapprehension of the meaning of the article. The first sentence merely gave power to instructors \u2014 all of whom were to be employees of the \u201ccontractor\u201d \u2014 if they thought that a given student would not make a good aviator to inform the \u201ccontractor,\u201d and the \u201ccontractor\u201d would then inform the Administrator, who would suspend, or end, the instruction. So far, it gave the Administrator no initiative; and it is only the third sentence which on any theory can be used to support rescission. It is possible to read that literally so as to give the Administrator power to stop the instruction of a student, at his pleasure, or because the instruction was imperfect; but if it is read with what went before, it merely gives the Administrator the power to decide for himself that a given student would not turn out to be a good aviator \u2014 the same power that the instructors had. It did not concern the propriety of the \u201ccontractor\u2019s\u201d instruction in any way whatever. The Administrator did have power to rescind the contract, of course, as every promisor has, when his performance is conditional upon performance by the other party, but Article Seventh did not give it. Indeed, Form 523 gave him express power to eliminate any instructor whose work was not satisfactory ; a power whose existence was at war with the notion that the contract did not bind the Administrator at all. Thus, if the rescission was justified, it was only because the plaintiff had substantially failed to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Arquendo we will assume that, those temperamental defects of Daitz, which the judge found to exist, would have justified that remedy; and we will also assume that the transfer of the students to other instructors was an adequate manifestation of an election to rescind, though the last, is somewhat doubtful. Be that as it may, the Administrator did not make use of the putative remedy from September 2nd when he suspended instruction, until January 26, 1942; and the suspension did not relieve the plaintiff of its duty to keep itself ready to resume, should the Administrator direct it to do so. The decisions more generally hold that in a bilateral contract the privilege of rescinding for a known breach of the other party, must be exercised seasonably, and that it is lost by delay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williston thinks that delay should not inevitably toll the remedy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> although he adds that it should do so, \u201cwhere there is further performance due under the contract from the other party, which in the absence of notice he might suppose would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>be accepted m spite of his prior breach. We agree; but it seems to us that there may be other occasions in which delay will have the same result. During any permissible delay the promisor has an option to retain the consideration for his own promise and perform, or to reject the consideration and relieve himself. Although by hypothesis the promisee is in default upon his counter-promise, it is not just to subject him indefinitely to variations in the value of his performance to the promisor. All that the promisor should enjoy is a fair opportunity to choose, but not a gamble upon possible changes that may be to his advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In the case at bar the evidence is ample that by September 3rd, the Administrator was fully aware of those temperamental infirmities of Daitz, which were all that could justify rescission. Fluet had gone to the airfield only to try him out; it was for that purpose that he misbehaved in the plane, as appears from his report to the Administrator which declared that \u201cthe reports of the trainees regarding such actions and attitudes are substantiated.\u201d The defendant makes no attempt to justify a delay of nearly five months before the \u201cAdvisory Board\u201d determined the question. The plaintiff did not assent to this delay; it protested at the very outset in its telegram of September 3rd, and it had presented a claim under the contract at some time before January 15, 1942. We hold that it is entitled under the second contract, not only to recover for instruction given, but to damages for the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The same reasoning applies to the third and fourth contracts provided they ever went into effect. Although, as we have said, they had been executed on August 11, 1941, no obligation arose under them unless the Administrator assigned students to be instructed under them. There is something to be said for the view of the judge that all four contracts were considered as one, anyway; but we need not go so far; for, as between the parties, the telegram of August 5th was equivalent to an assignment of the same six students for the \u201cInstructor Course\u201d whom the Administrator had already assigned for the \u201cCross Country Course.\u201d We rely upon the following language: \u201cIt is assumed all cross country operators will be equipped to start this course in time to complete by September 30 with the same students now in training in your summer cross country.\u201d The plaintiff on receiving this telegram was free to conclude that its \u201coperators\u201d \u2014 instructors \u2014 were to take over \u201cthe same students\u201d who were then in the \u201cCross Country Course\u201d; and that these students were \u201cassigned to him by the Administrator\u201d ,(the language of the contracts), although the assignment proper, which was a notice to the student himself, may never have been made. The defendant argues that so to recognize the telegram, would \u201cvary\u201d the third and fourth contracts; but that is obviously not true. The contracts did not say when the students should be assigned. Therefore, when on January 26, 1942, the Administrator assigned these students for instruction elsewhere, he rescinded the third and fourth contracts as well as the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">In view of our disposition of the cause upon the evidence, it becomes unnecessary to consider the questions raised as to the conclusiveness of the pre-trial order; or the effect of the judgment on the first count as res judicata. The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter judgment for the sums earned under \u201cStage C\u201d of the second contract, and for damages on the second, third and fourth counts as stipulated; together with costs in the district court, so far as these are allowable under \u00a7 258, Title 28 U.S.C.A.; but without costs in this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> \u201c9. The plaintiff did not satisfactorily perform Stage O of the Contract. The six students had to be reassigned to other flight schools for completion of the cross-country course and were not as well qualified as they should have been after completing Stage C. The caliber of the instruction given by plaintiff was inferior. Its president, Lewis R. Daitz, did not give instruction meeting the standards established by the Flight Instructor\u2019s Manual of the Civil Aeronautics Authority. In particular he lacked (a) patience; (b) ability to impart his knowledge to his students; and (c) capacity to inspire the respect and confidence of his students. The court finds that the unsatisfactory performances and insufficient qualifications of the students instructed by Lewis R. Daitz for plaintiff were due to said Daitz\u2019s temperamental and personality defects, lack of teaching technique, and intolerance of questions, unfitting him to discharge satisfactorily the duties of an instruction connected with the civilian pilot training program. The court finds that Lewis R. Daitz was a good pilot and knew the best use and method of flying instruction but that he was incapable at that time of imparting his skill to students of the civilian pilot training program.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\"> \u201cPartial completion of instruction.
