Even so, we agree with the Tax Court that no \u201cnote\u201d exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In the first place, as of the date when the parties contracted, no one could tell, from the face of the contract or otherwise, the amount for which taxpayer was liable, since the undertaking, even assuming it was unconditional, was to pay a sum \u201cnot to exceed a total cost of $75,000.\u201d Accordingly, we \u2019 do not have here a sum certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In the second place, the obligation, in several respects, was not unconditional. We need point to but one condition: Jordan-Marsh had the. right to terminate the agreement at will, on sixty days\u2019 notice at any one of divers dates during the ten-year period of the lease; if it so acted, then, by the provisions of the contract, taxpayer was \u25a0 not required to make any further payments and Jordan Marsh was required to pay taxpayer \u201cfor each month of the unexpired term a sum equal to 1/120 part of the $25,000 initially paid by the\u201d taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">As we agree with the Tax Court, we do not consider whether its decision is within so much of the doctrine of Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248 as still remains intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
