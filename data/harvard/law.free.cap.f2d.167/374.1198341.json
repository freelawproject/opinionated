Miller, doing business in Stamford, Connecticut, under the name and style of \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe.\u201d Charging both trade-mark infringement and unfair competition, the plaintiff sought an injunction against use by the defendant of the words \u201cLilliputian Shoppe,\u201d an accounting, and treble damages. The defendant answered denying the charges and counterclaiming for cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s registration on the ground that its tradermark was merely descriptive. Both parties were citizens of New York. Federal jurisdiction of the claim of trade-mark infringement was sustained under 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96, with pendent jurisdiction as to the claim of unfair competition. Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U.S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148; Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, 305 U.S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195. The trial resulted in dismissal of the complaint, from which the plaintiff has appealed, and dismissal of the counterclaim, from which the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The facts found by the district judge are set out at length in his opinion, 67 F.Supp. 809. A summary of them follows: Since 1879 the plaintiff and its predecessors have been continuously engaged in the City of New York in selling at retail apparel for infants and children not over six years of age. Up to 1910 its store front carried the name \u201cLiliputian Bazaar\u201d and the goods there sold were so advertised and labeled. In that year the store was moved to Fifth Avenue and 35th Street, and the business was expanded to include apparel and accessories for older children and adult men and women. Thereafter the sale of goods for infants and children under seven was conducted as a department of the plaintiff\u2019s business. Except where it was impracticable to do so, the merchandise sold in this department has always be\u00e9n labeled \u201cLiliputian Bazaar.\u201d During the entire period that the business has been in existence the \u201cLiliputian'Bazaar\u201d has been extensively advertised, and has come to signify in the minds of the buying public Best &amp; Co. In February 1930 the plaintiff opened a branch store in Mamaroneck, New York, which is 13 miles from Stamford, Connecticut. In that year the plaintiff had 1495 charge customers in the Stamford area. In August 1942 it opened a branch store in Stamford on the same street as the defendant\u2019s store and almost directly opposite it. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">\u25a0 The defendant\u2019s store was opened on December 31, 1930, by her husband Jacob Miller, to whose \u00a1interest she succeeded Upon his death .in 1940. The store has always borne the name \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe\u201d and occupied the same premises. From the start the business has been restricted .to the retail sale of wearing apparel for infants and children wearing garments no larger than size 16, and the merchandise sold has carried labels bearing the name 'of the \u2019 store and its location, \u201cStamford, Conn.\u201d All of the advertising has been of a purely local nature and has described the store as \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe,\u201d except on three occasions when an advertisement in a Stamford newspaper omitted the word \u201cShoppe.\u201d In September 1944, shortly before the present suit was started, two shoppers employed by the plaintiff made cash purchases at the defendant\u2019s store and requested the defendant to mail the purchased articles to designated addresses in New York, which was done. On November 9, 1945, the defendant had 26 charge customers residing, outside of Connecticut, to whom advertising material was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>sent and from whom orders were filled by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The existence of \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe\u201d at Stamford came to the attention of the plaintiff in 1933 and a demand was made upon Jacob Miller that he discontinue the use of the words \u201cLilliputian Shoppe.\u201d This demand was renewed in 1934 and again in October 1944. Negotiations followed, and upon their collapse the present suit was commenced on November 8, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Since registration of a trade-mark confers only procedural advantages .and does not enlarge the registrant\u2019s substantive rights,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial judge held it unnecessary to pass upon the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark and turned at once to a consideration of the claim of unfair competition. He found that the record was barren of a single instance of a purchaser buying the defendant\u2019s merchandise in the belief that it was the plaintiff\u2019s and that the plaintiff\u2019s president could not recall any one having confused the two; he found also that there was no likelihood that the public would be deceived by the defendant\u2019s use of the trade name \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe\u201d; consequently despite the finding that \u201cLiliputian Bazaar\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning signifying Best &amp; Co., he held that the defendant was \u2022 not engaging in unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Much of the argument on the appeal has concerned itself with the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, the defendant contending that \u201cLiliputian Bazaar\u201d is equivalent to \u201cChildren\u2019s Department\u201d or \u201cChildren\u2019s Store\u201d and merely descriptive of the business in which both parties are engaged, while the plaintiff argues that the word \u201cLiliputian\u201d as applied to the sale of goods is fanciful and suggestive rather than purely descriptive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the district court that it is unnecessary to decide whether the trade-mark is a proper subject of registration under the federal Trade-Mark Act of 1905, \u00a7 5, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85. Assuming it is, the plaintiff is entitled to no relief unless there has been infringement. What degree of resemblance is necessary to constitute an infringement is incapable of exact definition; courts can say no more than that \u201cno trader can adopt a trade-mark so resembling that of another trader as that ordinary purchasers, buying with ordinary caution, are likely to be misled.\u201d McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245, 251, 24 L.Ed. 828. Hence the test of trademark infringement differs little, if any, from the test of unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">By her counterclaim the defendant asks for cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s registration on the ground that the mark is merely descriptive. Under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, \u00a7 22, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 102, the defendant has no standing to obtain such relief since she has no interfering registered trade-mark. Drittel v. Friedman, 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 653, 654. If the court were to apply the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, effective July 5, 1947, to the appeal, section 47(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 note, although neither party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>has suggested that we should do so, it may be that section 37, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1119, gives her standing to demand the cancellation; but even on that assumption we could not decide the counterclaim in her favor on this record. Section 46(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 note, saves \u201cmarks, registered under the \u2018ten-year proviso\u2019 of section 5 of the Act of February 20, 1905, as amended.\u201d Under this proviso, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85, it seems likely that the plaintiff\u2019s mark, which has been in continuous use since 1879, was properly registered, even if it were considered merely descriptive. Thaddeus Davids Co. v. Davids, 233 U.S. 461, 34 S.Ct. 648, 58 L.Ed. 1046. This issue apparently was not litigated at the trial and has not been argued here. If the 1946 Act were held applicable, a remand to the district court would be necessary; but in the opinion of the court the provisions of the 1946 Act are not \u201capplicable to the subject matter\u201d of the defend-, ant\u2019s appeal from dismissal of her counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The essence of the wrong of unfair competition lies in the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or vendor for those of another or under such conditions as may lead the purchaser to think they are the goods of the other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the defendant selects a trade-mark or trade name similar to the plaintiff\u2019s with intent to palm off his wares as those of the plaintiff, proof of his intent may be strong evidence of, and in proper' circumstances establish, the likelihood of confusion. In the case at bar there is no finding that the defendant\u2019s trade name was chosen with any such intent; nor is there any evidence to justify such a finding. On the other hand, a defendant\u2019s good faith in believing that he has so marked his goods as to distinguish them from the plaintiff\u2019s, will not protect him if the court finds that confusion has resulted, or is likely to'result. The trial judge correctly ruled that unfair competition is a question of fact, and the test is \u201cwhether the public is likely to be deceived.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Applying this test he found no unfair competition. Such a finding is not conclusive on an appellate court, if it takes a different view as to the likelihood of deception'.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A majority of the court agrees with the trial court\u2019s finding of no unfair competition. It is true that \u201cMiller\u2019s Lilliputian Shoppe\u201d makes use of the dominant word in the plaintiff\u2019s mark and substitutes \u00e1 synonym for \u201cBazaar,\u201d but it also contains the surname \u201cMiller\u2019s,\u201d and no one word of the three is emphasized more than another. While not conclusive, it is not without significance in determining the likelihood of deception of the public by the use of the defendant\u2019s trade name, that no actual confusion has ever resulted during the many years since the business was started at the end of 1930.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, the sec-, ondary meaning which \u201cLiliputian Bazaar\u201d has acquired signifies Best &amp; Co. so that goods bearing that label are identified as coming from its store rather than from an anonymous source or from a dealer whose name the customer may have forgotten. Cases such as Barton v. Rex-Oil Co., 3 Cir., 29 F.2d 474, where the secondary meaning denotes a product, are therefore distinguishable. With the competing stores located on opposite sides of the same street, only about 100 feet apart, and each bearing the owner\u2019s name, the likelihood that customers will be deceived into buying the defendant\u2019s wares in the belief they are the plaintiff\u2019s seems to us nil.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The plaintiff contends that Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526, compels a contrary conclusion. There the trade-mark \u201cLa Favorita,\u201d followed by the name Holt &amp; Co., used as a brand name of flour was held infringed by the defendant\u2019s use of the same brand follow\u00e9d by the name S. O. Ryder, on its flour, the court saying that the substitution of the name Ryder for Holt \u201cis an aggravation and not a justification, for it is openly trading in the name of another upon the reputation acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>by the device of the true proprietor.\u201d But it should be observed that there the trade-mark, identified a product and that the court found an intent to infringe. Moreover, we do not understand the case to mean that under no circumstances will the use of the defendant\u2019s name be sufficient to prevent deception of the public. For reasons already stated we think there is no likelihood of deception in the case at bar and accordingly affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AN6\"> Armstrong Co. v.

Y. 429, 436, 87 N.E. 674, 676, which was a suit brought by a predecessor of the present plaintiff, the court said: \u201cThe word \u2018Lilliputian\u2019 is derived from Swift\u2019s Travels of Lemuel Gulliver to the imaginary Kingdom of Lilliput, the inhabitants of which were described as pygmies about six inches in height. Although of purely fanciful origin, the word \u2018Lilliputian\u2019 has become a part of the English language, and is used to denote persons, and possibly things, of diminutive or minute size. The word \u2018Bazaar\u2019 is also part of our common speech. * * * It is obvious that neither of these words alone can be the subject of a trade-name in which any one can acquire an exclusive proprietary right. They are purely descriptive parts of our language, and may be used by all. But their use together, or in combination with some other word, such as \u2018Best,\u2019 for instance, marks the difference between what is permissible and what may be forbidden.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b430-18\"> Armstrong Co. v.

That is the effect of the new Lanham Trade-Mark Act upon the plaintiff\u2019s case. Though only recently effective, we are certainly authorized to apply it at least prospectively, by its explicit terms. \u00a7 47(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1051 note. Since the plaintiff asks for reversal only to secure an injunction and prevent future infringement, I think we should review the situation in the light of this Act. It cannot be uniquely helpful to the defendant here (in its general broadening of remedies) ; on the contrary, it is clearly plaintiffs\u2019 legislation, beyond what is, I believe, yet judicially realized, even if not quite so much so as the already voluminous literature assumes. Thus it broadens the area of registrable trademarks, the protection accorded such marks, and the general remedies for false description or representation of goods. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 32(1), 43(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1052, 1114(1), 1125(a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> cf. LaTouraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 115, 118, 119, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 771, 67 S.Ct. 189; California Apparel Creators v. Wieder of California, Inc., 2 Cir., 162 F.2d 893, 900, 901, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 816, 68 S.Ct. 156. And it is a more recent and immediately direct expression of legislative concern for this species of property than we have had as to patents, to which analogy is sometimes asserted. Moreover, it seems obvious that in the case of a trade name-there is nothing like the same opportunity for burdensome monopoly and restriction on scientific advances which experience has shown to exist in the grant of a patent. The resources of the English language are such that a defendant may be required without undue hardship to choose his own formula or slogan to exploit without riding upon the successful advertising of another. Hence, however allergic we may be personally to the flamboyance of American advertising, I can see no escape from our duty to carry out the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The approach to this case, in my view, should be to regard it, as stated in Gannert v. Rupert, 2 Cir., 127 F. 962, 963, as \u201ca trade-mark case pure and simple,\u201d and \u201cnot a case of unfair competition,\u201d so that \u201cwith this distinction in mind it is obvious that many of the propositions argued by the defendant are irrelevant.\u201d Of course, once secondary meaning and unfair competition are proven in a case, the net results are in substance the same as upon proof of infringement of a valid trade-mark. But in the latter case the road is somewhat more direct; plaintiff need show only the defendant\u2019s confusing use, without proof of damage or other unfairness than the use, and our duty to review is clear. Soy Food Mills v. Pillsbury Mills, 7 Cir., 161.F.2d 22, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 766, 68 S.Ct. 73; LaTouraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., supra; cf. Magazine Publishers v. Ziff-Davis Pub. Co., 2 Cir., 147 F.2d 182, 185. I do not believe there can be doubt that this ancient trade name, originated by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in 1879, was a valid trade-mark when registered in 1915 or renewed in 1935. Its dominating adjective is a fanciful word, originally from the mind of Jonathan Swift, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>but given a new fanciful twist by plaintiff,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who also added to it a noun with exotic connotations to form a combination suggesting an original place and method of vending children\u2019s clothes. And we are int\u00e9rested only in the combination (not in the use of the separate words) ; for that was the registered trade-mark, as well as the trade name. It was afforded protection in Ball v. Broadway Bazaar, 194 N.Y. 429, 87 N.E. 674, and Ball v. Best, C.C.N.D.Ill., 135 F. 434. Such registration I think valid even without resort to the new law, \u00a7 46(b), or to the \u201cten-year proviso\u201d of the old law or its modern five-year substitute. \u00a7 2(f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Of course we still must determine whether or not defendant\u2019s use is likely to cause confusion or mistake. I do not know by how much the new Act must be considered to have extended protection to trade-marks generally; I think, however, that this trademark should have been accorded protection here even under the old law. Defendant has appropriated its dominant and eye-catching part, Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg &amp; Bros., 8 Cir., 25 F.2d 284; Huntington Laboratories v. Onyx Oil &amp; Chemical Co., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 165 F.2d 454, and for the rest has substituted a synonym arrestingly fashioned. One could hardly imagine an expression better formulated to express the same thing slightly differently, .but with like force. The addition of the defendant\u2019s surname thus possessively then does seem \u201can aggravation, and not a justification,\u201d as pointed out in Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514, 521, 9 S.Ct. 143, 144, 32 L.Ed. 526. Important, too, is the fact that the competition is in exactly the same business; obviously there would not be a like threat from, say, a Lilliputian dancing academy or even candy emporium. Threatened with a like danger as to each of its fifteen branch stores from Massachusetts to Illinois, plaintiff\u2019s business could be indeed menaced. And not without justification, it seems, does it express fear of direct competition right in New York City from \u201cMacy\u2019s Liliputian Shop, Saks\u2019 Liliputian Shoppe, Lord &amp; Taylor\u2019s Liliputian Department, Franklin Simon\u2019s Liliputian Store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">As it, is the likelihood of deception or confusion which is involved, evidence of specific instances is not necessary to support a holding of trade-mark infringement. LaTouraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., supra, and cases, cited. But since some point is made of a lack of evidence for plaintiff, I deem it proper to say that the evidence produced seemed to me pertinent and convincing. That plaintiff\u2019s customers frequently addressed its \u201cLiliputian Bazaar\u201d as \u201cLiliputian Shop,\u201d \u201cLiliputian Bar,\u201d \u201cLiliputian Center,\u201d and \u201cLiliputian Department\u201d helps to demonstrate the key word of the trade-mark. Plaintiff\u2019s canvass of housewives to show that persons seeing garments with defendant\u2019s label immediately assumed that they were garments from Best &amp; Co. is direct evidence of confusion. Beyond this, to expect testimony from persons who had actually made purchases from defendant under the belief that she was the plaintiff is to journey out of the field of business realities. What customer of children\u2019s wear is likely to get into a dispute between merchants as to their sales unless she is acutely dissatisfied with, or in some other way disgruntled over, her purchase? How is such a dissatisfied customer to be located by the rival concern, and what unique value would such testimony have? Further, I take it that this reasoning is opposed to the psychology of advertising which is designed particularly to attract attention to specific goods, so that they may sell themselves. If defendant\u2019s labels bring the customer to the counter or even to the doorstep, retreat is difficult and a sale is in prospect, even though that may ultimately be consummated with full knowledge of the vendor\u2019s identity. Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 205, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 86 L.Ed. 1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">I think, therefore, that defendant should be required to look elsewhere for her slogan. Analogies in the cases are many; I cite some examples from both the fields of trademark infringement and unfair competition: Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg &amp; Bros., supra (\u201cQueen Brand\u201d infringed \u201cQueen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Make\u201d) ; Fashion Park v.
