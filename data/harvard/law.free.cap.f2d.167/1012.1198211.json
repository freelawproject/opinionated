The former rejection was reversed by the board, leaving as the only issue to be considered here the question as to whether the appealed claims define merely the function of appellant\u2019s apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Appellant\u2019s application relates to the reaction of an olefin and an isoparaffin in the presence of a catalyst, and discloses a cylindrical chamber containing two opposed nozzles, one of which is fixed, while the other is mounted for rotation about an axis coinciding with that of the chamber. The fixed nozzle is supplied with a mixture of catalyst and reaction materials, while fresh reactants are supplied to the rotatably mounted nozzle. The fixed nozzle is provided with a plurality of openings which direct jets of liquid longitudinally of the cylindrical chamber. The rotatable nozzle comprises a number of radial blades, each of which has a plurality of tangentially directed orifices, through which the fresh reactants are fed into the cylindrical chamber. The reaction effect of the reactants will cause the nozzle to rotate, and the application states that additional rotating means may be provided if desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">It is evident that the processes defined by claims 17, 18, and 19 are intimately related to the particular apparatus disclosed. That apparatus will inherently carry out the steps set forth in the appealed claims, and the application does not disclose any other use to which the apparatus may be put. Conversely, the application does not suggest any way in which the steps claimed can be carried out except by the use of the apparatus disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">It is well settled that a process which is the mer.e function of an apparatus is not patentable, and that a process which cannot be carried <em>out </em>apart <em>from </em>a particular apparatus is the mere function of that apparatus. See In re Weston, 17 App.D.C. 431; In re Ernst et al., 71 F.2d 169, 21 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1235, In re Wadman, 94 F.2d 993, 25 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 936, and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">Counsel for appellant argue that it would be possible to perform the claimed processes by means of apparatus other than that disclosed in appellant\u2019s application, or even by hand and, in their brief they suggest modified forms of apparatus which, they allege, could be used for this purpose. The fact that appellant\u2019s application did not mention hand operation and did not suggest any modified form of apparatus, indicates that the modifications in question had not been thought of at the time the application was filed or were not thought to have any substantial value. It is clear that it would be impracticable to carry out the processes of the appealed claims by hand, and, although we have carefully considered the modifications suggested by counsel for appellant, we are of opinion that it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>not been disclosed that the claimed processes could be satisfactorily carried out by any apparatus differing substantially from that disclosed in appellant\u2019s application. It follows that the appealed claims are drawn to the mere function of the apparatus disclosed in appellant\u2019s application and were properly rejected for the reason stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Counsel for appellant contend that the processes claimed here involve chemical action and, therefore, cannot be merely the function of the apparatus. We disagree with that argument. See In re Charles P. Watson, 44 F.2d 868, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 712, 715, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Although the reaction involved may be a chemical one, the reaction is not distinguishable from the function of the machine disclosed in appellant\u2019s application, even though that machine, if used in some other manner, might function differently. In their request for reconsideration by the Board of Appeals, counsel for appellant said: \u201cThere was not, then, and is not now, any attempt on the part of the applicant to cover any other process for which the apparatus disclosed in the drawings could be used. Such apparatus might conceivably be used for mixing liquid fuel and air, the softening of water, the preparation of esters, the manufacture of soaps, or any one of numerous other chemical processes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">By reason of illness, O\u2019CONNELL, Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
