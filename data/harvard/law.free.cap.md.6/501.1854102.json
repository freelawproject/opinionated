Plea <em>non cut.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\"><em>Exception. </em>On the 1st of April 1850, a party became tenant of the plaintiff of a house and lot, at the annual rent of $560, payable quarterly, and continued such up to the time of this suit. On the 1st of August 1851, a <em>fi. fa. </em>upon a judgment against the tenant, was issued and delivered to the sheriff, who soon after levied it upon the tenant\u2019s household furniture found in the house aforesaid. The property was advertised and sold by the sheriff on the premises, early in October following, and the whole nett proceeds of sale paid over to the plaintiff in said judgment. At the time of this levy one quarter\u2019s rent accruing from the first of April to the first of July 1851, was due, an account for which was made out and left with the sheriff. It was further proved that after the levy and before the sale, the landlord\u2019s agent called upon the sheriff and stated the amount of the claim for rent, and the sheriff told him to make out the account, and the agent afterwards saw the sheriff\u2019s deputy who promised to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>amount of rent claimed. Another witness proved that sometime before the sale, in the presence of the deputy sheriff, the tenant, and the landlord\u2019s agent, it was understood that the rent claimed should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale, and the deputy sheriff so promised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">The defendant then proved that the landlord was not present at the sale, though he knew when it occured, and never, so far as the witnesses know, objected to it; that the goods were bought by a purchaser who afterwards deeded them in trust for the tenant\u2019s wife, and that none of said goods were ever removed by the sheriff or any other person from the house, either before or after the sale, and that they are still in said house, which the tenant still occupies under the original agreement for rent as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">The defendant then asked of the court four instructions to the jury; the first three were in substance, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, unless the jury find that the goods levied upon and sold by the sheriff, were in part or in whole removed from off the premises by the sheriff or his officer : the <em>fourth </em>is fully stated in the opinion of this court. The court below, (Marshall, J.,) rejected these instructions, except the fourth, which was granted with the modification stated in the opinion of this court. \u201cTo which instructions\u201d (as the record states,) the defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him for the whole amount of rent due, he appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

Because, the goods though sold by the sheriff were not removed, and he is therefore not responsible in this form of action, under the statute of <em>8th Anne, ch. </em>14. 46 <em>Eng. C. L.

The modification annexed to this prayer by the court, was clearly erroneous, because it submits the subject of <em>waiver, </em>which is a <em>question of law, </em>to the jury. 2 <em>Saund. on Pl., </em>303. <em>Chitty on </em>Bills, 174. 4 H. &amp; <em>J., </em>538, <em>Beck vs. Thompson. </em>1 <em>Md.

Shaaff Stockett </em>4' <em>Thomas S. Alexander </em>for the appellee, argued.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">1st. The only question open on this appeal, under the exception as taken, is the propriety of the modification by the court to the defendant\u2019s <em>fourth </em>prayer. This modification simply leaves it to the jury to find whether the plaintiff regarded the notice he gave the sheriff of his claim for rent, as a waiver of his rights. This it was clearly competent for the jury to find, and this modification, therefore, caused no injury to the defendant, and the judgment should not be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-7\">2nd. There is no reported case in this State, in which this question under the <em>statute of Anne </em>has been decided. The sheriff is not bound to find out that there is rent due, but the landlord must give him notice. This was done in this case, and the sheriff having proceeded to sell without paying the rent, after he had due notice of the claim, has made himself liable under the statute. 58 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>233, <em>Cocker vs. Musgrove. </em>3 <em>Taunt., </em>400, <em>Smith vs. Russell. </em>There was nothing in the notice which we gave of our claim, which can be regarded as a <em>waiver </em>of our rights under the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">3rd. The promise of the sheriff to pay the rent out of the proceeds of sale, and the absence of objection to the sale by the landlord, did not debar him of his right of action under the statute, for at no time after the seizure of the goods by the sheriff, they being thereby <em>in custodia legis, </em>could he have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>enforced his claim for rent by <em>distress. </em>6 <em>Eng.

Rep., </em>24, was a suit like the present against a sheriff, under the statute of 8 <em>Anne, ch. </em>14, <em>sec. </em>1, for taking in execution the goods and chattels of a tenant to the plaintiff without payibg the rent due on the lease. There the sheriff received regular notice from an agent of the plaintiff that a year\u2019s rent was due; but the same agent took from the sheriff\u2019s bailiff and auctioneer a written agreement or undertaking in these words: \u201cWe undertake to pay Mr. Rotherey one twelve-months\u2019 rent for the premises occupied by Mr. Clarkson if so much rent appears to be due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The goods were then sold with the consent of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, but the rent was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Lord Ellenborough held, the plaintiff bad waived the benefit of the statute, and that no <em>tort </em>hud been committed by the sheriff in taking the goods in execution without first paying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>rent, as it was done with the consent of the plaintiff. And although some doubt seems to have been intimated whether the written undertaking expressed on its face a sufficient consideration to render it available as a contract, it was considered to be a clear justification <em>to the </em>sheriff, whether valid or invalid as a contract. And the opinion concludes by saying, \u201cIn future, it will be better for landlords to have their rent before they suffer their tenants\u2019 goods to be sold in execution; but if they will give trust, they cannot afterwards resort to an action on this statute against the sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">According to the decision in that case, if the jury believed the present plaintiff consented to the sale under the circumstances stated in the prayer, it operated in law as a waiver of his right t,o sue under the statute. And to render such waiver available to the defence, it was not necessary the jury should be required to believe, that in point of fact the plaintiff had actually waived the right so to sue. Submitting such ail enquiry to them was therefore erroneous. Instead of tending to enlighten the jury, the proviso or qualification was well calculated to embarrass and mislead them, by requiring them not only to find the facts submitted in the prayer, but also that the plaintiff had <em>actually </em>waived his rights. Granting the prayer, with the qualification, was a virtual rejection of it as presented, and equivalent to saying to the jury, although they might believe every thing submitted therein to be true, yet such belief could avail nothing to the defendant unless they should also find it to be true, in fact, that the plaintiff had waived his rights under the statute and relied upon the promise of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In regard to what may or may not render a sheriff liable to a landlord for rent under the statute, see <em>Smith vs. Russell, </em>3 <em>Taunt., </em>401. <em>White vs. Binstead &amp; Prebble, </em>20 <em>Eng.
