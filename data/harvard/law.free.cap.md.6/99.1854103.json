And if hereafter any stockholder in this company, shall neglect or refuse to renew his notes as above directed, he shall forfeit all his interest in the said corporation, and his share or shares shall be disposed of by the president and directors as aforesaid, but the money which they shall receive from the sale of such share or shares or parts of shares, actually paid for by such delinquent, shall be repaid by them to him, his executors, administrators or assigns; but he shall nevertheless remain liable for the proportion of any loss which may arise, from risks taken antecedent to said refusal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">The other facts of the case sufficiently appear from the opinion of this poprt.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

By his refusal to renew, the appellant ceased to be a stockholder, and is therefore not responsible for liabilities incurred by the company, after the 4th of December 1826, the date of his refusal, the second section of the charter not giving the company the power, at option, to forfeit the shares, but making the refusal to renew of itself a cessation of the character of stockholder, and the only remedy against such stockholders as refused to renew is the forfeiture and sale prescribed by the charter. The language of the section is imperative, \u201che <em>shall </em>forfeit all his interest,\u201d and <em>\u201cshall </em>cease to be a member,\u201d &amp;e., and his share <em>\u201cshall </em>be disposed of,\u201d &amp;c. Upon refusal the company were bound to <em>sell </em>his stock, and if they did not do this they forfeited their charter, 1 <em>Wheat., </em>328, <em>Martin vs. Hunter. </em>Where one act gives an option by using the words \u201cmay or shall,\u201d and another omits this and says \u201cshall,\u201d the latter must be regarded as a <em>mandate </em>and not a <em>power. </em>As illustrating this view, see the acts of 1801, ch. 23, sec. 12; 1801, ch. 45, sec. 2; 1808, ch. Ill, sec. 9; 1830, ch. 149, sec. 2; 1835, ch. 65, sec. 3; 1838, ch. 267, sec. 8. For the general rule for construing such a charter, see <em>Angel and Ames on Corps., </em>494, 495. Charters have been construed in the following cases. 21 <em>Wend., </em>273, <em>Herkimer Manf. Co., vs. Small. </em>12 <em>Conn., </em>499, <em>Hartf. and New Haven Rail Road Co., vs. Kennedy. </em>6 <em>Mass., </em>40, <em>Andover Corp., vs. Gould. </em>1 <em>Binney, </em>70, <em>Del. and Schuyl. Canal, vs. Sansom. </em>2 <em>Bibb., </em>576, <em>Instone vs. Frankfort Bridge Co. </em>3 <em>Hawks., </em>520, <em>Tar River Nav. Co., vs. Neal. </em>4 <em>Randolph, </em>578, <em>Grays vs. Turnpike Co. </em>9 <em>Johns., </em>217, <em>Goshen Turnpike Co., vs. Hurtin. 8 Mass., </em>138, <em>New Bedford Corp., vs. Adams. </em>14 <em>Do., </em>286, <em>Franklin Glass Co., vs. White. </em>1 <em>Caines Rep., </em>381, <em>Union Turnpike Co., vs. Jenkins. </em>But in none of them are the words like those in the present case, containing a <em>mandate </em>and not an <em>option. </em>They may all be divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>into two classes, <em>first, </em>where an <em>option </em>is given by the charter, and <em>secondly, </em>where the stock is <em>forfeited </em>to the company. I insist therefore that there can be no recovery on this note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">2nd. But if the company have a cumulative remedy on the note, it is only upon the liabilities attaching upon it at the date of the refusal to renew. His liability is <em>expressly </em>restricted to antecedent risks, and this is an exclusion of a conclusion that he is liable for any subsequent risks. In this view the accounts in the case show, that too much has been allowed, by the judgment below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-6\"><em>Charles F. Mayer </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">This is an attempt on the part of the appellant, to get rid of his solemn obligations by his own wrong, his own wilful neglect to comply with the requirements of the charter of the company of which he was a member. The legislature had special reference to the <em>security of the creditors </em>of this insurance company, in all the provisions of its charter. Each stockholder is required to renew his notes every year. It is an injunction upon him to renew, and if he fails he is declared a defaulter, a delinquent. The language of the second section clearly shows that the remedy was <em>alternative, </em>for he is required to pay until the time of refusal. The stock cannot be' transferred except upon two good endorsers, and only to such persons as shall <em>apply </em>for it. If therefore the stock was worth nothing, the company would, upon the construction placed upon this section by the other side, have no security, nothing\u2019with which to pay their obligations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">The uniform construction of the word <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>is, that it implies a power and not a mandate. It means, in reference to. the object of this act, <em>\u201cmay,\u201d </em>just as <em>\u201cmay,\u201d </em>sometimes, is construed <em>\u201cmust.\u201d </em>In the case of <em>Hall vs. The United States Ins. Co., </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>499, a provision quite as peremptory as this was decided to he a mere power. In 1 <em>Binney, </em>70, the words were, \u201cmay and <em>shall </em>be sold,\u201d and yet the court say it was a mere discretionary power. See also 5 <em>Alabama, </em>799, <em>Selma Rail Road Co., vs. Tipton. </em>1 <em>Caine\u2019s Rep., </em>382, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Union Turnpike Co., vs. Jenkins. </em>9 <em>Johns., </em>217, <em>Goshen Turnpike Co., vs. Hurtin. </em>14 <em>Do., </em>238, <em>Dutchess Cotton Manf. vs. Davis. </em>2 <em>Comstock, </em>330, <em>Small vs. Herkimer Manf. Co. </em>And same case in 2 <em>Hill., </em>127. 22 <em>Wend., </em>277, 296, <em>Russell vs. Jackson. </em>2 <em>Barbour, </em>294, <em>Mann vs. Currie. </em>5 <em>Mass., </em>80, <em>Worcester Turnpike, vs. Willard. </em>4 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>135, <em>Mackubin vs. Whetcroft. </em>6 <em>Hill., </em>507, <em>Hinsdale vs. White. </em>The failure to renew would be the subject of a suit; how then can such refusal destroy the contract and the notes?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">But by the statement of facts upon which the case was tried, the only question is, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover at all? And if it is, the judgment must be affirmed, for the statement fixes and ascertains of itself the amount of the recovery. Now the second section of this charter says, the party shall be liable up to the date of the refusal, and the accounts show that the appellant had at <em>that time </em>incurred liability for antecedent risks. According to the strict construction of this agreement, therefore the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-7\">Le Grand, C. <em>J.,</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ale\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This case comes before us on a case stated. It is agreed that if the court should be of the opinion that the appellee is entitled to recover, that the judgment shall be entered up for a sum specified. This deprives us of the power to assess any other damages. The question then is: \u2014 Is the appellee entitled to recover ? We think it is, and we found this opinion on the express language of the 2nd sec. of the act of 1813, cb. 55, which after providing for the forfeiture of the' stock of a delinquent stockholder, goes on to declare,, that notwithstanding such forfeiture, he shall, <em>\u201cneverthelessr remaint liable for the proportion of any loss which may arise from risks taken antecedent to said </em>refusal,\u201d on his part, to-comply with his obligation-. It is clear from the account of the auditor that a loss had occurred, and the case stated- fixes the' amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">It was argued by the counsel, that there was-a duty imposed on the company to offer the stock for sale, and then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>adjust the account between the <em>company </em>and the appellant. We do not think the charter can be so interpreted. It provides that the stock when forfeited shall be transferred to any person applying for it; but it does not appear that any application was made for this stock of the appellant, and being utterly worthless, we suppose any effort to dispose of it would have proved unproductive of any benefit to the appellant.-</p>\n<p id=\"AGN\">We affirm the judgment.-</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
