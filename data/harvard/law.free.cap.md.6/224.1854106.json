Mitchell, died in August 1837, and his widow, the tenant for life under the will, died in 1841. Henry S. Mitchell hada- female child living at the death of the testator, but his- eldest male child was not born until March 1838, whieh child is now living.- The plaintiff is the sole heir at law of the testator, being his sister of the whole blood, and the land\u2019having been devised to the testator by his father, Francis J. Mitchell. Upon these facts\u00bb the plaintiff offered the following prayer :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">\u201cThat under the-will of James D. Mitchell no'title to the Myrtle Grove estate therein named can be set up in the eldest male heir of the body of Henry S. Mitchell, if the- jury find that the said Henry S. Mitchell was alive at the death of Elizabeth A. Mitchell, who is named in said will; and if they further find that the eldest male child of said Henry S. Mitchell was not born in the lifetime of said testator. But in such case, the title to Myrtle Grove, as devised in and by said will to the eldest male heir of Henry <em>S'. </em>Mitchell, lapsed and failed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">This prayer the court (William Matthews, Special Judge) granted, and instructed the jury as so prayed. To this ruling the defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">In the case in 2 <em>GUI, 230, </em>where a bill was filed on the 16th of February 1838, by Sarah E. Mitchell, the plaintiff in the present case, for the sale of Myrtle Grove lor the pay? ment of a legacy charged upon it by her father, Francis J. Mitchell, the Court of Appeals dismissed the bill, because, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>their opinion, the land had, under the proper construction of the above clause in the will of James D. Mitchell, descended <em>to </em>said Sarah E. Mitchell, the complainant in that case.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The cause was argued before Le .Grand, C.

The instruction, in the terms in which it is <em>given, is </em>clearly erroneous, for it construes the remainder as <em>contingent </em>upon the birth of the eldest male heir of the body of Henry S. Mitchell in the <em>lifetime </em>of the testator. Even, therefore, if the eldest male child had been <em>very heir </em>at the death of Elizabeth A. Mitchell, the tenant; for life, according to the law as announced by the prayer, the remainder could not vest, unless such heir had been born in the lifetime of the testator; whereas all the authorities show, that the remainder must vest only <em>eo insianti </em>the determination of the <em>particular estate. </em>This was so decided in the case in' 2 <em>Gill, </em>239, where this very will was construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-8\">2nd. The instruction is erroneous in announcing as the meaning of the will, that the remainder was contingent on the death of Henry S. Mitchell, in the lifetime of the tenant for life. The words <em>\u201celdest male heir of the body,\u201d </em>mean ail the same as <em>\u201celdest male child of the body.\u201d </em>The <em>word heir </em>was not used in its technical but in its popular sense. There are certain general rules by which courts are to be guided in construing wills. 1st. Unless the devise contravenes some public policy or positive rule of law, the intention of the testator must prevail: it is the law of the case. 1 <em>Plowden, </em>170. 2nd. Courts will be astute in discovering the intention, and in carrying it into effect. 9 <em>Gill </em>437, <em>Chelton vs. Henderson. </em>3rd. The court will look to all the surrounding circumstances, for the purpose of determining the object and the subject of the testator\u2019s bounty. 5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>304, <em>Walston vs. White. </em>It follows from this that each will must be construed <em>by itself, </em>must depend upon the peculiar circumstances attending it. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Wash. Va. Rep., </em>56, <em>Shelton vs. Shelton. </em>4 <em>Russell, </em>532, <em>Pycroft vs. Gregory. </em>In this case the land had regularly descended to the testator, through the eldest male heir of his ancestors, and he was desirous to transmit it in the same line, He had himself no children: his brother Henry was married at the date of the will, and his wife had already one child, a daughter, and at the death of the testator was <em>enciente. </em>The appellee, Sarah, the testator\u2019s heir at law, was older than Henry. She had evinced a desire to enter a nunnery, so that there was no prospect of male issue from her. He gives to her an annuity for her natural life and <em>no longer, </em>which is made a <em>charge </em>on this very estate, which, it is said, has now descended to her. Is not all this inconsistent with the idea, that the testator designed her to have this land? But besides this, there was a devise of <em>persona.I estate </em>in this very clause of the will, which plainly shows that he was not using words in their strict technical sense. The word <em>heir, </em>will be construed to mean <em>child, </em>when it is clear that he or they w\u2019ere to be the <em>stirps </em>of a new succession. 3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>544, <em>Ware vs. Richardson. </em>10 <em>B. Monroe, </em>57, <em>Prescott vs. Prescott. Ibid., </em>106, <em>Jarvis vs. Quigley. </em>12 <em>Do., </em>655, <em>Moore vs. Moore. </em>The word <em>\u201cissue\u201d </em>is, in England, in accordance with the policy there to favor descents, construed a word of limitation, but here the intention prevails and .controls the construction of the word. 9 <em>Gill, </em>436. But suppose the words are used in their technical sense : what is the technical sense of, \u201cthe eldest male heir of the body,\u201d in this State, since the passage of the acts abolishing entails? All the heirs now constitute but one heir; in England it means something but here it canppt mean any thing in a technical sense. But even in England, in modern times, this strict rule of <em>nemo est heres vivends </em>is sought to be avoided, and if it were <em>res integra, </em>would not Jiav,e been adopted. . The general leaning of the courts now is against enforcing it. 2 <em>Wm. Bl., </em>1010, <em>Goodright vs</em>. <em>White, </em>which clearly overrules <em>Archer\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Coke, </em>66. But we have cases in England in this very point construing words almost precisely similar to these. 1 <em>Peere Wms., </em>229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Darbison vs. Beaumont. </em>12 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>393, <em>Right vs. Creber. </em>1 <em>Lib. of Law </em>&amp; <em>Eq., </em>226. 9 <em>Clark &amp; Finnelly, </em>606 to 715, <em>Winter vs. Perratt.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">3rd. The question is not concluded by the case of <em>Mitchell vs. </em>Mitchell, 2 <em>Gill, </em>230. The will was there construed only <em>incidentally. </em>The words quoted by Judge Archer in that case and construed by the court, are not the words of the will. The words there used are, \u201cthe first male heir of his brother Henry,\u201d whereas the words of the will are, \u201cthe eldest male heir of the body of my brother.\u201d The distinction is obvious: for an uncle or a nephew may be first male heir, whereas none but a child can be eldest male heir <em>of the body. </em>But that case was decided upon different facts, and between different parties. The bill there sought to charge the land, and that was the main point argued: the court were not unanimous in their decision, and two of the judges deciding the case sat also in the case of <em>Chelton vs. Henderson, </em>where the strict technical meaning of such words in a will was repudiated. But suppose the ease is <em>res adjudicata, </em>the decision is not binding unless it settles the right between the parties, and would operate as an estoppel. 4 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>345, <em>Shafer vs. Stonebraker. </em>No judgment was there passed which in its nature could be pleaded to this action. The parties were different, the present appellant being a party there only in his character of administrator <em>d. b. n., </em>of the personal estate of James D. Mitchell. Again, the rights of the <em>infant </em>son of Henry S. Mitchell are involved in this proceeding, but he is not a party here nor was he in the former case. But the courts sometimes overrule their own decisions. See 5 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>133, <em>Steiger vs. Hillen, </em>and 8 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>55, <em>Sellman vs. Bowen. </em>They sometimes change their opinions. 4 <em>Gill, </em>128, <em>McCall vs. Hinkley. </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>447, <em>Albert &amp; wife, vs. Winn </em>&amp; <em>Ross. </em>And 8 <em>Gill, </em>472, <em>Kettlewell vs. Stewart. See </em>also on this point 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>165, <em>Hammond vs. Inloes, </em>and 1 <em>Gill, </em>1, <em>Stevenson vs. Reigart, </em>where the case of <em>Stevenson vs. Schriver, </em>9 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>324, was disregarded. 3 <em>G. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>&amp; J., </em>397, <em>Green vs. Johnson, </em>overruling <em>Grant vs. Bell, 4 H. </em>&amp; <em>McH., </em>419.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-5\"><em>Robert J. Brent </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-6\">The second branch of the first proviso in the instruction granted by the court, viz : \u201cif they further find that the eldest male child of said Henry S. Mitchell was not born in the lifetime of said testator,\u201d does not operate to the prejudice of the appellant, because the prayer would have been granted without it. It is merely a <em>further restriction </em>upon <em>our right </em>to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-7\">In the case in 2 <em>Gill, </em>235, where the same will was construed upon the same state of facts and between the same parties, the Court of Appeals decided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-8\">1st. That the words \u201celdest male heir,\u201d were used by the testator in their technical legal sense, and not signifying \u201cheir apparent,\u201d or child, could' not be gratified until the death of Henry S. Mitchell, leaving such male heir, for <em>\u201cnemo est heres </em>viventis.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-9\">2nd. That the Myrtle Grove estate was devised to Elizabeth A. Mitchell, the widow, for life, with a contingent remainder to such person as, at her death, might be the <em>\u201celdest </em>male heir of the body of Henry S. Mitchell.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-10\">3rd. That this contingent remainder must vest at or before the expiration of the particular life estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-11\">4th. That Henry S. Mitchell surviving Elizabeth A. Mitchell, there could be no heir of his body to take at that date, and therefore the contingent remainder lapsed and failed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-12\">We cannot suppose that after so elaborate a decision between the same parties and on the same clause of the same will, this court will suffer this adjudicated question to be reopened. As this case involves no great principles of public law requiring re-examination and review, but is a simple question of the construction of a particular will, it would be an alarming precedent to allow the former decision of this court on this same will and between the same parties to be even questioned, much less reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The parties were the same; beeause the eldest male child of the appellant in whose' right the present ejectment is defended, was directly a party to the former suit, and the appellant was himself a party as administrator, and actually carried on the defence in that case as in this, in the name and right of his child. Therefore,, if the child of the appellant would be concluded by the former adjudication, so would any one who afterwards in his name, or for his benefit, sets up the adjudicated and condemned title of that child. But this court has by its decision put this question at rest. In <em>Milburn vs. The </em>State, 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>13, a majority of the court would have ruled the point differently, but for a previous decision of the Court of Appeals, which they considered obligatory, although made in a cause between other parties. In <em>Hammond vs. Inloes, </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>164, the court reviewed very elaborately its former decisions on the eonclusiveness of former adjudications, and declared, \u201cthat if a court respects its own decisions in analogous cases, there would seem to be more reason for adhering to them where the facts are the same, though between different parties.\u201d See also 1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>324, <em>Thomas vs. Doub. Ibid., </em>395, <em>Young vs. Frost. </em>5 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>268, <em>Hammond vs. Ridgely. </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>488, <em>Alexander vs. Worthington. </em>We dismiss this part of case by referring to the language of Judge Earl, as quoted in 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>164: \u201cIf an exposition is given to a will or deed, fully defining the rights of the parties, &amp;c., it should be deemed irrevocable, and never again touched where the same persons, &amp;c., are concerned in the same contestation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-5\">But if this court will tolerate an argument on the merits of the title formerly tried between these parties and judicially condemned, we can do but little more than adopt the learned and able argument of this court, as delivered by Judge Archer, in 2 <em>Gill, </em>235. We shall, however, refer to a few additional authorities to support, if need be, the solemn judgment of this court. That the word \u201cheir,\u201d or \u201cheir of the body, \u201din deeds or wills, standing alone, has a technical and well defined legal sense, and denotes the person upon whom the la wat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the ancestor\u2019s death casts the inheritance, and to give it any other sense it must be qualified by something in the context showing that it was used in a different sense, so as to denote \u201cheir apparent,\u201d \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cissue,\u201d &amp;e., is well established by authorities. 1 <em>Fearne, </em>209, <em>sec. 6, and note. 2 Jarman on Wills, </em>1. In <em>Buck vs. Nurton, </em>1 <em>Bos. </em>&amp; <em>Pul., </em>57, Chief Justice Eyre says: \u201cEvery testator ought to be supposed to ' take legal words in a legal sense, unless, according to the marginal note in <em>Hobart, </em>there be demonstration plain of an intent to use them in a different sense.\u201d In <em>Hodgson vs. Ambrose, Dougl., </em>337, Buller, Justice, says: \u201cIf a testator makes use of legal phrases, or technical words only, the court are bound to understand them in a legal sense; they have no right or power to say that the testator did not understand the meaning of the words he has- used-, or to put a construction on- them- different from what has been long received, or what is affixed to them by law.\u201d See also <em>Archer\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Coke, </em>66. But this very case was settled as far back as the case of <em>Challoner vs. Bowyer, </em>2 <em>Leon, </em>70. In that case the testator devised- his lands to his younger son in tail, and for want of issu-e, \u201cto the heirs of the body of his eldest son.\u201d The younger son died without issue, living the elder son, whose issue was the tenant in the assize, (defending the case;) the court held, that there- could be no heir of the body of the eldest son while he survived, and that there was no distinction between a will and a grant in respect to the meaning of the words heirs of the body. This is our identical- case in principle, and almost in facts, for the younger son had an- estate tail to support- the contingent remainder to \u201cthe h'eirs of the body of the elder,\u201d and it was held, that when the estate tail failed- the remainder was gone, because the elder son- could have \u201cno heir of his body\u201d while he survived, though he had issue living and claiming the land. That case was even stronger than this, for the limitation over to the testator\u2019s daughters was in default of \u201cissue of- the eldest son,\u201d thus indicating an intention that the issue of the eldest son should take, but the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d required technical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>legal heirs. See also 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>13, and 9 <em>Clark &amp; Finnelly, </em>694.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-4\">Mason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We do not deem it important to pass any opinion upon the peculiar structure of the appellee\u2019s prayer, by which this case is presented, a question so forcibly argued by the opposite counsel. Whatever may be the supposed defects of this prayer, a reversal of the judgment, with a view to their correction, would not ultimately vary the substantial merits of the controversy, which rests upon facts, few, simple and undisputed, and which, in our judgment, could not be materially altered or added to,- by any subsequent proceedings which might be had in the case, short of the introduction of testimony intended to assail the validity of the will itself; and vve do not understand the appellant as contending for any such object. This is not a case where extrinsic evidence would be admitted to explain the meaning or intention of the testator. Extrinsic evidence is only admissible to explain latent ambiguities in testamentary or other instruments of writing, and such we understand to have been the case of <em>Walston vs. White, </em>5 <em>Md. </em>Rep., 297, relied upon in argument by the appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The present record discloses a question- of title dependent upon the interpretation of the language used by the testator in his will, considered with reference to the condition of the several parties who claim under it, and we must proceed to give that interpretation. At this point we are met by the counsel for the appellee with a decision of the former Court of Appeals, <em>(Mitchell vs. </em>Mitchell, 2 <em>Gill, </em>230,) in regard to this <em>identical will, </em>in connection with the same state of facts now before us, and it is insisted that the former decision'has settled the law of the case, and that we are concluded by it. The <em>conclusiveness </em>of that decision is the controlling, and indeed the only question involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">A decision by the Court of Appeals must be regarded as binding- and final in- all subsequent litigation- between' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>same parties, and upon the same subject matter of controversy: and if an exposition of a will has been made, by which the title to property has been settled, that exposition should be deemed irrevocable as between the same parties and those claiming under them'. These principles are distinctly affirmed by the case of <em>Hammond's Lessee vs. Inloes, </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>138.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">On the other hand it is urged that the present parties, the form of action and the questions submitted, are not the same with those of the former appeal. This may be in part true, yet it cannot be denied that the Court of Appeals, on the former appeal, has given an interpretation to this will, and has passed upon and settled the rights under it, of one at least, of the parties to this record; and if we were now, as to other parties, to give it a different construction, it would lead to the anomalous condition of things' of different persons having different and conflicting rights and interests under the same will. Such conflict, confusion and injustice- should not be sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The plaintiff in this suit is certainly so far bound by the former decision, as to be forever precluded from enforcing her annuity as a charge upon this real estate. Her right to do so was the <em>precise question </em>presented and decided on the former appeal, and the court said the annuity could not be enforced because the land itself under the will belonged to the plaintiff, and that the claim to the annuity was merged in the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">If we were now to give an opposite construction to this-will, and vest the title in another, it must readily be seen that the- appellee would lose both land and annuity. For such a result the-appellant\u2019s counsel even would not <em>directly </em>contend,, yet it is manifest that to adopt their views, we- would either' be bound to arrive at such a result, or we- would be compelled to reverse a decision of the- former Court of Appeals-, not for any mistake or error, as respects the facts of the case-, but for mere <em>error of judgment. </em>We are not prepared for either alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">However much we might be disposed to adopt and sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tion the views of the appellant\u2019s counsel, so ably enforced in tbe course of their argument as general principles of law, still we feel constrained to regard ourselves as concluded by the interpretation given to this will by the Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Mitchell vs. Mitchell, 2 Gill, </em>230; and while we might consider ourselves at liberty to disregard that decision as a general rule of law for the future interpretation of wills and deeds, yet we must regard it as final and conclusive upon the will now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\n<em>Judgment oj/irmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
