Mitchell, executrix of James D. Mitchell, and after her death contained against the appellant, as administrator <em>d. b. n. c. t. a, </em>of said James D. Mitchell, upon a bond for $2000, executed by David Williamson, Jr., as principal, and said James D.

Upon the 4th and 6th issues were joined.

Mitchell was only surety in the bond for David Williamson, Jr., the principal obligor, who died on the 1st of January 1839; that his executrix had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>in her hands sufficient assets to ha-ve paid the bond and all other debts of her testator; that in pursuance of the order of the orphans court she inserted an advertisement in two newspapers, and for the time specified in said order, notifying .all creditors of said David Williamson, Jr., to present their claims, with the vouchers thereof, on or before the 1st of October 1839, to said executrix, otherwise they might be excluded bylaw; that the plaintiffs had notice of all which premises, yet they neglected to present their said claim by the time limited in said order and notice; that after the institution of this suit, viz., on the 19th of October 1844, the said executrix passed her final account, by which she paid away and distributed all the assets without any notice of this obligation, and no further assets have been or are likely to be received by her; that the plaintiffs, by reason thereof, and of their voluntary and wilful laches and default, have released and discharged the real and personal estate of said David Williaipson, Jr. . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">The verdict and judgment .were in favor of the plaintifls, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C.

Brent </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">The <em>third </em>plea, we maintain, was a legally sufficient bar to the action. It distinctly shows :^-lst. That Adolphus, on\u00e9 of the plaintiffs, duly released all his interest in the judgment which the bond was made to secure. 2nd. That Juliana, another of the plaintiffs, duly released all her right and interest in the debt due by the principal obligor to the plaintiffs. These two having released under seal are estopped from now claiming an interest by this suit. 4 <em>Gill, </em>191, <em>Lloyd vs. Burgess. </em>If one plaintiff has released he ought not to be joined in the suit. 1 <em>Wheat. Selw., </em>472, <em>Debt, Release. </em>7 <em>Wheeler's Am. Com. Law, </em>517, <em>Principal &amp; Surety. </em>And so if the bond is due the obligees, <em>qua </em>executors, for the release of one executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>discharges the debt. 2 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>226, <em>Watkins vs. The </em>State, <em>use of Shaw. Ibid., </em>97, <em>Allender vs. Riston. </em>The release pleaded being to the principal obligor necessarily discharges the surety, and even if both were principals the release of one would discharge the other. 7 <em>Johns., </em>207, <em>Rowley vs. Stoddard. </em>13 <em>Do., </em>286, <em>Austin vs. Hall. </em>7 <em>Wheeler's Am.

Rep., </em>389, <em>Yates vs. Donaldson. </em>Again, the plea shows that not only did one of the plaintiffs release an interest in property conveyed by the principal debtor sufficient to have paid this debt, but also all his interest in the judgment which the bond was to secure. Now' the judgment was in itself a valuable security, and upon the payment of this bond by the surety he would have been entitled to an assignment of the judgment, and to any lien or benefit attached to it. That a release by the creditor of any security he may hold as .against the principal debtor will, <em>ipso facto, </em>discharge the security, is clearly established by the authorities. 8 <em>Pick., </em>129, <em>Baker vs. Briggs. </em>7 <em>Am. Com. Law, </em>470. The bond on its face shows that David Williamson, Jr., was principal, and therefore the averment in the plea to that effect is admissible jn law. 7 <em>Johns., </em>336, <em>People vs. Jansen. 6 G. &amp; J., </em>168, <em>State, use of Barber, vs. Hammond. </em>10 <em>Pet., </em>266, <em>Sprigg vs. Bank of Mt. Pleasant. </em>3 <em>Call., </em>268, <em>Ross vs. Overton.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-5\">The <em>fifth </em>plea presents the question, whether an action can he maintained against the surety without a previous demand on .the principal obligor.?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-6\">Assuming that the constructive release of the estate of the principal set up in the <em>seventh </em>plea is a valid defence, it will be observed that the distribution of assets by the executrix is shown to have been since the institution of the suit, but the omission .to aver it to have been since the last continuance is not demurable. 4 <em>J. J. Marshall, </em>223, <em>McGowan vs. Hoy. </em>Then as to the substance of the plea; the act of 1798, ch. 101, sub-ch. 8, sec. 15, protects the distribution of assets when made under legal notice to creditors, and when the executrix had no actual notice .of the claim in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The act of 1823, ch. 131, declares what alone shall amount to notice of a creditor\u2019s claim. See also the act of 1826, ch. 178. Such a release of the estate of the principal debtor, though it arises from laches and neglect alone, is equivalent in law to an affirmative or express release. 13 <em>Seargt. &amp; </em>Rawle, 157, <em>Lichtenthaler vs. Thompson. </em>9 <em>Verm., </em>143, <em>McCollum vs. Hinckley. </em>1 <em>Penn. Rep., 241, Finney vs. Allen. </em>It was held by the Supreme Court that the laches of the creditor would discharge his judgment. 7 <em>Pet., </em>578, 670, <em>Ex-parte Watkins. </em>The obligation of the surety ceases when the principal is discharged by the act of the creditor. 1 <em>Law Lib., </em>3, 6. The plaintiffs could have sued the executrix of David Williamson at law by virtue of the act of 1811, ch. 161, sec. 1. There being sufficient of his personal estate, it follows that his real estate could not be charged by the creditor. 4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>295, <em>Wyse vs. Smith.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">We rely especially on the <em>ninth </em>plea as a complete answer to this action. We are at a loss to conceive on what ground this plea can be assailed, as it shows that two of the executors being legatees, entitled to shares of this debt, and all debts and costs of administration being satisfied, released their. shares of this debt, and the balance not released was paid and satisfied before suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-6\"><em>John M. S. Causin </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">The <em>third </em>plea so much relied on now was expressly adjudicated on the former appeal, and the court there say, that our error was in joining issue instead of demurring. 9 <em>Gill, </em>73. The release by Adolphus and Juliana is <em>as representatives </em>and not as executors. The plea shows this because it connects itself with the release. But apart from this, the plea shows that they did not release as executors, because it states that Adolphus releases only <em>one-ninth, </em>whereas as executor his interest was one-third. So also the release of Juliana is as distributee and not as executrix. The plea does not allege that the release wrns as executors. A release to be a bar must be a technical release, especially where one attempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to release for another. 4 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>480, <em>Coomes vs. Clements. </em>A plea bad in part is bad for the whole. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>134, <em>Karthaus vs. Owings. </em>Nothing less than the release of the whole debt will bar the action. 4 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>309, 310, <em>Geiser vs. Kershner. </em>4 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>480, <em>Coomes vs. Clements. </em>22 <em>Pick., </em>308, <em>Shaw vs. Pratt. </em>7 Johns., 209, <em>Rowley vs. Stoddard. </em>This plea is also defective, because it seeks to inquire into the consideration upon which the bond was given, which cannot be done at law. 9 G. &amp; <em>J., </em>342, <em>Key vs. Knott.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">As to the <em>fifth </em>plea, we say forbearance to sue, on demand from the principal, does not exonerate the security. 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>281, <em>Somerville vs. Marbury. </em>2 G. <em>&amp; J., </em>234, <em>Planters Bank vs. Sellman. </em>6 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 247, <em>Sasscer vs. Young.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">The cases cited under the <em>fifth </em>plea settle the point raised by the <em>seventh, </em>that laches as to one of two obligors never discharges the right against the other. The cases all show that mere non-feasance will not discharge a surety, but to do this, there must be something done by the obligee changing the nature of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">The <em>ninth </em>plea is the same as the third: it is no release of the debt sued upon, and is liable to the objection stated in the opinion of Judge Chambers in the former case, in 9 <em>Gill, </em>77.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-8\">Le Grand, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlW\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">This is an action of debt brought by the appellees as executors of David Williamson, Sen\u2019r, ag-ainst Elizabeth A. Mitchell, executrix of James D. Mitchell, and continued after her death against the appellant, Henry S. Mitchell, as administrator <em>de bonis non cum testamento annexo. </em>The cause of action was a penal bond, dated 17th of August 1833, conditioned for the payment by David Williamson, Jr. \u2014 the principal obligor \u2014 at any time within two years from the date thereof, to George, Juliana and Adolphus Williamson, executors of David Williamson, Sen\u2019r, of the sum of two thousand dollars Without interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">To the right of recovery of the plaintiffs- nine pleas- were interposed. To the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8tb and 9th of which,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>there were <em>demurrers; </em>and on the 4th and 6th issue was taken. The 2nd and 8th pleas have been abandoned. The questions now before us are presented by the demurrers to the others, and we concur with the court below in its ruling in regard to each and all of them except the ninth;</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The 3rd plea is substantially as follows: It avers that the bond was executed by Mitchell as surety for Williamson, to secure the payment of a judgment obtained against him in Harford county court;-that Adolphus Williamson released all his interest in the <em>judgment; </em>and that David Williamson con- , veyed- to the plaintiffs all his interest in a large tract of land, lying in the State of Louisiana, for the purpose of securing the payment of the <em>judgment; </em>and also, that Juliana Williamson- one of the plaintiff\u2019s, by her writing of release, sealed, &amp;c., \u201cdid release all her interest and right in the debt due by the said David to-the said plaintiffs <em>aforesaid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">So far as those portions of the plea which allude to the release of interest in the <em>judgment </em>are involved, we think it clear beyond all question, that they- cannot avail to defeat the recovery of the plaintiffs. This is an action on a bond conditioned for the payment of a certain and ascertained sum of money,, within a specified time, and it is not competent for the obligors, <em>in this action, </em>to go behind the bond for the purpose of showing what was its consideration. The only reply that can be successfully made to it is, <em>non est factum, </em>payment or release. Any equitable considerations affecting the transactions out of which it originated,, must be availed of in a court of equity. In regard to that part of the plea which declares, that Juliana-Williamson released \u201call her interest and right in the debt due by the said David to the said plaintiffs aforesaid,\u201d we remark, that it appears-to us-it must be understood as having, reference to- the history of the debt as given in the preceding, portions of the plea, and therefore, equally as applicable to the judgment as to the bond. There is no doubt that prior to the act of Assembly of 1843, ch. 304 \u2014 and that act does not affect this case \u2014 an executor might sell or raise money on the property of the deceased, or give a release for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>a debt due to the estate of his testator, nor where there was more than one executor, that any one of them could da the same; and, therefore, had the plea simply averred a release of the <em>debt: </em>that is, the <em>debt sued on </em>by Juliana Williamson, we should have held the plea as good in bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right of action. We do not, however, regard the plea as referring exclusively to the debt mentioned in the bond, but as including the judgment also. There are other objections to the plea, but it is not essential they should be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The 5th plea presents the question \u2014 whether an action can be maintained against the surety without a previous demand on the principal? The learned counsel for the appellant, although he did not abandon, still he did not press in argument, the sufficiency of this plea. The principle asserted py it has been denied by several decisions of the Court of Appeals. In the case of <em>Somerville vs. </em>Marbury, 7 <em>Gill &amp; </em>Johnson, 281, the court say: \u201cThe only remaining point presented for our consideration is, whether the discontinuance of the first suit, instituted on the bond, in which the complainant was a surety, exonerated him from all liability thereon. This question is so conclusively settled by the principles established by this court in the cases of the <em>Planters Bank of Prince Georges </em>County, <em>vs. Sellman, 2 Gill </em>&amp; <em>Johns., </em>230, and <em>Sasscer vs. Young &amp; Kemp, 6 Gill </em>&amp; <em>Johns., </em>243, that it should not be treated as a subject open to discussion' in the courts of equity in this State.\u201d These views were fully affirmed in <em>Lawson vs. Snyder, </em>1 <em>Maryland Rep., </em>79.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">What has been said in relation to the 5th is equally applicable to the 7th plea. It was competent to the surety to have paid the debt, and to have preferred his claim against the estate of David Williamson, Jr. His failure to do so cannot work his discharge; nor does the failure of the plaintiffs to make the demand enure to his advantage. <em>Lawson vs. Snyder, </em>1 <em>Md. Rep., </em>79, and the authorities there relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The ninth plea if defective, it is because of its uncertainty. It alleges that Adolphus exonerated David Williamson, Jr., from his share of the debt and judgment, and that Juliana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>released \u201cher respective share or proportion of the debt as aforesaid;\u201d that the plaintiffs, \u201cor <em>some of them,have </em>released and discharged'D\u2019. Williamson, Jr., of and from a large <em>part </em>of the sum specified in said condition aforesaid; and that \u201cas to the residue of said sum of money not released and discharged as aforesaid,\u201d'..-.. \u201cD. Williamson, Jr., fully paid and satisfied the same before the impetration of the writ.\u201d The uncertainty of the plea consists in the averment, that \u201cthe plaintiffs or <em>some' of them </em>have relieved and discharged the said David Williamson, Jr;, of and from the payment of ao large <em>part </em>of the sum,\u201d &amp;c. The words, \u201cor some of them,\u201d and, a \u201clarge part,\u201d are too uncertain and indefinite. They do not specify which of the plaintiffs, nor what particular part of the debt. But although we consider the plea defective, we nevertheless reverse <em>the ruling </em>of the court below. The defect could only be taken advantage of by <em>special, </em>and not by general demurrer,- as was attempted. 2 <em>Saunders on Pleading </em>&amp; <em>Evidence, </em>722, <em>(Ed. of </em>1829.) In 1 <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>236, <em>Ed. of </em>1851, it is said, that pleadings must not be insensible or repugnant, nor <em>ambiguous or </em>doubtful in meaning, nor argumentative, nor in the alternative. The same writer shows that the exactions of the rules of pleading in these particulars, have been somewhat relaxed by the new rules of William 4th. They,, however, have no operation in this State. The precise point was decided in this State, in the- case of <em>Gardiner vs. Miles, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>100.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
