A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A9a\">This is a highway collision case. Defendant appeals from an adverse judgment returned by the Judge of Essex County District -Court, -sitting -without a jury, for the stipulated dam-ages of $200 to plaintiff\u2019s auto-mo-bile, allegedly caused 'by negligence of defendant, Wilbur E. Twitty, operator of motor vehicle of defendant, Holiday Motors, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The issue is solely a factual -one, and for the purpose o-f this appeal the facts h-ave been stipulated. In these day-s of increasing motor traffic and the consequent risks incident thereto, this accident is not unusual, in that'it involved a collision between two automobiles at the intersection of two public thoroughfares, to wit: Park Avenue and_ Prospect Street, in the City of East Orange. There was -conflicting testimony on the question of negligence and contributory negligence. At the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants moved for a non-suit which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Defendants assert two grounds of appeal: (1) plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; and (2) that the court erred in refusing defendants\u2019 motion for non-suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Under the procedure in effect prior to September 15, 1948, findings of fact by a trial judge -in the District Court on conflicting evidence, were conclusive on appeal. <em>R. S. </em>2:32-202. Under present court <em>Rules </em>1 :2-20 and 4:2-6, the appellate court <em>may </em>review the facts and make an independent finding. <em>Rule </em>3:81-13. See also <em>DeMoors v. Atlantic Casualty Insurance Company of Newark, 1 N. J. Super, </em>1, 61 <em>Atl. (2d) </em>511 <em>(App. Div. </em>1948); <em>Tuzio v. Saylor, </em>1 <em>N. J. Super. </em>61 <em>(App. Div. 1948), </em>recently decided. There was, however, ample evidence in the record here to justify the trial judge\u2019s finding, and we see no justification for disturbing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Where, as here, the only basis for an appeal from an adverse judgment clearly appears to involve a controversial factual issue, we will not review the facts and make independent findings thereon, unless the interests of justice may so require.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
