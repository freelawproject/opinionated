A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A4Q\">Plaintiff brought suit for separate maintenance and defendant counterclaimed for divorce upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ground of desertion. After hearing a .judgment was entered dismissing the suit for -separate maintenance and granting the divorce. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The parties were married in 1917 and lived together until the latter part of 1944 when a controversy arose respecting financial matters which engendered ill feeling upon the part of the wife. It became -so intense that plaintiff refused to permit the defendant to sleep in the same room and thereafter he -slept in another room. This is -corroborated by the fact that thereafter a daughter slept in the same.bed with her mother. Without going into details, it suffices to say that the evidence supports the defendant\u2019s efforts to effect a reconciliation. Essentially the question is one of fact and to are clearly of the opinion that the plaintiff, enraged over the financial situation, -vented her spleen by a denial of -cohabitation. We concur in the finding of the court below that the defendant had established a -cause of action for desertion and that the maintenance action was properly di-smi-ssed since the plaintiff failed to show -that -the defendant separated from her and refused to maintain -and provide for her without justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
