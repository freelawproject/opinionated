A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A1WW\">The Monmouth County Orphans\u2019 Court admitted to probate as the will of Edward R. Heyer, deceased, a certain paper writing with, the exception of the fourth paragraph therein which the court found that the testator had revoked. The paragraph excepted from probate gave the residue of testator\u2019s estate to Clarence Ziegler and Ethel, his wife. They appeal from so much of the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court as denies probate to the residuary clause. The facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">On Saturday, February 1, 1947, shortly before noon, testator called on his attorney, Mr. Thomas P. Doremus, and told him that he wanted to cut the Zieglers from his will, and asked him to take care of it immediately. Mr. Doremus suggested that Mr. Heyer execute a new will but added that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>not draw it that day because his clerical force had already left the office. Testator insisted on the revocation, \u201cI want it done now; I want it done immediately.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind about another will yet. I don\u2019t know who I want to leave it to.\u201d The lawyer pressed his advice that another will be made, \u201cotherwise his relatives would get it,\u201d and testator replied, \u201cI will take care of that in the future.\u201d So Mr. Doremus, with pen, ran a line through each word of the fourth paragraph of the original will and then on the margin wrote: \u201cI hereby revoke the fourth paragraph of my last will and testament.\u201d Testator signed this statement on the margin and the attorney \u25a0and a Mr. McCue, who had been asked into 'the room for the purpose, signed as witnesses. Although Mr. Heyer lived until the next December, he did not execute a new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Appellants say that the law does not permit a testator to revoke the residuary clause of his will. We know of no such rule. \u201cThe law gives every citizen full dominion over his property. He may do with it whatever to him may seem fit, provided his disposition of it is made pursuant to legal methods and not in contravention of the law.\u201d <em>Creveling v. Fritts, </em>34 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>134, at 142 <em>(Ch. </em>1881). A man may dispose of part of his property by will and leave the balance to go in accordance with the statutes of descent and distribution in cases of intestacy. Any devise .or bequest in a will can be revoked by the cancellation of the same by the testator himself or by another person in his presence, by his direction and consent. <em>R. S. </em>3 :2-4; <em>In re Kirkpatrick, 22 N. J. Eq. 463 (Zabriskie, O., </em>1871); <em>Hilyard v. Wood, </em>71 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>214 <em>(Bergen, V. O., </em>1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Appellants next urge that the revocation of the fourth paragraph was conditional; that testator intended the revocation to be operative only if he should execute another will or a codicil disposing of his residuary estate. We cannot reconcile this theory with the proofs. The signed statement on the margin of 'the will, \u201cI hereby revoke the fourth paragraph of my last will and testament,\u201d is strong evidence of an unconditional intention to revoke. The undisputed testimony of the two witnesses who were present when the residuary clause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>cancelled, shows the same intention. Mr. Heyer intended the revocation to take effect that day, immediately, whether or-not he should make a new will at some future time. In accordance with his intention, the revocation was effectual. <em>In re Frothingham, </em>76 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>331 <em>(E. &amp; A. 1909); In re Allen, </em>88 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>291 (Learning, <em>V. O.), </em>affirmed 89 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>208 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1918). The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court will be affirmed with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
