In order for a 67-year-old man to collect benefits for \u201c 10 years \u201d, they would have to be paid\u2014contrary to the provision in Part Gr\u2014beyond his \u201c seventy-second birthday.\u201d However, this was a <em>group </em>insurance policy and the record establishes that the words \u201c 10 years \u201d were typed in on the cover of every policy issued to every member of the group. Reasonably read, the two clauses in question provide that the sickness benefits to which each member of the gr oup was entitled under the policy were limited to 10 years or until he reached the age of 72, whichever eventuated sooner. So read, the claim of ambiguity must fail. Nothing turns on the fact that the insured initially purchased his policy as a member of the group when he was 67, since it is clear from the record that the premium charged to each group policyholder was \u201cbased upon the member\u2019s age \u201d and there is no allegation or proof that the insured was defrauded.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order of the Civil Court of the City of New York granting summary judgment to the defendant should be reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b423-4\">Keating, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP4\">(dissenting). With respect to insurance policies, we have stated: \u201c They should be so plain and unambiguous that men of average intelligence who invest in these contracts may know and understand their meaning and import.\u201d <em>(Janneck </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>162 N. Y. 574, 578; see, also, <em>Hartol Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>290 N. Y. 44, quoting <em>Janneck, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The law is settled regarding the problems presented by this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\"><em>First: </em>The typewritten provision on the cover of the policy states that the limit for total sickness is 10 years. This statement is unequivocal. Its clear indication is that the 10-year limitation is the <em>only </em>time limitation on the benefits. There is an inconsistency between this typewritten provision stating <em>only one </em>limitation and the printed provision in Part Gr indicating that there are <em>two </em>limitations, viz., the additional 72-year-age limitation. The fact that the insured was a member of a group in no way affects, or, as the majority appears to imply, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>cures this obvious inconsistency. Where such an inconsistency exists, the law is clear that the typewritten provision prevails. (See, e.g., <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Taggart, </em>209 U. S. 385; <em>Heyn </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>192 N. Y. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Secondly: </em>At the very least, ambiguity exists between the two provisions. Nine Judges<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> have found them ambiguous and confusing. Certainly, then, these provisions could have confused a gentleman, unversed in the complex language of insurance contracts. We have pronounced that insurance policies \u2018 \u2018 should not be couched in language as to the construction of which lawyers and courts may honestly differ.\u201d <em>(Janneck </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>pp. 577-578.) Certainly this policy has presented and does present a construction problem. The United States Supreme Court has held that an insurance company \u201cmust accept the consequences resulting from the rule that the doubt for which <em>its own lack of clearness </em>was responsible must be resolved against it.\u201d <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hurni Co., </em>263 U. S. 167, 176, italics supplied; see, also, <em>Walters </em>v. <em>Great Amer. Ind. Co., </em>12 N Y 2d 967; <em>Hartol Prods. </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Since the policy is ambiguous, the ambiguity must and should be resolved against the insurer and not the insured. This rule is sound. An insurance company should not be permitted to have typed on the <em>cover </em>of an insurance policy an <em>unequivocal </em>provision stating only one time limitation on the insurance benefits, and then place a further limitation in the printed body of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Judges Van Voorhis, Burke, Sgileppi and Bergan concur with Chief Judge Fuld; Judge Keating dissents and votes to affirm in an opinion in which Judge Breitel concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Order of Appellate Division reversed and that of the Civil Court of the City of New York reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> Two Judges in the Appellate Term constituting a majority granted the plaintiff summary judgment on this policy. The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
