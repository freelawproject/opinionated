J.</author>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Union Carbide Corporation appeals from a judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs Bobbie Izell and Helen Izell (Plaintiffs) on claims for personal injuries and loss of consortium stemming from Mr. Izell\u2019s exposure to Union Carbide asbestos and subsequent diagnosis with mesothelioma. After a four-week trial the jury returned special verdicts finding Union Carbide 65 percent comparatively at fault for Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and awarding Plaintiffs $30 million in compensatory damages plus $18 million in punitive damages against Union Carbide. By remittitur, which Plaintiffs accepted, the trial court reduced the compensatory damages award to $6 million, but declined to disturb the punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">On appeal, Union Carbide contends the evidence was insufficient to support the liability finding, apportionment of comparative fault, and the remitted compensatory damages award. Union Carbide also challenges the punitive damages award as excessive. We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, as well as the compensatory and punitive damages awards. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Union Carbide purchased an asbestos mine near Coalinga, California, in 1963. Until 1985, Union Carbide supplied asbestos to companies that manufactured and marketed products for the construction industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Mr. Izell owned a construction business that built approximately 200 homes in Southern California from 1964 until 1994. Mr. Izell did not work as a laborer or supervisor on these projects, but he regularly visited and walked through the construction jobsites. All the homes were constructed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>drywall interiors. Mr. Izell\u2019s workers applied various brands of premixed joint compound to cover nailheads, fill the seams between drywall boards, and fill corner sections of drywall. Once the joint compound dried, the workers sanded it one to three times, usually with sandpaper on a long pole, then by hand. Mr. Izell often was present when his workers sanded the joint compound. He described the resulting dust as a \u201clittle fog in the air.\u201d He also recalled breathing dust that was disturbed when his workers swept the excess joint compound from the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Mr. Izell\u2019s workers also used gun plastic cement to apply stucco to the homes\u2019 exteriors. Mr. Izell was present when his workers tore open bags of gun plastic cement, and he breathed the dust from those products as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Mr. Izell recalled seeing four different brands of joint compound on his jobsites and two brands of gun plastic cement. Of the joint compound brands, Mr. Izell believed Georgia Pacific was the most common brand because it was the \u201cdominate seller in those days,\u201d followed by Hamilton Red Dot, Kaiser Gypsum, and Kelly-Moore\u2019s Paco brand. Mr. Izell also saw his workers use Riverside and Colton gun plastic cement. At varying times from 1970 to 1978, Union Carbide supplied asbestos to each of the four joint compound manufacturers and to Riverside for use in its gun plastic cement.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In July 2011, at the age of 85, Mr. Izell was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Initially, Plaintiffs sued more than 20 defendants who were allegedly responsible for the asbestos-containing products to which he claimed he was exposed. By trial, only five defendants remained, including Union Carbide, one joint compound manufacturer (Kaiser Gypsum), one stucco manufacturer (La Habra) and two gun plastic cement manufacturers (Colton and Riverside).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">After hearing percipient witness and expert medical and scientific testimony, the jury returned a special verdict finding all defendants liable on all theories of strict product liability and negligence. The jury awarded Plaintiffs a total of $30 million in compensatory damages, consisting of $5 million in past and $10 million in future noneconomic damages to Mr. Izell and $5 million in past and $10 million in future loss of consortium damages to Mrs. Izell.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The special verdict form also asked the jury to apportion comparative fault among the defendants, Mr. Izell, and six other entities, consisting of three joint compound manufacturers (Georgia Pacific, Hamilton, and Kelly-Moore), two asbestos suppliers (Carey Canadian and Johns-Manville), and an unnamed asbestos-cement pipe manufacturer. The jury apportioned 95 percent of the fault to the five defendants, assigning 65 percent to Union Carbide, 20 percent to Kaiser Gypsum, and a total of 10 percent to the three stucco and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>gun plastic cement manufacturers. The jury allocated the remaining 5 percent to the nondefendant joint compound manufacturers and asbestos suppliers, finding each responsible for a 1 percent share of the comparative fault. No fault was apportioned to Mr. Izell or the asbestos-cement pipe manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The jury also found Union Carbide and Kaiser Gypsum acted with \u201cmalice, oppression or fraud.\u201d Kaiser Gypsum settled before the jury was asked to decide the amount of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">For the punitive damages phase, Union Carbide stipulated that it had a present net worth of $4.2 billion. The court instructed the jury that it should consider a variety of factors in deciding the amount, if any, of punitive damages to award, including a \u201creasonable relationship between the amount of punitive damages\u201d and the harm to Mr. Izell. The jury also was instructed that it could consider evidence of harm caused to others for purposes of assessing reprehensibility, but not for purposes of \u201cpunishing the defendant directly for harm caused to others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In his argument to the jury, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel commented there was probably no amount of money that could deter Union Carbide, given its $4.2 billion net worth. Thus, counsel suggested the jury award something in the range of $8.6 million ($100,000 for each year of Mr. Izell\u2019s life) and $18 million ($1 million for each year Union Carbide sold asbestos after it knew its product caused cancer). The jury returned a verdict awarding Plaintiffs $18 million in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Union Carbide moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and a new trial on all issues, including punitive damages. The trial court denied the JNOV motion, but conditionally granted a new trial \u201con the ground of excessive compensatory damages only,\u201d unless Plaintiffs consented to a remittitur reducing the compensatory damages award from $30 million to $6 million. The court declined to disturb the punitive damages award, concluding Union Carbide\u2019s stipulated $4.2 billion net worth and the evidence concerning the reprehensibility of its conduct supported the amount of the award, notwithstanding the substantial reduction in compensatory damages. Plaintiffs accepted the remittitur and the court entered judgment against Union Carbide.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">1. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Jury\u2019s Causation Finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">\u201cIn the context of a cause of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first establish some threshold <em>exposure </em>to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>defective asbestos-containing products, <em>and </em>must further establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a \u2018legal cause\u2019 of his injury, i.e., a <em>substantial factor </em>in bringing about the injury. . . . [T]he plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s or decedent\u2019s <em>risk </em>of developing cancer.\u201d <em>(Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982-983 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 941 P.2d 1203], fn. omitted <em>(Rutherford).) </em>We review a jury\u2019s causation finding for substantial evidence. <em>(Jones v. John Crane, Inc. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 990, 997-999 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Union Carbide contends the jury necessarily speculated in finding Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos and that the exposure contributed to his risk of developing mesothelioma. We conclude the evidence of causation was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">a. <em>Substantial evidence supports the finding that Mr. Izell was exposed to asbestos supplied by Union Carbide</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\u201cA threshold issue in asbestos litigation is exposure to the defendant\u2019s product.\u201d <em>(McGonnell </em>v. <em>Kaiser Gypsum Co. </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 23] <em>(McGonnell); </em>see <em>Rutherford, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 982.) It is axiomatic that, \u201c[i]f there has been no exposure, there is no causation.\u201d <em>(McGonnell, </em>at p. 1103.) Further, \u201c[t]he mere \u2018possibility\u2019 of exposure\u201d is insufficient to establish causation. <em>(Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 108 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229]; see <em>Dumin v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 650, 654-656 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 702] <em>(Dumin).) </em>\u201c[P]roof that raises mere speculation, suspicion, surmise, guess or conjecture is not enough to sustain [the plaintiff\u2019s] burden\u201d of persuasion, <em>(Ulwelling v. Crown Coach Corp. </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 96, 104-105 [23 Cal.Rptr. 631].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">In <em>McGonnell, </em>the court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendant, concluding the plaintiffs\u2019 limited circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish more than the mere possibility that the decedent had been exposed to the defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing joint compound. In opposing summary judgment, the plaintiffs in <em>McGonnell </em>offered \u201cinvoices showing the sale of [the defendant\u2019s] joint compound to a contractor in 1972,\u201d which indicated the materials were purchased for a project at the decedent\u2019s workplace. <em>(McGonnell, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1105.) Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>on this evidence, the <em>McGonnell </em>court acknowledged it was \u201cat least within the realm of possibility\u201d that the decedent \u201cencountered a wall with [the defendant\u2019s] [asbestos-containing] joint compound during his 24 years of employment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, the court held this possibility alone was insufficient to create a triable issue of fact, because a finding of exposure would necessarily require \u201cspeculation that at some time [the decedent] might have cut into a wall that might have contained [the defendant\u2019s] joint compound that might have contained asbestos.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>McGonnell </em>court concluded the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, \u201ccreate[d] only \u2018a dwindling stream of probabilities that narrow into conjecture,\u2019 \u201d and thus summary judgment was properly granted. <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>Dumin, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 656 [affirming directed verdict where defendant\u2019s product \u201cwas only one of many asbestos insulation products used at the shipyard,\u201d such that a conclusion that plaintiff was exposed to defendant\u2019s product \u201cwould require a stream of conjecture and surmise\u201d]; <em>Whitmire v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. </em>(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1094 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 371] [evidence that defendant specified asbestos insulation at plant in the 1950\u2019s was insufficient to create triable issue where plaintiffs submitted no evidence that \u201cthe asbestos-containing materials installed in the early 1950\u2019s were more likely than not still present when [decedent] was employed there\u201d in 1961].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Union Carbide contends the evidence in this case, as in <em>McGonnell, </em>established only the mere possibility that Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos at some unspecified time during the 20-year period in question. In support of this contention, Union Carbide cites evidence indicating there were multiple asbestos suppliers for the joint compound and gun plastic cement products that Mr. Izell remembers encountering at his jobsites. Thus, while Union Carbide concedes it supplied asbestos that could have been in one or all of these products, it argues the jury necessarily speculated in concluding Mr. Izell was more likely than not exposed to Union Carbide asbestos, as opposed to asbestos from one of the other suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">As we shall explain, though we agree the evidence allowed only speculation with respect to the products manufactured by Kelly-Moore, Georgia Pacific, Kaiser Gypsum and Riverside, with respect to the Hamilton joint compound, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">(i) <em>Kelly-Moore</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">At trial, Plaintiffs presented a collection of invoices showing Union Carbide supplied Kelly-Moore\u2019s San Carlos, California, plant with several hundred thousand pounds of raw asbestos from 1971 to 1976. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>uncontradicted evidence established that Kelly-Moore had multiple asbestos suppliers during this time period, of which Union Carbide was only a minor supplier. Specifically, a former Kelly-Moore employee offered undisputed testimony that Union Carbide supplied only 8 percent of the asbestos Kelly-Moore purchased for its Paco Textures division \u2014 the division that manufactured the company\u2019s asbestos-containing products \u2014 while Carey Canadian supplied 72 percent and Johns-Manville supplied 20 percent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Because the invoices show Union Carbide supplied asbestos to Kelly-Moore\u2019s San Carlos, California, plant, Plaintiffs argue a reasonable inference, beyond speculation, can be drawn that joint compound containing Union Carbide asbestos made its way to one of the Southern California jobsites where Mr. Izell inhaled dust from a Kelly-Moore product. We disagree. In view of the uncontested evidence that Kelly-Moore had multiple asbestos suppliers during the relevant time period, the fact that Union Carbide supplied asbestos to a plant in California does not remove the issue from the realm of speculation. As Union Carbide points out, Plaintiffs failed to show what percentage of the asbestos supplied to Kelly-Moore\u2019s San Carlos plant came from Union Carbide, as opposed to some other supplier, let alone that Kelly-Moore\u2019s Paco Textures division had other plants outside of San Carlos, California. Moreover, even if supplying Kelly-Moore\u2019s San Carlos plant enhanced the possibility that Union Carbide asbestos made its way to one of Mr. Izell\u2019s jobsites, this still leaves speculation about whether Mr. Izell was present when his workers sanded joint compound that might have contained Union Carbide asbestos, as opposed to asbestos from one of Kelly-Moore\u2019s other suppliers. <em>(McGonnell, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">(ii) <em>Georgia Pacific</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Mr. Izell testified that he inhaled dust from Georgia Pacific Ready-Mix joint compound on jobsites in Southern California during the mid to late 1970\u2019s. He identified the Georgia Pacific joint compound as \u201ca pasty thing\u201d\u2014 i.e., the premixed compound \u2014 that came in five-gallon buckets weighing 62.5 pounds. Plaintiffs contend the jury could have reasonably inferred that Mr. Izell was more likely than not exposed to Union Carbide asbestos from Georgia Pacific joint compound because the evidence showed that <em>all </em>Ready-Mix manufactured at Georgia Pacific\u2019s Acme, Texas, plant between September 1971 and May 1977 contained Union Carbide asbestos. This assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>would have merit if the joint compound from the Texas plant had been the only premixed product that Georgia Pacific sold in California under the Ready-Mix brand during the relevant time period. The undisputed evidence established it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Because Ready-Mix was \u201c33 percent water\u201d and \u201cthe freight on the water would make it uncompetitive\u201d for Georgia Pacific to ship the product from Texas to California, the undisputed evidence showed that from 1968 to 1971, Georgia Pacific had a \u201cformal rebranding agreement in which a Paco [(Kelly-Moore)] facility in California made . . . joint compounds and cements at their facility and put them in Georgia Pacific containers.\u201d After the rebranding agreement expired in'1971, Georgia Pacific\u2019s \u201cindividual distribution centers\u201d in California were allowed to \u201cpurchase [rebranded Ready-Mix] from anybody they wanted,\u201d including Kelly-Moore. According to the uncontested testimony of a former Georgia Pacific employee, the reason for this distribution arrangement was the same as had motivated the former rebranding agreement \u2014 Georgia Pacific \u201ccouldn\u2019t get the product economically to California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Plaintiffs argue the evidence was in conflict as to whether Ready-Mix joint compound from Georgia Pacific\u2019s Texas plant made its way to the Southern California market. They stress that, on appeal, this conflict must be resolved in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, even if we assume a genuine conflict exists, when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence still required the jury to speculate as to whether Mr. Izell might have inhaled dust from Ready-Mix joint compound manufactured at Georgia Pacific\u2019s Texas plant (where Union Carbide asbestos was used), or Kelly-Moore\u2019s California facility (where asbestos from multiple suppliers was used), or some other joint compound manufacturer that contracted with one of Georgia Pacific\u2019s individual distribution centers during the period. Absent a minimum evidentiary showing that Ready-Mix joint compound manufactured at Georgia Pacific\u2019s Texas plant was used on one of Mr. Izell\u2019s jobsites, the jury could only speculate as to whether Mr. Izell inhaled dust containing Union Carbide asbestos. (See <em>Dumin, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>(iii) <em>Kaiser Gypsum and Riverside</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">For the reasons already discussed with respect to Kelly-Moore and Georgia Pacific, we also conclude the evidence was insufficient to support anything more than speculation that Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos from Kaiser Gypsum joint compound or Riverside gun plastic cement.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">With respect to Kaiser Gypsum, the undisputed evidence showed that Kaiser Gypsum purchased asbestos from \u201cmany different suppliers,\u201d of which Carey Canadian and Johns-Manville were the two largest. As they did with Kelly-Moore, Plaintiffs offered Union Carbide invoices showing that it supplied several hundred thousand pounds of raw asbestos to a Kaiser Gypsum plant in Southern California between 1970 and 1975 \u2014 part of the period during which Mr. Izell testified he inhaled dust from Kaiser Gypsum joint compound. Plaintiffs, however, failed to offer evidence establishing that Union Carbide was the exclusive asbestos supplier for this plant, let alone evidence showing that joint compound from this plant found its way to one of Mr. Izell\u2019s jobsites.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The evidence was even more speculative with respect to Riverside gun plastic cement. The parties stipulated that Union Carbide was a minority supplier to Riverside during only one year \u2014 1978\u2014and Mr. Izell testified he saw workers dump Riverside gun plastic cement into a mixer in the \u201clate \u201970s.\u201d Even if we accept as a reasonable inference from this testimony that Mr. Izell inhaled dust from Riverside gun plastic cement in 1978, there still is no evidence establishing this dust contained asbestos from Riverside\u2019s \u201cminority supplier\u201d \u2014 Union Carbide \u2014 as opposed to any of its larger suppliers. Any finding of exposure based on this evidence would have been speculative. <em>(Dumin, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.4th at p. 656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">(iv) <em>Hamilton</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">In contrast to the foregoing, the evidence adduced with respect to Hamilton supported a reasonable inference that Union Carbide was Hamilton\u2019s exclusive asbestos supplier during the time period when Mr. Izell inhaled dust from Hamilton Red Dot joint compound. Hamilton\u2019s president, Willis Hamilton, testified that, from the 1960\u2019s through 1977, all of Hamilton\u2019s taping and embedding joint compound contained asbestos. Mr. Hamilton also affirmed that, during this same period, the asbestos used to make Hamilton\u2019s joint compound was <em>\u201call </em>Union Carbide.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>As for exposure, Mr. Izell testified that, apart from Georgia Pacific, which was the dominant joint compound seller at that time, he most frequently encountered \u201cHamilton Red Dot\u201d joint compound on his jobsites. Hamilton described its Red Dot product as an \u201c \u2018All Purpose Joint System.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Izell testified that his workers used the joint compound to fill in seams between sections of drywall, cover nailheads, and fill in corner sections. When the joint compound dried, the workers sanded it, dispersing a \u201cfog\u201d of dust into the air. Mr. Izell testified that he inhaled dust from Hamilton Red Dot joint compound during the mid-to-late 1970\u2019s. Coupled with Mr. Hamilton\u2019s testimony, this evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that Mr. Izell more likely than not inhaled Union Carbide asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Union Carbide argues Mr. Hamilton\u2019s \u201cmemory was too faulty\u201d to credit his testimony that Union Carbide was ever Hamilton\u2019s exclusive asbestos supplier. In support of the contention, Union Carbide cites its own records as evidence that it did not start selling asbestos to Hamilton until <em>1974, </em>which it argues undisputedly refutes Mr. Hamilton\u2019s testimony that his company used \u201call Union Carbide\u201d asbestos in its \u201cjoint taping compound <em>from the 1960\u2019s through [the] 1970\u2019s.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Union Carbide also points out that when Mr. Hamilton was asked about these records, he conceded he could not recall when Hamilton started purchasing asbestos from Union Carbide.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Though the foregoing discrepancies suggest that Mr. Hamilton\u2019s memory was not perfect, Union Carbide\u2019s objection concerns only his credibility and the weight of his testimony \u2014 not the sufficiency of the evidence. (See <em>Wright v. Best </em>(1942) 19 Cal.2d 368, 379-380 [121 P.2d 702] [\u201cinconsistencies\u201d evidencing \u201ca faulty memory ... do not go to the admissibility or sufficiency of the evidence, but rather to the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses, matters wholly within the exclusive province of the trier of fact, whose determination upon them will not be disturbed by an appellate court\u201d].) While the jury could have entirely disregarded Mr. Hamilton\u2019s testimony based on these inconsistencies, it also could have reasonably inferred that he was confused about the start date, but correct in his recollection that Union Carbide became his company\u2019s exclusive supplier once it started selling asbestos to Hamilton.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Union Carbide also contends it is speculative whether Mr. Izell ever inhaled asbestos from a Hamilton product, because the evidence showed that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>in addition to its asbestos-containing joint compound, Hamilton also sold a drywall topping compound that did not contain asbestos. The record does not support this contention. Though there was evidence of Hamilton\u2019s asbestos-free topping compound, there was no evidence that it ever was used on any of Mr. Izell\u2019s jobsites. Mr. Izell\u2019s testimony exclusively concerned Hamilton\u2019s Red Dot all-purpose joint compound, which his workers used to fill in seams, cover nailheads, and fill corner sections of drywall \u2014 functions that cannot be performed with a topping compound due to its lower adhesive content<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Izell never mentioned Hamilton\u2019s topping compound, and Union Carbide made no attempt to elicit this testimony from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos when he inhaled dust from Hamilton Red Dot joint compound.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">b. <em>Substantial evidence supports the finding that Union Carbide\u2019s asbestos was a substantial factor in increasing Mr. Izell\u2019s risk of developing mesothelioma</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In addition to establishing \u201csome threshold <em>exposure </em>to the defendant\u2019s defective asbestos-containing products,\u201d a plaintiff in an asbestos-related cancer case \u201cmust further establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a \u2018legal cause\u2019 of his injury, i.e., a <em>substantial </em>factor in bringing about the injury.\u201d <em>(Rutherford, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 982.) However, \u201cgiven the long latency period of asbestos-related disease, and the occupational settings that commonly exposed the worker to multiple forms and brands of asbestos products with varying degrees of toxicity,\u201d our Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff \u201cneed <em>not </em>prove with medical exactitude that fibers from a particular defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing products were those, or among those, that actually began the cellular process of malignancy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 957-958.) Rather, a \u201cplaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to defendant\u2019s product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff\u2019s or decedent\u2019s <em>risk </em>of developing cancer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 982-983.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">As our Supreme Court explained in <em>Rutherford, </em>\u201c[t]he substantial factor standard is a relatively broad one, requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical.\u201d <em>(Rutherford, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number><em>supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 978.) Thus, \u201c[a] plaintiff who suffers from an asbestos-related cancer and has proven exposure to inhalable asbestos fibers from several products will not, generally speaking, face insuperable difficulties in convincing a jury that a particular one of these product exposures, or several of them, were substantial factors in creating the risk of asbestos disease or latent injury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Under <em>Rutherford, </em>a plaintiff is free to \u201cestablish that his particular asbestos disease is cumulative in nature, with many separate exposures each having constituted a \u2018substantial factor\u2019 [citation] that contributed to his risk of injury,\u201d and \u201ca defendant cannot escape <em>liability </em>simply because it cannot be determined with medical exactitude the precise contribution that exposure to fibers from defendant\u2019s products made to plaintiff\u2019s ultimate contraction of asbestos-related disease . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 958.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Union Carbide contends Plaintiffs\u2019 medical evidence was inadequate to establish legal causation under the <em>Rutherford </em>test. In particular, Union Carbide emphasizes the following testimony by Plaintiffs\u2019 medical expert, Dr. Eugene Mark, which it claims improperly conflates a threshold showing of exposure with proof of legal causation:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Question: \u201cIf [Mr. Izell] was exposed to asbestos supplied by Union Carbide that went into some of these various asbestos-containing joint compounds, would the Union Carbide asbestos . . . have been a contributing cause of his mesothelioma as well?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Answer: \u201cAll of the asbestos together contributes to cause mesothelioma. The asbestos fibers don\u2019t come into the body labeled Union Carbide. They come in as asbestos fibers with certain physical, chemical, and biological principles. And those asbestos fibers, all of them together in total, contributed to cause this disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Union Carbide asserts the foregoing testimony cannot be squared with <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>two-step causation test. Under Dr. Mark\u2019s approach, Union Carbide argues, \u201cit is only the first step \u2014 proof of exposure \u2014 that matters, because every exposure contributes to the overall increase in risk\u201d; thus, \u201c[t]he second step would be wholly unnecessary, since proof of exposure automatically equates with proof that the exposure constituted a \u2018substantial factor.\u2019 \u201d This argument does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">To begin, the purported fallacy Union Carbide claims \u2014 that the \u201csecond step [of the <em>Rutherford </em>test] would be wholly unnecessary\u201d under Dr. Mark\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>approach \u2014 disregards the fact that Dr. Mark\u2019s expert medical testimony <em>is </em>the evidence that satisfies <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>second step. In other words, proof of exposure establishes legal causation only if the jury accepts Dr. Mark\u2019s expert medical testimony that all exposures constitute a substantial factor contributing to the risk of developing mesothelioma. This is not inconsistent with <em>Rutherford\u2019s </em>two-step causation test. Nothing in <em>Rutherford </em>precludes a plaintiff from establishing legal causation through opinion testimony by a competent medical expert to the effect that every exposure to respirable asbestos contributes to the risk of developing mesothelioma. On the contrary, <em>Rutherford </em>acknowledges the scientific debate between the \u201cevery exposure\u201d and \u201cinsignificant exposure\u201d camps, and recognizes that the conflict is one for the jury to resolve. (See <em>Rutherford, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 984, 985 [discussing jury\u2019s resolution of conflict between defense expert opinion that \u201ca very light or brief exposure could be considered \u2018insignificant or at least nearly so\u2019 \u201d in assessing increased risk of cancer and plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s contrary opinion that \u201ceach exposure, even a relatively small one, contributed to the occupational \u2018dose\u2019 and hence to the risk of cancer\u201d; noting jury \u201crejected defendant\u2019s argument that such a small contribution should be considered insubstantial\u201d].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In any event, Union Carbide\u2019s argument ignores the distinction Dr. Mark drew between significant exposures that contributed to Mr. Izell\u2019s risk of contracting the disease and \u201ctrivial exposures\u201d that would not have been substantial factors increasing his risk. In particular, Dr. Mark testified that asbestos fibers had to be \u201crespirable and put into the air\u201d and Mr. Izell needed to have \u201cbreathed it in\u201d for the exposure to constitute a \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d toward his mesothelioma. In contrast, Dr. Mark testified that if Mr. Izell had been exposed to asbestos in a \u201cwet slurry\u201d this would be a \u201ctrivial exposure, and I would not be able to say that that was a contributing factor.\u201d Contrary to Union Carbide\u2019s characterization, Dr. Mark did not opine that every exposure constituted a substantial factor. Rather, he testified that only those exposures in which the asbestos-containing product was \u201cdry enough so that asbestos fibers could be released into the air,\u201d and the asbestos became \u201cairborne\u201d and Mr. Izell \u201cbreathed it in\u201d would be significant enough to contribute to his risk of contracting cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">As discussed above, Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Mr. Izell was exposed to Union Carbide asbestos contained in Hamilton Red Dot joint compound. Mr. Izell testified that he not only saw his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>workers apply Hamilton Red Dot in its wet form, but he also watched them sand the dried product, and inhaled the resulting dust when it became airborne. Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, this evidence, coupled with Dr. Mark\u2019s expert testimony, is sufficient to establish in reasonable medical probability that exposure to Union Carbide asbestos was a substantial factor contributing to Mr. Izell\u2019s risk of contracting mesothelioma. (See <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Amcord, Inc. </em>(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 659, 676 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 90] [testimony regarding \u201cdust which would become airborne and settle on [the plaintiff\u2019s] face\u201d and expert testimony \u201csuggesting that if an individual is exposed to many different asbestos-containing products, each of those products would contribute to an increased risk of asbestos-related disease, as long as the asbestos was inhaled and retained in the worker\u2019s body\u201d held sufficient to establish legal causation under <em>Rutherford].)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">\n<em>2.

As a result, all presumptions are in favor of the decision of the trial court [citation]. The power of the appellate court differs materially from that of the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>passing on this question.

Accordingly, we quote the trial court\u2019s decision in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">\u201cBobbie Izell, age 86 at the time of trial, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in July of 2011, approximately 11 months before the trial. He and his wife Helen had been married for 65 years, and were living comfortably in retirement near family. Bobbie Izell, who had a successful career in building and selling homes, was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a fatal lung disease, during a doctor visit for an unrelated ailment. He had liters of fluid drained from his lungs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">\u201cMr. Izell was not terribly expressive about the effect of his diagnosis and disease at the time of trial. Much of the evidence concerning the effect of the disease came from Mrs. Izell. From their combined testimony, there was evidence that Mr. Izell became very depressed after the diagnosis, and went through a \u2018real bad spell.\u2019 Mrs. Izell had to work all the time to lift his spirits. She described how Mr. Izell would try to hide his feelings from the outside world; however, she knew him well enough to see the pain he was feeling inside. Mrs. Izell testified that Mr. Izell had experienced grief, anxiety, and emotional problems since his diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>\u201cPhysically, Mr. Izell became increasingly reliant on a walker. At the time of trial, Mr. Izell walked with a cane with much difficulty. At times Mr. Izell would fall if he did not have something for support, and one time fell onto a barbed wire fence. His energy level was low. He would go back to bed after breakfast, wake up in time for lunch, and go back to bed. He had difficulty speaking at times, with his voice \u2018giving way.\u2019 Mr. and Mrs. Izell could not do the things they used to do before the diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\">\u201cThere was testimony regarding the expected course of the disease from Dr. Eugene Mark, a medical doctor and professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School. He described how the disease will inevitably spread into the chest and cover the lung. It will grow into the lung and chest wall. The severe pain will require pain medication. [Mr. Izell] will lose his appetite and weight, experience depression, and pass away. He could expect to live another 2 to 3 years. Mrs. Izell, of course, would experience his demise right along with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">\u201cDefendants rightly point out countervailing evidence concerning damages. Mr. Izell\u2019s hospital visit was due to a fall on a nail, not from any symptoms related to the disease. Mr. Izell had other infirmities as well as his lung disease. He had arthritis in his joints, and had had falls before his diagnosis, and had used a walker in the past. He had kidney problems, gout, and hypertension. He was able to participate in activities that did not require a great deal of physical efforts, such as gardening and watching television. These were all factors for the jury to consider in determining damages for both Mr. and Mrs. Izell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cBased on this evidence, the award of damages for past noneconomic losses of $5,000,000 and future noneconomic losses of $10,000,000 each was clearly excessive. This does not mean, however, that the evidence did not support a significant award. For a man of Mr. Izell\u2019s age, his normal life expectancy would have been an additional 5 years. At the time of trial his life expectancy was 2 to 3 years. The jury was charged with the responsibility of determining the effects on Mr. and Mrs. Izell of living with what is, in essence, a death sentence, with an inevitable painful demise. The jury had the opportunity to hear and evaluate the testimony, and to determine the consequences of the disease. Based on the evidence, and reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom, the Court finds that an . award of past noneconomic damages in the sum of $1,000,000 and future noneconomic damages of $2,000,000, as to each plaintiff, is fair and reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In its briefs, Union Carbide largely ignores our presumption of correctness by downplaying the evidence that supports the trial court\u2019s findings, while highlighting the \u201ccountervailing\u201d evidence the court thoughtfully considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>in significantly reducing the jury\u2019s award. For instance, Union Carbide acknowledges \u201cPlaintiffs are right that . . . Mr. Izell had fluid drained from his lungs,\u201d but emphasizes \u201che had no chemotherapy or surgery.\u201d It continues, \u201cPlaintiffs are also right that Mr. Izell testified that his voice was sometimes weaker and he used his walker more after his diagnosis,\u201d but stresses \u201cit is also undisputed that Mr. Izell was 85 when diagnosed and suffering from a number of unrelated infirmities, . . . which had already caused him to use a walker.\u201d With respect to Mrs. Izell\u2019s loss of consortium damages, Union Carbide contends \u201c[t]here was no evidence in her scant 10-pages worth of testimony to suggest that Mrs. Izell had suffered physical or emotional injuries as a result of her husband\u2019s diagnosis,\u201d noting \u201c[s]he testified that her husband still helped around the house and showed affection for her after his diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">The trial court\u2019s statement of decision adequately resolves the conflicting evidence Union Carbide seeks to relitigate on appeal, and the court\u2019s thorough discussion of the evidence and witnesses\u2019 demeanor fully dispels any suggestion that Mr. and Mrs. Izell have not suffered significant physical and emotional anguish since learning of Mr. Izell\u2019s cancer. Though we recognize the remitted amount remains on the high end of noneconomic damages awards discussed in reported mesothelioma decisions \u2014 particularly for plaintiffs of the Izells\u2019 advanced ages \u2014 this alone is not sufficient to second-guess the trial judge, who presided over the four-week trial and personally observed \u201cthe injury and the impairment that has resulted.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Seffert, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at pp. 506-507; see <em>Daggett v.

[Citation.]\u201d <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 418.) The defendant\u2019s financial condition also is a permissible consideration under the due process clause in determining the amount of punitive damages necessary to further the state\u2019s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence. <em>(Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1159, 1185-1186 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 379, 113 P.3d 63] <em>(Simon).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On appeal, we defer to findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence, and we independently assess each of the three guideposts to determine de nova whether the punitive damages award is excessive under the due process clause. <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 418; <em>Cooper Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 424, 436 [149 L.Ed.2d 674, 121 S.Ct. 1678]; <em>Simon, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1172 &amp; fn. 2.) The reviewing court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional mission is only to find a level higher than which an award <em>may not </em>go; it is not to find the \u2018right\u2019 level in the court\u2019s own view. While we must. . . assess independently the wrongfulness of a defendant\u2019s conduct, our determination of a maximum award should allow some leeway for the possibility of reasonable differences in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>weighing of culpability. In enforcing federal due process limits, an appellate court does not sit as a replacement for the jury but only as a check on arbitrary awards.\u201d <em>(Simon, </em>at p. 1188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">a. <em>The reduction in the compensatory award did not mandate retrial of punitive damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Before examining the <em>State Farm </em>guideposts, we first will address Union Carbide\u2019s contention that, \u201cgiven the dramatic reduction in compensatory damages, California law required the trial court either to grant a new trial . . . or to reduce the punitive damages to the level the jury selected.\u201d In support of this argument, Union Carbide principally relies upon <em>Frommoethelydo </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 208 [228 Cal.Rptr. 160, 721 P.2d 41] <em>(Frommoethelydo) </em>and <em>Auerbach v. Great Western Bank </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 1172 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 718] <em>(Auerbach).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">In <em>Frommoethelydo, </em>the plaintiff obtained a judgment for $15,271 in general damages, $250,000 for emotional distress, and $1.25 million for punitive damages in an action for misconduct by an insurer in dealing with a claim for stolen property. <em>(Frommoethelydo, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 211.) Our Supreme Court held the plaintiff could not recover emotional distress or general damages that were based on the insurer\u2019s privileged report of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the Bureau of Fraudulent Claims, and reduced the compensatory award from $265,271 to $8,771. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 211, 220.) Then, citing the rule requiring reasonable proportionality between punitive and compensatory damages (see <em>Neal v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 910, 928 [148 Cal.Rptr. 389, 582 P.2d 980]), the <em>Frommoethelydo </em>court held \u201c[t]he award of punitive damages may not be upheld since most of the compensatory damages must be set aside.\u201d <em>(Frommoethelydo, </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">In <em>Auerbach, </em>a jury found the defendant bank liable on contract and fraud claims and awarded the plaintiff $207,155 for each, together with $2.6 million in punitive damages. <em>(Auerbach, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at p. 1184.) The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on the contract claim and held the recoverable compensatory damages on the fraud claim were limited to $6,750. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1189, 1192.) The court then addressed the punitive damages award, stating, \u201cWe cannot . . . simply reduce the damages and modify the award on the fraud cause of action at this stage. Because the jury was misled about the amount of compensatory damages it could award, its punitive damage award is suspect. Although there is no fixed ratio, punitive damages must be proportional to recoverable compensatory damages. [Citation.] Because the punitive damages are out of proportion to the actual damages suffered by the [plaintiffs], the punitive damage claim will have to be retried.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>Union Carbide contends <em>Frommoethelydo </em>and <em>Auerbach </em>draw a bright-line rule requiring a new trial on punitive damages whenever a compensatory damages award is \u201cdramatically reduced.\u201d We read these cases differently. Contrary to the rule advanced by Union Carbide, the courts\u2019 focus in <em>Frommoethelydo </em>and <em>Auerbach </em>was not simply on the magnitude of the compensatory damages reduction, but rather on the effect the reduction had on the proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In <em>Frommoethelydo, </em>after the Supreme Court set aside most of the compensatory damages, the resulting ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was 142.5 to one. Similarly in <em>Auerbach, </em>after the Court of Appeal\u2019s reduction, the resulting ratio of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award to the reduced compensatory damages was 385 to one. The United States Supreme Court has held \u201cfew awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages . . . will satisfy due process.\u201d <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 425.) Likewise, our Supreme Court stated that ratios significantly greater than nine or 10 to one raise a \u201cpresumption\u201d of invalidity. <em>(Simon, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1182.) Although <em>Frommoethelydo </em>and <em>Auerbach </em>did not expressly rely on constitutional standards in reversing the punitive damages awards, it is clear that such grossly disproportionate awards could not withstand constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>Behr v.

We conclude the award is constitutional under each guidepost.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">(i) <em>Degree of reprehensibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s conduct is the most important indicator of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award. <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 419; <em>Gore, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 575.) In assessing the reprehensibility of a defendant\u2019s conduct, we are to consider whether \u201c[(1)] the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; [(2)] the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; [(3)] the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; [(4)] the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and [(5)] the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. [Citation.] The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant\u2019s culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.\u201d <em>(State Farm, </em>at p. 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Independently assessing these factors in view of the evidence presented at trial, we must agree with the apparent findings of the jury and trial court that Union Carbide\u2019s culpability was so reprehensible as to warrant punitive damages to achieve the state\u2019s legitimate interest in deterring such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The first reprehensibility factor \u2014 whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic \u2014 clearly weighs in favor of high reprehensibility. Due to his exposure to Union Carbide\u2019s asbestos, Mr. Izell has contracted a terminal cancer from which he will die in two to three years. (See <em>Bullock </em>v. <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc. </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 543, 561 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 382] <em>(Bullock II) </em>[\u201cThe harm caused by Philip Morris\u2019s misconduct was physical rather than economic because the evidence shows that Bullock suffered a debilitating and terminal illness, lung cancer, as a result of Philip Morris\u2019s fraudulent scheme.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">With respect to the second factor, the evidence also shows Union Carbide acted with a reprehensible indifference to the health and safety of others. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>1967, Union Carbide produced an internal report concluding that low levels of exposure to asbestos cause mesothelioma, which can occur after only \u201ca brief exposure, which may be as little as three months.\u201d Though acknowledging a \u201cgeneral inference that Crocidolite [asbestos] is more liable to produce mesothelioma,\u201d the report cautioned that \u201c[ejxoneration of [Union Carbide\u2019s] Chrysotile [asbestos] has not been made\u201d and \u201cthat on the basis of present evidence, we are not entitled under any circumstances to state that our material is not a health hazard.\u201d Echoing this concern, in 1968, Union Carbide\u2019s associate medical director reported, \u201c[i]t is generally held that much less exposure to asbestos increases the possibility of mesothelioma formation,\u201d and thus advised, \u201cI don\u2019t see that we have any choice in a position except to admit that asbestos is carcinogenic under certain conditions.\u201d Despite these admonitions, Union Carbide chose not to warn its customers about the risk of cancer, stating in 1975, \u201ccancer is a very emotional word and there is a strong possibility that people will react to it far beyond the real danger involved. . . . [J[] We cannot predict with certainty what effect the use of the proposed [cancer warning] will have on our business, but the general feeling here is that it is likely to vary somewhere between serious and fatal.\u201d All this suggests Union Carbide knew the dangers of its product, but failed to warn consumers of those dangers, while seeking to maintain profits from the sale of asbestos. (See <em>Stewart v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 34-35, 38 [117 Cal.Rptr.3d 791] [reviewing same evidence and rejecting Union Carbide\u2019s assertion that punitive damages were unconstitutionally excessive because its conduct was on the \u201clow end of the reprehensibility scale\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The same evidence also establishes reprehensibility with regard to the fourth and fifth factors \u2014 whether the conduct involved repeated actions, and whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit. Unquestionably, Union Carbide\u2019s continued sales of asbestos for more than decade after it internally recognized low levels of exposure could cause mesothelioma establishes repeated conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, as Union Carbide acknowledged, had it warned of the known risk of cancer, the result may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>have been \u201cfatal\u201d for its asbestos business, but it also likely would have prevented Mr. Izell from being exposed to its dangerous product. All told, four of the five factors weigh in favor of finding high reprehensibility.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">(ii) <em>Disparity between actual harm and punitive damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Due process requires that punitive damages bear a \u201c \u2018reasonable relationship\u2019 \u201d to the actual or potential harm to the plaintiff. <em>(Gore, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 580.) Thus, \u201ccourts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.\u201d <em>(State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at p. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">.The United States Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula.\u201d <em>(Gore, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 582; see <em>State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at pp. 424-425.) As <em>State Farm </em>explains, the due process limitation is elastic, rather than rigid, and depends on the circumstances: \u201c[Bjecause there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where \u2018a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.\u2019 [Citations.] The converse is also tme, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(State Farm, </em>at p. 425.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>In view of the \u201cmultimillion dollar\u201d compensatory damages award for noneconomic losses, Union Carbide argues \u201cany punitive award greater than [its] share of the compensatory award would be constitutionally excessive.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">To begin, though Union Carbide\u2019s $3.9 million share of the reduced compensatory damages award may be substantial in the abstract, \u201cwe believe that whether the compensatory damages are \u2018small\u2019 or \u2018substantial\u2019 within the meaning of <em>State Farm, supra, </em>538 U.S. at page 425, depends, in substantial part, on the defendant\u2019s financial condition.\u201d <em>(Bullock II, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.4th at p. 565, fn. 11.) This is because \u201cthe state\u2019s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence are not served if the amount of punitive damages is so small relative to the defendant\u2019s wealth as to constitute only a nuisance or a routine cost of doing business <em>(Simon, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1185), and because a punitive damages award violates due process only if the award is \u2018 \u201c \u2018grossly excessive\u2019 in relation to these interests\u201d \u2019 <em>(ibid., </em>quoting <em>Gore, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 568).\u201d <em>(Bullock II, </em>at p. 565, fn. 11.) Here, Union Carbide stipulated to a present net worth of $4.2 billion. In view of its financial condition, and the highly reprehensible conduct discussed above, we cannot hold that punitive damages equal to less than five times Union Carbide\u2019s share of compensatory damages exceeded the amount necessary to serve the state\u2019s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Union Carbide\u2019s contention that a one-to-one ratio was mandated because the compensatory award here consisted entirely of noneconomic damages. To be sure, some cases have recognized that a noneconomic award may be \u201chigh enough that it <em>appears </em>to include a punitive component,\u201d thereby reducing the permissible ratio of punitive to compensatory damages. <em>(Bankhead v. ArvinMeritor, Inc. </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 68, 90 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 849] <em>(Bankhead), </em>italics added; see <em>Walker v. Farmers Ins.

Here, however, we need not speculate from what \u201cappears\u201d to be included in a jury\u2019s verdict, because we have the trial court\u2019s thorough recitation of the harm suffered by Plaintiffs that it considered in setting the amount of compensatory damages. The trial court\u2019s thoughtful analysis is set forth above in its entirety; there is no appearance that the court included a punitive component in the reduced compensatory award.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Finally, Union Carbide attempts to establish equivalency with <em>Roby </em>v. <em>McKesson Corp. </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 686 [101 Cal.Rptr.3d 773, 219 P.3d 749], in which our Supreme Court concluded a one-to-one ratio between compensatory and punitive damages was the federal constitutional limit where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>defendant\u2019s conduct involved a <em>\u201crelatively low degree of reprehensibility\u201d </em>and the compensatory verdict included a substantial award of noneconomic damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 719, italics added.) As we discussed with respect to the reprehensibility guidepost, that is not the case here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., supra, </em>190 Cal.App.4th at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Plaintiffs are entitled to their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\"> Without disputing the numbers, Plaintiffs note these percentages are based on Kelly-Moore\u2019s \u201cnationwide\u201d asbestos purchases. The portion of the record cited by Plaintiffs says nothing about \u201cnationwide\u201d purchases. But even if the record supported Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, this fact alone would not supplant the need for speculation, inasmuch as Plaintiffs, who bore the burden of proof on exposure, failed to present evidence showing how Kelly-Moore used or geographically distributed its various suppliers\u2019 asbestos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\"> To support this assertion, Plaintiffs rely exclusively on the testimony of their materials expert, Dr. William Longo, who claimed \u201cI don\u2019t have the document in front of me, but California was one of the places it [(Ready-Mix from the Tex. plant)] [was] sold.\u201d Dr. Longo admitted he lacked personal knowledge on the issue, and Plaintiffs did not offer the unidentified document he mentioned into evidence. Thus, were we to resolve the issue on this basis, we would conclude Dr. Longo\u2019s testimony is entitled to no weight and cannot alone support the judgment. (See <em>Roddenberry v. Roddenberry </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 651 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 907] [\u201cExpert opinion testimony constitutes substantial evidence only if based on conclusions or assumptions supported by evidence in the record.\u201d]; <em>Casey v.

The jury could have concluded that Hamilton had other suppliers in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, but those relationships ended once Hamilton began purchasing asbestos from Union Carbide in 1974 \u2014 just around the mid to late 1970\u2019s when Mr. Izell testified he inhaled dust from Hamilton Red Dot joint compound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b853-9\"> In contrast to a joint compound, which must be used to fill in seams and cover nailheads, the evidence showed that a topping compound has less adhesive.

As in <em>Rutherford, </em>the jury here could resolve the conflict between the competing expert opinions and conclude, based on Dr. Mark\u2019s testimony, that even a single exposure to respirable asbestos fibers was a substantial factor in increasing Mr. Izell\u2019s risk of developing mesothelioma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b856-8\"> Indeed, the evidence in this case, including Dr. Mark\u2019s expert medical testimony, was substantively similar to the evidence presented at trial in <em>Rutherford. </em>In <em>Rutherford, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 causation showing included factual evidence of the decedent\u2019s exposure to the defendant\u2019s product, expert testimony from an epidemiologist who opined as to the cause of mesothelioma generally, and expert medical testimony on the relationship between asbestos exposure and lung cancer. Specifically, the plaintiffs\u2019 medical expert, like Dr. Mark, offered an opinion \u201cto the effect that each exposure, even a relatively small one, contributed to the occupational \u2018dose\u2019 and hence to the risk of cancer.\u201d (Rutherford, <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 984.) The Supreme Court held this evidence was sufficient for a jury to determine legal causation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b859-5\"> We also reject Union Carbide\u2019s assertion that the jury\u2019s \u201cpassion or prejudice\u201d with respect to compensatory damages necessarily infected its liability and comparative fault determinations. Even if an excessive damages award is the product of passion and prejudice, it does not necessarily follow that the verdict as to liability was similarly influenced. <em>(West, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.3d at pp. 876-877; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Automobile Club of So.

Further, given our conclusion that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s remitted compensatory damages award, we need not consider Union Carbide\u2019s contentions concerning the improper closing argument by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. In view of the court\u2019s thorough discussion of the evidence, we are confident the trial judge was not swayed by counsel\u2019s entreaties to \u201cmake a difference.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\"> The other cases cited by Union Carbide similarly recognize that punitive damages must be reasonably proportionate to the harm suffered, and thus hold, if compensatory damages are to be retried, punitive damages must be retried too. (See <em>Liodas v. Sahadi </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 278, 284 [137 Cal.Rptr. 635, 562 P.2d 316] [when a trial court has \u201cgranted a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages,\u201d \u201c[e]xemplary damages must be redetermined as well\u201d]; <em>Ramona Manor Convalescent Hospital v.

Union Carbide contends this argument invited the jury to impermissibly punish Union Carbide for harm caused to others, because Mr. Izell was exposed to asbestos for only eight of the 18 years in question. Though due process does not permit courts or juries, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties\u2019 hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, this does not mean that the defendant\u2019s similar wrongful conduct toward others should not be considered in determining the amount of punitive damages. <em>(Bullock v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. </em>(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 655, 690-691 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 775].) As our Supreme Court stated in <em>Johnson v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1191 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 401, 113 P.3d 82], \u201c[t]o consider the defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct in setting or reviewing a punitive damages award, even in an individual plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>lawsuit, is not to punish the defendant for its conduct toward others. An enhanced punishment for recidivism does not directly punish the earlier offense; it is, rather, \u2018 \u201c \u2018a stiffened penalty for the last crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 . . . By placing the defendant\u2019s conduct on one occasion into the context of a business practice or policy, an individual plaintiff can demonstrate that the conduct toward him or her was more blameworthy and warrants a stronger penalty to deter continued or repeated conduct of the same nature.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1206, fn. 6, citation omitted.) Here, the jury, in fixing punitive damages based on the reprehensibility of Union Carbide\u2019s conduct, could properly consider the number of years Union Carbide sold asbestos after learning of its hazards, without impermissibly punishing the company for harm caused to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\"> The third reprehensibility factor, \u201cwhether . . . the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability\u201d <em>(State Farm, </em>supra, 538 U.S. at p. 419), ordinarily is relevant only if financial vulnerability made the target more vulnerable to the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct or exacerbated the harm, such as where the harm caused by the' defendant\u2019s conduct was economic. (See <em>Gore, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 576 [\u201cinfliction of economic injury, especially when done intentionally through affirmative acts of misconduct [citation] or when the target is financially vulnerable, can warrant a substantial penalty\u201d], cited in <em>State Farm, </em>at p. 419.) As economic injury is not at issue here, this factor is not germane to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\"> As for Union Carbide\u2019s policy arguments, we note they have been largely rejected by other courts (see <em>Bankhead, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.4th at p. 88; <em>Stevens v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1645, 1668 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 525]), and we have no cause to address them here. While considerations about the current leadership of Union Carbide and the volume of other asbestos litigation it faces might have been relevant to the jury or trial court in setting punitive damages, these issues are not among the guideposts that direct our constitutional mission \u201cto find a level higher than which an award <em>may not </em>go.\u201d <em>(Simon, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1188.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b867-8\">KITCHING, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8l\">Concurring and Dissenting. \u2014 I concur with my colleagues on all issues except the affirmance of the $18 million punitive damages award.

Recognizing that \u201cpunitive damages must be proportional to recoverable compensatory damages,\u201d the <em>Auerbach </em>court concluded the substantial reduction in compensatory damages made the punitive damages award \u201csuspect,\u201d because it indicated \u201cthe jury was misled about the amount of compensatory damages it could award.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[\u201cBecause the punitive damages are out of proportion to the actual damages suffered by the Auerbachs, the punitive damage claim will have to be retried.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>At the outset, I note two issues that militate against applying the customary degree of deference to the trial court\u2019s decision in this case. First is the fact that the court used the incorrect compensatory damages figure in determining a \u201c3:1 ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is reasonable.\u201d As both parties agree, the court should have compared the punitive damages award to Union Carbide\u2019s 65 percent share of the compensatory damages ($3.9 million), which yields a ratio of 4.62 to one. Second, in ruling on Union Carbide\u2019s new trial motion, the trial court was exclusively concerned with whether its reduction of the compensatory damages required it to make a corresponding reduction in punitive damages to preserve the jury\u2019s original ratio. In addressing this issue, the trial court correctly followed the rule stated in <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Tucoemas Federal Credit Union </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1351 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 1281] \u2014 that \u201ca reduction in compensatory damages does not mandate a corresponding reduction in punitive damages,\u201d as \u201c[t]here is no requirement that the original ratio between compensatory and punitive damages as measured by the jury remain.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1362.) However, by narrowly focusing on this issue, the trial court failed to consider whether its decision to reduce the jury\u2019s compensatory damages award by $24 million made the same jury\u2019s $18 million punitive damages award \u201csuspect,\u201d and thereby subject to a new trial. <em>(Auerbach, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at p. 1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In my view, the trial court\u2019s 80 percent reduction of the compensatory damages presents two possibilities with respect to the propriety of the jury\u2019s punitive damages award. One is that the jury acted with passion or prejudice, both in awarding $24 million more in compensatory damages than was supported by the evidence, and also in awarding punitive damages almost five times greater than the remitted amount of compensatory damages apportioned to Union Carbide. The other is that the jury followed the court\u2019s instruction and, in awarding punitive damages roughly equivalent to the amount of compensatory damages apportioned to Union Carbide, chose a number bearing a \u201creasonable relationship\u201d to the harm the jury believed plaintiffs suffered as a result of Union Carbide\u2019s misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the first scenario is the case, Union Carbide was plainly entitled to a new trial. However, even if the second scenario is accurate, this still makes the punitive damages award \u201csuspect,\u201d because, as the trial court found here, the \u201cjury was misled about the amount of compensatory damages it could award.\u201d <em>(Auerbach, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.4th at p. 1190.) In either event, given the trial court\u2019s significant reduction of the compensatory damages award, and the jury\u2019s crucial role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>determining, without passion or prejudice, the \u201cproper proportion punitive damages should bear to the injury suffered\u201d <em>(Gagnon, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at p. 1602), I conclude punitive damages should be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 18, 2015, S223511.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\"> The jury\u2019s original verdict apportioned 65 percent of the $30 million compensatory damages award to Union Carbide, or $19.5 million \u2014 slightly more than the $18 million punitive damages award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
