Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 187), torture (\u00a7 206), first degree burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a)), and grand theft (\u00a7 487). The trial court further found true the allegations that defendant had served two prior prison terms (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851; Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5). The trial court sentenced defendant to 29 years to life for the first degree murder count, a consecutive 16-month term for the burglary count, and a consecutive eight-month term for the grand theft count. Additionally, the court imposed a life term for the torture count, but stayed punishment under section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">On appeal, defendant claims <em>Faretta</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error and a prejudicial delay in arraignment require reversal. He further argues that his eight-month sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>for grand theft must be stayed pursuant to section 654; the Attorney General concedes this error. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the judgment. A limited remand is required, however, to correct the conceded sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">I. EVIDENCE AT TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">A. <em>Residential </em>Burglary; <em>Gun Theft, and Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Jimmy Bean, Jr., testified that in November 2009 he suspected his son, Eric Bean, was taking drugs. On December 17, 2009, Bean discovered that someone had broken into his gun safe and had taken three shotguns and a Ruger pistol. Bean\u2019s gun safe had been pried open. The responding police officer noted that the front and back doors of Bean\u2019s residence showed no signs of forced entry. The officer also observed tool marks on a gun safe and took latent print samples from the front of the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Four days later, on the morning of December 21, 2009, Eric Bean\u2019s body was discovered by a bicyclist along McEwen Road in Contra Costa County. His body was in rigor mortis, indicating that he had been dead for several hours. It appeared that Eric had been tied and beaten; his wrists, ankles, and neck bore ligature marks and there were many lacerations, abrasions, and contusions about his face and head. His T-shirt was bloodstained, though no blood was found on the ground, suggesting that Erie had been murdered at another location. It was later determined that Eric had been murdered at 100 Carolina Drive in Benicia, the known residence of defendant\u2019s confederate Timothy Delosreyes, Jr. (Big Tim).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">B. <em>Forensic Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Crime lab analyst Catherine Currier testified that she observed a \u201clarge cut\u201d on Eric\u2019s head, a wound on the chin, and bruises to the right elbow and foot. Currier observed ligature marks to the victim\u2019s wrists and ankles. Currier observed a shoe print on the victim\u2019s left buttock. Currier opined that the victim died at another location due to the lack of blood pooling, spatter, or shoe prints around the body. On March 9, 2010, Currier tested defendant\u2019s white pickup truck for blood evidence. An area under the bed liner and the frame under the tailgate tested positive for blood. Currier found yellow rope in the truck bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Crime lab analyst Richard Bowden found 0.02 micrograms per milliliter of amphetamine and 0.07 micrograms per milliliter of methamphetamine in Eric\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">Criminalist Donald Finley found three blue fibers on Eric\u2019s boxers, a yellow fiber on the body\u2019s right leg, and various fibers on an outer T-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Pathologist Arnold Josselson found numerous abrasions on the body\u2019s right ankle, right shoulder, penis, right elbow, lower right abdominal wall, right thigh, left forearm, upper abdomen, left hip, right ear, both cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. There were bruises on the feet, right back, upper left arm, right knee, left hip, eyelids, nose, left knee, and left shoulder. There were lacerations to the left eyebrow, on the chin, right ear, lower lip, and on the right comer of the mouth. There was a ligature abrasion across the lower neck, several smaller ligature impressions on the front of the neck, and ligature marks on the left ankle and each wrist. One tooth was chipped. There was hemorrhaging on the surface of the brain, blood inside the brain, on the left side of the neck, on the soft tissue of the voice box and the larynx, and on the soft tissue overlying the spinal column in the neck. Josselson opined that Eric died from strangulation and from blunt force injury to the head. Josselson noted that Eric had blood in his stomach and airway.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Criminalist Alex Tally a examined the residence at 100 Carolina Drive in Benicia. The northeast bedroom showed signs of sloppy application of wall paint. Two stains on the north wall were presumptively positive for blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Latent print analyst Stephanie Souza examined the latent prints taken from the gun safe and found that one print was from defendant\u2019s right thumb and another from defendant\u2019s right middle finger. Eric\u2019s left thumb made two latent prints on the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Criminalist Kim Willey examined blood samples taken from the northeast bedroom of 100 Carolina Drive. The DNA profile of that blood sample matched Eric\u2019s DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">C. <em>Defendant\u2019s Statements to Police</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">1. <em>December 30, 2009</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Deputy Sheriff Michael Meth first questioned defendant on December 30, 2009. Defendant said that on December 20 and December 21, he was working at a construction project in San Francisco. Defendant said he was in San Francisco with \u201cLittle Tim\u201d Delosreyes (Timothy Delosreyes III, also called \u201cTimmy\u201d). When told that his cell phone records did not corroborate his presence in San Francisco, defendant had no explanation. Defendant denied knowing about Eric\u2019s whereabouts or death. Defendant said that Big Tim and Little Tim Delosreyes were his longtime friends. Defendant last saw Eric during the week of December 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">2. <em>March 6, 2010</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Garrett Schiro testified that on March 6, 2010, he obtained arrest warrants for defendant, Big Tim, Timmy, and defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>wife, Melody Rives. That same day, defendant led investigators on a tour through the residence at 100 Carolina Drive in Benicia. The jury was shown a video depicting defendant\u2019s tour.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant told Deputy Meth that he believed he was being helpful or positive in advising Timmy on how not to get caught. He described the rope used to tie up Eric as \u201c \u2018half inch yellow rope.\u2019 \u201d Defendant reported that Eric had been gagged while being held captive in the bedroom. He acknowledged that he could have saved Eric\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Defendant said that on Saturday, December 19, 2009, he and Big Tim spent the night in Vallejo. Then, on Sunday morning about 8:30 a.m., defendant received a telephone call from his wife, followed by another call from Timmy. Defendant left Vallejo and drove to 100 Carolina Drive in Benicia. Eric was in a bedroom, beaten and hog-tied.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Defendant estimated that Eric died between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m. that Sunday. Defendant said that Eric and Timmy had stolen some guns. Melody told defendant that Eric was going to \u201csqueal.\u201d Defendant said that Eric was tied up with half-inch yellow rope. Defendant saw Big Tim throw a drinking glass at Eric and heard Eric moan after being struck. After Eric\u2019s death, Big Tim left the house and went to a \u201cdrug rehab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Defendant said that he and Timmy carried the body to defendant\u2019s truck bed for disposal. Defendant and Timmy wrapped the body in a blanket that was later discarded at a Nob Hill grocery store dumpster. Defendant wore latex gloves during the disposal of the body. Defendant estimated that the dead body was in the Benicia residence for about seven and a half hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Defendant said Timmy cleaned the house with bleach for nine hours. Defendant inspected the work and told Timmy he had more spots to clean.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">3. <em>March 10, 2010</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">On March 10, 2010, Sergeant Schiro interviewed defendant at the Martinez Detention Facility. That interview was videotaped and a redacted portion of the recording was played for the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant said he helped Eric and Timmy retrieve the guns from the gun safe about a week before Eric\u2019s death. Defendant explained that on Saturday, December 19, 2009, he was with Big <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Tim in Vallejo, getting high at someone\u2019s residence. The next morning, Timmy called and said he needed help and asked defendant to come back to the house in Benicia. On arriving at the Benicia residence, Melody told defendant that Eric was going to \u201csnitch\u201d to his father about the stolen guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Defendant said that when he arrived at the Benicia residence, Eric was hog-tied but not beaten. Timmy told Eric to shut up and pushed a homemade \u201cmetal sticker\u201d in the area under Eric\u2019s chin. Melody told defendant that Eric was \u201cgoing to dip\u201d or \u201cleave.\u201d Defendant left the residence to buy lunch for everyone. He denied punching, kicking, or spitting on Eric. Defendant instructed Timmy that Eric\u2019s bindings had loosened during the assault.- He told Timmy, \u201c[Ojnce somebody\u2019s hog-tied, you can\u2019t let them go.\u201d Defendant said he wanted Eric to die \u201csmoothly\u201d and not suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Defendant saw Timmy grab a 24-inch sword, place it in Eric\u2019s mouth, and move it horizontally in Eric\u2019s mouth. Defendant said the stolen guns were already in \u201cthird or fourth hands by now.\u201d Defendant said he drove the body in his truck and pulled off the side of the roadway. Timmy went to the back of the truck and rolled the body out of the truck bed and down the hill. Defendant allowed Timmy to live at his residence for two weeks after Eric\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">D. <em>Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Melody Rives testified that she married defendant on September 12, 2009. In October 2009, Big Tim resided at Carolina Drive in Benicia. In December 2009, Melody began using methamphetamine. On December 15, 2009, at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m., Timmy called Melody from the Martinez Amtrak station and asked her to give him and Eric a ride. Melody estimated defendant was drunk four to five times a week and was not available to drive Timmy or Eric. Melody picked up Eric, who appeared \u201chigh\u201d on drugs. She saw Timmy using a handmade weapon with a sharp point. The weapon had a handle wrapped in tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">On December 17, 2009, Melody saw defendant leave about 5:00 a.m. Defendant returned to the Carolina Drive house with Timmy, who was carrying a blanket with three shotguns and a .22 revolver. Big Tim was away from the residence from December 16 through December 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">On December 19, 2009, about 6:00 p.m., Melody was at the Carolina Drive residence with defendant, Eric, Big Tim, and Timmy. At 11:00 p.m., defendant and Big Tim left the residence. At 1:00 a.m., Timmy and Eric were inside Timmy\u2019s bedroom smoking methamphetamine. Later that morning, Timmy woke Melody and asked her to come into the bedroom to talk to Eric. Eric was \u201czip-tied\u201d on the bed, covered by a blanket. The next morning, defendant came back to the residence with Big Tim.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>At 3:00 p.m., Melody became concerned for Eric, having last seen him six or seven hours prior. She slightly opened the bedroom door, but Timmy pulled the door shut \u201creal fast.\u201d Melody never saw defendant enter that bedroom. At 3:30 or 4:00 p.m., Melody was sitting on the couch and heard \u201cscuffling noises, banging noises\u201d coming from the bedroom. She saw Big Tim enter the bedroom. She saw Big Tim throw a glass into the bedroom and heard the glass break. Big Tim left the residence thereafter. Defendant escorted her outside. Outside, Melody heard \u201cheavy noises\u201d coming from inside the residence. After five minutes, there were no more noises. At one point, Melody saw Timmy carrying rope.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">At 5:00 or 5:30 p.m., Melody returned to the residence and saw defendant \u201cextremely upset\u201d and sitting in the dining room, and noted that Timmy was taking a shower. In the late afternoon, Melody was \u201cscared to death,\u201d having learned Eric was dead.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At 6:00 p.m., Big Tim returned to the residence with cleaning supplies. Melody cleaned up a latent fingerprint on the bedroom door and a \u201cfew spots\u201d on the mattress and put wet clothing into the dryer. Bloody clothes had been placed into bags and put inside the garage. Timmy was moving the bags around in the garage and painting the bedroom wall. In the morning hours of December 21, Melody saw defendant and Timmy drive away from the Carolina Drive residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">E. <em>Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">On March 6, 2010, Sergeant Van Hook contacted Melody. Melody said that on Saturday, December 19, she was at the Carolina Drive residence with defendant, Timmy, and Big Tim. Melody said that Eric was not at the house. She said that Timmy disposed of the body. Melody later said defendant and Timmy disposed of the body. She did not know the motive for the killing. Eric feared that Timmy believed that he would snitch about the stolen guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">On December 29, 2009, Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Tiffany Van Hook contacted Melody at her residence in Benicia. Melody said she last saw Eric and Timmy on Friday, December 18, 2009. She gave both men a ride to a park in Martinez. She said she next saw Timmy at the candlelight vigil for Eric.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">On March 10, 2010, Sergeant Van Hook again spoke with Melody. In that conversation, Melody said she burned a phonebook inside a \u201cpot belly stove.\u201d Melody said that Eric was present at the Carolina Drive residence with Timmy and herself. Eric told her he was not going to snitch on anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>After the killing, Melody saw defendant and Timmy cleaning up. On Sunday, Melody told Big Tim that Timmy feared Eric was going to snitch on them all. Melody feared Eric would implicate defendant in the gun theft. Melody saw that the shotguns were now sawed off, making them shorter in length. Defendant delivered the shotguns to someone named \u201cButters\u201d in Concord. Melody saw defendant tighten the restraints used on Eric. Big Tim told defendant to tighten the restraints because Timmy did not know what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">A. <em>Self-representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error when it denied his request for self-representation. Citing <em>People v. Johnson </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 519 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 54, 267 P.3d 1125] <em>(Johnson), </em>defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s justifications for denying his <em>Faretta </em>motion did not constitute substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s incompetence. Therefore, defendant argues, the error is reversible per se, and the judgment must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The trial court heard defendant\u2019s motion to discharge appointed counsel and to represent himself on May 4, 2011, 10 months before trial commenced on March 12, 2012. Defense counsel informed the court that she had doubts about defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. The trial court immediately suspended the criminal proceedings and appointed Jessica Ferranti, M.D., to evaluate defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial and to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Two months later, the parties waived a trial on competence and submitted the issues to the court based on Dr. Ferranti\u2019s written report. In her July 18, 2011, report, Dr. Ferranti stated that she conducted a psychiatric exam on defendant, including a two-and-three-quarter-hour interview, two quantitative tests, and a review of relevant records. Dr. Ferranti stated that defendant\u2019s \u201ccurrent diagnosis is Alcohol Abuse, Amphetamine Dependence, Antisocial Personality Disorder and Expressive Language Disorder.\u201d She opined that appellant was competent to stand trial. Dr. Ferranti considered several factors, including that defendant (1) \u201cdemonstrated excellent knowledge of legal terms\u201d but \u201cwas impaired in his ability to string them together articulately in an effective and articulate presentation\u201d; (2) \u201chad an adequate understanding of the roles of various courtroom participants and the role of his attorney\u201d; (3) \u201cexhibited a fair understanding of the nature of the proceedings against him\u201d; (4) \u201cdemonstrated awareness of evidence against him although he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>maintained that said evidence should be \u2018inadmissible\u2019 because of what he perceives as police protocol violations\u201d; (5) \u201cexpressed his general understanding of his charges\u201d; and (6) \u201cperformed very well on a formal assessment instrument,\u201d scoring 92 out of 100 points on a test designed to assess an accused\u2019s competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Based on the enumerated factors, Dr. Ferranti opined, with reasonable medical certainty, \u201cthat [defendant] . . . ha[d] the ability ... to assist counsel in a rational manner, should he choose to do so\u201d (italics omitted). In support of this conclusion, Dr. Ferranti noted that defendant did \u201cnot have any thought process impairments or psychotic symptoms that would prevent him from engaging rationally with an attorney.\u201d She further noted that although defendant \u201cstruggled with expressing himself,\u201d he \u201cultimately was able\u201d to do so with her \u201cclarifications.\u201d Dr. Ferranti also reported that defendant \u201cwas able to provide a cogent and consistent account of the events on the day of his arrest,\u201d and he \u201cdemonstrated the ability to engage in strategizing and future-planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Dr. Ferranti, however, opined \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty\u201d that defendant was not competent to represent himself. She based her opinion on various factors, including defendant\u2019s expressive language disorder, which prevented him from being able to \u201ccommunicate coherently enough to make presentation^] to the Court.\u201d She further opined that defendant would \u201cnot be able to communicate with the Court or a jury with sufficient clarity to make himself understood in real time during trial.\u201d As a result, she found it likely that defendant \u201cwould be significantly disadvantaged due to his mental impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Dr. Ferranti further opined that \u201cdue to the significant amount of time required for [defendant] to express himself and for his audience to get clarification on his remarks that the essential principles of fairness to the defendant and efficiency for the State of California in trying him for serious crimes, would both be at risk by allowing this defendant to represent himself.\u201d Accordingly, she concluded that defendant was \u201cmentally impaired to the extent that the basic integrity of the proceeding would be . . . jeopardized by going forward with adjudication with him as pro per.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Ferranti explained as follows: \u201cCommunication in court requires that decisions be made quickly and sometimes under pressure. Decisions facing defendants representing themselves include all the basic strategic and tactical choices of trial, such as what motions to make, what witnesses to call, and what arguments to make to the jury. [Defendant] clearly lacks the ability to communicate clearly. In addition, [defendant] demonstrates a lack of ability to incorporate new ideas (learn) and adapt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>strategically. . . . Lack of ability to foresee possible outcomes and shift one\u2019s basic defensive strategy is an important basic competency for the pro per defendant. [Defendant] lacks this ability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Dr. Ferranti further explained that although she thought defendant \u201cis competent to waive his right to counsel and understand the potential risks and benefits of doing so, he does not demonstrate the higher cognitive abilities necessary to litigate his case in court. Although [defendant] does not meet criteria for mental retardation or borderline intellectual functioning, his intelligence is limited. He does not exhibit the ability for abstract thinking, higher level problem solving or cognitive flexibility. His ability to be educable and process information is limited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Based on Dr. Ferranti\u2019s report, the trial court found defendant competent to stand trial on July 20, 2011. Defense counsel noted her agreement with Dr. Ferranti\u2019s conclusion that defendant was competent to stand trial but not competent to represent himself. Defense counsel also advised the court that defendant would like to substitute counsel. After holding a Marsden<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> hearing, the court denied defendant\u2019s request for substitute counsel. The court did not expressly rule on defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">On January 19, 2012, two months before trial began, the court heard a defense motion to continue the trial. At this hearing, defense counsel informed the court that defendant would like to represent himself. After agreeing to waive time for trial, defendant stated that he \u201cwould like to go Faretta.\u201d The following colloquy occurred: \u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s my understanding from your attorney that you have been evaluated and the doctor felt that you had difficulty understanding the complexity of putting on a trial, as to whether or not you were competent to represent yourself. [J[] This doctor, Dr. Ferante [sz'c], made the assessment that you would not be able to litigate your case in court because of the cognitive disabilities you have \u2014 meaning higher processes \u2014 not that you can\u2019t understand what is going on, but it\u2019s more complicated. Do you understand? [][] THE DEFENDANT: I feel I can do it now because this case is two years old; and I\u2019ve been preparing, doing my own litigating within my cell and stuff like that. I got a couple of motions that I already prepared, already ready to go out. And I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s an issue. [][] THE COURT: Well I did re-read Dr. Ferante\u2019s [sz'c] evaluation; and based on my assessment of that and [defense counsel\u2019s] interaction with you, I am finding that your mental state is about the same as when Dr. Ferante [szc] evaluated you. So I am denying your Faretta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>2. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">A trial court must allow a defendant to represent himself if he knowingly and intelligently makes an unequivocal and timely request. <em>(Faretta, supra, </em>422 U.S. at pp. 835-836; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 73, 97-98 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 271, 82 P.3d 296].) The right of self-representation, however, is not absolute. <em>(Indiana v. Edwards </em>(2008) 554 U.S. 164, 171 [171 L.Ed.2d 345, 128 S.Ct. 2379] (Edwards).) Indeed, in <em>Edwards </em>the United States Supreme Court held that courts may limit a defendant\u2019s self-representation right by insisting upon representation by counsel at trial on the ground that the defendant lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense unless represented. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 178.) \u201cThat is to say, the Constitution permits States to insist upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial. . . but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d <em>(Ibid) \u201cEdwards </em>described competence to represent oneself at trial as the ability \u2018to carry out the basic tasks needed to present [one\u2019s] own defense without the help of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th 519, 530 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 54, 267 P.3d 1125], quoting <em>Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 175-176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Before <em>Edwards, </em>California courts held that a defendant who was competent to stand trial was competent to represent himself under <em>Faretta. </em>(See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 527.) In <em>Johnson, </em>the California Supreme Court adopted the limitation on self-representation authorized by <em>Edwards, </em>but declined to adopt a more specific standard. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 530.) In so holding, <em>Johnson </em>explained that the appropriate standard for trial courts to use in deciding whether to exercise their discretion to deny self-representation \u201cis simply whether the defendant suffers from a severe mental illness to the point where he or she cannot carry out the basic tasks needed to present the defense without the help of counsel.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In other words, California courts have discretion to deny self-representation to so-called gray-area defendants \u2014 those who are mentally competent to stand trial if represented by counsel but not mentally competent to conduct the trial themselves \u2014 \u201cin those cases where <em>Edwards </em>permits such denial.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 528; see <em>Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 172-174 [discussing gray-area defendants].) Nevertheless, our Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201c[s]elf-representation by defendants who wish it and validly waive counsel remains the norm and may not be denied lightly.\u201d <em>(Johnson, </em>at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">\u201cAs with other determinations regarding self-representation, we must defer largely to the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 531.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ruling regarding a defendant\u2019s competence will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Ibid.) \u201cFaretta </em>error is reversible per se.\u201d <em>(People v. Valdez, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">3. <em>No Abuse of Discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We believe that the trial court correctly applied <em>Edwards </em>to the circumstances of defendant\u2019s case, and there was no abuse of discretion. <em>Johnson, </em>which was decided after defendant\u2019s self-representation request, serves to bolster our conclusion that the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion. Defendant relies heavily on the fact that he was not delusional or psychotic, that he achieved top scores on tests designed to assess his competence to stand trial, and that he was believed to be of average intelligence. Because the rationale of <em>Edwards </em>is at the heart of the issue in this case, we believe further analysis of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Johnson </em>is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In <em>Edwards, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that its precedents did not answer the question whether the federal Constitution prohibits a state from insisting that a defendant proceed to trial with counsel (and denying the defendant the right to represent himself) when the state court finds the defendant mentally competent to stand trial if represented, but not mentally competent to conduct the trial himself. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 167, 169.) The court explained that the chief precedents on the standard for mental competence <em>(Dusky v. United States </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 402 [4 L.Ed.2d 824, 80 S.Ct. 788] <em>(Dusky) </em>and <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975) 420 U.S. 162 [43 L.Ed.2d 103, 95 S.Ct. 896]) did not consider the relation of the mental competence standard to the right of self-representation. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 169-170.) <em>Faretta </em>also did not answer the question both because it did not consider the problem of mental competence, and because <em>Faretta </em>itself and later cases made clear that the right of self-representation is not absolute. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 170-171.) Similarly, <em>Godinez v. Moran </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 389 [125 L.Ed.2d 321, 113 S.Ct. 2680] <em>(Godinez) </em>did not answer the question. <em>(Edwards, </em>at p. 173.) The court recognized that its emphasis in <em>Godinez </em>on the need to consider only the defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018competence to <em>waive the </em>right\u2019 \u201d and the absence of the need to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018technical legal knowledge\u2019 \u201d about how to conduct a trial stemmed from the fact that the <em>Godinez </em>defendant sought only to change his pleas to guilty, not to conduct trial proceedings. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 173.) Moreover, <em>Godinez </em>held only that a state may <em>permit </em>a gray-area defendant to represent himself. It did not tell a state whether it might <em>deny </em>the same type of defendant the right to represent himself, which was at issue in <em>Edwards. (Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The consideration of various factors, taken together, led the <em>Edwards </em>court to hold that \u201cthe Constitution permits States to insist upon representation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>counsel for those competent enough to stand trial . . . but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">In explaining its rationale, <em>Edwards </em>first observed that the court\u2019s \u201c \u2018mental competency\u2019 \u201d cases focused upon a defendant\u2019s ability to consult with his attorney and <em>assumed </em>representation by counsel, which suggested that, when such a defendant sought to forgo counsel, it called for a different standard. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 174-175.) The court pointed out that <em>Faretta </em>itself \u201crested its conclusion in part upon pre-existing state law set forth in cases all of which are consistent with, and at least two of which expressly adopt, a competency limitation on the self-representation right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Second, the complex nature of mental illness and mental competence, with its tendency to vary in degree and over time as well as in its effect on the individual, cautions against employing the same standard for determining whether a represented defendant can stand trial and whether a defendant must be allowed to represent himself at trial. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 175.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Third, allowing a defendant with an uncertain mental state to represent himself would not affirm the dignity and autonomy of the individual, which are the underpinnings of the right to represent oneself. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The <em>Edwards </em>court also observed that self-representation by a defendant who lacked the capacity to do so would \u201cundercutQ the most basic of the Constitution\u2019s criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.\u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 176-177.) Moreover, the trial must not only be fair, its fairness must be apparent to all. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 177.) The <em>Edwards </em>court determined that there was little reason to believe that application of <em>Dusky\u2019s </em>basic mental competence standard was sufficient. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 173.) The court believed that the trial judge \u201cwill often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, the court concluded that \u201cthe Constitution permits judges to take <em>realistic account </em>of the particular defendant\u2019s mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct his own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 177-178, italics added.) In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Edwards </em>court cited with approval the amicus curiae brief by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), which stated that \u201c \u2018[disorganized thinking, deficits in sustaining attention and concentration, impaired expressive abilities, anxiety, and other common symptoms of severe mental illness can impair the defendant\u2019s ability to play <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>the significantly expanded role required for self-representation even if he can play the lesser role of represented defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the California Supreme Court decided that California courts may \u201caccept [the] invitation\u201d extended by <em>Edwards </em>and \u201capply a higher standard of mental competence for self-representation than for competency to stand trial.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 523.) The court stated that, \u201c[b]ecause California law- \u2014 -which, of course, is subject to the United States Constitution \u2014 has long been that criminal defendants have <em>no </em>right of self-representation, . . . California courts may deny self-representation when the United States Constitution permits such denial.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The standard trial courts should apply when deciding whether to exercise their discretion to deny self-representation is \u201cwhether the defendant suffers from a severe mental illness to the point where he or she cannot carry out the basic tasks needed to present the defense without the help of counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 530.) Trial courts may order a psychological or psychiatric examination to inquire into the issue of doubts about the defendant\u2019s mental competence for self-representation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, the judge\u2019s own observations will also provide support for an incompetence finding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In the instant case, unlike in <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>we do not have a defendant who wrote and presented the court with bizarre documents. (See <em>Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 176, 179; <em>Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at pp. 532-533 &amp; fn. 2.) We do not have a record of bizarre or disruptive behavior in the courtroom. (See <em>Johnson, </em>at p. 525.) Nor do we have the convenience of a finding by the instant trial court like the one made by the trial court in <em>Johnson, </em>which employs nearly the exact wording of the amicus curiae brief by the APA quoted in <em>Edwards.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We nevertheless have sufficient substantial evidence to uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion, although the evidence differs from that of <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>Substantial evidence is \u201cevidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value .... [Citation.] We presume every fact in support of the judgment the trier of fact could have reasonably deduced from the evidence. [Citation.] If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. [Citation.] \u2018A reviewing court neither reweighs evidence nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>reevaluates a witness\u2019s credibility.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Albillar </em>(2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 60 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 244 P.3d 1062].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Here, the trial court considered Dr. Ferranti\u2019s report, which determined with \u201creasonable medical certainty\u201d that defendant was incompetent to represent himself at trial. In her report, Dr. Ferranti echoed the sentiments of the APA amicus curiae brief, noting that defendant suffered from an \u201cExpressive Language Disorder\u201d that prevented him from coherently communicating with the court or a jury. Dr. Ferranti also reported that defendant did not demonstrate \u201cthe higher cognitive abilities necessary to litigate his case in court.\u201d In other words, defendant did not have the \u201c \u2018ability to play the significantly expanded role required for self-representation even if he [could] play the lesser role of represented defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p. 176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On this record, allowing defendant to represent himself would have undercut \u201cthe most basic of the Constitution\u2019s criminal law objectives,\u201d that is, the providing of a fair trial. <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>554 U.S. at pp. 176-177.) As its comments indicated, the trial court clearly believed that defendant, due to his mental illness, was not capable of carrying out the basic tasks required to present a defense \u2014 tasks such as organizing a defense, making motions, and questioning witnesses. (See <em>Edwards, </em>at p. 176; <em>Johnson, supra, </em>53 Cal.4th at p. 530.) Because defendant was not obstreperous in court and otherwise lucid in his demeanor, the trial court\u2019s decision here was of necessity more finely tuned. (See <em>Edwards, </em>at p. 177.) There is absolutely no indication that the trial court denied defendant\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion for reasons of efficiency or merely to level the playing field. (See <em>Johnson, </em>at p. 531.) The trial court obtained expert evaluation, as urged by <em>Johnson {id. </em>at p. 530), and relied on that evaluation, as well as considered defense counsel\u2019s concerns. We will not second-guess that decision. (See <em>Edwards, </em>at p. <em>177 </em>[a \u201ctrial judge . . . will often prove best able to make more fine-tuned mental capacity decisions, tailored to the individualized circumstances of a particular defendant\u201d].) We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">III.
