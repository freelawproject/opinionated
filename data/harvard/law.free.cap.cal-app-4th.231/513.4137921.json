Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Often, it is the federal courts, applying federal law, that wrestle with claims of cross-state securities fraud involving a nationally listed stock. Here, plaintiffs of various states allege defendants, securities firms headquartered on the East Coast, violated California and New Jersey laws through their involvement in massive \u201cnaked short selling\u201d of Overstock.com, Inc. shares. The trial court sustained demurrers to plaintiffs\u2019 New Jersey Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq.) claim without leave to amend and subsequently granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 California market manipulation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>We affirm the dismissal of the belatedly raised New Jersey RICO claim. We also affirm the summary judgment as to three of the four defendants, but reverse as to Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation. The evidence, although slight, raises a triable issue this firm effected a series of transactions in California and did so for the purpose of inducing others to trade in the manipulated stock. In reaching this disposition, we conclude Corporations Code section 25400, subdivision (b), reaches not only beneficial sellers and buyers of stock, but also can reach firms that execute, clear and settle trades. However, as we further explain, such firms face liability in a private action for damages only if they engage in conduct beyond aiding and abetting securities fraud, such that they are a primary actor in the manipulative trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Plaintiffs are Overstock.com, Inc., an online retailer, and seven of its investors. In their fourth amended complaint, plaintiffs alleged defendants intentionally depressed the price of Overstock stock by effecting \u201cnaked short sales\u201d \u2014 that is, sales of shares the brokerage houses and their clients never actually owned or borrowed. This practice, and specifically perpetuating the naked short positions by means of exotic trading schemes, allegedly increased the apparent supply of the stock, led to a \u201cpile on\u201d of further short sales, and thereby decreased the stock\u2019s value \u2014 including the value of shares plaintiffs sold. Plaintiffs claimed defendants\u2019 conduct violated Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and New Jersey\u2019s RICO statute (N.J. Stat. 2C:41-2.c.-d.). To put plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and the nature of the evidence proffered during the summary judgment proceedings in context, we start with an overview of how securities transactions unfold, naked short sales, and the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) efforts to prohibit abusive short selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">A. <em>Steps in a Securities Transaction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Securities transactions involve a number of steps. These include, among others, executing a trade order, clearing a trade, and settling a trade. (See generally Minnerop, <em>Clearing Arrangements </em>(2003) 58 Bus. Law. 917, 919 (Minnerop); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.11a2-2(T) (2014).)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Execution is the process of reaching agreement on the terms of a transaction. This includes, for a buyer, not only finding the best price, but also choosing the right seller given the size of the order, the nature of the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>being traded, and the costs and fees associated with the trade. (See <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 1998) 135 F.3d 266, 270 &amp; fn. 2.) Execution can be accomplished manually or automatically by computer. (See <em>Domestic Securities, Inc. v. S.E.C. </em>(D.C. Cir. 2003) 357 U.S. App.D.C. 118 [333 F.3d 239, 243] [in the NASDAQ marketplace, buyers and sellers can automatically execute trades against quoted prices].)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Upon execution, \u201cthe actual transaction has only begun. Thereafter, several steps must be taken to complete the course of dealing. These steps are typically the responsibility of a clearing agency . . .\u201d associated with a given stock exchange. <em>(Bradford Nat. Clearing Corp. v. Securities and Exchange Commission </em>(D.C. Cir. 1978) 191 U.S. App.D.C. 383 [590 F.2d 1085, 1091, fn. 2] <em>(Bradford).) </em>\u201cThe clearing agency has three functions. First, the agency \u2018compares\u2019 submissions of the seller\u2019s broker with those of the buyer\u2019s to make sure that there is a common understanding of the terms of the trade. Following this process, the resulting \u2018compared trade\u2019 is \u2018cleared.\u2019 Most simply, this amounts to the clearing agency advising the selling and buying brokers, respectively, of their delivery and payment obligations.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cThe final, \u2018settlement,\u2019 stage in the process involves the delivery of securities certificates to the purchasing broker and the payment of money to the selling broker. Modernization of this task has led to storage of most stock certificates in a depository affiliated with the clearing agency. Thus, \u2018delivery\u2019 amounts to a bookkeeping entry that removes the security from one account and places it in another.\u201d <em>(Bradford, supra, </em>590 F.2d at p. 1091, fn. 2; see Poser, <em>The Stock Exchanges of the United States and Europe: Automation, Globalization, and Consolidation </em>(2001) 22 U. Pa. J. Int\u2019l Econ. L. 497, 514.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Some firms, known as clearing firms, specialize in postexecution, \u201cback office\u201d clearing and settling of trades in conjunction with the appropriate clearing agency, in which the clearing firm is a \u201cparticipant.\u201d Such firms may provide these services to \u201cintroducing\u201d brokerage firms on a fee-for-service basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Dillon v. Militano </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1990) 731 F.Supp. 634, 636-637; Branson, <em>Nibbling at the Edges </em>\u2014 Regulation <em>of Short Selling: Policing Fails to Deliver and Restoration of an Uptick Rule </em>(2009) 65 Bus. Law. 67, 91; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(23)-(24) [defining clearing agency and participant].) Their services tend to include extending credit in margin accounts; providing written confirmation of executed orders to customers; receiving or delivering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>funds or securities from or to customers; maintaining books and records that reflect transactions, including rendering monthly or periodic statements of account to customers; providing custody of funds and securities in customer accounts; clearing and settling transactions effected in customer accounts. (Minnerop, supra, 58 Bus. Law. at p. 919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B. <em>The Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Overstock sold shares in May and December 2006 through public offerings arranged by a San Francisco firm, W.R. Hambrecht + Co. The other seven plaintiffs are individuals who sold Overstock shares in 2004, 2005, and 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">There are four defendants, two related \u201cGoldman\u201d entities and two related \u201cMerrill\u201d entities. Their ordinary activities can be understood with reference to the stages in a securities transaction discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. (hereinafter Goldman Brokerage) executes, clears, and settles securities transactions. Its operations are centered in New Jersey and New York. In some cases, Goldman Brokerage performs execution, clearance, and settlement for a single transaction. In other cases, its clients execute elsewhere and Goldman Brokerage provides only clearance and settlement services. Goldman Brokerage also houses a securities lending department which procures and supplies stock associated with certain transactions, including, as explained below, short sales. In this case, Goldman Brokerage\u2019s execution of certain client trades and its own purchase of certain securities in connection with its securities lending business are primarily at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Goldman Sachs Execution &amp; Clearing, L.P. (hereinafter Goldman Clearing), likewise executes, clears, and settles securities transactions. It is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation. It is headquartered in New Jersey and has significant operations there, and in New York and Chicago. It offers its clearing services to other SEC-registered broker-dealers, hedge funds, and institutions. In this case, Goldman Clearing\u2019s clearing and settlement services are primarily at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. (hereinafter Merrill Brokerage), like its Goldman Brokerage counterpart, provides various investment services and runs a stock lending department that borrows and lends securities. This department conducts its borrowing, lending, and related transactional activity in New York and Illinois. As with Goldman Brokerage, it is Merrill Brokerage\u2019s trade execution and lending operations connected to naked short sales that are primarily at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (hereinafter Merrill Clearing), like its Goldman Clearing counterpart, provides various investment services and is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Merrill Clearing is a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Brokerage. It is headquartered in New York and has a substantial presence in New Jersey and Illinois. It also has a San Francisco customer service office. Merrill Clearing offers only limited execution services, and most Merrill Clearing clients execute their own trades. Merrill Clearing uses Merrill Brokerage to procure stocks needed to settle (or close out) a transaction. As with Goldman Clearing, Merrill Clearing\u2019s clearing and settlement operations are primarily at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">C. <em>\u201cNaked\u201d Short Selling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In a short sale, the seller sells stock the seller does not own. It is a bet against the stock. In an ordinary short sale, the seller borrows stock from a lender (such as a brokerage firm\u2019s lending department), sells this stock to a buyer at the going price, and then purchases replacement stock \u2014 hopefully at a lower price \u2014 to return to the lender. Lenders typically charge a \u201cborrow\u201d fee for lending shares to sell short. The seller profits if the stock price falls enough to cover all costs and fees associated with the sale, including borrowing the stock. Otherwise, if the stock price rises or does not fall enough to cover the costs and fees, the short seller suffers a loss. If the short seller never delivers the stock to the buyer, a \u201cfail to deliver\u201d occurs. The sale nonetheless appears on the seller\u2019s and buyer\u2019s books, and is then termed a \u201cnaked\u201d short sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Stocks that are \u201chard to borrow\u201d (also called \u201cnegative rebate\u201d stocks) can command high borrow fees, given their scarcity and desirability for short selling. During the 2005 and 2006 timeframe, Overstock was a particularly hard-to-borrow security, and shares of the company commanded a negative rebate of up to 35 percent of its value on an annualized basis. Thus, any trader hoping to profit from selling short would ordinarily need to recoup the borrow fees through a significant decline in the price of the security. In naked short sales, however, there is no borrowing and thus no borrow fee, and it is significantly easier to make a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Short selling, itself, is lawful. <em>(GFL Advantage Fund, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Colkitt </em>(3d Cir. 2001) 272 F.3d 189, 207 <em>(GFL).) </em>Even short sales resulting in \u201cfails to deliver\u201d are not necessarily nefarious and occasionally occur in the regular press of market activity. <em>(Cohen v. Stevanovich </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2010) 722 F.Supp.2d 416, 424-425 <em>(Cohen) </em>[\u201callegations of failures to deliver, without more, are insufficient to state a claim for market manipulation\u201d].) In <em>Cohen, </em>the alleged naked short selling activity was untethered to any \u201cdistortion to] the price\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>of the stock at issue and so did not constitute \u201c \u2018willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors\u2019 with regard to market activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 425.) Similarly, in <em>Sullivan &amp; Long, Inc. v. Scattered Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1995) 47 F.3d 857, 864, the short selling of more shares than could be obtained could not be viewed as manipulative when, under the peculiar circumstances, the selling drove the stock down to the correct market price, given the terms of a restructuring agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">But there are situations in which intentional naked short selling can be employed to manipulate the market. (See <em>Cohen, supra, </em>722 F.Supp.2d at pp. 425, 424 [\u201c \u2018fails to deliver can occur for a variety of legitimate reasons, and flexibility is necessary in order to ensure an orderly market and to facilitate liquidity,\u2019 \u201d but some fails may be \u201c \u2018a potential problem\u2019 \u201d when \u201c \u2018willfully combined with something more to create a false impression of how market participants value a security\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Hyperdynamics Corp. v. Southridge Capital Management, LLC </em>(2010) 305 Ga.App. 283, 287, fn. 8 [699 S.E.2d 456] [noting naked short sales could \u201cdepress the price of a target company\u2019s shares\u201d]; <em>In re Adler, Coleman Clearing Corp. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2007) 469 F.Supp.2d 112, 126 [\u201cThe Court is persuaded that the evidence sufficiently establishes that DiPrimo\u2019s conduct, under Gurian\u2019s control, amounted to concerted, naked short selling whose purpose was to drive down the price of Hanover House Stocks . . .\u201d]; Regulation SHO Proposed Release, S.E.C. Release No. 34-48709, 68 Fed.Reg. 62972, 62975 (Nov. 6, 2003); Amendments to Regulation SHO, 71 Fed.Reg. 41710, 41712 (July 21, 2006) [\u201clarge and persistent fails to deliver . . . can be indicative of manipulative naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company\u2019s stock price. The perception of such manipulative conduct also may undermine the confidence of investors\u201d].) Thus, in <em>GFL, supra, </em>272 F.3d at page 208, the Third Circuit suggested naked short selling would be actionable if it caused an artificial depression in price, by, for instance, \u201cinjection of inaccurate information\u201d or \u201ccreation of a false impression of supply and demand,\u201d such as by means of \u201c \u2018matched buy and sell orders\u2019 to \u2018create a misleading appearance of active trading.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">D. <em>Regulation SHO: Regulating Abusive Short Sales</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The SEC began to focus on naked short selling and its potential abuses in 2003 and 2004. (See Walker &amp; Forbes, <em>SEC Enforcement Actions and Issuer Litigation in the Context of a \u201cShort Attack\u201d </em>(2013) 68 Bus. Law. 687, 691 [relating history of SEC regulation of short sales, particularly through Regulation SHO].) It recognized manipulative short selling could pose problems for the markets and took \u201csteps to restrict or prohibit it in various situations. See Regulation SHO Proposed Release, SEC Rel. No. 34-48709, 68 Fed.Reg. 62972, 62975-78 (Nov. 6, 2003); Short Sales, SEC Rel. No. 34-50103, 69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Fed.Reg. 48008, 48009 (Aug. 6, 2004); Amendments to Regulation SHO, SEC Rel. No. 34-56212, 72 Fed.Reg. 45544 (Aug. 7, 2007); Emergency Order, SEC Rel. No. 34-58166 (July 15, 2008).\u201d <em>(Pet Quarters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. </em>(8th Cir. 2009) 559 F.3d 772, 776, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In its 2003 proposal to regulate, the SEC warned: \u201cNaked short selling can have a number of negative effects on the market, particularly when the fails to deliver persist for an extended period of time and result in a significantly large unfulfilled delivery obligation at the clearing agency where trades are settled. At times, the amount of fails to deliver may be greater than the total public float. In effect the naked short seller unilaterally converts a securities contract (which should settle in three days after the trade date) into an undated futures-type contract, which the buyer might not have agreed to or that would have been priced differently. The seller\u2019s failure to deliver securities may also adversely affect certain rights of the buyer, such as the right to vote. More significantly, naked short sellers enjoy greater leverage than if they were required to borrow securities and deliver within a reasonable time period, and they may use this additional leverage to engage in trading activities that deliberately depress the price of a security.\u201d (Regulation SHO Proposed Release, S.E.C. Release No. 34-48709, 68 Fed.Reg. 62972, 62975 (Nov. 6, 2003), fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The following year, in 2004, the SEC adopted Regulation SHO, which imposes two requirements \u2014 \u201clocate\u201d and \u201cdelivery\u201d \u2014 aimed at curtailing intentional naked short sales. <em>(Electronic Trading Group, LLC v. Banc of America Securities LLC </em>(2d Cir. 2009) 588 F.3d 128, 135-136 <em>(Electronic </em>Trading), citing 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.203 (2014).) The regulation first imposes \u201ca \u2018locate\u2019 requirement.... See 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.203(b)(1 )(i) \u2014 (iii) (\u2018A broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order in an equity security from another person . . . unless the broker or dealer has: (i) [bjorrowed the security, or entered into a bona-fide arrangement to borrow the security; or (ii) [Reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due. . . .\u2019). Regulation SHO also imposes a \u2018delivery\u2019 requirement .... See 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.203(b)(3) (with certain enumerated exceptions, \u2018[i]f a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position ... in a threshold security for thirteen consecutive settlement days, the participant shall immediately thereafter close out the fail to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity\u2019).\u201d <em>(Electronic Trading, supra, </em>588 F.3d at pp. 135-136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">In other words, Regulation SHO requires brokers to have a reasonable belief they can \u201clocate\u201d the shares to be sold short and requires \u201cparticipants]\u201d \u2014 i.e., clearing firms \u2014 to \u201cdeliver\u201d shares on a timely basis. Bona fide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>market makers\u2019 trades, however, are exempt from the locate requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.203(b)(2)(iii) (2014).) Thus, market makers and their brokers, when engaged in legitimate trading, can commence a short sale without first worrying about whether they have ready access to the shares. The delivery requirement, in turn, only applies to \u201cthreshold securities],\u201d meaning certain listed securities already suffering numerous fails to deliver (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.203(c)(6) (2014)), and clearing firms can \u201creasonably\u201d delegate the obligation to deliver shares to bona fide market maker clients. (17 C.F.R. 242.203(b)(3)(vi) (2014); see Short Sales, S.E.C. Release No. 34-50103, <em>supra, </em>2004 WL 1697019 at pp. *1, *16, *44.) Overstock, at all relevant times, was a threshold security.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">E. <em>SEC and Exchange Actions Against Market Maker Clients of Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Following the enactment of Regulation SHO, the SEC and several exchanges brought enforcement actions against a number of market participants for violating locate and delivery requirements, including two market maker clients of defendants, Steven Hazan and Scott Arenstein. While Hazan and Arenstein purported to be bona fide market makers, in fact, they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Hazan, a New York resident, was sanctioned in an August 2009 SEC order for violating both locate and delivery requirements. <em>(In the Matter of Hazan Capital Management, LLC, </em>S.E.C. Release No. 60441 (Aug. 5, 2009) 2009 WL 2392842.) Among numerous other findings, the Commission found Hazan was not acting as a bona fide market maker and violated Regulation SHO when executing riskless and profitable \u201creverse conversion\u201d trades and related \u201creset\u201d trades. (2009 WL 2392842 at pp. *l-*2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In the reverse conversion trades, Hazan would sell short a hard-to-borrow threshold security to a counterparty. He would also buy from that counter-party a call option in the security and sell to that counterparty a put option in the security, such that he would eliminate all market risk associated with the short sale. Because all three components of the reverse conversion were priced interdependently, Hazan was assured an \u201cagreed-upon\u201d profit. <em>(In the Matter of Hazan Capital Management, </em>supra, 2009 WL 2392842 at p. *3.) Meanwhile, the counterparty \u2014 for instance, a brokerage firm such as Goldman Brokerage or Merrill Brokerage \u2014 was willing to pay this price to Hazan to \u201cobtain\u201d on its books shares of the hard-to-borrow threshold security, which it could lend for a profit until the put and call options expired. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cConsequently\u201d explained the SEC, \u201cprime brokers created the demand for the reverse conversion to create inventory for stock loans on hard to borrow securities and options market makers like [Hazan] fed this demand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Hazan employed additional nefarious trading practices to ensure the short sale portions of the reverse conversions remained \u201cnaked\u201d over time. Specifically, when alerted by clearing firms of his Regulation SHO obligation to deliver shares so settlement could occur, Hazan engaged in \u201csham reset transactions\u201d that only gave the appearance of delivery, while actually perpetuating his undelivered short positions. <em>(In the Matter of Hazan Capital Management, supra, </em>2009 WL 2392842 at p. *2.) Hazan would \u201cobtain\u201d the necessary shares for delivery by buying from another market maker who was also selling short and who similarly never intended to deliver shares to Hazan. <em>(Id. </em>at p. *3.) Meanwhile, Hazan would \u201cpair\u201d or hedge his new \u201cpurchase\u201d with option trades, creating what the SEC called \u201cmarried puts\u201d or \u201cbuy-writes,\u201d sometimes using \u201cFLEX options.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. <em>*2, </em>*4.) Even though Kazan\u2019s clearing firm \u2014 a firm such as Goldman Clearing or Merrill Clearing \u2014 would not receive actual delivery of the shares, it nevertheless would record the transactions as generating a \u201cclose out\u201d and a new long position. <em>(Id. </em>at p. *4.) There was also an appearance of delivery of the \u201cpurchased\u201d shares back to the other market maker (who had never delivered them in the first place). <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the end, Hazan would reestablish his previous short position, still naked, while succeeding in having the Regulation SHO 13-day delivery clock, in the clearing firms\u2019 eyes, \u201creset\u201d to day one. As settlement dates approached again and again, Hazan would repeat this process until the options on the original reverse conversion trade \u201cexpired or were assigned, thus\u201d finally \u201cclosing out the short position and eliminating the synthetic long position that the short position had hedged.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Hazan pocketed over $3 million through his trading strategy. The SEC ordered him to disgorge it, enjoined him from further violations of Regulation SHO, censured his organization and barred him from association with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>broker or dealer, with the right to reapply for association after five years. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issued a similar order regarding the same conduct.

Plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint, filed in April 2009, alleged several causes of action, including as relevant here, violations of California\u2019s Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (\u00a7 25000 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In December 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint, seeking to add a cause of action under New Jersey\u2019s RICO statute against the Merrill and Goldman defendants. According to plaintiffs, the new RICO claim was simply a new theory based on facts unearthed late in discovery on their California securities claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Defendants, though wary of the new complaint, ultimately chose to acquiesce in its filing and entered into a stipulation with plaintiffs, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>became an order of the trial court in January 2011. In the stipulation, the parties recited their conflicting positions on the motion for leave to amend (defendants believed the fourth amended complaint was defective and prejudicial, while plaintiffs did not) and noted the court\u2019s \u201ctentative inclination,\u201d expressed at a case management conference, \u201cto address any issues of prejudice ... by continuing the trial date.\u201d The stipulation also expressly stated defendants were \u201cnot waiving, and expressly reserve[d], all rights to file in response to the Fourth Amended Complaint any and all pleadings, motions, and other responses on any grounds available under law or equity.\u201d The complaint was deemed filed, and the trial date was continued for approximately three months, to December 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">As advertised, and as pertinent here, plaintiffs\u2019 fourth amended complaint realleged violations of sections 25400 and 25500 and additionally alleged a violation of New Jersey\u2019s RICO statute (N.J. Stat. 2C:41-2.c.-d.).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Defendants demurred to the New Jersey RICO claim, arguing California law, not New Jersey law, should apply and, in any case, plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the New Jersey law. They did not ask the trial court to dismiss the new complaint based on prejudicial delay, but sought denial of further leave to amend on that ground. Ruling from the bench on May 10, the trial court concluded the allegations about conduct in New Jersey were vague and conclusory, did not disclose whether actionable trade or commerce occurred in that state, and thus failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The trial court also found such lack of detail in the pleadings so close to trial \u201cpernicious to defendants.\u201d However, rather than denying leave to amend outright, it allowed plaintiffs to submit a proposed fifth amended complaint, stating it would consider granting leave based on the contents of the proposed pleading. Plaintiffs promptly submitted a proposed amended complaint with over 50 pages of additional allegations in support of their New Jersey RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">After extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, the trial court, on August 1, 2011, denied leave to file the proposed fifth amended complaint. It cited two grounds: (1) granting leave to add the new RICO claim would prejudice defendants on the eve of trial; and (2) the RICO claim \u201cwould be futile because the facts as alleged ... do not warrant the application of New Jersey RICO [law] to this case under California choice-of-law principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">2. <em>Summary Judgment on the Corporations Code and Unfair Competition Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Two weeks later, on August 19, 2011, defendants moved for summary judgment on <em>the </em>remaining causes of action, including those based on California\u2019s securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Defendants advanced several arguments as to plaintiffs\u2019 state law securities claims; (1) no actionable conduct occurred <em>in </em>California, (2) defendants did not \u201ceffect\u201d any stock transactions, (3) defendants\u2019 conduct was not manipulative, (4) defendants did not act for the purpose of \u201cinducing\u201d others to trade in a manipulated stock, (5) defendants\u2019 conduct did not cause any decline in Overstock\u2019s share price and thus did not result in injury to plaintiffs, and (6) federal securities laws and regulations preempted the state law claims. We do not discuss the parties\u2019 extensive evidentiary showing here, but do so in the next section in discussing the merits of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The trial court heard three days of argument on evidentiary objections to the documents filed in connection with the summary judgment motions and a full day of argument on the merits. In an order dated January 10, 2012, the court granted the motions. As to the state law securities claims relevant here, the court ruled plaintiffs \u201cfailed to raise [any] triable issue of material fact supportive of finding that any act by any defendant foundational to liability, causation, or damages occurred in California.\u201d The court declined to reach any of the other grounds for judgment defendants had urged. It issued a final, comprehensive order on April 11 and entered judgment the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs seek reversal of the dismissal of their New Jersey RICO claim and reversal of the summary judgment on their California\u2019s Corporate Securities Law of 1968 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">A. <em>New Jersey RICO </em>Claim<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">B. <em>California\u2019s Corporate Securities Law of 1968 Claim</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AeJ\">1. <em>Sections 25400 and 25500</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u201cCorporations Code section 25400, a part of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968 (Corp.

Subdivisions (c) and (e) deal with \u2018tipster sheets\u2019 where either a broker-dealer or other person engaged in the pool operations, or a third person employed by the principals, disseminates information that the price of a security will rise or fall because of the market operations of the pool.\u201d (Ibid.; see 1 Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[2][c], p. 14-61 (rel. 39-7/2011).)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201c[T]he more general and fundamental prohibitions\u201d of section 25400 are set forth in subdivisions (b) and (d).

Subdivision (b) makes it unlawful \u201c[t]o effect, alone or with one or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security or raising or depressing the price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>such security for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others.\u201d (\u00a7 25400, subd.

The first is the meaning of the term \u201c[t]o effect\u201d a series of transactions in a security. (\u00a7 25400, subd. (b), italics added.) The second is the distinction between liability as a principal, and aider and abettor liability. (See <em>California Amplifier, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 113 [a private civil action under \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500 does not reach aiders and abettors].)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">2. <em>\u201cEffecting\u201d a Trade Under Section 25400 Is Not Limited to Beneficial Sellers and Buyers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Defendants contend section 25400, subdivision (b), reaches only the beneficial sellers and buyers of manipulated securities and does not reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>entities that execute, clear and settle trades for clients. Thus, according to defendant clearing firms, for example, no section 25400, subdivision (b), claim can lie against them as a matter of law. Rather, any claim under this subdivision would have to be advanced against their former trader clients, such as Kazan and Arenstein, in whose name the manipulative trades were made and who have been punished by the SEC and major exchanges.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Section 25400, subdivision (b) could have been drafted to apply only to beneficial sellers and buyers. But it was not. Rather, this subdivision applies to \u201cany person, directly or indirectly\u201d who \u201ceffect[s], alone or with one or more other persons, a series of transactions.\u201d (\u00a7 25400, subd (b), italics added.) This is in stark contrast to other provisions of section 25400 that apply to narrower classes of persons. (\u00a7 25400, subd. (a) [subd. (a)(1) applies to those who \u201ceffect\u201d transactions, while subd. (a)(2) and (3) apply only to those who \u201center an order or orders\u201d]; <em>id., </em>subds. (c), (d) [both applying only to \u201ca broker-dealer or other person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The verb \u201c \u2018to effect\u2019 means \u2018to bring about; produce as a result; cause; accomplish.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s New World Dict. (3d college ed. 1988) p. 432.)\u201d <em>(People v. Brown </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1361, 1368 [277 Cal.Rptr. 309].) A \u201c \u2018Broker-dealer,\u2019 \u201d in turn, is defined under California\u2019s securities law as \u201cany person engaged in the business of <em>effecting transactions </em>in securities in this state for the account of others or for his own account.\u201d (\u00a7 25004, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, the plain language of the securities laws contemplates those \u201ceffecting\u201d a transaction can include someone other than the beneficial seller or buyer, and can include broker-dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a et seq.; SEA), on which section 25400 was based, also uses the terminology \u201ceffect ... a series of transactions\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(a)(2)), and that terminology is construed broadly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Weisscredit Banca Commerciale E D\u2019Investimenti </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1971) 325 F.Supp. 1384, 1393-1394.) The legislative history of the SEA shows \u201cthe term \u2018effect\u2019 as used in Section 9 of the 1934 Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i) and other sections means \u2018to (participate) in a transaction whether as principal, <em>agent, </em>or both\u2019.

Release No. 605 (Apr. 7, 1936) 1936 WL 31604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Moreover, reading section 9 of the SEA to reach, as appropriate, agents of beneficial sellers and buyers also harmonizes the section with other provisions of the SEA and its regulations, which, like California\u2019s definitional statute, speak of brokers \u201ceffecting\u201d transactions by carrying out various agency and back-office functions, including clearing and settlement. (See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(4) [a broker \u201cmeans any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others\u201d]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 78bb(e)(3)(C) [\u201ca person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he . . .

Indeed, the case does not even consider the meaning of the term \u201ceffect\u201d in section 25400, subdivision (b). The complaint in <em>Kamen </em>\u201cpurported] to state a cause of action under section 25400, <em>subdivision (d).\u201d (Kamen, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 202, italics added.) That subdivision, in contrast to subdivision (b), prohibits a \u201ca broker-dealer or other person <em>selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase\u201d </em>a security from making any \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d statement \u201cfor the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>such security by others.\u201d (\u00a7 25400, subd. (d), italics added.) While the defendants in Kamen, a corporate officer and an accounting firm, were accused of mating false statements about the company\u2019s performance, neither sold or offered for sale any of the company\u2019s shares. <em>(Kamen, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 200.) Thus, neither was liable under the plain language of <em>subdivision (d), </em>which is strikingly different from the language of subdivision (b). <em>(Kamen, </em>at p. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Defendants also point out the authors of Marsh &amp; Volk were heavily involved in the drafting of the state securities laws, and their treatise states section 25400 generally reaches only those \u201cengaged in market activity.\u201d (Marsh &amp; Volk, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[4], p. 14-66 (rel. 42-7/2014).) The treatise then continues, \u201cSubdivision (a), dealing with matched orders, and Subdivision (b), dealing with liability for a series of transactions manipulating the price of a security, by their very nature require that the defendant be a purchaser or seller, since the conduct prohibited is associated with a market transaction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We have no disagreement with Marsh &amp; Volk\u2019s general observation, as one can \u201cengage in market activity\u201d by executing, clearing and settling trades. However, for all the reasons we have discussed, we conclude Marsh &amp; Volk\u2019s second statement is unsupported and incorrect. In fact, the treatise provides no analysis on this point, let alone any discussion of either the statutory language or the like provisions of section 9 of the SEA on which Corporations Code section 25400 was based. (See <em>Diamond, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1055 [the Marsh &amp; Volk treatise cannot be invoked in favor of a statutory interpretation contrary to a statute\u2019s plain language].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">3. <em>Primary Versus Aider and Abettor Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Having concluded any person who \u201ceffect[s] ... a series of transactions\u201d can include not only beneficial sellers and buyers of shares, but also brokerage and clearing firms that execute, clear and settle the trades, we next consider under what circumstances brokerage and clearing firms can incur liability, given the well-established rule that a private civil action under sections 25400 and 25500 does not reach aiders and abettors. Rather, only primary actors are subject to civil liability for damages. <em>(Kamen, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 206, citing <em>Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.

Any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator . . . , assuming <em>all </em>of the requirements for primary liability ... are met. ...

On the one hand, the trades were arguably legitimate efforts to reduce Blech\u2019s debt balance on Bear Steams\u2019s books; on the other, they were arguably known by Bear Steams to be propping up the price of the traded securities. <em>(Blech II, supra, </em>961 F.Supp. at pp. 577-578; <em>In re Blech Securities Litigation </em>(S.D.N.Y., Oct. 17, 2002, No. 94 CIV.7696 RWS) 2002 WL 31356498 pp. *1, *15 <em>(Blech III).) </em>In <em>Blech II, </em>the district court denied a motion to dismiss. While allegations Bear Stearns cleared or otherwise \u201cengaged in\u201d manipulative trades were insufficient to state a claim, as even knowingly processing the sham trades of others does not give rise to direct liability, additional allegations Bear Steams \u201cdirected\u201d the sales and cleared the resulting trades to its pecuniary benefit, and did so knowing Blech\u2019s fraudulent purpose, brought Bear Steams into the realm of a primary violator. <em>(Blech II, supra, </em>961 F.Supp. at pp. 584-585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">In <em>Blech III, </em>Bear Steams moved for summary judgment. Evidence corroborated the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of Bear Steams\u2019s orchestration of the trades and knowledge of the manipulation of the market. Not only did Bear Stearns direct trades, but it decided with Blech who should be on the</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>purchasing side of his sales.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(Blech III, supra, </em>2002 WL 31356498 at p. *11.) Indeed, the plaintiffs alleged, \u201cthese demands forced parking and trading <em>between Blech Accounts </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *15, italics added.) Bear Stearns contended in turn, its \u201cactions with respect to debit demands were simply consistent with its agreement ... to serve as . . . clearing broker,\u201d an agreement that, under NYSE Rule 382, allocated back-office functions to Bear Steams and compliance with mies and regulations to Blech as an introducing broker. <em>(Blech III, </em>at pp. *15, *5-*6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The district court acknowledged, \u201cmargin calls by a clearing broker or a failure to make margin calls, even with suspicion or knowledge of impropriety on the part of the initiating broker, is an appropriate and essential part of the securities business.\u201d <em>(Blech III, supra, </em>2002 WL 31356498 at p. *15.) The court concluded, however, \u201cAn agreement to clear does not constitute an absolution from securities fraud . . .\u201d and concluded the \u201ccontentions here go further.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[A] margin call made with knowledge that it will cause the initiating broker to commit a securities fraud which must be cleared by the clearing broker, constitutes direct action in connection with a contrivance to manipulate a security. Here that element of causality is at issue.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>In re Mutual Funds Inv. Litigation, </em>the district court also discussed clearing firm liability and allowed a SEA manipulation claim to proceed against two such firms when their activity extended beyond mere clearing services to providing clients with access to trading platforms that allowed for late trades and trades without time stamps. <em>(In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, supra, </em>384 F.Supp.2d at p. 862.) \u201cThese acts are \u2018manipulative or deceptive\u2019 on their face, and by virtue of the trades they enabled, they affected the worth of mutual fund shares. Thus, they are the functional equivalent in the mutual fund industry of sham transactions that artificially affect market prices in more conventional contexts. [Citation.] Moreover, these alleged acts of deception, when considered with other allegations concerning the extent of Bank of America\u2019s and Bear Stearns\u2019 activities on behalf of late traders and high-volume market timers, imply that Bank of America and Bear Stearns did not merely assist in facilitating late trades and market timed transactions. Rather, it is reasonably inferable that they participated in initiating, instigating, and orchestrating the scheme. If discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>demonstrates this to be so, Bank of America and Bear Stearns face primary liability under <em>Central Bank.\u201d (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In contrast, clearing firms were absolved of liability in <em>Fezzani v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 2004) 384 F.Supp.2d 618. The plaintiffs in that case alleged, much as in <em>Blech, that Bear Steams </em>engaged in market manipulation under SEA section 10(b) because it knew of a client\u2019s, Baron\u2019s, activities aimed at inflating stock prices and \u201cprovided financial support to Baron, and directed Baron at times to sell the manipulated securities to the public.\u201d (384 F.Supp.2d at p. 628.) But in <em>Fezzani, </em>the allegations \u201cd[id] not cross the threshold laid out in <em>Blech III.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 642.) \u201cAll the complaint alleges\u201d is Bear Steams \u201cknew of Baron\u2019s fraud and cleared the transactions that were fraudulently made\u201d; there was no allegation Bear Steams \u201c \u2018contrived and agreed to fund\u2019 \u201d a manipulative scheme as in <em>Blech. (Fezzani, </em>at p. 642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\"><em>Scone Investments, L.P. v.

In <em>Scone, </em>a bank was \u201calleged to have directed that . . . securities be sold, not that the sale be effectuated by way of fraudulent misrepresentation. The Bank\u2019s liquidation demand is a far cry from the \u2018intimate\u2019 \u2018hands-on involvement\u2019 and participation in \u2018key decisions\u2019 about the details of the sale which would render it a primary violator.\u201d <em>(Scone, </em>at p. *8; see Abrams, A <em>Second Look at Clearing Firm Liability </em>(2001) 67 Brook. L.Rev. 479, 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Second Circuit recently addressed the \u201cnormal clearing services\u201d standard in <em>Levitt v. J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. </em>(2d Cir. 2013) 710 F.3d 454, 458-459, 466-468 <em>(Levitt) </em>in reversing a class certification order. The circuit court concluded Bear Steams had no duty to disclose a known fraud to the plaintiffs, clients of an introducing firm, Sterling Foster, which had a clearing agreement with Bear Steams making Sterling Foster responsible for monitoring its customers. The plaintiffs maintained Bear Steams knew of Sterling Foster\u2019s plan to manipulate the market for a soon-to-be-publicly-offered stock, ML Direct, by misusing insider shares supposedly subject to a lockup agreement. They further alleged Bear Sterns nonetheless agreed to clear transactions in these shares, extended Sterling Foster unsecured credit, failed to cancel trades as required by an SEC regulation (Regulation T), and failed to disclose to purchasers Sterling Foster\u2019s 400 percent profit in the underwriting. (710 F.3d at pp. 462-465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\"><em>Levitt </em>observed courts have grouped clearing firm activity into two categories: \u201cFirst, in cases where a clearing broker was simply providing normal clearing services, district courts have declined to \u2018impose . . . liability on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>clearing broker for the transgressions of the introducing broker.\u2019 [Citations.] The district courts have so held even if the clearing broker was alleged to have known that the introducing broker was committing fraud, [citation]; even if the clearing broker was alleged to have been clearing <em>sham </em>trades for the introducing broker, <em>In re Blech, </em>961 F.Supp. at 584; and even if the clearing broker was alleged to have failed to enforce margin requirements against the introducing broker \u2014 thereby allowing the introducing broker\u2019s fraud to continue \u2014 in violation of Federal Reserve and NYSE rules, [citation].\u201d <em>(Levitt, supra, </em>710 F.3d at p. 466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u201cIn the second, much more limited category of cases, district courts have found plaintiffs\u2019 allegations to be adequate \u2014 and so have permitted claims to proceed \u2014 where a clearing broker is alleged effectively to have shed its role as clearing broker and assumed direct control of the introducing firm\u2019s operations and its manipulative scheme. Thus in <em>Berwecky v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>197 F.R.D. 65 (S.D.N.Y.2000), the district court granted class certification in a suit brought by investors against clearing broker Bear Stearns for its role in the introducing firm . . . scheme to defraud investors. The <em>Berwecky </em>plaintiffs alleged that Bear Stearns \u2018asserted control over [the introducing firm\u2019s] trading operations by, <em>inter alla, </em>placing Bear, Stearns\u2019 employees at Baron\u2019s offices to observe Baron\u2019s trading activities, approving or declining to execute certain trades, imposing restrictions on Baron\u2019s inventory, and loaning funds to Baron.\u2019 . . . [][] Similarly, the district court in <em>[Blech II\\, </em>961 F.Supp. 569, found that the \u2018[c]omplaint crosse[d] the line dividing secondary liability from primary liability when it claim[ed] that Bear Steams [the clearing broker] \u201cdirected\u201d or \u201ccontrived\u201d certain allegedly fraudulent trades.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Levitt, supra, </em>710 F.3d at pp. 466-467, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Applying this dichotomy to the facts before it, <em>Levitt </em>concluded Bear Stearns did not have a duty to disclose Sterling Foster\u2019s fraud because the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to allege sufficiently direct involvement.\u201d <em>(Levitt, supra, </em>710 F.3d at p. 467.) \u201cCertainly plaintiffs here do not allege that Bear Steams, beyond merely acquiescing in the ML Direct scheme, went so far as to control and implement that scheme in the manner alleged, for example, in <em>Berwecky.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 468.) That \u201c \u2018Bear Steams <em>allowed </em>putatively sham or manipulative trades\u201d was not \u201ccomparable to <em>directing </em>or <em>instigating </em>such trades.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Thus, the threshold for primary liability on the part of clearing firms is high. They do not incur such liability when they provide \u201cnormal clearing services\u201d \u2014 and that is so even when a firm knows the trader is committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>fraud or knows it is clearing and settling sham trades. Rather, to qualify as a primary violator a clearing firm must \u201cshed its role as clearing broker\u201d and engage in conduct akin to \u201cdirecting\u201d the client\u2019s manipulative trading, or \u201cdeciding with\u201d the client how to engage in the unlawful trading, or intentionally providing a specialized tool for the client to engage in unlawful trading, or \u201cinitiating, instigating, and orchestrating\u201d the client\u2019s unlawful scheme, or having \u201cintimate\u201d \u201chands-on involvement\u201d and participating in \u201ckey decisions\u201d about the \u201cdetails\u201d of the client\u2019s unlawful trading, or assuming \u201cdirect control of\u2019 the client\u2019s \u201coperations and its manipulative scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">4. <em>The Summary Judgment Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AD\">a. <em>Goldman Brokerage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Goldman Brokerage was, itself, a purchaser of reverse conversions, and plaintiff\u2019s expert, J. Marc Allaire, based on his review of Goldman documents, averred Goldman bought reverse conversions from Razan and Arenstein. Allaire and other experts also opined, based on the pricing of these trades, Goldman Brokerage knew the short sale components of these complex trades would fail and continue to fail for the duration of the options components of the trades \u2014 in short, Goldman knew the trades were shams and created a \u201cphony\u201d supply of Overstock shares. Indeed, there is evidence Goldman Brokerage acted as Arenstein\u2019s agent in executing conversion trades with itself, and acknowledged Arenstein could provide the firm a supply of shares it could not obtain \u201cin the pits.\u201d In an e-mail, for example, Goldman acknowledged such conversion trades \u201ccreate inventory to allow customers to short.\u201d In another e-mail, it acknowledged a general goal of its hedging strategies group was \u201cto create supply and perpetuate selling in stocks with a large amount of short interest.\u201d In sum, there is substantial evidence Goldman Brokerage was, itself, a beneficial purchaser of one species of the exotic trades in which Kazan and Arenstein engaged to circumvent Regulation SHO.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">There is no evidence, however, raising a triable issue Goldman Brokerage\u2019s own purchases, or its execution of Kazan\u2019s or Arenstein\u2019s or another client\u2019s sham trades in Overstock, were made <em>in </em>California. Kazan and Arenstein operated out of New York and New Jersey.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Goldman Brokerage operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>out of New York, New Jersey and Chicago. Further, plaintiffs did not rebut Goldman Brokerage\u2019s evidence that any conversion trades were consummated on regional exchanges outside of California, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Midwest Stock Exchange, or Cincinnati Stock Exchange.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Accordingly, summary judgment was properly granted as to Goldman Brokerage.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">b. <em>Merrill Brokerage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">There is a similar shortcoming in the evidence as to Merrill Brokerage. To begin with, there is no evidence Merrill Brokerage, in contrast to Goldman Brokerage, was, itself, a purchaser of reverse conversions in Overstock.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">There is evidence Eugene McCambridge, a Merrill broker in Chicago, executed some trades in Overstock shares for Mazan and Arenstein. However, McCambridge could not identify which exchange he used for any given trade. He testified at deposition he would ordinarily route NASDAQ trades through \u201cArea or P-Coast.\u201d But he was shown and testified specifically about trade tickets showing Overstock trades on the Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago. The \u201cblotters\u201d (the paperwork showing the trades) also do not identify the exchange used for the trades. Thus, whether McCambridge executed any Overstock trades on the Pacific Exchange is pure speculation, insufficient to raise a triable issue Merrill Brokerage executed trades in Overstock <em>in </em>California.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">In addition, there is no evidence the trades McCambridge executed were of the exotic variety designed to avoid Regulation SHO\u2019s delivery requirement. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts purported to identify the alleged manipulative trading and they focused on Goldman Brokerage\u2019s purchases of conversions and on the clearing firms\u2019 activities. They made no reference to the trades McCambridge executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Accordingly, summary judgment was also properly granted as to Merrill Brokerage.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">c. <em>Goldman Clearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Goldman Clearing did not have a clearing office in California, and there is no evidence this clearing firm did anything, in California or otherwise, beyond normal clearing activity. There is no evidence Goldman Clearing directed, developed, or instigated \u2014 as opposed to acquiesced in \u2014 any strategy for repeatedly failing short sales, shirking delivery obligations, or clearing sham reset transactions. (See <em>California Amplifier, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 113 [no aiding and abetting liability]; cf. <em>In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, supra, </em>384 F.Supp.2d at p. 862 [\u201creasonably inferable that they participated in <em>initiating, instigating, and orchestrating </em>the scheme\u201d (italics added)].) At best, there is evidence suggesting the firm was clearing purported market makers\u2019 sham reset transactions, was aware \u201cshort interest\u201d in Overstock was high, \u201cnoticed fails going up rather dramatically ... at [Goldman Clearing],\u201d and generally monitored client short sales in Overstock and gave clients notice of their regulatory obligations to \u201cbuy-in.\u201d However, there is no evidence raising a triable issue the firm \u201cshed its role as clearing broker and assumed direct control\u201d of the scheme to evade federal securities laws. <em>(Levitt, supra, </em>710 F.3d at p. 466.) Indeed, the evidence pertaining to Goldman Clearing does not come close to that pertaining to Merrill Clearing and to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">d. <em>Merrill Clearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Merrill Clearing, unlike Goldman Clearing, had an office in California and from that office provided clearing services to traders in Overstock shares, including Kazan and Arenstein. By February 2005, Alan Cooper, the head of the office, was having \u201cfrequent interactions\u201d with Kazan \u2014 approximately five to six times a week by telephone and e-mail. Cooper, Kazan, and Merrill Clearing\u2019s compliance department discussed Regulation SHO and, in general, a clearing firm\u2019s responsibility to ensure delivery and not to fail trades. At his deposition, Cooper claimed he and the compliance officer were not offering opinions on Regulation SHO, but simply explaining how Merrill Clearing would be implementing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In one interaction, in mid-February, Kazan was upset that Merrill Clearing was automatically borrowing shares to ensure delivery, when he expected it would not. In an internal e-mail, Cooper, based on a conversation with Kazan, relayed \u201cthe trader did not know we were going to be charging [fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>to borrow] negatives\u201d and if Merrill Clearing were to buy-in Kazan on the trade, Kazan would likely resell shares to \u201cmaintain his hedge.\u201d Cooper asked if the buy-ins could be stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">What Kazan, and in turn, Cooper, were complaining about was what Merrill termed the \u201cflipping\u201d of all trades for automatic delivery and settlement. This deprived legitimate market maker clients of Regulation SHO\u2019s exemption from the locate requirement, and deprived the clearing firm of its right under the regulation to delegate delivery obligations to bona fide market maker clients. Kazan was not the only Merrill Clearing client complaining about it. Moreover, Merrill Clearing had had a \u201cdo not flip\u201d practice for market maker clients in place prior to the time Kazan and Arenstein became clients, and the complained-about automatic \u201cflipping\u201d started with Merrill\u2019s acquisition of another firm, Sage (for whom Cooper had worked), whose computer system was not programmed to \u201chold back\u201d market maker short sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">About a week later, Kazan sent Cooper an e-mail noting an interaction with Merrill Clearing\u2019s compliance department concerning Regulation SHO, and then posing several questions: Did a clearing firm need to pay to borrow a stock if it is \u201cbeing held for less than 10 days\u201d as would be the case with a \u201cflex or short term option hedge?\u201d Could the options market maker exemption exempt trades from Regulation SHO\u2019s closeout requirements if stock did not appear on \u201cthe Reg sho list\u201d of threshold securities until after a short sale as a hedge? If Merrill Clearing were long in the stock, could Kazan use that position to offset short sales?</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On the afternoon of February 23, Cooper told colleagues, in an e-mail, Kazan was threatening to leave Merrill Clearing for another firm if Merrill could not (without providing further specifics) \u201caccommodate his trading style.\u201d One colleague responded, \u201cI would say we can\u2019t.\u201d At his deposition, Cooper could not recall what he had meant by \u201ctrading style,\u201d but admittedly knew at the time it involved trading in threshold (hard-to-borrow) stocks, doing \u201criskless\u201d trades, \u201cdelta-neutral\u201d trades, conversions, and reversals. He also admitted having at least a general understanding Kazan could profit from the spread between the pricing of the options components of reverse conversions. And he admitted the reverse conversions the SEC later investigated and for which it imposed sanctions, were the sort of trade Merrill was clearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">At around the same time \u2014 that is, February 2005 \u2014 Cooper also began working with Arenstein. Cooper spoke to Arenstein about possibly opening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>an account, and Merrill Clearing\u2019s managing director, Curt Richmond, told Arenstein he and Cooper were \u201cspeaking to compliance about Reg-SHO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">In a March 4, 2005 e-mail, Richmond and Merrill Clearing\u2019s president, Thomas Tranfaglia, Jr., discussed how Arenstein wanted to talk to Tranfaglia about Regulation SHO and Merrill Clearing\u2019s related policies. Richmond stated: \u201cAfter the Kazan incident I informed [Arenstein] that we had no interest in clearing his \u2018Reg-SHO fail with FLEX Options Strategy.\u2019 \u201d Richmond noted Arenstein had taken \u201csome of the other side of Kazan\u2019s closing trades,\u201d but told Tranfaglia \u201cit is your call.\u201d Arenstein particularly wanted to know if Merrill Clearing would charge market makers lending fees on a fail to deliver if there was no violation of Regulation SHO, and whether Merrill Clearing would give its clients a chance to \u201cget out on their own\u201d before Regulation SHO deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">At the end of the month, Cooper relayed to superiors a trading strategy suggested by Kazan \u2014 to use a \u201cone day flex\u201d in which Kazan would buy and sell calls in the same number of shares. Cooper asked, \u201c[c]ould we fail\u201d on those shares \u201cfrom the assignment the next day.\u201d The admitted goal was \u201cto reestablish a new short and not borrow it.\u201d Cooper was asked to discuss the matter in person, and the conversation went offline. At his deposition, Cooper claimed he did not believe the goal of such a trade was to evade Regulation SHO, but to address Kazan\u2019s desire to avoid fees related to the supposedly unnecessary, automated borrowing of shares imposed by the computer system Merrill Clearing had inherited from Sage.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The following month, in April 2005, Cooper filled in parts of a spreadsheet listing certain securities Kazan was holding (none of which were Overstock). In the far right column, Cooper marked down checks indicating Kazan \u201cwill not pay negative rebate\u201d and had a \u201cdesire to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In mid-May, Cooper oversaw a \u201cReg SHO test trade\u201d by Kazan. The trade would establish a new 350,000-share short position in a security (one other than Overstock) for which options had been placed before implementation of Regulation SHO, and Merrill Clearing would not process the trade for delivery.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At his deposition, Cooper again claimed the purpose of this exotic trade was not to evade Regulation SHO\u2019s delivery requirement, but to move a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>position from a \u201cfaulty\u201d account that required borrowing of shares, to a different account which would allow a bona fide market maker to sell short without borrowing. In an internal e-mail that same day, Cooper said he told Kazan he would be subject to Regulation SHO\u2019s buy-in requirement, even though Kazan had earlier hoped for assurances \u201cthat the position would not be subject to Reg Sho buy-in in 13 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The compliance department wanted to have further discussions to get more comfortable with the test trade, and wanted to have a procedure set up to deal with \u201cholding] these trades back\u201d \u2014 a procedure that it would \u201cneed ... to provide to the SEC.\u201d But the trade was already in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On May 25, 2005, after trade execution, a managing director at both Merrill entities and president and chief operating officer of Merrill Clearing, Peter Melz, responded to the compliance department\u2019s concern about the trade saying: \u201cfuck the compliance area \u2014 procedures, schmecedures.\u201d At her deposition, Merrill\u2019s compliance officer stated she watched Melz draft the e-mail and it was made as part of an in-office jest.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">By mid-2005, Merrill Clearing remedied the computer trading system it had acquired from Sage, and completed implementation of an automated \u201cdo not flip\u201d process. This new process ensured trades in negative rebate securities (those, like Overstock, with high borrow fees) would not automatically \u201cflip\u201d to settlement when a market maker was selling short. Thus, Merrill Clearing would no longer inform Merrill Brokerage of the need to acquire shares to settle such short sales. Both firms were aware that if the brokerage firm kept on its books the shares of negative rebate securities it otherwise would have provided to comply with Regulation SHO, those shares could be lent out for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Merrill Clearing claims the \u201cdo not flip\u201d process was the means by which, as allowed by Regulation SHO, it allocated responsibility for delivery to bona fide market maker clients. Yet, Merrill still had a policy of (1) giving such clients notice of impending 13-day deadlines to close out fail to deliver positions, and (2) actually \u201cbuying in\u201d clients who did not comply \u2014 a \u201cbuy in\u201d being a trade ostensibly conducted to close out a fail to deliver and enable delivery to a waiting buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">By summer 2005, discussions within Merrill turned to handling \u201cbuy ins.\u201d In late July, Cooper noted Kazan \u201ctrades many hard to borrows and will need as much color [(that is, information)] on potential buy-ins as possible.\u201d On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>August 29, one of Cooper\u2019s employees, Hugh Skinner, wrote to Cooper that Hazan wanted early notification of buy-ins because late notice \u201ccould prevent him from selling into the buy-in.\u201d At his deposition, Cooper stated traders like Hazan wanted estimates of impending buy-ins so they could \u201csell into it\u201d and, in the case of naked shorts, reobtain the naked short position and remain risk neutral. This would, Cooper understood, effectively \u201creset\u201d the Regulation SHO clock and give traders, at least from Merrill\u2019s perspective, a new period of time to complete delivery of shares. As we have discussed, the SEC found this scheme to reset the Regulation SHO clock and avoid delivery to be an egregious violation of the regulation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It was the San Francisco office that provided the notification function for Hazan and other clients in and around August 2005, but not necessarily for the entire period relevant here. At his deposition, Cooper denied taking an active role in Hazan\u2019s trades or the trades of other Merrill Clearing clients, and viewed his role as largely clerical. He also denied reviewing trades to see if anyone repeatedly used reset transactions to perpetuate the naked short positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Despite Cooper\u2019s assertions of passive ignorance, on August 4, 2005, a Merrill Clearing director-level employee, Bill Stein, noticed Cooper\u2019s traders \u201cwere knowingly putting on shorts and then basically rolling them every 13 days.\u201d At his deposition, Cooper said he did not recall exactly what this statement referred to, but conceded Stein was referring to \u201cbeating the Reg SHO obligation.\u201d Certainly by July of 2006, Cooper understood this regulation-evasion aspect of the trading strategy Hazan and others were pursuing, noting \u201cFLEXs were being questioned\u201d and wrote in an e-mail, \u201cA few traders have figured out how to use the FLEXs to deal with Reg SHO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In December 2005, Merrill Clearing\u2019s chief compliance officer sent a bulletin noting the firm had received regulatory inquiries and scrutiny over \u201cflex trades by two . . . clients in OSTK.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>In an internal January 2006 telephone call, the compliance officer talked about Arenstein\u2019s trading, how he was not acting as a bona fide market maker, and how it was \u201cnot okay\u201d to be \u201crecycling\u201d his \u201cshort position.\u201d She said: \u201cYou know, I \u2014 we really \u2014 I got to set up a meeting where we have to talk to the business, because these guys, they must be spoken to. Like \u2014 and not by you. You know what I\u2019m saying? Like this is not okay. Like you cannot be recycling this short position. I mean, I don\u2019t understand. If he\u2019s got \u2014 If he\u2019s got, you know, a buy-in due today, tomorrow, and the next day, right? Then he can\u2019t short anymore in these next few days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">That same month, the compliance officer followed up with an e-mail to Merrill Clearing executives, telling them \u201cas you know\u201d Arenstein had been involved in trading activity the NASD (National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.) was questioning as inconsistent with Regulation SHO, and informing them of the flex option recycling scheme and how Merrill\u2019s net fails to deliver in Overstock were not diminishing. She noted if the firm were to drop Kazan and Arenstein, the database of fails \u201cshrinks unbelievably.\u201d There is also evidence, during this timeframe, of compliance communications with Kazan and Arenstein during which they insisted they were acting as bona fide market makers, and a telephone call to Arenstein confronting him about recycling of trades and requesting him to do real buy-ins.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Nevertheless, Merrill Clearing continued to clear Kazan\u2019s and Arenstein\u2019s trades for another seven months and did not even begin to wind down its \u201cclearing relationship\u201d with them until August 2006 \u2014 just before the SEC and New York exchange issued stipulated sanctions orders against the two traders. Even after Kazan was told to leave Merrill Clearing, he continued to increase his short positions there for several months before he was finally terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">All told, Merrill Clearing cleared Kazan\u2019s and Arenstein\u2019s exotic trades designed to support perpetually naked short positions for more than a year, and as a result failed to deliver Overstock shares for settlement every single day between August 1, 2005, and the end of 2006. The number of failed deliveries quickly rose above a million shares, and at one point reached three million shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">(i) <em>Triable Issue Merrill Clearing Was a Primary Violator</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">As we have discussed, even if there is a triable issue Merrill Clearing knew Kazan\u2019s and Arenstein\u2019s trades were designed to evade Regulation SHO and knew it was clearing sham trades, that is not enough to raise a triable issue of primary liability under sections 25400 and 25500. Rather, the evidence must be such that Merrill Clearing\u2019s conduct was arguably akin to \u201cdirecting\u201d Kazan\u2019s and Arenstein\u2019s trading schemes <em>(Levitt, </em>supra, 710 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>pp. 466-467), or to deciding with them how to effect a manipulative trade (see <em>Blech III, supra, </em>2002 WL 31356498 at p. *11), or to providing calculated \u201caccess\u201d to the means to engage in unlawful trading <em>(In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, supra, </em>384 F.Supp.2d at pp. 861-862), \u2018or to \u201cinitiating, instigating, and orchestrating the scheme\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 862), or to having \u201cintimate,\u201d \u201c \u2018hands-on involvement\u2019 \u201d and participating in \u201c \u2018key decisions\u2019 \u201d about the \u201cdetails\u201d of the exotic trades <em>(Scone Investments, L.P. v. American Third Market Corp., supra, </em>1998 WL 205338 at pp. *8-*9).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">While a close question, we conclude the evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue Merrill Clearing did more than provide normal clearing services, bearing in mind the observation of the district court in <em>Blech III, </em>that \u201c[i]n this difficult . . . distinction between aiding and abetting and direct action, the line will be drawn with respect to summary judgment in favor of protecting the investing public rather than the clearing broker.\u201d <em>(Blech III, supra, </em>2002 WL 31356498 at p. *15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">There is clearly a triable issue Merrill Clearing had knowledge, indeed abundant knowledge, its clients were rolling shorts and engaging in sham reset transactions to mimic the appearance of genuine trading. There is a triable issue Merrill did not believe, or, at the very least, could not have reasonably believed, Hazan and Arenstein were bona fide market makers engaging in legitimate trading. And there is a triable issue Merrill took an active, direct role in their trading schemes to cause, and to profit from, ongoing failures to deliver shares in short sales of Overstock, as well as other hard-to-borrow securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">For example, there is a triable issue Cooper and others within Merrill Clearing purposefully developed or \u201ccontrived\u201d procedures, at the request of Hazan and Arenstein, by which Merrill Clearing could, and repeatedly did, effect their one-day FLEX options \u201cto reestablish a new short and not borrow it.\u201d Arguably, Hazan effectively asked Merrill Clearing to review and approve the exotic \u201ctest trade\u201d he concocted to flagrantly violate the securities laws. Not only did Merrill give its stamp of approval, it continued to clear Kazan\u2019s unlawful trades even after compliance personnel made it clear this was \u201cnot ok.\u201d Indeed, Merrill did so for another seven months and only stopped clearing those trades on the eve of the SEC sanction ruling. Such contriving behavior is akin to that found actionable in <em>In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation, supra, </em>384 F.Supp.2d at page 862, in which the clearing firm provided clients with access to trading platforms that enabled manipulative late trades, and in <em>Blech III, </em>in which the clearing firm and clients discussed and agreed upon a strategy that would manipulate the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Even if Merrill\u2019s do-not-flip procedures were initially designed as a legitimate means to correct the Sage computer problem, they arguably became deliberately employed as tools to implement Kazan\u2019s and Arenstein\u2019s well-understood strategy of perpetuating naked short positions. Similarly, even if buy-in notifications are usually normal clearing activities, it is arguable Cooper went beyond giving routine notice and knowingly coached Kazan and Arenstein on handling buy-in obligations for the very purpose of selling into them and reobtaining naked short positions. Moreover, the arguable buy-in coaching of these traders cannot be viewed in isolation from the evidence showing Merrill Clearing\u2019s involvement with the development, for these same abusive traders, of the process to \u201croll shorts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Cooper\u2019s techniques were, indeed, known, and ratified, within Merrill Clearing. Cooper\u2019s clients, said one colleague, \u201cwere knowingly putting on shorts and then basically rolling them every 13 days.\u201d In 2005, Tanfaglia was given the \u201ccall\u201d on whether to add Arenstein as a client given his \u201cFLEX Options Strategy\u201d and the \u201cKazan incident\u201d \u2014 and Arenstein became a client. In early 2006, a Merrill Clearing compliance officer was aware of Arenstein \u201crecycling\u201d his \u201cshort position\u201d and called for action, but the abusive trading practices continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In sum, while close, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as it must be on review from summary judgment, it suffices to raise a triable issue Merrill Clearing, through its San Francisco office, did more than provide normal clearing services, and did more than knowingly clear its clients\u2019 manipulative trades and sham reset transactions. There is enough to commit to a jury the difficult \u201cdistinction between aiding and abetting and direct action.\u201d <em>(Blech III, supra, </em>2002 WL 31356498 at p. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">(ii)-(iv)*</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">e.

The California address for Group One in some of Merrill Clearing\u2019s trading records does not suffice to establish the location of trades or other interactions with Goldman Brokerage. Plaintiffs cited no deposition testimony or other evidence regarding the location of Group One or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>trading history it had with Goldman Brokerage, in particular. Indeed, while plaintiffs\u2019 expert stated Merrill Clearing\u2019s \u201cblue sheets show that Group One was located in San Francisco in 2005-2006,\u201d the expert noticeably refrained from stating Group One conducted manipulative conversion trades with Goldman Brokerage in California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> While plaintiffs\u2019 expert Allaire links the potentially California-based Pacific Exchange with the <em>clearing </em>firms and various sham reset trades, no linkage is made to Goldman Brokerage. The omission is striking. It is not enough, as Allaire states, that Goldman Brokerage purchased conversions whose components were cleared by, for instance, Merrill Clearing, in a manner that links up with California. The question is what did Goldman Brokerage do in California? There is no evidence Goldman Brokerage did anything actionable in California.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> Under the version of Regulation SHO in effect between 2005 and 2007, naked positions put on before a security became a threshold security were \u201cgrandfathered\u201d and not subject to the regulation\u2019s ordinary delivery requirement. (See 17 C.F.R. former \u00a7 242.203(b)(3)(i)-(ii) [effective to Aug. 28, 2005].) None of the parties have discussed whether any component of this \u201ctest\u201d trade was or was not grandfathered under the then effective regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> While Merrill claims the sanction orders found Hazan and Arenstein deceived their clearing firms and thus exonerated the firms, that is not a fair reading of the orders. The SEC .order against Hazan, for example, describes how, under Regulation SHO, \u201ca clearing firm is permitted reasonably to allocate a fail-to-deliver position to a broker or dealer whose short sale resulted in the position\u201d and states Kazan\u2019s clearing firm \u201cnotified\u201d him on numerous occasions it had \u201callocated\u201d to him the closeout obligation. The order <em>goes on </em>to point out the prime brokerage firms \u201ccreated the demand for the reverse conversion\u201d trades Hazan was making because by purchasing those conversions they could \u201ccreate inventory.\u201d It further discusses how Kazan\u2019s \u201cclearing firm,\u201d based on Kazan\u2019s \u201cpurported \u2018purchase\u2019 of shares,\u201d would \u201creset\u201d his \u201cReg SHO close out obligation to day one\u201d thus giving him \u201canother thirteen settlement days in which to close out the short position.\u201d The SEC concluded this strategy was a patent violation of the regulation \u2014 and there is no exoneration of the clearing firms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 513.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
