FedEx organizes those benefits under two plans. The first is the Short Term Disability (STD) Plan. It provides up to twenty-six weeks of paid leave for disabled workers. Once an employee exhausts her twenty-six weeks under the STD Plan, she moves to the Long Term Disability (LTD) Plan. The LTD Plan provides up to twenty-four months of additional paid leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">An employee does not necessarily have to wait twenty-four months to receive her full LTD benefits. Section 3.3(c) of the LTD Plan \u2014 which is the focus of this case \u2014 is a \u201cLump Sum Payment\u201d provision. It states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-19\">If a Disabled Covered Employee has Permanent Occupational Restrictions and Limitations, as determined by the Claims Paying Administrator, which prevent him from returning to his regular occupation and if he is unable to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>an available job with the Company within the time stated in the Company\u2019s applicable personnel policies and if the Company is unable to reasonably accommodate him, as required by applicable personnel policies and law, then such Covered Employee, upon the termination of his Employment Status, shall be paid a Lump Sum Present Value (not to be offset by amounts earned from employment with someone other than Employer) equal to the remaining benefits available under the Plan for an Occupational Disability, but excluding in any case the value of any Pilot and Crew Member Supplementary Disability Benefit. The foregoing shall not prevent such Covered Employee from voluntarily resigning his' position prior to the expiration of the period available for placement in another position, in which case the Lump Sum Present Value Payment shall be made at that time....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A82\">FedEx gives its employees ninety days to search for an available job. So an employee . is eligible for a lump sum payment under Section 3.3(c) if: (1) the \u201cClaims Paying Administrator\u201d determines that the employee has \u201cPermanent Occupational Restrictions and Limitations\u201d that prevent the employee from returning to her regular job, (2) the employee is unable in ninety days to find another job at FedEx that is available and for which she can perform the necessary duties, and (3) FedEx cannot reasonably accommodate the injured employee\u2019s restrictions and limitations so that a job is available in the ninety-day period. If those three criteria are met, then the employee \u201cshall be paid\u201d a lump sum for the amount of her remaining LTD benefits, offset by whatever she earns from another employer. There are two possible triggers for the payment: (1) FedEx terminates the employee, or (2) the employee resigns before the ninety-day period ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Braden hurt her back in 2008 while working as a FedEx Station Manager. As a Station Manager, Braden had to be able to lift seventy-five pounds and with assistance maneuver packages weighing over seventy-five pounds. Braden\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Howard Jackson, determined that her back injury prevented that kind of heavy lifting, so she was placed on the STD Plan beginning August 24, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Her twenty-six weeks of STD benefits ran out on February 21, 2011, and she moved to the LTD Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">On February 25, 2011, Braden received a letter from Deborah Lamp, a FedEx human resources worker. The letter was titled \u201cReturn to Work with Permanent Restrictions.\u201d It told Braden that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">A review of your medical status indicates you have reached maximum medical improvement and have been released to return to work with permanent restrictions of no lifting over 10 [pounds] and no overhead reaching. These restrictions limit your ability to perform the essential functions of your position [as a Station Manager].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The letter went on to inform her that she had ninety days to seek a position at FedEx for which she could perform the essential functions, but that she also had the option to \u201cvoluntarily resign within the 90 day period and receive a lump sum payout of your remaining disability benefits.\u201d Braden applied for one position but was not hired. She received a second letter from Lamp on August 26, 2011. It told Braden that she had \u201creached maximum medical improvement and [was] perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>nently incapable of performing the essential functions of [her] position as a [Station Manager], with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d The letter went on to conclude that it was \u201cnecessary to terminate [Braden\u2019s] employment since [she had] been unable to return from [her] medical leave of absence.\u201d The August 26 letter did not mention any lump sum payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A few weeks later, Braden got more bad news. When FedEx terminated Braden, it notified Aetna Life Insurance Company, which serves as the \u201cClaims Paying Administrator\u201d for the LTD Plan. Over a period of several weeks AETNA investigated Braden\u2019s case. During its investigation, Aetna had Dr. Jackson complete a \u201cPhysician Report for the Federal Express Disability Claim Unit\u201d form. In filling it out, Dr. Jackson indicated that Braden\u2019s workplace restrictions were not permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At the conclusion of its investigation, Aetna determined that Braden was not owed any further benefits under the LTD Plan. It sent her a letter, dated September 13, 2011, informing her that she would not be receiving LTD benefits beyond August 25, 2011. In Aetna\u2019s view, Braden\u2019s LTD benefits ended that day because it was her last full day of employment before she was terminated. The letter justified that decision by citing Section 3.3(b)(6) of the LTD Plan, which states that \u201c[t]he Disability Benefit shall cease to be paid to a Disabled Covered Employee [at] the termination of his Employment Status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Braden then appealed the denial through the Plan\u2019s administrative process, arguing that she was entitled to a lump sum payment covering the eighteen months of disability benefits that she had not received. Aetna affirmed the denial of benefits in a letter dated April 2, 2012. The letter explained that Braden was not eligible for the lump sum payment under Section 3.3(c) because that provision applies only \u201cif an employee has Permanent Restrictions and Limitations and is permanently unable to perform the essential duties of [her] job.\u201d The letter reasoned that Braden did not qualify because \u201cin [her] case the Permanent Restrictions and Limitations were imposed by Worker\u2019s Compensation and not [her] own physician. If [her] provider had imposed Permanent Restrictions and Limitations which Aetna found to be appropriate, then [she] would have been eligible for a lump sum payment. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Braden then filed suit in federal district court against both FedEx and Aetna. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants. This is Braden\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">\u201cIn the context of an ERISA action we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard that controlled the district court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Green v. Holland, </em>480 F.3d 1216, 1222 (11th Cir.2007). When reviewing a plan administrator\u2019s benefit-eligibility decision, courts in this circuit apply a six-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-12\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-13\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-14\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Melech v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>739 F.3d 663, 673 n. 14 (11th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Braden raises two contentions. The first is that Aetna\u2019s decision to deny a lump sum payment under the Plan was arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To prevail, she must persuade us that \u201cno reasonable basis exists for the decision.\u201d <em>Shannon v. Jack Eckerd Corp., </em>113 F.3d 208, 210 (11th Cir.1997). Here, there was a reasonable basis for Aetna\u2019s decision. As the district court pointed out, Dr. Jackson\u2019s answers on the \u201cPhysician Report for the Federal Express Disability Claim Unit\u201d form indicated that Braden\u2019s restrictions and limitations were not permanent. On that form, he checked \u201cYes\u201d to the question \u201cIs Your Patient Able to Work With Restrictions.\u201d And he checked \u201cNo\u201d to the questions: \u201cAre work restrictions <em>permanent,\u201d </em>and \u201cHas your patient\u2019s condition reached a <em>Permanent &amp; Stationary </em>status.\u201d (Capitalization omitted.) That opinion from Dr. Jackson \u2014 who was Braden\u2019s treating physician \u2014 provided evidence that Braden did not have \u201cPermanent Occupational Restrictions and Limitations,\u201d which was a prerequisite to receiving a lump sum payment under Section 3.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">Braden points to evidence in the record that suggests her Occupational Restrictions and Limitations were permanent. But Aetna\u2019s decision to credit the most recent opinion of Braden\u2019s treating physician was not arbitrary and capricious. <em>See Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., </em>432 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cGiving more weight to the opinions of some experts than to the opinions of other experts is not an arbitrary or capricious practice.\u201d). Braden\u2019s arguments for crediting other evidence in the record is the kind of second guessing that the arbitrary-and-capricious standard does not allow. <em>See id. </em>at 1280 (\u201cAn administrator\u2019s determination must be upheld if it has a reasonable factual basis, even if the record also contains contrary information.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Braden\u2019s second contention is that the defendants were equitably estopped from denying her the lump sum payment. To succeed under that theory, she must \u201cshow that (1) the relevant provisions of the plan at issue are ambiguous, and (2) the plan provider or administrator has made representations to the plaintiff that constitute an informal interpretation of the ambiguity.\u201d <em>Jones v. Am. Gen. Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1065, 1069 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Braden\u2019s equitable estoppel challenge relies on the February 25 letter that she received from Deborah Lamp, the FedEx human resources worker. She points to the portion of the letter telling her that: \u201cYour disability benefits will continue for up to 90 days while you seek placement. You have the option to voluntarily resign within the 90 day period and receive a lump sum payout of your remaining disability benefits.\u201d In Braden\u2019s view, that letter qualifies as an interpretation of Sections 3.3(b)(6)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 3.3(c) of the LTD Plan and interprets those sections in a manner that guarantees her a lump sum payment. Specifically, she argues that the interpretation gave her the option to resign without searching for an available job at FedEx.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Braden\u2019s argument overlooks the first requirement of our collateral estoppel doctrine, that there must be an ambiguity in the portion of the plan that Aetna used to deny her benefits claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1069; <em>see also Kane v. Aetna Life Ins., </em>893 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.1990) (examining whether \u201c[t]he provisions of the Plan at issue here are ambiguous\u201d). As the district court correctly noted, the portions of the LTD Plan on which Aetna relied are clear and unambiguous. Section 3.3(c) explicitly states that employees cannot be eligible for a lump sum payment unless the employee \u201chas Permanent Occupational Restrictions and Limitations, <em>as determined by the Claims Paying Administrator.\u201d </em>Nothing in Section 3.3(b)(6), or any other portion of the LTD Plan, suggests that a lump sum payment can be made without such a determination. Aetna was the \u201cClaims Paying Administrator\u201d for the LTD Plan, not FedEx, and Aetna determined that Braden did not meet the \u201cPermanent Occupational Restrictions and Limitations\u201d prerequisite in Section 3.3(c). Because that prerequisite was unambiguous, the defendants were not equitably estopped from relying on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Braden attempts to bolster her equitable estoppel argument by citing the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, </em>563 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1866, 179 L.Ed.2d 843 (2011). That decision addressed the question of whether a court can <em>alter </em>the terms of the plan when the claimant has sued \u201cto obtain other appropriate equitable relief\u2019 under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B). <em>See id. </em>at 1871, 1880-82. Braden did not sue for equitable relief under that provision of the statute. Her amended complaint sought the remedies provided under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). Those being: \u201cto recover benefits due to [her] under the terms of his plan, to enforce [her] rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify [her] rights to future benefits under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>plan.\u201d The <em>CIGNA </em>decision therefore does not apply to Braden\u2019s claim. Additionally, none of Braden\u2019s briefing to the district court mentioned the possibility of receiving \u201cother equitable relief\u2019 under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)(B). Her failure to do so forfeits the issue on appeal. <em>See Neumann v. United States, </em>938 F.2d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201c[W]e will not consider an issue not argued to the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-4\">. Braden supplied additional documentation of her disability showing that she had three herniated cervical discs with- nerve root impingement and radiculopathy. We need not go into further detail because it is not necessary to decide this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\">. As far as the six-step process is concerned, Braden challenge focuses on the district court's determination at the third step. For expediency's sake, we will start there. <em>See Doyle v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>542 F.3d 1352, 1357-58 (11th Cir.2008) (proceeding immediately to the third step where the claimant raised no issue with the first two).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-11\">. For expediency's sake, we will not engage in a detailed analysis of the fifth and sixth steps of the summary judgment standard. The district court ended its inquiry at the fifth step after concluding that there was no conflict of interest because AETNA makes the eligibility determinations, and FedEx pays the awarded benefits from a trust fund it maintains. <em>See Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355 (\"A pertinent conflict of interest exists where the ERISA plan administrator both makes eligibility decisions and pays awarded benefits out of its own funds.\u201d). Braden does not challenge that conclusion. We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>district court, and our review under the summary judgment standard is thus complete. <em>See Melech, </em>739 F.3d at 673 n. 14 (\u201cIf there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.\u2019\u2019) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-13\">.
