In 2013, Cannion filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d), which lowered the guideline ranges for crack-cocaine offenses, as well as the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), which lowered the statutory mandatory minimums applicable to certain crack-cocaine offenses. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Cann-ion was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because (1) the FSA was not a Guidelines amendment and did not apply retroactively, and (2) Amendment 750 did not lower Cannion\u2019s applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-22\">On appeal, Cannion argues that the district court abused its discretion in ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>dressing his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 750. The government, in turn, concedes that the district court erred in finding Cannion ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and it asks this Court to reverse the denial and remand for consideration of whether Cannion should receive a discretionary sentence reduction. Because the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked the authority to entertain Cannion\u2019s motion, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Cannion was convicted in 2008 of one count of distributing at least five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(iii), and one count of conspiring to distribute at least fifty grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 846. In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation officer held Cannion responsible for 77.88 grams of crack cocaine, yielding a base offense level of 30 under U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2D1.1. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Cannion\u2019s total offense level was 27. With a criminal history category of VI, the PSR provided a guideline range between 130 and 162 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">At sentencing, the district court granted the government\u2019s request for an upward departure under U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 4A1.3 based on Cannion\u2019s extensive criminal history. The court increased the base offense level from 30 to 38, and then applied the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, leaving Cannion with a total offense level of 35 and a new guideline range of 292 to 365 months in prison. The court then imposed a total sentence of 292 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">In December 2013, Cannion moved for a reduction in his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 750 and the FSA. Amendment 750 took effect in November 2011, lowering the base offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses by revising the drug-quantity tables in U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C., amend. 750. For an offender like Cannion, who was held responsible for between 28 and 112 grams of crack cocaine, Amendment 750 reduced the base offense level from 30 to 26. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7) (2007), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7) (2011). Amendment 750 is retroactively applicable and may be enforced through a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">In denying Cannion\u2019s motion, the district court determined that Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering his guideline range because, solely as a result of the upward departure under \u00a7 4A1.3, \u201cCannion\u2019s 292-month sentence was not derived from the amount of cocaine base for which he was responsible.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the district court erred in finding Cannion ineligible for a sentence reduction based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>on the \u00a7 4A1.3 departure, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)' and the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Section \u00a7 3582(c)(2) grants federal courts the power to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered through a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 824-25, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). If a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, the court may, in its discretion, reduce the term of imprisonment after considering the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">The Sentencing Commission has explained that a reduction is not authorized under the Guidelines if a retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). The Commission defines the \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d in turn, as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n. 1(A)); <em>see United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540-41 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013). Because the district court did not exclude the \u00a7 4A1.3 departure in determining Cannion\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d the court erred. . <em>See United States v. Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d 1253, 1254-55 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cIn Amendment 759, the Sentencing Commission made explicit that \u00a7 4A1.3 departures are not part of the \u2018applicable guideline range.\u2019 \u201d); U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 759. Nor was the error harmless. Instead, Cannion is entitled to have his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion addressed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Amendment 750 had the effect of lowering Cannion\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In making this determination, we first look to the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal-history category without including the \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure. <em>See Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d at 1254-55 &amp; n. 1. Here, Cannion\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d before Amendment 750 was 130 to 162 months\u2019 imprisonment (with a base offense level of 30).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">Next, we must \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if [Amendment 750] had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1); <em>see Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 793. In doing so, we must \u201csubstitute only [Amendment 750] for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). As a result, had Amendment 750 been in effect at the time of his sentencing, Cannion\u2019s guideline range would have been 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment (with a base offense level of 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-13\">But because Cannion is subject to a 120-month statutory mandatory minimum, his guideline range would be simply 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2008); U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 5G1.1(b); <em>see also Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d at 1255. Amendment 750, therefore, lowered Cannion\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d from a range of 130 to 162 months to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>range of 120 months. U.S.S.G. Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n. 1(A)); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">In sum, the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked the authority to reduce Cannion\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c) by basing its decision on the \u00a7 4A1.3 departure. <em>See Hargrove, </em>732 F.3d at 1254-55 &amp; n. 1. We therefore reverse the denial of Cannion\u2019s motion and remand for a determination of whether Cannion should receive a discretionary sentence reduction in consideration of the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Appeal no. 14-10563 is REVERSED and REMANDED; Appeal no. 1411217 is DISMISSED as duplicative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">. Cannion does not expressly challenge the denial of his motion based on the FSA, and therefore arguably has abandoned the issue. <em>See Sapuppo v. Floridian Allstate Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680-81 (11th Cir.2014). In any case, we agree with the government that the district court correctly determined that the FSA did not provide Cannion a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Berty, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">. It appears that Cannion filed multiple notices of appeal in this case, triggering the opening of two appeal numbers (14 \u2014 10563 and 14-11217). Because both notices indicate Cannion's intent to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we direct the Clerk\u2019s Office to DISMISS as dupli-cative appeal no. 14-11217, which was based on the second, untimely notice of appeal docketed by the district court on March 20, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
