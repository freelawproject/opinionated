Chisolm appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). She argues that her Fourth Amendment claims and her malicious prosecution claims are not time barred. She also moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">By moving to proceed IFP on appeal, Chisolm is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is frivolous and not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); \u00a7 1915(a)(3). This court may authorize Chisolm to proceed IFP on appeal if she demonstrates that she is a pauper and that her appeal is taken in good faith, i.e., the appeal presents nonfrivolous issues. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). This court\u2019s inquiry into the litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Chisolm\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims accrued more than four years before she filed suit. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 388, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Accordingly, her claims were time barred. <em>See Hitt v. Connell, </em>301 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2002); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a). Chisolm\u2019s reliance on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), is misplaced. The record contains no evidence that Chisolm was ever prosecuted or convicted of any offense; therefore, <em>Heck </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">Chisolm\u2019s challenge to the dismissal of her state-law malicious prosecution claim is likewise unavailing. <em>See Pete v. Metcalfe, </em>8 F.3d 214, 219 (5th Cir.1993). Chisolm has failed to make the requisite showing under <em>Pete. </em>Therefore, she has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing this claim as frivolous. <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cjr.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Chisolm has failed to show that her appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Her IFP motion is therefore denied, and her appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
