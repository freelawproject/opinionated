The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issues of whether (1) Adams\u2019s due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to sever his trial from that of his brother, (2) Adams was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to call a potential witness at trial and by counsel\u2019s failure to move for a mistrial, and (3) the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence in the form of handwritten notes contained in the prosecutor\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">In addressing the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief, we review issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error, applying the same deference to the state court\u2019s decision as we do to the district court\u2019s decision under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). <em>Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007). Under the AEDPA, habeas relief may not be granted with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>court, unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2); <em>see also Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 181 S.Ct. 770, 787, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Adams has not shown that the alleged error of the trial court in denying his motion to sever rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>See Manning v. Warden, La. State Penitentiary, </em>786 F.2d 710, 711 (5th Cir.1986). Adams contends that Larry Adams presented an antagonistic defense, but the record does not support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">He also claims that the district court erred in finding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a potential witness to testify at trial. Specifically, he contends that trial counsel should have called Glenda Jackson, the owner of the gun found in Adams\u2019s van, as a witness. Adams fails to assert that Jackson was available to testify or would have done so. Neither does he set forth any content of her proposed testimony. This claim also fails. <em>See Day v. Quarterman, </em>566 F.3d 527, 538 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Adams\u2019s challenge to his counsel\u2019s effectiveness for failing to request a mistrial based on his brother\u2019s abandonment of an alibi defense fails as well. Because the defenses were not, mutually exclusive or antagonistic, Adams has failed to identify any basis for the trial court to grant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Regarding the alleged withholding of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution, Adams does not show that the handwritten notes contained in the prosecutor\u2019s work product were material evidence or that any evidence was suppressed. <em>See Lawrence v. Lensing, </em>42 F.3d 255, 257 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
