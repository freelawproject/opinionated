Hills, </em>No. 13-30960. He also moves this court to stay his supervised release and the district court\u2019s order of restitution during the pen-dency of his appeal in No. 13-30960, or, in the alternative, to modify certain conditions of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">By moving to proceed IFP, Hills is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that this appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Since Hills filed the instant appeal, we have issued our decision in No. 13-30960, affirming the district court\u2019s denial of Hills\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Hills, </em>No. 13-30960 (5th Cir. Nov. 18, 2014). Given our affirmance in No. 13-30960, Hills cannot demonstrate a nonfrivolous issue for appeal with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a stay or injunction. Accordingly, his motion for IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Moreover, because we have already issued our decision in No. 13-30960, Hills\u2019s motion to stay his supervised release and the order of restitution pending that decision is DENIED. Finally, to the extent Hills seeks modification of the conditions of his supervised release, he must move for modification in the district court pursuant to pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(c). Accordingly, his motion\u2019 to modify his conditions of supervised release is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
