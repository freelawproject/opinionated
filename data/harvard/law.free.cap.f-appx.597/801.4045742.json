He contends that his sentence is substantively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>sonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Rosales-Bugarin has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The district court was \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. The court acknowledged Rosales-Bugarin\u2019s mitigating arguments but concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. We have rejected the argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s double-counting of a prior conviction in the calculation of a defendant\u2019s offense level and criminal history score necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected substantive reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Finally, as Rosales-Bugarin concedes, also foreclosed is his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"ApH\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
