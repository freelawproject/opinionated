His sentence was double the top end of his United States Sentencing Guidelines range of 18 to 24 months. On appeal, Peters argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to (1) consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, (2) use the guideline range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>as a benchmark, or (3) provide an adequate explanation for its decision to vary upward to 48 months. Peters also challenges the substantive reasonableness of the sentence on the ground that the court\u2019s variance was not supported by a sufficient justification. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">From the beginning of 2010 through August 2012, Peters fraudulently represented to an undocumented Slovakian immigrant living in the United States that Peters could help him obtain lawful immigration status here. In particular, Peters told the victim that he knew immigration officials and that he had filed an immigration petition on the victim\u2019s behalf. Neither was true. In exchange for his \u201chelp\u201d and purportedly to aid the immigration process, Peters requested money. In total, Peters received from the victim nearly $25,000 in wire transfers and personal checks. When the victim asked Peters about the status of his petition, Peters had other individuals call the victim, falsely represent that they were agents with the' Department of Homeland Security, and induce the victim to continue making payments to Peters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">Peters was arrested in January 2014 and then indicted by a federal grand jury on eight counts of wire fraud and one count of encouraging an alien to reside in the United States. He pled guilty to one count of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, under a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The probation officer prepared a presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and calculated the guideline range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). The PSR reflected that the total offense level was 13. This included a two-level increase for a crime involving a vulnerable victim, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l). Peters objected to the victim enhancement, arguing that the offense level should be 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">The PSR reflects that Peters had several prior criminal convictions, for which the probation officer placed him into criminal history category IV. His criminal history began in 2000, at the age of forty-five, when he was convicted of driving under the influence. Between 2002 and 2003, Peters was convicted of uttering a forged instrument, grand theft (stealing buckets of paint from Home Depot), and burglary of an unoccupied dwelling (taking and pawning statues worth $3,000 from a family friend who was away on vacation). The PSR shows no further convictions until 2012, when Peters was again convicted of grand theft, as well as dealing in stolen property, after stealing and pawning two rings from his sister\u2019s house, where he was staying and babysitting. Peters was also convicted of marijuana possession around this time. While on probation, he was asked to leave his brother\u2019s home because he was stealing from his brother and his brother\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\">With a criminal history category of IV and a total offense level of 13, The PSR provided a guideline range of 24 to 30 months of imprisonment. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment was 20 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">The PSR also detailed information about Peters\u2019s personal, family, and business history. Peters objected to the following factual allegations in the PSR concerning this information: Peters had borrowed thousands of dollars from his son without paying him back; had used his son\u2019s credit cards without his son\u2019s knowledge or permission; had taken money from his then-wife\u2019s purse without her knowledge; and, according to his former business partner, had stolen approximately $300,000 from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>the partner, the business, and their customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained the PSR\u2019s calculation of the guideline range and then addressed Peters\u2019s objection to the vulnerable-victim enhancement, hearing testimony from the victim, who was present in court. The victim explained how Peters threatened to contact authorities to detain or deport the victim and his wife if he did not pay. Based on the victim\u2019s statements, the court concluded that the \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l) enhancement did not apply and sustained Peters\u2019s objection to the two-level increase. With two levels removed, the new guideline range was 18 to 24 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The district court asked for sentencing recommendations from the parties and indicated that it was considering going above the guideline range. The government recommended a sentence at the low end of the guideline range, citing to the plea agreement. Peters\u2019s attorney likewise argued that an 18-month sentence was appropriate because Peters\u2019s entire criminal history was isolated to two distinct time periods, both when he was going through difficult personal times caused by divorce, illness, or job loss. Despite these problems, his attorney asserted, Peters had done good things in life, was a good husband and father, and had built up a successful business. The court disagreed that Peters had been \u201csuccessful,\u201d noting the PSR\u2019s description of Peters\u2019s theft from a business partner, which was, according to the court, \u201ctotally consistent with Mr. Peters\u2019[s] background.\u201d Peters\u2019s attorney denied that Peters had stolen from the partner and suggested that the PSR did not accurately reflect the person that he was. But the court went on to state, \u201cThis is the person he is. He steals from his relatives. He steals from his business partner. He steals from immigrants. He steals from anybody he comes into contact with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">After hearing from Peters personally, the district court concluded that a sentence of 48 months of imprisonment was appropriate, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-9\">I think the guidelines are entirely inadequate in this case. They fail to account for the threats that were made to the victim and his wife. They fail to account for [the] kinds of vulnerabilities that someone in this victim\u2019s situation faced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-10\">The guidelines are too low in this case in relationship to the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the defendant\u2019s conduct, which I have absolutely no doubt about that has not resulted in criminal charges, occurred; that the thefts and embezzlements that are reflected in the PSI, they are entirely consistent with his criminal history. Even his own family describes him as a thief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1063-11\">The Court has considered the statements of the parties, the presentence report containing the advisory guidelines and all of the statutory factors, but in particular the ones I mentioned, and the need for general and specific deterrence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">Peters objected to the reasonableness of the sentence and to the court\u2019s reliance on facts he had objected to in the PSR concerning theft from his business partner and some family members. In response, the court stated, \u201cAnd let me make it clear for the record that even if you were to eliminate those items from my consideration entirely, the sentence would be exactly the same based on his criminal record, the information provided here today by the victim, and everything else in the [PSR].\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence, whether imposed inside or outside the guideline range, under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our review is a two-step process. We first ensure that the district court did not commit any significant procedural errors, such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guideline range, treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any variance from the guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">If the district court committed no significant procedural error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.; United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2014). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1361. Generally, we will defer to the district court\u2019s judgment about an appropriate sentence \u201cunless the district court has made a clear error of judgment and has imposed a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">\n<em>A. Procedural Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Peters challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on three grounds. First, he asserts, the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by disregarding mitigating evidence about his criminal history, his age, and his poor health. Second, he contends, the court failed to use the guideline range as a sentencing benchmark. And third, he argues, the court\u2019s explanation for the sentence imposed was inadequate because it was confusing, took into account factors which had already been considered in the guideline range, and relied on unproven allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree on all points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, the Supreme Court has explained that a properly calculated guideline range should be the \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for the district court at sentencing. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. at 596. The district court must then hear argument from the parties about what would be an appropriate sentence and consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors as they apply to the individual defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">Under \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In determining the sentence to be imposed, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, among other factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>The court must also explain the reasons for its chosen sentence, particularly when, as here, the court varies from the guideline range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). For purposes of appellate review, we have explained that \u201cthe district court should set forth enough information\u201d to show \u201cthat it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for making its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 140, 187 L.Ed.2d 38 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Here, the district court properly calculated the guideline range and used it as a benchmark. At the beginning of the hearing, the court explained the guideline range as calculated in the PSR and then addressed Peters\u2019s objection to the vulnerable-victim enhancement. It is true that the court did not explicitly recalculate the guideline range after sustaining the objection, but this omission does not show that the court \u201cfailed to actually determine a range,\u201d as Peters contends. Peters knew full well that the guideline range was 18 to 24 months without the enhancement, as is clear from his earlier-filed objections to the PSR and his attorney\u2019s comments at sentencing. Further, in providing reasons for its 48-month sentence, the court explained that the guidelines were \u201ctoo low\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d in this case, indicating that it taken the guideline range into consideration. Thus, the court did not err in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing also makes clear that the district court listened to, but simply disagreed with, Peters\u2019s arguments in favor of mitigation. The court explicitly stated that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the information in the PSR. We do not require the.district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (stating that the failure to discuss mitigating evidence does not mean that the court ignored or failed to consider such evidence). Rather, it is sufficient for the district court to acknowledge that it has considered the \u00a7. 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the court did so before imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">Finally, we conclude that the district court\u2019s explanation for the sentence was sufficient to support the court\u2019s upward variance in this case. The court provided the following reasons for its sentence: (1) the guideline range was too low to account for the seriousness of the conduct, which included victimizing a vulnerable immigrant and threatening him and his wife; (2) Peters\u2019s criminal history and other criminal conduct showed numerous occasions of theft from friends, family, and strangers; (3) specific deterrence was particularly warranted in this case; and (4) general deterrence of conduct such as this against immigrants was important.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Peters contends that the court\u2019s explanation was deficient because the court relied on his criminal record, which was already accounted for in his guideline range, and on the vulnerability of the victim, despite having sustained Peters\u2019s objection to that enhancement. But we have explained that \u201c[t]he district court may consider facts that were taken into account when formulating the guideline range for the sake of a variance.\u201d <em>Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1362. By the same token, the district court may also consider facts, like the vulnerability of the immigrant victim in this case, that did not factor into the guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>range. The Sentencing Guidelines are not mandatory, and the district court bears the ultimate responsibility of making an individualized assessment based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). That the court properly considered Peters\u2019s criminal history and the vulnerability of the victim is confirmed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661, which states, \u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">As for Peters\u2019s objection to the part of the district court\u2019s reasoning that the court based its sentence in part on objeeted-to facts in the PSR, regarding Peters\u2019s theft from his business partner, son, and ex-wife, which were not established by the government at the sentencing hearing, <em>see United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cWhere a defendant objects to the factual basis of his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact.\u201d), the court clarified, \u201cAnd let me make it clear for the record that even if you were to eliminate those items from my consideration entirely, the sentence would be exactly the same based on his criminal record, the information provided here today by the victim, and everything else in the PSI.\u201d We do not agree with Peters that the court committed \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">First, the purported error affected only part of one of the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the 48-month sentence. The court\u2019s reliance on the seriousness of the conduct and the need for the sentence to account for both general and specific deterrence remains unaffected. Second, even solely with respect to Peters\u2019s \u201ccriminal conduct,\u201d the objected-to facts were not unique in showing that Peters had stolen from a wide range of people, sometimes without legal sanction. Other unob-jected-to facts in the PSR, which the district court appears to have referred to by the phrase, \u201ceverything else in the PSI,\u201d indicate that Peters had stolen from his sister, from his brother and his brother\u2019s son, from a family friend, from the victim in this case, and from Home Depot. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832 (\u201cA sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact may be based on undisputed statements in the PSI.\u201d). These facts are consistent with the court\u2019s earlier statements in responding to Peters\u2019s request for an 18-month sentence. Third, we take the district court at its word that the sentence would be the same without consideration of the disputed facts. <em>Cf. United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2006) (applying harmlessness review to guideline-calculations errors where the district court states that it would have imposed the same sentence absent the application of the guideline provision). Finally, we conclude that the district court\u2019s explanation was otherwise sufficient to show \u201cthat it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for making its decision.\u201d <em>Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">In sum, we conclude that the district court committed no procedural error. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we turn to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">\n<em>B. Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-9\">Peters challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on the basis that the district court\u2019s justification was insufficient to support the significant vari-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>anee, particularly when, he asserts, the guideline range had already accounted for the factors on which the court based the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Our review for substantive reasonableness includes whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d at 1327. When the sentence is outside the guideline range, we consider the degree of variance and the extent of the deviation from the guideline range. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). The justification given by the district court \u201cmust be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But we must give due deference to the court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the variance. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1361-62 (stating that we must defer to the weight the district court gives the \u00a7 3553(a) factors unless the court makes a clear error of judgment). That we might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate is insufficient to justify reversing the district court. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Moreover, a sentence well below the statutory maximum sentence signals reasonableness. <em>Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Here, Peters has not met his burden of showing that his 48-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that an above-guideline range sentence was necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing. As the court found, the conduct underlying the offense was serious. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Peters and those he enlisted to help him did not just cause economic harm by defrauding the victim out of at least $25,000. But he also caused psychological damage over a protracted period \u2014 not to mention the potential immigration consequences for the victim, who believed that a valid petition for lawful status was filed on his behalf \u2014 by threatening the victim and his family with deportation if they did not pay up. In addition, Peters\u2019s criminal history, almost all of which is for theft or fraud offenses, supports the district court\u2019s reliance on both general and specific deterrence in fashioning an appropriate sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The sentence is also supported by the.need to protect the public from further crimes of Peters. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Finally, the 48-month sentence was considerably lower than the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years, signaling that the sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">In light of these considerations, we cannot say that the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d by imposing \u201ca sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Peters to 48 months of imprisonment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">. The Government asserts that plain-error review applies to these arguments because they were not raised before the district court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Patterson, </em>595 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.2010). We do not address whether plain-error review applies because Peters has shown no error, plain or otherwise. <em>United States v. Victor, </em>719 F.3d 1288, 1291 n. 3 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
