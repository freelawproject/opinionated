On appeal, he contends that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2241 petition. Briefly stated, he says that his 1996 federal sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act\u2019s (\u201cACCA\u201d) enumerated-offense clause, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2) (B) (ii), was unlawful in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007); <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008); <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009); and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). He also argues that circuit precedent previously foreclosed him from arguing that his three earlier Florida burglary convictions under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02 (1979) were not ACCA predicate violent felonies because the modified categorical approach announced in <em>Shepard </em>was not available during his sentencing, direct appeal, or initial \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">Whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause is a question of law we review <em>de novo. Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). The applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue, and the savings clause imposes a subject matter jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that the \u00a7 2255 remedy was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">Mathews was convicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1) and, in 1996, was sentenced to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. A person convicted of knowingly violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) shall be imprisoned \u201cnot more than ten years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). But for defendants who vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>late \u00a7 922(g) after sustaining three previous convictions for violent felonies, the ACCA imposes a 15-year mandatory-minimum sentence and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Generally speaking, once a conviction becomes final, a federal prisoner may challenge his detention only through a \u00a7 2255 motion. But when a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) permits the prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">For a petitioner to bring a \u00a7 2241 challenge to the legality of his detention on the ground that an earlier state conviction was not a predicate offense for purposes of the ACCA, he must make a five-part showing that an earlier \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274. First, a petitioner must show that, \u201cthroughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, [this] Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had specifically addressed [his] distinct prior state conviction that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed [his] \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was' erroneously sentenced above the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, a petitioner must identify a Supreme Court decision announced after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding that overturned our precedent \u201cthat had squarely foreclosed [his] \u00a7 924(e) claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, he must show that the Supreme Court\u2019s new rule applies retroactively on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>Fourth, he must show that, as a result of the new rule being retroactive, his current sentence exceeds \u00a7 924(a)\u2019s ten-year statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>Finally, he must show that \u201cthe savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his pure \u00a7 924(e)[ ] error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Upon review of the entire record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Here, the district court erred by denying Mathews\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition on the merits, rather than dismissing it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. First, Mathews has failed to establish that his claim\u2014 that his three earlier burglary convictions did not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated-offense clause\u2014 was squarely foreclosed by binding Eleventh Circuit precedent at the time of his 1996 sentencing, 1997 direct appeal, or 1998 filing of his first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Cf. Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1344-45 (11th Cir.2013) (explaining that \u201c[n]o Eleventh Circuit precedent squarely held that burglary of a dwelling, as defined in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02, was a violent felony for ACCA purposes\u201d between 1990 and 2004). Moreover, Mathews has also failed to identify an intervening Supreme Court decision that overturned such alleged binding circuit precedent. Mathews\u2019s reliance on <em>Shepard, James, Begay, Chambers, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>as circuit-law-busting Supreme Court decisions is misplaced: none of these cases decided whether a burglary conviction under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02 constituted a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated-offense clause. Because Mathews has failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his petition on the merits. Accordingly, we vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
