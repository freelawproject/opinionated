California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Pacheco-Garcia has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant parts of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. However, in light of the nonreversible error in categorizing Pacheco-Garcia\u2019s Texas sexual assault conviction as an aggravated felony, the judgment of the district court is REFORMED to show that Pacheco-Garcia was convicted and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367-69 (5th Cir.2009). Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
