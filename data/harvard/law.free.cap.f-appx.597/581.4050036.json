Nipper argues that the 195-month prison sentence imposed after he pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), exceeds the maximum 120-month term authorized by Congress. Specifically, he argues that because of several intervening U.S. Supreme Court decisions, his prior convictions for common-law robbery and \u201cbreaking or entering\u201d did not qualify as predicate convictions supporting an enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nipper further argues that the government may not support his ACCA enhancement now by relying on prior convictions it did not rely upon at sentencing. After careful review, and in light of our recent decision in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman</em>-Medium, 738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. \u201cWhen a conviction has become final, a federal prisoner usually may challenge the legality of his detention only through a \u00a7 2255 motion [to vacate].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1256. Once a prisoner has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1260. Here, Nipper unsuccessfully sought permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">However, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if he shows that a \u00a7 2255 motion was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256, 1262. Whether this provision \u2014 the \u00a7 2255(e) \u201csavings clause\u201d \u2014 may \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 petition is a \u201cjurisdictional question\u201d that must be decided before addressing the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262. The restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not alone render a \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate or ineffective for purposes of the \u201csavings clause.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">In <em>Bryant, </em>we held that to show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective, a petitioner asserting a sentencing error must establish that: (1) binding circuit precedent squarely foreclosed the claim \u201cthroughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding\u201d; (2) \u201csubsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding,\u201d a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned that circuit precedent; (3) the rule announced in that decision applies retroactively on collateral review; and (4) as a result of that new rule, the petitioner\u2019s sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress. 738 F.3d at 1274, 1281. The claims Nipper raises in his \u00a7 2241 petition do not satisfy these jurisdictional requirements because none of the U.S. Supreme Court cases on which he relies were decided \u201csubsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1274, which concluded on October 29, 2010. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>560 U.S. 563, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (decided June 14, 2010); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (decided March 2, 2010); <em>Hunter v. United States, </em>558 U.S. 1143, 130 S.Ct. 1135, 175 L.Ed.2d 967 (decided January 19, 2010), Watts <em>v. United States, </em>558 U.S. 1143, 130 S.Ct. 1134, 175 L.Ed.2d 967 (same)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (decided January 13, 2009); <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (decided April 16, 2008); <em>cf. In re Hill, </em>113 F.3d 181, 182-84 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding that a new rule of law was not \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d for purposes of a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition because the Supreme Court decision forming the basis for the new rule was issued while the petitioner\u2019s prior \u00a7 2254 proceedings were pending). Consequently, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Nipper\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">During this appeal, Nipper has filed several Notices of Supplemental Authorities, in which he seeks to rely on cases decided since the conclusion of the district court proceedings. The only Supreme Court case he cites is <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). There, the Court considered whether a sentencing court may examine certain documents to determine whether a prior conviction for a crime with a single, indivisible set' of elements qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated-offenses provision, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-83. The Court concluded that, when faced with a prior conviction for violating an indivisible <em>statute </em>\u2014 ie., one not containing alternative elements \u2014 sentencing courts may apply only the \u201ccategorical \u00e1pproach,\u201d which requires comparing the elements of the statute forming the basis of the prior conviction with the elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d version of that crime. <em>See id. </em>at 2283</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Nipper may not \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 petition based on <em>Descamps. </em>Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has held that <em>Descamps </em>applies retroactively on collateral review. Beyond that, <em>Des-camps </em>was decided in the context of a direct appeal, and the Supreme Court has not since applied it to a case on collateral review. <em>See id. </em>at 2282-83; <em>cf. In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not retroactively applicable in part because it was decided on direct appeal and the Supreme Court had not applied it to a case on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Finally, none of the remaining cases cited in Nipper\u2019s Notices of Supplemental Authorities contradict the fact that all of the Supreme Court cases on which he relied in his \u00a7 2241 petition were decided well before the conclusion of his \u00a7 2255 proceedings. For those reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Nipper\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\">.
