On appeal, Dolleh argues that (1) the IJ erred in holding that his application for asylum was time-barred, (2) the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, and (3) the IJ\u2019s hostile attitude towards him at his removal hearing constituted a denial of due process. After careful review, we dismiss in part and deny in part his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">A person must generally file his application for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an asylum application was not filed within the applicable one-year deadline. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s conclusion that a person failed to show extraordinary circumstances that would excuse an untimely filing. <em>Id. </em>Although we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review, INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), whether a person complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse an untimely filing are not \u201clegal issues\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Dolleh failed to establish extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing of his application for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957. Although Dolleh argues that the BIA committed legal error in concluding that a nine-month delay in filing an application for asylum after reaching the age of majority was unreasonable, this argument merely takes issue with the BIA\u2019s determination that there were no extraordinary circumstances to overcome his untimely application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We dismiss Dolleh\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s holding that his asylum application was untimely for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Next, Dolleh argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, .under the \u201chighly deferential\u201d substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>test. <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We will reverse the agency\u2019s findings \u201conly if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must show that, if returned to his country, it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cIf the applicant is determined to have suffered past persecution in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, it shall be presumed that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the -original claim.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain his burden of proof, even without corroborating evidence. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Conversely, if the applicant relies solely on his testimony, an adverse-credibility determination may alone be sufficient to support the denial of an application. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). When the IJ makes an adverse-credibility finding, the applicant must demonstrate that the finding was not supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101, 119 Stat. 231, 302, for applications filed after May 11, 2005, a credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the demeanor, candor, and responsiveness of the applicant; (2) the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; and (5) the consistency of the applicant\u2019s statements with other record evidence. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). In addition, an adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In this case, when reviewing the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in the light most favorable to the agency, we cannot say that the record compels us to reverse its finding. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230. Both the BIA and IJ identified specific discrepancies about key matters in Dolleh\u2019s testimony, including Dolleh\u2019s inability to recognize a photograph of a Joshua Blahyi, a Liberian rebel leader for whom he testified that he acted as a personal servant for several years, as well as discrepancies in Dolleh\u2019s testimony about how he came under Blahyi\u2019s control. Although Dolleh argues that the IJ failed to consider a corroborating affidavit from a sociology professor, the affidavit only states that Dolleh\u2019s claims were generally consistent with Liberian history, and therefore cannot establish that Dolleh himself suffered past persecution. Thus, on this record, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Dolleh was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>credible. We deny Dolleh\u2019s challenge to the adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">IIL</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Finally, Dolleh argues that the IJ\u2019s hostile attitude towards him at his removal hearing constituted a denial of due process. We do not have jurisdiction to review a claim unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to that claim. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Although some due process claims may not require exhaustion, \u201cwhere the claim is within the purview of the BIA which can provide a remedy, the exhaustion requirement applies with full force.\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003). We have previously held that a claim that a person was denied a full and fair hearing because of an IJ\u2019s hostile attitude is \u201cprecisely the kind of procedural error which requires exhaustion.\u201d Amay<em>a-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1251. Dolleh failed to raise his argument that the IJ\u2019s hostile attitude violated his due process rights before the BIA, and we therefore lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">For these reasons, we find no reversible error. We DISMISS Dolleh\u2019s petition in part and DENY his petition in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">. Dolleh also argues here that the IJ erred in holding that his asylum application was untimely because there was no consideration of his argument that he was an unaccompanied minor when he entered the United States. This argument is not supported by the record. Additionally, because Dolleh failed to raise this argument before the BIA, he has not exhausted his administrative remedies and this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this claim. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\"We lack jurisdiction to consider a claim raised in a petition for review unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect thereto.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
