She thus argues that her own interest in the property vested before the Government\u2019s interest under the \u201crelation back\u201d doctrine in \u00a7 853(c). She acknowledges that, according to the indictment, the offense began in January 1998, but she argues that the PSR\u2019s description of the offense should control. She does not acknowledge Gonzalez\u2019s admission in the agreed preliminary order of forfeiture that the property was purchased with the proceeds of the drug trafficking conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We apply de novo review to the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, taking all of Torres\u2019s allegations in the petition as true. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>710 F.3d 565, 567 (5th Cir.2013). The dismissal will be \u201caffirmed only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Contrary to Torres\u2019s claim, the PSR confirms that Gonzalez was engaged in the drug trafficking conspiracy in July 1998 when the property was purchased. It is indisputable that the Government\u2019s interest vested at the time of the offense under the relation back doctrine. <em>See </em>\u00a7 853(c); <em>United States v. Corpus, </em>491 F.3d 205, 209 (5th Cir.2007). Torres\u2019s argument that the PSR established the priority of her interest over the Government\u2019s is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Torres also contends that, because she is Gonzalez\u2019s common law spouse, the property is community property and not amenable to forfeiture. This claim also fails under the application of the relation back doctrine. As discussed above, the Government\u2019s interest in the property vested at the time of Gonzalez\u2019s offense, which began before the couple purchased the property. Accordingly, the property never became the community property of Torres and Gonzalez. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>228 F.3d 587, 590 (5th Cir.2000) (interpreting an identical relation back provision in the RICO forfeiture statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. Although the notice of appeal also references the final judgment of forfeiture against a second property located in Rockwall County, Torres abandons her appeal of that judgment by failing to address the forfeiture of that property. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
