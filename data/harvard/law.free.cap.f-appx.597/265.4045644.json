He contends that the district court erred in denying him a safety-valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999). We need not decide whether to apply plain error review because Contreras\u2019s claim of error fails even under the ordinary standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A defendant may receive a two-level reduction in his offense level if he, inter alia, provides truthful information to the Government concerning the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(16) (2013), 501.2(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). Contrary to Contreras\u2019s argument, <em>Miller </em>does not preclude us from concluding that Contreras\u2019s untruthfulness about the source of cocaine in the instant offense independently justify the denial of the safety-valve reduction so long as there is evidence that Contreras lied. <em>See Miller, </em>179 F.3d at 967-69. The district court\u2019s finding that Contreras was not truthful was plausible in light of the record as a whole and not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Montes, </em>602 F.3d 381, 384 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
