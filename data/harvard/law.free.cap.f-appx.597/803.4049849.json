We have reviewed the briefs and applicable portions of the record, and we conclude that the district court committed no error. The district court correctly dismissed B osier\u2019s complaint because Bosier failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. In addition, as the district court noted, dismissal was warranted for the independent reason that B osier\u2019s suit \u2014 which he commenced 91 days after the MSPB\u2019s decision became final \u2014 was untimely. Moreover, Bosier fails to show that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to appoint counsel for him. <em>See Salmon v. Corpus Christi Indep. Sch. Dist, </em>911 F.2d 1165, 1166 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">For the foregoing reasons, as more fully explained by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
