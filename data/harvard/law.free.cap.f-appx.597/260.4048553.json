For the reasons that follow, the petitions for review are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">For the first time, Zapata-Hernandez concedes that her 2007 Texas guilty-plea conviction of tampering with a government record, a state jail felony for which she received three years of deferred-adjudication probation, was both a conviction and a crime involving moral turpitude (\u201cCIMT\u201d). Her sole theory is that, despite that conviction, she is eligible for relief in the form of cancellation of removal because her conviction falls within the petty-offense exception of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Inasmuch as Zapata-Hernandez petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing her appeal and denying reopening based on the determination that she was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because her prior offense was a CIMT conviction \u2014 a fact she now concedes \u2014 the petitions for review are denied. Similarly, to the extent that she petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her request for relief in the form of voluntary departure, her petition is also denied because she has failed to brief any challenge thereto. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">As she did for the first time in her motion to reopen, Zapata urges that her offense falls within the petty-offense exception because she received deferred-adjudication probation, was never adjudged guilty, and was never ordered to serve imprisonment. She reasons that, without an adjudication of guilt, she was never subject to imprisonment and thus that the petty offense exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The BIA may reopen or reconsider any case in which it has previously rendered a decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a)-(c). A motion to reopen must \u201cstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); <em>accord </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Zapata-Hernandez\u2019s motion to reopen did not point to any new facts and was not supported by new evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Consequently, the BIA did not err in determining that the newly raised argument regarding the petty-offense exception was not a proper basis for reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"Asz\">The petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. Zapata\u2019s motion to reopen could not be construed as a motion for reconsideration, instead of a motion to reopen, because it was not filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), (2); <em>see also Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219 n. 3 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
