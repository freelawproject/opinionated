Barnes filed hundreds of pages of pleadings, which the magistrate judge and district court found to be difficult to parse, and so she was ordered to file a single amended complaint not to exceed 30 pages that named all defendants, identified all claims, and complied with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Barnes, though given multiple opportunities to comply with the orders, extensions of time, and warnings that if she did not comply her case would be dismissed, did not file an amended complaint, and so the district court dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">A district court may dismiss an action where the plaintiff fails to comply with a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988). Where, as here, a district court\u2019s dismissal is with prejudice, we will uphold it only \u201cwhen there is clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff and when lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.\u201d <em>Bryson v. United States, </em>553 F.3d 402, 404 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Coleman v. Sweetin, </em>745 F.3d 756, 766 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">First, Barnes takes issue with the order that she limit her complaint to 30 pages, contending the page limit was arbitrary and not required by Rule 8, it would have been impossible to include all claims and defendants in a pleading of that length, and, if her pleadings were too voluminous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the court should have rejected them immediately when it received them. Rule 8(a) requires that a complaint contain, among other things, a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), and the district court has \u201cgreat leeway in determining whether a party has complied with\u201d this rule, <em>Gordon v. Green, </em>602 F.2d 743, 745 (5th Cir.1979) (citing cases where courts found that voluminous pleadings ran afoul of the requirement that the plaintiff provide a short and plain statement of the claim). In light of Barnes\u2019s conduct in continually adding claims and defendants and the resulting volume of pleadings and related submissions received by the district court, the orders requesting that Barnes replead her case, comply with Rule 8, and limit her pleadings to 30 pages were within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Cesarani v. Graham, </em>25 F.3d 1044, 1994 WL 261232, 1-2 (5th Cir.1994) (explaining that the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint was not an abuse of discretion where the plaintiff failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order that his amended complaint not exceed 20 pages in length and comply with Rule 8(a)); <em>see also Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 1406, 1417 (5th Cir.1995) (explaining that \u201c[t]he federal courts are vested with the inherent power to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">To the extent that Barnes argues that she was entitled to discovery before being required to enumerate all of her claims, she is mistaken. Discovery is not a license for the plaintiff to \u201cgo fishing,\u201d <em>Marshall v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>576 F.2d 588, 592 (5th Cir.1978) (internal quotation marks omitted), and is limited to information that \u201cis relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). Thus, it was incumbent on Barnes to lay out her claims before seeking discovery germane to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Barnes also contends that though she did not comply with the court\u2019s orders, her conduct was excusable because the magistrate judge would not provide her a sample pleading, the magistrate judge did not clarify the order that she file an amended complaint, and the district court refused her request for copies of her pleadings. She has not sufficiently explained, however, and it is not apparent, how any of these issues prevented her from submitting an amended complaint. She further alleges that, while in prison, she lacked access to supplies and materials necessary to file an amended complaint. This assertion rings hollow, though, because, during the same time period, she was nonetheless able to file motions for a new trial and extensions of time, and it is not evident why she could not also have filed an amended complaint as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Barnes\u2019s decision not to comply with the district\u2019s court\u2019s orders shows a clear record of purposeful, contumacious conduct and amounts to the \u201cthe stubborn resistance to authority\u201d justifying a dismissal with prejudice. <em>Millan v. USAA Gen. Indent. Co., </em>546 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Coleman, </em>745 F.3d at 766 &amp; n. 9. Moreover, the lesser sanctions imposed by the district court \u2014 in the form of warnings that Barnes\u2019s failure to comply with its orders would lead to dismissal\u2014 did nothing to change her behavior, and so the continued imposition of additional lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice. <em>See Bryson, </em>553 F.3d at 404; <em>see also Rogers v. Kroger Co., </em>669 F.2d 317, 321-22 (5th Cir.1982) (explaining that explicit warnings are among the lesser sanctions that courts should consider before dismissing a case with prejudice under Rule 41(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Finally, Barnes complains that the district court denied her motion to appoint counsel. Her case, however, does not present the exceptional circumstances required for the court to appoint counsel, and the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). Especially in light of the fact that at one time, Barnes was a licensed attorney, she has not shown why she was unable to compose a short and plain statement of her case without the assistance of appointed counsel. Barnes\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal take issue with various actions on the part of the magistrate judge that have no bearing on the orders requiring her to submit an amended complaint, and so we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
