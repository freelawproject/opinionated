For the first time on appeal, Perdomo-Caballero argues that the district court erred in calculating his offense level by adding 16 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 for a prior Texas conviction, for aggravated robbery. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 29.03. More specifically, he contends that the Texas offense of theft, which is incorporated into the Texas aggravated robbery offense, is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of theft because the Texas offense includes theft by deception. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 29.02, 29.03, 31.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We recently rejected the argument that Texas theft is not equivalent to a generic theft offense due to the theft by deception provision of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 31.03(a). <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014). Because Perdomo-Caballero\u2019s prior offense qualifies as the enumerated offense of robbery under \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of crime of violence, we do not address his second argument that his prior conviction is not a crime of violence under the residual \u201cforce\u201d clause of that definition. <em>See United States v. Olalde-Hernandez, </em>630 F.3d 372, 376 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
