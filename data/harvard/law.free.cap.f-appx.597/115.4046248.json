AMBRO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Appellant IDEA Boardwalk LLC filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s January 21, 2015 order denying its motion for a stay pending appeal. On January 29, 2015, Appellant filed in this Court an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal and to expedite the appeal. The parties filed briefing on the issue and the Court heard oral argument on Friday, February 6, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">It is hereby ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">The District Court order entered January 21, 2015 denying Appellant\u2019s motion for stay pending appeal is hereby REVERSED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the District Court for entry of an order granting a limited stay as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The temporary stay entered by this Court on January 30, 2015 is hereby modified. A stay is granted only to the extent Appellant seeks to stay paragraph 14 of the Sale Order as it pertains to IDEA. No other provision of the Sale Order is affected by this stay order, and thus the Sale is free to go forward in all other respects. The limited stay imposed by this Court remains in force until the District Court enters a stay order in conformity herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">The Court will issue an Opinion in this matter at a later time. This Court takes no position on the merits of the appeal pending in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is denied, Appellant\u2019s motion to expedite the appeal is denied as moot, and Appellant\u2019s motion to file exhibits in excess of the Court-imposed twenty (20) page limit is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">The mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-28\">. Judge Shwartz would have affirmed the January 21, 2015 order and denied the stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
