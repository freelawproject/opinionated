On appeal, Dorante argues that the BIA and IJ erred in finding that he did not establish past persecution. After thorough review, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-19\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will also review the IJ\u2019s decision to that extent. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision but agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings regarding past persecution, well-founded fear of future persecution, and withholding of removal. Thus, we review both decisions to that extent. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-20\">We review our own subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>468 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). In a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). Under the substantial evidence test, we draw every reasonable inference from the evidence in favor of the agency\u2019s decision, and reverse a finding of fact only if the record compels a reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is insufficient to reverse. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Additionally, where the BIA fails to consider an issue, we cannot conduct our own review of the issue but must remand to give the agency the opportunity to address the matter in the first instance in light of its own expertise. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">An applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). The INA defines a refugee as a person who cannot return to his home country due to \u201cpersecution or a- well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate either past persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on a statutorily listed factor. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). If the applicant demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>This presumption may be rebutted if the government shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions in the country have changed or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country if, \u201cunder all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">If the applicant cannot demonstrate past persecution, he must establish a well-founded fear of future persecution that is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257. \u201cAn applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii). Thus, if the applicant cannot demonstrate past persecution, then he, rather than the government, bears the burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable to relocate, unless the persecution he fears is governmental or government-sponsored. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We have held that \u201c[persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353 (quotations omitted). In determining whether the petitioner has suffered persecution, we evaluate the cumulative harm suffered by the petitioner. <em>Shi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>707 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.2013). Such a determination is a highly factintensive inquiry that requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1235-36. We have previously concluded that circumstances involving only minimal violence do not compel a finding of persecution. <em>See Kazemzadeh, 577 </em>F.3d at 1353 (upholding the BIA\u2019s determination of no past persecution where the petitioner was \u201carrested while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>participating in a student demonstration, interrogated and beaten for five hours, and detained for four days, but ... did not prove that he suffered any physical harm\u201d); <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (upholding the BIA\u2019s determination of no past persecution where the petitioner had been detained for 36 hours, sustained a \u201cminor beating\u201d by police officers, and suffered only \u201cscratches and bruises\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Nevertheless, we have also rejected a rigid requirement of physical injury, and have made clear that \u201cattempted murder is persecution, regardless of whether the petitioner was injured.\u201d <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1233 (11th Cir.2007)). In <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>we held that repeated death threats accompanied by the attempted kidnapping of the petitioner\u2019s daughter and the attempted murder of the petitioner, whose moving vehicle was shot at multiple times but who was not struck by the bullets or physically injured, constituted persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34. Additionally, we\u2019ve held that the totality of verbal death threats and attempted attacks over an 18-month period, culminating in a roadside assault at gunpoint, during which persecutors threw the petitioner to the ground and hit him in the face with the butt of a rifle, resulting in a broken nose, amounted to persecution. <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir.2007). Thus, past persecution may be found absent a serious physical injury where the applicant demonstrates repeated threats combined with other forms of severe mistreatment, such as kidnapping or attempted murder. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009 (finding past persecution where the applicant suffered \u201crepeated death threats, two physical attacks [which resulted in minor physical injuries], the murder of a family friend, and a kidnaping cut short only by a harrowing escape\u201d). Furthermore, we \u201cmay consider a threatening act against another as evidence that the petitioner suffered persecution where that act concomitantly threatens the petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Finally, an alien seeking withholding of removal similarly must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [his] country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and, thus, is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the well-founded fear standard for asylum relief. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, where a petitioner fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, often he necessarily fails to establish any claims for withholding of removal. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">As an initial matter, the only issue we have jurisdiction to review is Dorante\u2019s challenge to the finding that he did not establish past persecution. As we\u2019ve said, if a petitioner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not raising a claim before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim, even if the BIA sua sponte considered the claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51. Further, when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue on appeal, that issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. In this case, Dorante did not argue before the BIA, and does not argue on appeal, that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution independently of the presumption created by past persecution. Thus, he has abandoned that issue and, even if he had not, he has failed to exhaust it.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Nevertheless, in our view, the BIA and IJ\u2019s finding that Dorante did not suffer mistreatment that rose to the level of persecution is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Dorante testified that, in 2008, he joined an organization in his hometown of Saint Louis du Sud (\u201cSaint Louis\u201d), called the \u201cMPC,\u201d which translated into the Movement for Change. At the time, the organization had 13 members, including President Claudy Morose, and worked to clean the streets, address irrigation and literacy problems, and teach civil rights and civic engagement to local citizens. The people they taught began to tell MPC members about the problems they were having with local politicians, which prompted the MPC to create a weekly radio program as an outlet for local residents to discuss their problems on the air. After the program\u2019s creation, Morose received a phone call from someone stating that if he did not stop the radio program, there would be \u201cproblems.\u201d Morose was then threatened by Andre Masner, an influential member of the Lavalas party and a security guard for Representative Jean Candi\u00f3, who had himself been arrested for human rights violations he committed in Haiti. Masner told Morose that he would make Morose \u201cpay for his mouth.\u201d On June 10, 2010, Masner and his crew entered Morose\u2019s home and beat Morose to death in front of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In July 2010, a month after Morose had been beaten to death by Masner\u2019s men in his own home, Masner and his men forced their way into Dorante\u2019s home and began beating him, until they were interrupted by a group of people passing by who responded to his wife\u2019s calls for help. Following the beating, Dorante received a number of threatening phone calls from Masner and his men. After Dorante fled his hometown, his wife was beaten by Mas-ner and his men in December 2010 in order to ascertain Dorante\u2019s whereabouts, after which Dorante had to relocate and his wife had to leave her home. Then, in August 2013, upon his wife\u2019s brief return to their hometown for a funeral, after an absence of more than two years, their home was burned down under unknown circumstances, though Dorante claims Masner is responsible. While none of these discrete instances of mistreatment, when considered alone, would meet the threshold for persecution, the determination is whether the mistreatment cumulatively amounts to persecution. <em>See Shi, </em>707 F.3d at 1235. We conclude that Do-rante\u2019s beating, .combined with Masner\u2019s repeatedly threatening him, then beating his wife to try to find him, and then possibly burning down his home once someone returned to it, compel a finding that Dorante suffered persecution. <em>See De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009; <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1257-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In finding that Dorante did not suffer past persecution, the BIA and IJ implied that they relied, in part, on the fact that Dorante did not sustain serious physical harm as a result of his mistreatment by Masner and his men. However, we have explicitly rejected the notion that a physical injury is required- to find past persecution. <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1008. Moreover, the fact that Dorante did not suffer serious physical harm during his beating is not because his attackers voluntarily retreated but rather because they were interrupted. Given that these same attackers recently had beaten Morose to death in his home, it appears that this interrupted beating of Dorante in his home rises to the level of attempted murder, which we\u2019ve held constitutes persecution. <em>See Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Notably, however, our conclusion rests on Dorante\u2019s credibility, and the BIA declined to reach the IJ\u2019s alternative find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ing that Dorante was not credible. Thus, because the record compels a finding that Dorante suffered past persecution if his testimony is credible, we remand for the BIA to consider Dorante\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-20\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-17\">. Finally, Dorante briefly argues on appeal that the BIA and IJ erred in finding that he did not meet his burden of showing that could not relocate safely within Haiti. But he failed to exhaust this issue because he did not raise before the BIA any challenge to the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to show he could not relocate. Nevertheless, if Dorante prevails on his past persecution claim on remand, the burden would switch to the government to show that Dorante could safely and reasonably relocate to another part of Haiti. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i). Importantly, no agency has made no finding on whether the <em>government </em>has met its burden on relocation. Thus, if the BIA reverses the IJ\u2019s credibility finding on remand, it would likely need to remand for the IJ to make a new relocation finding in light of the new burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
