All of the claims have been dismissed on summary judgment, but we granted Smith leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) whether the district court erred by granting summary judgment dismissing an excessive-force claim against defendant Columbus Swopes arising on March 20, 2009, and an excessive-force claim against defendants Sean Murray and Mark Minshew arising on April 20, 2009. <em>Smith v. Murray, </em>No. 13-51134 (5th Cir. May 6, 2014) (unpublished order). IFP was denied as to all other claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">Smith has abandoned the essential issues for appeal by failing to brief them. <em>See Audler v. CBC Innovis Inc., </em>519 F.3d 239, 255 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). At best, his few bare assertions of excessive force, unsupported by any competent summary judgment evidence, do not show any genuine issue for trial. <em>See Duffle v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir.2007). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and all of Smith\u2019s claims against all defendants in this action are now dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b835-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
