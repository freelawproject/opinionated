His sole argument on appeal is that the district court\u2019s written judgment erroneously provided that he was convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2) when he was convicted only under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). The Government agreed with Perez,- and this court granted the Government\u2019s unopposed motion to modify the judgment and for a limited remand for entry of a corrected judgment. The district court subsequently entered a corrected judgment providing that Perez was convicted under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). The Government now moves for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Perez has received all of the relief that he seeks in the present appeal. Thus, the basis for the present appeal no longer exists, and summary affirmance is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the unopposed motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
