After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">Gibson worked as a carhop at Defendant Valley\u2019s Sonic Drive-In. It is undisputed that Defendant Valley terminated Gibson after she defied her supervisor\u2019s instructions and left her line position in the middle of a shift, cursed at her supervisor when she learned the supervisor had clocked her out, and then left the restaurant without completing her shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Gibson\u2019s discriminatory discharge claim. As the district court correctly pointed out, Gibson did not present any evidence that she was replaced by, or treated less favorably than, a similarly-situated employee outside her protected class. <em>See Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that in the disciplinary context, \u201cthe nature of the offenses committed and the nature of the punishment imposed\u201d are the most important factors). The male coworkers Gibson identified as potential comparators did not engage in misconduct that was similar to the misconduct for which Gibson was terminated. <em>See Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that to be \u201csimilarly situated\u201d for purposes of the prima facie case, the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct must be \u201cnearly identical\u201d). In her deposition and in her response to summary judgment, Gibson identified some male employees, but none of them walked away from a line of customers in direct contradiction of a supervisor\u2019s order and without notifying the supervisor, then cursed the supervisor and left the restaurant without finishing a scheduled shift. The misconduct Gibson said the male employees engaged in included things like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>using profanity, refusing to clean tables, or drinking beer at work, none of which was similar in degree or nature to Gibson\u2019s misconduct. Consequently, those male employees were not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to Gibson in all relevant respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In any event, Gibson did not present evidence that Defendant Valley\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating her was pretext. <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1087 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that if an employer satisfies its burden to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action, the plaintiff must produce evidence that the reason is pretext for illegal discrimination). Gibson admitted her misconduct and offered only her own conclusory allegations that her gender, as opposed to her misconduct, was the true reason for her termination. <em>See Mayfield, v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that conclusory allegations are insufficient \u201cto raise an inference of pretext or intentional discrimination\u201d where the employer has produced \u201cextensive evidence of legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Apart from her discharge, Gibson contends that she was discriminated against because her supervisors sometimes gave preferential treatment to certain male employees, such as allowing them to take breaks without clocking out, to drink beer, or to not answer the drive-through speaker. The district court correctly concluded that these employment actions were not sufficiently significant to constitute an adverse employment action. <em>See Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Fla., </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that an adverse employment action requires a significant change in employment status, such as firing, failing to hire or promote, or significantly changing responsibilities or benefits).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The district court refused to consider Gibson\u2019s retaliation and defamation claims because Gibson did not allege them in her complaint or in any other subsequent pleading prior to her summary judgment response. In this Court, Gibson did not challenge the district court\u2019s handling of her retaliation and defamation claims in her opening brief, and thus she did not preserve this issue for appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201cwe do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Finally, to the extent Gibson argues that the district court should have granted her motions for reconsideration, this claim lacks merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gibson contends that she did not properly oppose summary judgment because she did not understand that she could rely upon her own deposition and the other evidence Defendant Valley submitted in support of its summary judgment motion. In evaluating whether summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>judgment was warranted, however, the district court considered all the admissible evidence in the record, including Gibson\u2019s deposition. Moreover, the record evidence as a whole, including Gibson\u2019s deposition, did not demonstrate' the existence of a material factual dispute. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Gibson\u2019s motions for reconsideration on this ground.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-13\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">. Gibson does not appear to have alleged, and the district court did not consider, a gender-based hostile work environment claim. In any event, we note that, as described by Gibson in her deposition, her supervisors\u2019 actions in favoring certain male employees were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a gender-based hostile work environment. <em>See Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., </em>594 F.3d 798, 808 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\">. Although Gibson's <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal designated only the district court\u2019s December 19, 2013 summary judgment order, it is apparent from Gibson's initial appeal brief that she intended also to appeal the district court's January 7, 2014 order denying her motions for reconsideration. Accordingly, we liberally construe Gibson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal to include the January 7, 2014 order. <em>See KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b599-15\">.
