(collectively \u201cthe Oil Companies\u201d) brought a breach of contract claim against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims. After appeal to the Federal Circuit and to the Supreme Court, they prevailed, and the Federal Circuit entered judgment in their favor on remand. <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>236 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed.Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cContract Judgment </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">The Oil Companies demanded post-judgment interest on the Federal Circuit contract judgment. When the government refused to pay, the Oil Companies brought a new claim alleging that they were entitled to the interest under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2). The Court of Federal Claims dismissed their complaint. <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>56 Fed.Cl. 768 (2003) <em>(\u201cInterest Opinion </em>\u201d). We affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing the Oil Companies\u2019 claim for post-judgment interest. We hold that the Oil Companies have not demonstrated a waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on final judgments against the United States in the Federal Circuit that unambiguously extends to encompass their contract judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">In 1981, the Oil Companies purchased interests in oil and gas leases from the United States. In 1990, new federal legislation impacted the Oil Companies\u2019 rights under the lease contracts. The Oil Companies sued for breach of contract in the Court of Federal Claims and won, receiving judgments in the amount of over $78 million each. <em>Conoco, Inc. v. United States, </em>35 Fed. Cl. 309 (1996). On appeal, we reversed, <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1331 (Fed.Cir.1999), but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed again, <em>Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, </em>528 U.S. 1002, 120 S.Ct. 494, 145 L.Ed.2d 381 (1999), holding that the government had breached its contracts with the Oil Companies. On December 28, 2000, we rejected an argument by the government on remand that the damages award should be reduced, and we affirmed the initial judgments of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Contract Judgment, </em>236 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>at 1315-16. The mandate issued on February 23, 2001, and the government did not seek review in the Supreme Court. On February 28, 2001, the Court of Federal Claims reinstated its initial judgments in favor of the Oil Companies, and on May 1, 2001, the government paid the amounts specified in the judgments to the Oil Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The amounts paid, however, did not include post-judgment interest on the Federal Circuit contract judgment. The Oil Companies made a demand to the Department of the Treasury for this interest, but the demand was rejected. The Oil Companies next filed this lawsuit seeking post-judgment interest for the period from December 28, 2000 \u2014 the date of the Federal Circuit\u2019s contract judgment on remand from the Supreme Court \u2014 through May 1, 2001 \u2014 the date on which the government paid the contract judgment. In the Court of Federal Claims, the Oil Companies argued that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) waives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity from a claim for post-judgment interest on the contract judgment because the statute requires the government to pay post-judgment interest on \u201call final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal [Cjircuit.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The Court of Federal Claims rejected the Oil Companies\u2019 arguments and dismissed their complaint. <em>Interest Opinion, </em>56 Fed.Cl. at 776. The court stated two reasons why section 1961(c)(2) did not waive sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment. First, the court held that \u201cthe plaintiffs received their awards ... pursuant to final judgments \u25a0 of the Court of Federal Claims, not the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 773. Therefore, the \u201c \u2018judgment\u2019 of the Federal Circuit on December 28, 2000 was not a \u2018final judgment\u2019 within the contemplation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2)....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, the court held that, even assuming the Federal Circuit judgment to be a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for the purposes of section 1961(c)(2), the waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on some Federal Circuit judgments that is embodied in section 1961(c)(2) did not unambiguously encompass interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 773-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The Oil Companies timely appealed the Court of Federal Claims judgment to us, and we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">This appeal turns on the proper interpretation of a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as the term is used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2), and on the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by that statute. This court reviews without deference both issues of statutory construction, <em>Ainslie v. United States, </em>355 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2004), and issues of sovereign immunity, <em>Ins. Co. of the West v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">\u201cAs sovereign, the United States, in the absence of its consent, is immune from suit.\u201d <em>Library of Congress v. Shaw, </em>478 U.S. 310, 315, 106 S.Ct. 2957, 92 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986) (citing <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941)). Guided by \u201cthe historical view that interest is an element of damages separate from damages on the substantive claim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 314, 106 S.Ct. 2957; the rule of sovereign immunity not only extends to create governmental immunity from an interest award, it does so in the guise of the \u201cno-interest rule,\u201d requiring consent to liability for interest on a damage award to be \u201caffirmatively and separately contemplated by Congress,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 315, 106 S.Ct. 2957. Thus, the waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>for sovereign immunity for interest must be distinct from a general waiver of immunity for the cause of action resulting in the damages award against the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 316, 106 S.Ct. 2957 (affirming that \u201cfederal statutes cannot be read to permit interest to run on a recovery against the United States unless Congress affirmatively mandates that result\u201d); <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>8 F.3d 791, 798 (Fed.Cir.1993) (\u201cInterest may not be recovered against the government in the absence of an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity for that purpose\u201d). The no-interest rule applies to claims for post-judgment interest. <em>See, e.g., United States v. N.Y. Rayon Imp. Co., </em>329 U.S. 654, 661, 67 S.Ct. 601, 91 L.Ed. 577 (1947) (noting that the no-interest rule includes claims for interest \u201carising out of pre-existing judgments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Well established rules of statutory construction frame a court\u2019s analysis of whether Congress has waived sovereign immunity in a statute or statutory scheme, and they tilt the interpretive playing field in favor of the government\u2019s immunity. \u201cIn analyzing whether Congress has waived the immunity of the United States, we must construe waivers strictly in favor of the sovereign, and not enlarge the waiver \u2018beyond what the language requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957 (quoting <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 685-86, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983) (quoting <em>E. Transp. Co. v. United States, </em>272 U.S. 675, 686, 47 S.Ct. 289, 71 L.Ed. 472 (1927)) (citation omitted)). A waiver of sovereign immunity \u201cmust be unequivocally expressed,\u201d or a court must infer that Congress did not intend to create a waiver. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. King, </em>395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969)); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>514 U.S. 527, 531, 115 S.Ct. 1611, 131 L.Ed.2d 608 (1995); <em>United States v. Nordic Vill., Inc., </em>503 U.S. 30, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992); <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990); <em>Kalan, Inc. v. United States, </em>944 F.2d 847, 849-50 (Fed.Cir.1991). If a statute is susceptible to a plausible reading under which sovereign immunity is not waived, the statute fails to establish an unambiguous waiver and sovereign immunity therefore remains intact. <em>See Nordic Vill., </em>503 U.S. at 37, 112 S.Ct. 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">With respect to waiver of sovereign immunity for interest on damage awards against the United States, \u201c[t]he no-interest rule provides an added gloss of strictness upon these usual rules.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957. To conclude that a statute waives sovereign immunity for interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">[Tjhere can be no consent by implication or by use of ambiguous language. Nor can an intent on the part of the framers of a statute or contract to permit the recovery of interest suffice where the intent is not translated into affirmative statutory or contractual terms. The consent necessary to waive the traditional immunity must be express, and it must be strictly construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>N.Y. Rayon Imp., </em>329 U.S. at 659, 67 S.Ct. 601) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">The Oil Companies contend on appeal that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) demonstrates that Congress has waived sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on their contract judgment. The Court of Federal Claims provided two grounds to support its conclusion that the Oil Companies\u2019 contention is incorrect. We examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">The Court of Federal Claims erred in holding that the December 28, 2000 judgment was not a \u201cfinal judgment! 1 ... in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u201d as envisioned by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2). Although it is true, as the Court of Federal Claims noted, that \u201cthe language of the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion and judgment ... clearly state[s] that the court was affirming the prior judgments of the Court of Federal Claims,\u201d <em>Interest Opinion, </em>56 Fed.Cl. at 771, the legal accuracy of a trial court\u2019s judgment is not determinative of the status of the judgment of a court of appeals as a final judgment of that court. A final judgment is \u201c[a] court\u2019s last action that settles the rights of the parties and disposes of all issues in controversy, except for the award of costs (and, sometimes, attorney\u2019s fees) and enforcement of the judgment.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>847 (7th ed.1999); <em>cf. Catlin v. United States, </em>824 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945) (holding that in the context of appellate jurisdiction a \u2018final decision\u2019 generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment). Our December 28, 2000 judgment was, temporally, our last action in the Oil Companies\u2019 suit for breach of contract, and it did not remand any substantive disputes on liability or on damages for resolution in the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Cf. Williams v. Principa </em>275 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that a remand is generally not a final judgment). It was, therefore, a final judgment of this court for the purposes of section 1961(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Given that the December 28, 2000 judgment was a final judgment of the Federal Circuit under section 1961(c)(2), we must consider whether section 1961(c)(2) unambiguously waives sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on \u201call\u201d judgments of the Federal Circuit as the Oil Companies posit it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Section 1961(c)(2) cannot be read in isolation. Its express language triggers a chain of cross-references that links four distinct statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Section 1961, in its entirety, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-11\">(a) Interest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court. Execution therefor may be levied by the marshal, in any case where, by the law of the State in which such court is held, execution may be levied for interest on judgments recovered in the courts of the State. Such interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment, at a rate equal to the weekly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding! ] the date of the judgment. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall distribute notice of that rate and any changes in it to all Federal judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-12\">(b) Interest shall be computed daily to the date of payment except as provided in section 2516(b) of this title and section 1304(b) of title 31, and shall be compounded annually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-13\">(c) (1) This section shall not apply in any judgment of any court with respect to any internal revenue tax case. Interest shall be allowed in such cases at the underpayment rate or overpayment rate (whichever is appropriate) established under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, interest shall be allowed on all final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal [Cjircuit, at the rate provided in subsection (a) and as provided in subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">(3) Interest shall be allowed, computed, and paid on judgments of the United States Court of Federal Claims only as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection or in any other provision of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-6\">(4) This section shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 (2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. III 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">As relevant to this appeal, section 1961(c)(2) provides that \u201cinterest shall be allowed on all final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal [Cjircuit ... as provided in subsection (b),\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> id. \u00a7 1961(c)(2), and section 1961(b) states that \u201c[ijnterest shall be computed daily to the date of payment except as provided in section 2516(b) of this title and section 1304(b) of title 31, and shall be compounded annually,\u201d id. 1961(b). Section 2516(b), in turn, provides that: \u201c[ijnterest on a judgment against the United States affirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States is paid at\u201d the same rate specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2516(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Finally, chapter 13 of title 31, entitled \u201cAppropriations,\u201d contains 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, commonly known as the Judgment Fund statute, which, according to its title, creates an appropriation for \u201cJudgments, awards, and compromise settlements.\u201d Section 1304(b), the only subsection of section 1304 referenced in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(b), provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">(1) Interest may be paid from the appropriation made by this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-13\">(A) on a judgment of a district court, only when the judgment becomes final after review on appeal or petition by the United States Government, and then only from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the Secretary of the Treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-14\">(B) <em>on a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or the </em>United States Court of Federal Claims <em>under section 2516(b) of title 28, only from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the Secretary of the Treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-15\">(2) Interest payable under this subsection in a proceeding reviewed by the Supreme Court is not allowed after the end of the term in which the judgment is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) (2000) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">The Oil Companies\u2019 argument is straightforward. The Oil Companies argue that, under the plain language of section 1961(c)(2), Congress has unambiguously waived sovereign immunity for \u201call final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal [Cjircuit.\u201d All means all, they say, and all includes their contract judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>The Oil Companies recognize that section 1961(c)(2) provides for interest on judgments only \u201cas provided in subsection (b),\u201d but they contend that subsection (b) supports, rather than detracts from, their argument. Subsection (b) formulates a general rule for calculating interest and identifying the time period during which interest accrues: [Ijnterest shall be computed daily to the date of payment.... 28 U.S.C.1961(b). This general rule applies except as provided in section 2516(b) of this title and section 1304(b) of title 31. Id. According to the Oil Companies, these two sections merely place different constraints on the computation of interest. They permit interest only on a particular subset of judgments against the United States- \u2014 those judgments \u201cagainst the United States affirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2516(b); see also 31 U.S.C. 1304(b)(1)(B) (addressing only interest \u201con a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ... under section 2516(b) of title 28\u201d). With respect to these particular judgments against the United States, the two statutes define a window during which interest is available that is different from the one specified in section 1961(b), stating that interest is to be computed \u201conly from the date of filing of the transcript of the judgment with the Secretary of the Treasury through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.\u201d 31 U.S.C. 1304(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">According to the Oil Companies\u2019 theory, neither section 1961(b) nor the two statutes it references negate the government\u2019s liability for interest on all Federal Circuit judgments established in section 1961(c)(2) because these statutes address only the secondary, technical issue of how to compute the required interest. Furthermore, the Oil Companies contend that the interest owed on their contract judgment is unaffected by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) or 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b). These sections are only relevant to the limited set of judgments expressly delineated therein \u2014 that is, to judgments \u201caffirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States.\u201d For all judgments against the United States that the United States does not unsuccessfully appeal to the Supreme Court, the Oil Companies insist that the provisions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(B) do not impact the existence or the scope of the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity as established in section 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">In summary, the Oil Companies contend (1) that section 1961(c)(2) provides a rule that is applicable to all (meaning all) judgments of the Federal Circuit, and (2) that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) merely list particular circumstances not relevant to this appeal under which interest on judgments of the Federal Circuit against the United States is computed according to a rule other than the one specified in section 1961(b). Because the United States did not petition the Supreme Court for review of the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment, the Oil Companies argue that the exceptions do not affect their right to post-judgment interest, and they seek interest running from the date the judgment was entered to the date the judgment was paid as provided in section 1961(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Viewing this argument from a historical perspective, the Oil Companies propose that the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (\u201cFCIA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 97-164, 96 Stat. 25 (1982), which created this court and enacted subsections (b) and (c)(2) of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961, left the pre-1982 waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest intact for all of the judgments that it had historically encompassed, but created a new \u2014 and broader \u2014 waiver for interest on all other judgments for which sover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>eign immunity had never before been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Prior to the enactment of FCIA, <em>31 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 724a contained language similar to the post-FCIA language now found in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b). Section 724a, entitled \u201cAppropriations for payment of judgments ... against the United States,\u201d stated that \u201cwhenever a judgment rendered by the Court of Claims [now the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit] is payable from this appropriation, interest payable thereon in accordance with section 2516(b) of title 28 shall be computed from the date of the filing of the transcript thereof in the General Accounting Office.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 724a (1976). Prior to 1982, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) provided, as it does today, for interest on judgments \u201cagainst the United States affirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) (1976). Before the FCIA, these two statutes were the only statutes addressing post-judgment interest on judgments of the Court of Claims, and they were held to waive sovereign immunity \u201cfor post-judgment interest only during the period that [the government] appealed its adverse judgment to the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Kennickell, </em>797 F.2d 1015, 1018 (D.C.Cir.1986). We find no cases suggesting that prior to 1982 the government paid post-judgment interest on Court of Claims judgments against the United States that the United States did not seek to have reviewed in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Thus, for judgments of the Federal Circuit against the United States reviewed by the Supreme Court on the government\u2019s request and affirmed, the Oil Companies suggest that the pre- and post-FCIA waiver of sovereign immunity is identical and that the waiver is \u201cfor post-judgment interest only during the period that [the government] appealed its adverse judgment to the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Oil Companies contend, however, that while this figure has remained constant, the FCIA shifted the ground from black to white. The Oil Companies argue that subsections (c)(2) and (b) of section 1961 now not only waive sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on all judgments against the United States that the government chooses not to appeal to the Supreme Court \u2014 judgments that were previously entirely beyond the scope of the waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest \u2014 but also that they waive sovereign immunity for interest on such judgments from the date of the judgment until the date of payment \u2014 a time period potentially longer than is permitted for appealed judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Needless to say, the government views the effect of the statutory scheme on sovereign immunity from liability for post-judgment interest differently. It argues that the pre-FCIA regime remains in force today unaltered by the enactment of subsections (c)(2) and (b) of section 1961. It argues that the relevant statutes are clear on their face, waiving immunity only narrowly as in the past, and that, at best, the Oil Companies have demonstrated an ambiguity in the statutory scheme that by law precludes a waiver of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>We conclude that the Oil Companies have not demonstrated an unequivocal or unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on their contract judgment. The interaction of sections 1961(c)(2) and (b), on the one hand, and sections 2516(b) and 1304(b), on the other hand, is subject to plausible readings under which Congress has not waived sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on judgments of the Federal Circuit against the United States that the United States does not seek to have reviewed in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">In the end, the legal choice is simple and self-evident. Either the relevant statute could mean that all final judgments of the Federal Circuit carry post-judgment interest, or it could mean that all final judgments as provided in the relevant statutes, less than the global universe of \u201call final judgments,\u201d carry such interest. Given the legal test to be administered to the statutes at hand, and the statutes themselves as discussed below, there can be no doubt that Congress has not unequivocally excluded the narrower reading of the relevant statutes. Given the fact that Congress never before had even contemplated waiving sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on <em>all </em>final judgments of a court of appeals, the notion that it has done so for the Federal Circuit with nary a word of legislative history to support such a sweeping change strikes us as nearly beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Section 1961(b) establishes a general rule for interest calculation \u201cexcept as provided in section 2516(b) of this title and section 1304(b) of title 31.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(b). On its face, it is susceptible to both a reading favoring the Oil Companies and a reading favoring the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">As discussed above, the Oil Companies suggest one reading: The exception in section 1961(b) should be read to mean \u201cexcept as provided [for the specific set of judgments listed] in section 2516(b) ... and section 1304(b),\u201d namely except when the judgment against the United States is \u201caffirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">However, a second plausible reading exists as well. The reference to sections 2516(b) of title 28 and 1304(b) of title 31 is a citation to all of the relevant provisions in the United States code that deal directly with post-judgment interest on judgments against the government,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so the reference to these statutes in section 1961(b) can be read to refer to all judgments against the government. According to this reading, the exception in section 1961(b) should be read to mean \u201cexcept as provided [for the general class of judgments addressed] in section 2516(b) ... and section 1304(b),\u201d namely except when the judgment is against the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Under this second reading, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on a judgment like the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment that the government does not seek, unsuccessfully, to have reviewed in the Supreme Court. Interest on such a judgment is withdrawn from the scope of the general rule in section 1961(b) because the judgment is against the government, but does not fall within the scope of the interest provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) and/or 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) because the judgment does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>satisfy the criteria therein stated. In sum, under this reading, Congress has not created a rule for computing interest on such a judgment, so Congress has not waived immunity for interest on such a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The Oil Companies argue that the second reading is not a plausible reading because it renders section 1961(c)(2) superfluous by making sections 2516(b) and 1304(b) determinative of the outcome in all cases seeking post-judgment interest on judgments of the Federal Circuit.. In the context of section 1961 as a whole, we conclude that some redundancy in statutory provisions is insufficient to transform a plausible reading into an implausible one. Several provisions of section 1961(c) are replete with redundancy, and section 1961(c) is thus more easily read as providing an overview intended to emphasize and to cross-reference rather than as codifying law not provided for elsewhere. For example, subsection (c)(3) states that: \u201cInterest shall be allowed, computed, and paid on judgments of the United States Court of Federal Claims only as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection or in any other provision of law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(3). Court of Federal Claims judgments are mentioned nowhere else in section 1961; subsection (1), which provides the rule for internal revenue tax cases, would presumably apply to internal revenue tax cases in the Court of Federal Claims without the aid of subsection (c)(3); \u201cother provision[s] of law\u201d would also presumably apply to Court of Federal Claim judgments without the benefit of subsection (e)(3). Likewise, subsection (4) states that: \u201cThis section shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1961(c)(4). Presumably, this provision is redundant in light of ordinary plain-meaning principles of statutory interpretation, and strict-construction principles of sovereign immunity, and was added by Congress for emphasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">In summary, the reading of the \u201cexcept as provided in\u201d language of section 1961(b) under which Congress did not waive sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment is a plausible reading, and the existence of a plausible reading under which Congress has not waived sovereign immunity means that we are obliged to conclude from the plain language of the statute that Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity. <em>See Nordic Vill., </em>503 U.S. at 37, 112 S.Ct. 1011 (noting that sovereign immunity was not waived because the readings of a statute that did not waive sovereign immunity were, although \u201cassuredly not the only readings,\u201d plausible readings).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Another argument suggests to us as well that, despite the presence of the word \u201call\u201d in section 1961(c)(2), Congress has not unequivocally waived sovereign immunity for interest on judgments of the Federal Circuit against the United States unless the criteria listed in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) are satisfied. There can be no unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on a broad array of judgments of this court if Congress has not clearly appropriated funds with which the government can pay the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Under the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, funds from the Treasury cannot be used for purposes other than those permitted by the appropriating statute. <em>See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 424, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990) (\u201cMoney may be paid out [of the Federal Treasury] only through an appropriation made by law; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>other words, the payment of money from the Treasury must be authorized by a statute.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 432, 110 S.Ct. 2465 (\u201cThe general appropriation for payment of judgments ... does not create an all-purpose fund for judicial disbursement.... Rather, funds may be paid out only on the basis of a judgment based on a substantive right to compensation based on the express terms of a specific statute.\u201d). The congressional appropriation that creates the Judgment Fund, from which the government pays interest on all judgments \u201cnot otherwise provided for,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(a)(1), thus can only be dispensed in accordance with the terms of section 1304. In light of these strict rules governing the expenditure of the Treasury\u2019s funds, it is plausible to construe the role of section 1304(b) in the concatenation of statutes at issue in this appeal as more important than merely explaining the method of computing post-judgment interest for the narrow subset of judgments against the United States that the Oil Companies argue are excepted from section 1961(b). It is plausible to conclude that the scope of the appropriation in section 1304(b) is jurisdictional in nature, and that the government has waived sovereign immunity \u2014 and thus is liable \u2014 only for the interest specified therein. Under this reading, Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity only for interest payments that satisfy the conditions of section 1304(b) because Congress has appropriated funds to pay interest only under those conditions. Inversely, Congress did not intend to waive sovereign immunity for interest payments for which Congress has provided no funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">As discussed above, the Oil Companies\u2019 claim for interest on their contract judgment does not satisfy the conditions of section 1304(b), so to the extent that the statutory restrictions on dispersal of funds from the Judgment Fund to pay interest on judgments are jurisdictional, the Oil Companies\u2019 claim must fail. The Oil Companies failed to counter the proposition that section 1304 is the only potential existing source of funding for the post-judgment interest that they seek and that Congress has not provided for payment of the interest allegedly authorized by section 1961(c)(2) elsewhere.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 1304(b)(1)(B) permits payment of interest from the Judgment Fund appropriation created by section 1304 only on final judgments of the Federal Circuit against the United States that the United States unsuccessfully appeals to the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(B) (concerning only judgments \u201cof the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ... under section 2516(b) of title 28\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) (pertaining only to judgments \u201cagainst the United States affirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States\u201d). The government did not petition for review of the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment, so Congress has not expressly appropriated funds in section 1304(b)(1)(B) to pay interest on judgments such as the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment. No other subsection of 1304(b) permits payment of the sought-after interest either. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A) (addressing interest \u201con a judgment of a district court\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1304(b)(2) (placing an additional limitation on interest otherwise payable under subsection (b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Returning to the language of section 1961(c)(2), whether the word \u201call\u201d claims a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>universe that includes a subset of final judgments for which certiorari is successfully taken, or whether Congress meant \u201call\u201d to mean all of those cases for which it clearly has provided a source of funding in section 1304 but not another category of final judgments for which Congress has provided no funding, is ambiguous. However, construing the interest-related provisions of the Judgment Fund in section 1304(b) as limitations on the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, we would be required to find ambiguity in the overall statutory scheme even if the language of subsections (c)(2) and (b) of section 1961 were, hypothetically, crystal clear when read in isolation from the Judgment Fund statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The reasonableness of concluding that the contours of section 1304(b)(1) determine the liability of the United States for post-judgment interest is supported by the pronouncements of other courts on the jurisdictional nature of section 1304(b)(1). In <em>Transco Leasing Corp. v. United States, </em>992 F.2d 552, 554-55 (5th Cir.1993), the Fifth Circuit interpreted section 1304(b)(1)(A), the statute controlling access to the Judgment Fund for the government to pay interest on judgments of the district courts, as determinative of the scope of Congress\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">Section 1961[ (b) ] restricts the liability of the United States for postjudgment interest to amounts funded in section 1304. Section 1304(b), then, acts as more than an appropriation statute, it limits the <em>liability </em>of the United States for postjudgment interest, by limiting the waiver of sovereign immunity to the time periods it specifies. Accordingly, we reject appellees\u2019 contention that section 1304 is not controlling because it is an appropriation statute which determines which judgments and amounts the United States will pay, but does not determine whether or not the United States is liable for a particular judgment or award of interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-9\"><em>Transco Leasing, </em>992 F.2d at 555 (citations omitted); <em>see also Bhargava v. Veneman, </em>143 F.Supp.2d 16, 18 (D.D.C.2001) (construing 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A) as a waiver of sovereign immunity that determines the conditions under which interest on district court judgments may be awarded against the United States); <em>Moyer v.

The government\u2019s argument relied on the language in section 1304(a)(3)(A) permitting payment from the judgment fund for judgments \u201cunder section 2414,\u201d and section 2414\u2019s provision solely for the \u201cpayment of final judgments.\u201d The court ruled against the government, however, concluding that the language in section 2414 incorporated by reference into the Judgment Fund statute was not designed \u201cto retract or limit duly enacted waivers of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335; <em>see also Rosenfeld, </em>859 F.2d at 726 (\u201cSince Congress waived sovereign immunity from attorney\u2019s fees in the FOIA actions ... no additional waiver is required [in the Judgment Fund statute] for interim fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">We express no opinion on whether the waiver of sovereign immunity from interim attorney fees in these cases was truly \u201cunequivocally expressed,\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. at 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, but we conclude that the discussion of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414 in <em>Rosenfeld </em>and <em>Trout </em>does not render implausible our interpretation of the role that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1) plays in maintaining and waiving sovereign immunity for interest on Federal Circuit judgments against the United States. The courts in both <em>Trout </em>and <em>Rosenfeld </em>relied on the fact that self-contained waivers of sovereign immunity existed in Title VII and the FOIA, statutes completely unconnected to the Judgment Fund statute. In contrast, the alleged waiver of sovereign immunity in section 1961(c)(2) on which the Oil Companies rely in the instant case includes a reference, via section 1961(b), to the very limitations in section 1304(b)(1)(B) at issue. Whereas the court in <em>Trout </em>began its analysis of the Judgment Fund statute by reaffirming the \u201cwell-accepted\u201d proposition that \u201csovereign immunity does not bar a <em>claim </em>by a Title VII plaintiff for interim fees against the government,\u201d 891 F.2d at 334, we must consider the reference to the Judgment Fund statute in section 1961(b) in the first instance to determine whether a claim for interest by a party granted a final judgment by the Federal Circuit is barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Additionally, the sovereign immunity inquiry is different for the Judgment Fund provision in section 1304(a), addressed in <em>Trout </em>and <em>Rosenfeld, </em>and the Judgment Fund provision in section 1304(b) at issue here. The interest-specific provisions in subsection (b) are subject to the \u201cno-interest rule\u201d and thus to an \u201cadded gloss of strictness\u201d on the traditional sovereign immunity analysis. <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Finally, we note that <em>Rosenfeld </em>relied on the fact that \u201cwhen a court has rejected the Judgment Fund argument [casting section 1304 as a waiver of sovereign immunity], the government has managed to pay the interim fee award.\u201d 859 F.2d at 727. For evidence of this fact, <em>Rosenfeld </em>cited <em>Jurgens v.

When faced with a citation for contempt of court, however, the defendants in <em>Shafer </em>made immediate payment. The court believes that the EEOC can also arrange for immediate payment of this court\u2019s interim award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An3\"><em>Jurgens, </em>660 F.Supp. at 1102. However, the Supreme Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">[I]t would be most anomalous for a judicial order to require a Government official ... to make an extrastatutory payment of federal funds.

Here, where the Oil Companies cannot suggest an appropriate statutory appropriation of funds with which interest on their $156 million contract judgments could be paid, we decline to infer that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest when payment could only occur extrastatutorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">As with the core ambiguity in section 1961(c)(2), we thus conclude that it is plausible to read section 1304(b)(1)(B) to likewise \u201cdetermine whether or not the United States is liable for a particular judgment or award of [post-judgment] interest.\u201d <em>Transco Leasing, </em>992 F.2d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">Requested at oral argument to identify a statute authorizing the appropriation of funds from which interest on their contract judgment could be paid, as interest cannot be paid under the terms of section 1304(b)(1), the Oil Companies were quick to suggest section 1304(a). The Oil Companies argue that the interest on \u201call final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal [C]ircuit\u201d described in section 1961(c)(2) is interest ... otherwise authorized by law as provided for in section 1304(a), and that section 1304(a) by its own force therefore appropriates the \u201c[necessary amounts\u201d to pay their sought-after interest. Even assuming that the interest mentioned in section 1961(c)(2) is \u201cinterest ... otherwise authorized by law,\u201d however, this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Section 1304(a) authorizes payment from the Judgment Fund only when the judgment is payable under one of the statutes listed in subsection (a)(3), as the numbered subsections of the statute are written in the conjunctive. In full, section 1304(a)(3) authorizes the appropriation of funds \u201cwhen ... the judgment, award, or settlement is payable \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-11\">(A) under section 2414, 2517, 2672, or 2677 of title 28;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-12\">(B) under section 3723 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-13\">(C) under a decision of a board of contract appeals; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-14\">(D) in excess of an amount payable from the appropriations of an agency for a meritorious claim under section 2733 or 2734 of title 10, section 715 of title 32, or section 203 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2473).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(a)(3). None of the listed statutes authorize the payment of a judgment of the Federal Circuit. Thus, to the extent that the Oil Companies seek payment of interest based on their contract judgment obtained in this court, section 1304(a) does not aid their cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-16\">The Oil Companies could argue, however, that the judgment for which they seek payment from the Judgment Fund is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>Court of Federal Claims judgment that they would receive if they were to prevail on this appeal. Subsection (a)(8)(A) provides for payment from the Judgment Fund of judgments payable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517, which in turn authorizes the payment of \u201cevery final judgment rendered by the United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(a) (2000). A construction of section 1304(a) permitting payment from the Judgment Fund under this theory is tenuous, as it would require two different portions of section 1304(a) to refer to two different judgments: the interest ... otherwise authorized by law in subsection (a) would refer to interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 Federal Circuit contract judgment, and the judgment payable under section 2517 in subsection (a)(3)(A) would refer to the Court of Federal Claims judgment sought in this appeal. Nonetheless, even accepting this construction of section 1304(a), the Oil Companies\u2019 argument fails to demonstrate an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity. Subsection (a) of section 1304 is clearly not independent of subsection (b)(1), and subsection (b)(1) is plausibly read to limit the post-judgment interest payable under subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">This line of analysis requires us to confront the language in section 1304(b)(1) which states that \u201c[ijnterest may be paid from the appropriation made by this section,\u201d namely section 1304 or the Judgment Fund as a whole. 31 U.S.C. 1304(b)(1) (emphasis added). If the \u201cmay\u201d language in subsection (b)(1) is simply permissive, allowing not only the conditions in (a) and (b) but other conditions as well to warrant payment from the Judgment Fund, the Oil Companies could navigate the interstices of section 1304 with success. But the matter is not so simple, as the word \u201cmay\u201d in some contexts is not permissive but indeed is interpreted as restrictive in nature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v.

Bougas, </em>434 U.S. 35, 38, 98 S.Ct. 88, 54 L.Ed.2d 218 (1977) (noting that it is \u201csettled\u201d that the word \u201cmay\u201d in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 94 means \u201cmay ... only\u201d in the restrictive sense of the word). Whereas a permissive reading of may would make subsection (b)(1) an enumeration of conditions sufficient for the payment of post-judgment interest, a restrictive reading of may would transform subsection (b)(1) into a list of conditions necessary for the payment of post-judgment interest. Without doubt, if the may in subsection (b)(1) were to be restrictive, then the provisions of subsection (b)(1)(B) would clearly prohibit the payment of interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 final contract judgment of this court in this particular case. Thus, for the Oil Companies to succeed, the permissive reading must be unequivocally the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>reading. We decline to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In <em>Cortez Byrd Chips, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the word \u201cmay\u201d in three related venue provisions of the FAA, including section 9 that provides that, to confirm an arbitration award, \u201capplication may be made to the United States court in and for the district within which such award was made.\u201d 529 U.S. at 197, 120 S.Ct. 1331 (quoting 9 U.S.C. 9). One party argued that the statute was permissive in that it liberalized venue by adding another district in which confirmation could occur; the other party countered that the statute was restrictive in that it required confirmation to occur in the specified district. The Court expressly declined to resolve this issue based on the plain meaning of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\">Enlightenment will not come merely from parsing the language, which is less clear then either party contends. Although \u201cmay\u201d could be read as permissive in each section ... the mere use of \u201cmay\u201d is not necessarily conclusive of congressional intent to provide for permissive or discretionary authority.... Each party has a point, but neither point is conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 198-99, 120 S.Ct. 1331. Instead, the Court examined the statutory history and animating policy of the venue provisions of the FAA and determined that \u201cmay\u201d was used in the permissive sense. <em>Id. </em>at 199\u2014 204,120 S.Ct. 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">We find the Court\u2019s reasoning in Cortez Byrd Chips both persuasive and decisive. Even if read in the light most favorable to the Oil Companies, the plain language of the \u201cmay\u201d provision in section 1304(b)(1) is not unequivocally permissive language. Rather, it is ambiguous, and an ambiguous statute cannot waive sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest. See <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 318, 106 S.Ct. 2957.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Seen in the light. of the standards of legal review that we must apply to the question of whether Congress has waived the sovereign\u2019s right to refuse to pay interest, we think there necessarily is ambiguity in the. meaning of the word \u201call\u201d in section 1961(c)(2) and the phrase \u201cexcept as provided in\u201d in section 1961(b), as well as in the relationship between section 1961 and the Judgment Fund statute. Any of these ambiguities alone, given the legal test to be applied, is enough to defeat the claim to post-judgment interest made by the Oil Companies, as they candidly conceded at oral argument. The statutes cited by the Oil Companies do not offer an \u201cunequivocal\u201d waiver of sovereign immunity, <em>Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. at 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349 (quoting <em>King, </em>395 U.S. at 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501), for post-judgment interest sufficiently broad to encompass interest on the Oil Companies\u2019 contract judgment, especially when the statutes are strictly construed in favor of the sovereign, <em>Shaw, </em>478 U.S. at 318,106 S.Ct. 2957.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">6</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Given that sections 1961(c)(2) and 1961(b) are ambiguous, the legislative history of the FCIA is legally irrelevant: If Congress has left us with an ambiguous statute, no waiver of sovereign immunity can be found, regardless of what Congress may or may not have intended as a purpose for its statute. Nonetheless, lest there be any lingering doubt that perhaps Congress intended to depart from the historical narrow waiver of immunity for post-judgment interest (as unambiguously reflected in pre-FCIA law), the legislative history of the FCIA makes absolutely certain that Congress intended that the new statutes fashioned to make way for the new Federal Circuit were not to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>the narrow waiver of immunity that preceded the FCIA. Subsections (c)(2) and (b) of section 1961, as well as 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b), were enacted as part of the FCIA in 1982, and the FCIA\u2019s legislative history strongly suggests that Congress did not intend for these sections to constitute a broad waiver of sovereign immunity for interest on Federal Circuit judgments against the United States other than those judgments described in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">As discussed above, prior to 1982, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(b) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 724a waived sovereign immunity only for claims for post-judgment interest on Court of Claims (now Federal Circuit) judgments against the United States that the United States sought to have reviewed in the Supreme Court. Although the FCIA\u2019s addition of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961(b) and (c)(2) transformed these two formerly freestanding statutes into statutes referenced by the \u201cexcept as provided in\u201d provision of section 1961(b), the legislative history of the FCIA shows that Congress intended the FCIA to preserve the preexisting interpretation of these two statutes with respect to post-judgment interest. <em>See generally Thompson, </em>797 F.2d at 1022-26 (discussing the legislative history of the FCIA as relevant to whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a) waived sovereign immunity for post-judgment interest on all district court judgments against the United States); <em>Ulmet v. United States, </em>19 Cl.Ct. 527, 537-38 (1990) (discussing the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) as relevant to whether post-judgment interest accrues on judgments of the Claims Court, now the United States Court of Federal Claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The original Senate bill contained language that would have made the United States liable for post-judgment interest on all judgments, \u201cincluding judgments of the United States [Court of Federal Claims].\u201d S. 1700, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 302(a)(3), 127 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>23,093 (1981). This sweeping potential change to the law was brought to the attention of Congress in a letter from Mr. Stockman, then the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that advocated for maintaining the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d 127 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>29,865-66 (Dec. 8, 1981) (noting that under the then-current regime \u201cthe Federal Government only pays post-judgment interest when it appeals from a Court of Claims judgment to the Supreme Court and loses\u201d and advocating an amendment to \u201cmaintain the status quo\u201d under which \u201cinterest [would] be paid only during the pendency of unsuccessful appeals to the Supreme Court\u201d). In response to Mr. Stockman\u2019s letter, Senator Grassley introduced an amendment to the Senate bill containing essentially the language now found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) and stated that \u201cthe amendment ... retain[s] the status quo with respect to accumulation of interest on judgments of the Court of Claims,\u201d now the Federal Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 29,865.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Because the statutes cited by the Oil Companies do not demonstrate an unequivocal waiver of <em>sovereign </em>immunity from the Oil Companies\u2019 claim for post-judgment interest on their contract judgment, no waiver of sovereign immunity has occurred for the post-judgment interest they seek.

The reference to subsection (c)(1) in section 1961(c)(2) applies only to tax cases and is not germane to the Oil Companies' argument.

The government also argues that we are bound by our previous decision in <em>Zumerling v. Marsh, </em>783 F.2d 1032, 1036 n. 12 (Fed.Cir.1986), to hold that sovereign immunity has been waived only for final judgments of the Federal Circuit affirmed by the Supreme Court. We disagree. In <em>Zumerling, </em>we stated that \"[s]ection 2516(b) is only applicable ... to 'judgments] against the United States affirmed by the Supreme Court after review on petition of the United States.' \" <em>Id. </em>As previously noted, this statement is uncontroversial, and it is not contested by the parties in this appeal. In <em>Zumerling, </em>we did not address whether sovereign immunity has been waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>for judgments that do not fall within the ambit of section 2516(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">.

At oral argument, the Oil Companies did propose that subsection (a) of section 1304 provides an appropriation unlimited by the restrictions of subsection (b) that could be used to satisfy their claim for post-judgment interest. This argument is addressed, and dismissed, in Section III.B.4.iii, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b929-5\">. A distinct dimension of ambiguity sometimes lodged in the word \"may\u201d is the distinction between discretion and duty, or the possibility that \"may\u201d means \"must.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rodgers, </em>461 U.S. 677, 706, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983) (\"The word 'may,' when used in a statute, usually implies some degree of discretion.

The majority concludes that sov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>ereign immunity is not waived based on its finding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) is subject to two plausible readings. In my view, however, there is only <em>one </em>plausible reading of the statutory language at issue. It is the reading that maintains that \u201cinterest shall be allowed on <em>all </em>final judgments against the United States in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, at the rate provided in [\u00a7 1961(a)] and as provided in [\u00a7 1961(b) ].\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The majority errs in reading \u00a7 1961(c)(2) as providing a second \u201cplausible\u201d reading for at least four reasons. First, as the majority notes in its discussion of the appellants\u2019 arguments, \u201call\u201d means \u201call.\u201d There is no language in the statute that limits \u201call\u201d to a specific subset of cases or that creates ambiguity where none exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Second, the majority also attempts to trace a path through \u00a7 1961(b) that would create ambiguity in \u00a7 1961(c)(2). But \u00a7 1961(b) merely discusses <em>how </em>interest is to be calculated \u2014 not whether it is available at all. The \u00a7 1961(b) method of computation is to be used <em>\u201cexcept </em>as provided in section 2516(b) [of title 28] and section 1304(b) of title 31.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(b) (emphasis added). And here, \u201cexcept\u201d means \u201cexcept.\u201d The majority\u2019s second \u201cplausible\u201d reading of the statute effectively requires amending \u201cexcept as provided in\u201d to read \u201csubject to.\u201d It is simply not in our power to amend the text of Congressional statutes in such a way.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Third, the majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1961(c)(2) as having a second \u201cplausible\u201d meaning renders significant portions of the statute superfluous. This violates a central canon of statutory construction. <em>See Freytag v. C.I.R., </em>501 U.S. 868, 877, 111 S.Ct. 2631, 115 L.Ed.2d 764 (1991) (courts should have \u201ca deep reluctance to interpret a statutory provision so as to render superfluous other provisions in the same enactment\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c[i]t is ... not our job to find reasons for what Congress has plainly done; and it <em>is </em>our job to avoid rendering what Congress has plainly done ... devoid of reason and effect.\u201d <em>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, </em>534 U.S. 204, 217-18, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Fourth, and finally, the majority is incorrect when it implies that the literal reading of \u00a7 1961(c)(2) cannot be given effect because it is supported by \u201cnary a word\u201d of legislative history. Clear statutes need not be supported by legislative history in order to be given effect. To deny a clear statute its force based on the absence of legislative history would be an example of the tail wagging the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">The majority also rests its conclusion that there is no sovereign immunity waiver on the alternative ground that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 does not provide an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But it is highly doubtful that a separate statute can trump a clear waiver of sovereign immunity in another statute. In any event, the government has neither raised it as an independent basis for a judgment against the Oil Companies nor argued it before this court. Moreover, there is conflicting case law on whether or not \u00a7 1304 can serve as an additional barrier to recovery of post-judgment interest when it conflicts with another more specific statute. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>case, therefore, \u00a7 1304 by itself does not appear to me sufficient to create ambiguity regarding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. <em>See </em>Part III.B.4 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
