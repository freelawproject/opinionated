The magistrate judge concluded that because Daniels\u2019 conviction had become final on March 23, 2012, his filing fell well outside the one-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed the motion as time-barred. Daniels appealed and we granted a certificate of appealability on a single question: \u201cWhether the district court erred in dismissing as time-barred ... Daniels\u2019[ ] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred. <em>Outler v. United States, </em>485 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2007). Under AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, a federal prisoner must ordinarily \u201cfile his \u00a7 2255 petition within one year of the date on which his judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2003). We apply the prison mailbox rule, under which \u201ca <em>pro se </em>prisoner\u2019s court filing is deemed filed on the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing.\u201d <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (11th Cir.2009). We assume, \u201c[a]bsent evidence to the contrary, ... that a prisoner delivered a fifing to prison authorities on the date that he signed it.\u201d <em>Jeffries v. United States, </em>748 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Daniels\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion is signed and dated September 4, 2013. Absent evidence to the contrary, that is the presumptive fifing date. <em>See id. </em>Because Daniels\u2019 conviction became final in March 2012, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>motion was therefore untimely under AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Daniels contends that we should recognize a different filing date. He argues that his filing was timely under the prison mailbox rule because he originally delivered his \u00a7 2255 motion to prison authorities for mailing on an earlier date. In the district court, he submitted an affidavit that stated in relevant part, \u201cOn March 13, 2013, I placed my motion for relief under \u00a7 2255, in the prison mailbox .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts permits a prisoner to show that his motion was timely by making that type of declaration. Rule 3(d) further provides, however, that the prisoner\u2019s declaration must not only \u201cset forth the date of deposit,\u201d it must <em>\u201cstate that first-class postage has been prepaid.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Daniels\u2019 affidavit sets forth the date of deposit, but it does not state that first-class postage had been prepaid. That omission is fatal to his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Rule 3(d) has only two requirements with respect to the content of the prisoner\u2019s declaration. To demand anything other than strict compliance with those requirements would render them nullities. <em>See United States v. Winkles, </em>795 F.3d 1134, 1146-47 (9th Cir.2015) (stating that to adopt an interpretation of Rule 3(d) that does not require the prisoner to state that postage has been prepaid \u201cwould render this portion of the rule mere surplusage\u201d). As the Seventh Circuit has explained, \u201cthe declaration [is required] to state only two things; 50% is not enough.\u201d <em>United States v. Craig, </em>368 F.3d 738, 740 (7th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Because Daniels did not satisfy the requirements of Rule 3(d), he cannot avail himself of the prison mailbox rule and the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">. Daniels also moves this Court for leave to file his <em>pro se </em>reply brief out of time and to waive the certification of compliance requirement for his reply brief, which we construe as a motion to file excess pages. Those motions are GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">. In <em>Craig, </em>the Seventh Circuit construed Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(c)(1) instead of Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. 368 F.3d at 739-40. However, both rules state the same requirement, using the same language, that the prisoner\u2019s declaration \"must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.\u201d Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing Section 2255; Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1). Because the rules are the same in that regard, we see no reason to construe them differently.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
