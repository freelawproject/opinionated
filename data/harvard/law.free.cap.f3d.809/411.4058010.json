(Harris News) applied for a federal license to sell guns. William Bowers, the Director of Industry Operations for the Kansas City Field Division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), denied the application on the ground that the Harris News officers and co-owners willfully allowed a felon to possess firearms. The district court agreed. Because the ATF did not show the Harris News officers and owners did anything to further the felon\u2019s possession of firearms, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b464-17\">James Harris Sr. sold guns under a federal license at his store, Jim\u2019s Hobbies, in North Platte, Nebraska. James\u2019s wife, Lois Harris, and their two sons, James Harris Jr. and Brian Harris, worked with James Sr. at the store. Brian continued working there after he was convicted of a felony in Nebraska state court in 1992. His work included gunsmithing, which naturally involved handling guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-18\">In 2011, the ATF investigated a tip about Brian working with guns. The investigation eventually resulted in James Sr. pleading guilty to lying to an ATF invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>gator about Brian possessing guns at the store. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). Part of James Sr.\u2019s plea deal was surrendering his firearms license. To \u201ckeep the family business going,\u201d Lois and James Jr. applied for a new license on behalf of Harris News, a corporation in which they are the president and vice president, respectively, and the only shareholders. They hoped to continue operating Jim\u2019s Hobbies, through Harris News, without James Sr.\u2019s or Brian\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">An applicant for a license to sell guns must not have \u201cwillfully violated any of the provisions of [18 U.S.C. ch. 44].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(d)(1)(C). The ATF, after an informal hearing, concluded Harris News willfully violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (part of the covered chapter) and denied the Harris News application. Section 922(g)(1) forbids felons to possess guns. The ATF\u2019s theory was that by working at Jim\u2019s Hobbies and \u201callowing\u201d Brian to work with firearms and ammunition, Lois and James Jr. also had become liable for Brian\u2019s illegal possession under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a), which makes anyone who \u201caids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures\u201d the commission of a federal crime \u201cpunishable as a principal.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Roan Eagle, </em>867 F.2d 436, 445 (8th Cir.1989) (\u201cTo be guilty of aiding and abetting is to be guilty as if one were a principal of the underlying offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Harris News petitioned for \u201cde novo judicial review\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(f)(3). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled for the ATF, concluding \u201csubstantial evidence supports a finding that James Harris, Jr., violated [18 U.S.C. ch. 44] by allowing his brother, a convicted felon, to possess firearms at Jim\u2019s Hobbies\u201d and \u201calso establishes that James, Jr. was plainly indifferent to the unlawfulness of the situation, which is all that is required for a finding of willfulness.\u201d Harris News appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (appellate jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">We review de novo the grant of summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., On Target Sporting Goods, Inc. v. Attorney Gen. of the U.S., </em>472 F.3d 572, 575 (8th Cir.2007). If no material facts are in dispute, summary judgment is proper for the party entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">The crux of the ATF\u2019s decision was that Lois and James Jr. violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) by \u201callowing\u201d Brian to possess guns at work. Yet allowing someone to commit a crime \u2014 in the sense of simply not stopping it-is not the same as committing it. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, </em>195 F.2d 673, 675 (8th Cir.1952) (\u201c[M]ere negative acquiescence is not sufficient [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a) ].\u201d). To the contrary, liability as a principal for aiding and abetting requires \u201csome conduct of an affirmative nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c\u2018[A]iding and abetting\u2019 ... assumes some participation in the criminal act in furtherance of the common design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ATF failed to find any such affirmative conduct. Nothing in the record suggests Lois or James Jr. gave Brian guns, told customers to give him guns, directed him to work with guns, or did anything else to further his possession of guns.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The district court, for its part, recognized \u201c[t]he [ATF] failed to explain how Lois and James, Jr. actually \u2018allowed\u2019 Brian to possess firearms.\u201d Nonetheless, the district court found a \u201csufficient basis for concluding that James, Jr. aided and abetted his brother in the unlawful possession of firearms\u201d in the fact James Jr. was a \u201cmanager\u201d at Jim\u2019s Hobbies. As a manager, the district court reasoned, James Jr. presumably had supervisory authority over gun sales and services. Perhaps, but even that would imply, at most, that James Jr. knew Brian handled guns and could have stopped' him, but did not, which is still no more than negative acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Absent a showing Lois and James Jr. affirmatively helped Brian possess guns illegally, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not make them liable for Brian\u2019s alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore do not reach the question of whether Lois or James Jr. acted willfully. Nor do we consider Harris News\u2019 appeal from the denial of its motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We do reject the proposition \u2014 advanced by the ATF at oral argument and perhaps implicit in its brief and also proposed by the district court\u2019s memorandum \u2014 that Lois and James Jr., willfully violated \u00a7 922(g)(1) as long as they knew Brian was working with guns, knew it was illegal, and exhibited \u201cplain indifference to the unlawfulness going on.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That reasoning ignores the clear requirement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(d)(1)(C) that <em>\u201cthe applicant\u201d </em>\u2014 that is, Harris News, through Lois or James Jr. \u2014 \u201cwillfully violated [\u00a7 922(g)(1) ].\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 923(d)(1)(C) does not target willfulness in the abstract; it requires a specific act be done willfully, namely the violation of a federal gun law by a license applicant. Brian possessing guns, by itself, was not a violation by Lois or James Jr.; thus, Lois and James Jr. supposedly turning blind eyes to Brian\u2019s illegal gun possession cannot alone justify denying the Harris News application.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The ATF had no authority to deny the Harris News license application under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(d)(1)(C). We reverse the entry of summary judgment in favor of the ATF and remand the case to the district court with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of Harris News.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">. At oral argument, the ATF claimed substantial evidence showed James Jr. directed customers to Brian to have gunsmithing work done. In fact, the evidence was that while both James Sr. and Brian were out of the store, James Jr. told an undercover investigator who asked to have a scope mounted on his rifle that \"the guy who would [do the gun-smithing] would be back shortly.\u201d According to the record, that was the extent of James Jr.\u2019s involvement. When James Sr. and Brian returned, James Sr. approached the investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>tor, took his rifle, confirmed he wanted a scope mounted, and gave the rifle to Brian to work on. In context, James Jr.\u2019s telling a purported customer to wait for another, unidentified worker, who obviously could have been James Sr., does not rise to the level of affirmative participation required for aiding- and-abetting liability. <em>See Johnson, </em>195 F.2d at 675 (\"As the term \u2019aiding and abetting\u2019 implies, it assumes some participation in the criminal act in furtherance of the common design.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">. Though Harris News does not raise the issue, we also note the record does not show the guns Brian worked with were in or affecting interstate commerce \u2014 an essential element of a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Hernandez, </em>803 F.3d 994, 996 (8th Cir.2015). If the ATF failed to establish Brian\u2019s possession violated \u00a7 922(g)(1) in the first place, it could not have treated Lois and James Jr. as having broken the law by helping him, even if the ATF had shown some affirmative assistance. <em>Cf. Roan Eagle, </em>867 F.2d at 445.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-13\">. Plain indifference to a known legal obligation constitutes willfulness for purposes of \u00a7 923(d)(1)(C). <em>See On Target Sporting Goods, </em>472 F.3d at 575.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
