We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary for our disposition of this appeal. On May 7, 1998, the plaintiff was at the Meriden police station as a result of having been arrested on a charge of operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff agreed to take a breath test to determine his blood alcohol content. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (c). Officer John Williams, a certified testing officer, administered the test with the arresting officer, Officer Michael Hadvab, acting as a witness. Williams instructed the plaintiff on how to perform the test but, contrary to Williams\u2019 instructions, the plaintiff would blow into the tube of the intoxilyzer only for a second, stop, then blow again. Williams, while holding the tube for the plaintiff, noticed that he was blowing more air into Williams\u2019 hand than into the tube. Despite repeated instructions, the plaintiff continued in his failure to comply with Williams\u2019 instructions. He then complained that he wanted to go to the bathroom and stated that he did not want to take the test anymore.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, he refused to blow into the intoxilyzer again. Hadvab witnessed that refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The police reported the plaintiffs arrest and refusal to participate in the test to the commissioner, who initiated the suspension action against the plaintiff. The plaintiff then requested an administrative hearing before the commissioner. The commissioner, acting through Charles G. Greenwald, his hearing officer, found, inter alia, that \u201cthe operator refused to submit to [a] test or analysis.\u201d Over the plaintiffs objection, the hearing officer admitted state\u2019s exhibit A into evidence. That exhibit consisted of a form A-44<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> together with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>supplemental report from Hadvab and an affidavit by Williams. As a consequence of the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions, the commissioner suspended the plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The plaintiff first complains that the hearing officer should not have admitted the A-44 and its attachments into evidence. The plaintiffs principal claim, as argued in his brief, is that the A-44 and attachments should not have been admitted because only Hadvab, the arresting officer, and Williams, the testing officer, signed the A-44. In his brief, the plaintiff argues that the statute requires that a third person be present to witness his refusal and, in the absence of a third person\u2019s signature, the hearing officer could not properly admit the exhibit into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Any merit that this argument may have had was emasculated by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>54 Conn. App. 62, 733 A.2d 304 (1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Mailhot </em>unequivocally put to rest any claim that more than two officers must be present in a refusal situation for an A-44 to be admitted into evidence. The <em>Mailhot </em>court enunciated: \u201cWe hold that \u00a7 14-227b (c), where there is a refusal to take the test by the party arrested, requires, at a minimum, the presence of three persons, i.e., the person charged, the arresting officer and a third party witness, who may or may not be the same person who took the arresting officer\u2019s oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u201cAccordingly, we conclude that the trial court, in concluding that the hearing officer properly admitted into evidence the A-44 report and that the hearing offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>cer properly suspended the plaintiffs driver\u2019s license, acted reasonably and prudently in accordance with applicable law.\u201d Id., 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Applying <em>Mailhot </em>to the present case, we find that three people were present during the testing\u2014the plaintiff, arresting officer Hadvab and testing officer Williams. Hadvab swore to the A-44 in his capacity as arresting officer, and the plaintiffs refusal was witnessed by him and testing officer Williams, both of whom signed the A-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">At oral argument, the plaintiff attempted to distinguish <em>Mailhot </em>by arguing that Hadvab could not sign the A-44 as both the arresting officer and as a witness to the refusal to take the test, even though Williams signed the A-44 as the testing officer. The plaintiff claims that this means the A-44 is not properly executed. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The court properly affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s admission of state\u2019s exhibit A into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The plaintiff next claims that even if state\u2019s exhibit A was admissible, there was not substantial evidence of a refusal to take the test. Even though the plaintiff agreed to take a breath test, the state argues that his conduct amounted to a refusal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Refusal to take a breath test can be by conduct as well as express verbal refusal. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>60 Conn. App. 830, 832, 761 A.2d 786 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">In <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>44 Conn. App. 702, 714-15, 692 A.2d 834 (1997), this court held that \u201cwhere it is undisputed that the motorist submitted to the chemical alcohol test, the fact that he failed to provide an adequate breath sample does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>automatically constitute refusal within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227b. Such refusal must be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d The gravamen of <em>Bialowas </em>is that, without more, an officer\u2019s conclusory statement that the operator has refused the test does not constitute substantial evidence. In <em>Bialowas, </em>the officer failed to furnish supporting evidence for his conclusion that the plaintiff therein had refused to take the test. Id., 716-17; cf. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 833 (officer provided supporting details).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">As previously stated, the plaintiff in this case failed to comply with the officer\u2019s repeated instructions as to how the test should be performed. The plaintiff improperly blew into the intoxilyzer and subsequently refused to blow into the intoxilyzer again.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Thus, we conclude in this case that the officer furnished supporting details \u201cas contrasted with the naked conclusion of the police officer in <em>Bialowas </em>.... Factual determinations of the commissioner must be upheld if there is substantial evidence in the record to support such a finding. ... An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . Such a standard of review allows less room for judicial scrutiny than does the weight of the evidence rule or the clearly erroneous rule. ... In determining whether an administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, a court must defer to the agency\u2019s right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 833-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u201cWhether the plaintiffs actions constituted a refusal to submit to the test presented a question of fact, and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s review was limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>determining whether the hearing officer\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Id., 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner and must affirm his decision unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 \u00a9. In the present case, the court properly determined that there was substantial evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (c) provides: \u201cIf the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or analysis or submits to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicate that the <em>ratio </em>of alcohol in the blood of such person is ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, the police officer, acting on behalf of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, shall immediately revoke and take possession of the motor vehicle operator\u2019s license or, if such person is anonresident, suspend the nonresident operating privilege of such person, for a twenty-four-hour period and shall issue a temporary operator\u2019s license or nonresident operating privilege to such person valid for the period commencing twenty-four hours after issuance and ending thirty days after the date such person received notice of his arrest by the police officer. The police officer shall prepare a written report of the incident and shall mail the report together with a copy of the completed temporary license form, any operator\u2019s license taken into possession and a copy of the results of any chemical test or analysis to the Department of Motor Vehicles within three business days. The report shall be made on a form approved by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and shall be subscribed and sworn to under penalty of false statement as provided in section 53a-157b by the arresting officer. If the person arrested refused to submit to such test or analysis, the report shall be endorsed by a third person who witnessed such refusal. The report shall set forth the grounds for the officer\u2019s belief that there was probable cause to arrest such person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and shall state that such person had refused to submit to such test or analysis when requested by such police officer to do so or that such person submitted to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> Because the appeal was argued on the basis of a refusal by conduct, we will limit our analysis to that aspect of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (c). We note, however, ihat the plaintiff appears to have verbally refused to take the test. We also note that the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to complete the first test could constitute a refusal to take the second test required by \u00a7 14-227b (k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> Form A-44 is the report of the refusal to take the test.

The brief was filed by the plaintiff on June 3, 1999, and the <em>Mailhot </em>decision was not decided until twenty-six days later on June 29, 1999.
