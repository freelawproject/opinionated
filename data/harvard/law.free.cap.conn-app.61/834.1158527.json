Davis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that (1) the court should have held a hearing on its objection to the report of an attorney trial referee, (2) the plaintiff could not prevail on her claim of an unjust tax and unfair share of the municipal tax burden in the absence of fair market value evidence, (3) the plaintiff could not appeal except in a revaluation year and (4) the court improperly awarded expert testimony costs. We set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>award of appraisal fees and affirm the judgment of the trial court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The parties do not dispute the relevant facts or procedural history. In 1993, the plaintiff and her husband, Martin S. Davis, purchased the property known as 60 Beachside Avenue in Westport. The property contained approximately 2.92 acres and had an assessed land value of $917,840. In 1995, the plaintiff and Martin S. Davis acquired the immediately adjacent property known as 62 Beachside Avenue, containing about three acres. The town assessor determined that the assessed land value of that parcel was $1,309,000. The value assessments represented the fair market values for the land that the assessor had determined for the grand list of October 1,1985, which was when the last revaluation of all real property in Westport occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The Davises then filed an application with the West-port planning and zoning commission (commission) to build a new single family residence comprised of nearly 13,000 square feet that would straddle the boundary line of the two lots. On June 15, 1995, the commission issued a resolution concerning the Davises\u2019 application. The commission conditioned its coastal area management approval of the application on a merger of the two lots. The Davises abided by the condition and merged the two properties into one 5.39 acre lot. They demolished the existing structures on the two lots and constructed one new home. This appeal does not involve the fair market value of the new home, but involves, rather, the 1985 assessment of the consolidated lot. The lot is a premier piece of shorefront property with 1000 feet of frontage on Long Island Sound.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>The assessor combined the properties into one on the grand list of October 1, 1995, and modified the assessment map to depict the plaintiffs property as one lot. For the 1995 tax year, the assessor determined that the new assessed value of the larger, merged lot was $2,226,840. That figure represents the simple addition of the two 1985 assessed values of the separately purchased lots ($917,840 plus $1,309,000). The plaintiff objected to the assessed value and requested that the town board of tax review (board) reduce the assessment. The board denied the request and approved the assessed value. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She claimed that the assessment was grossly excessive, disproportionate and unlawful. At trial, the plaintiff did not claim that the assessor assessed the one lot, which had been two lots, in excess of fair market value. She contended, instead, that the assessor did not use the same methodology that he employed for other single lots on the same street. As permitted by statute, the plaintiff amended her appeal to include the assessments for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 tax years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The court referred the appeal to an attorney trial referee to review the board\u2019s decision and to hold a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>hearing on the law and facts. The referee heard the appeal in November, 1998, and issued a report on April 14,1999. The referee found that the assessor had failed to employ the methodology used and applied to other like properties, and did not, therefore, apply uniform percentages as required by General Statutes \u00a7 12-64.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The referee then determined that the appropriate method for valuing waterfront property in Westport resulted in a fair assessed value of $1,493,030 for the plaintiffs land. Accordingly, the report recommended a refund of taxes paid and attributable to the excess assessment on the property, together with interest at the statutory rate for the four tax years involved, and compensation of $2500 to the plaintiff for the testimony and reports of her expert witnesses. On May 21, 1999, the court, over the defendant\u2019s objection to the report, rendered judgment in accordance with the referee\u2019s report. This appeal followed. We will provide additional facts as they become relevant to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">We must first determine whether the rules of practice granted the defendant a hearing as of right on an objection to the referee\u2019s report before the court could render judgment, for if the defendant was so entitled we must remand the case and forgo a discussion of the remaining issues. The defendant claims that Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 19-16 required the court to give it the opportunity to claim the case to the short calendar for a hearing on the objection to acceptance of the referee\u2019s report. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>The defendant filed an objection to the adoption of the referee\u2019s report on April 27, 1999, and amended that objection on April 28,1999. The plaintiff filed comments on the amended objection on May 5,1999. Neither party ever requested oral argument nor indicated any desire for oral argument on the papers filed with the court. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and rendered judgment on May 21,1999, in accordance with the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 19-16 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f exceptions or objections have been seasonably filed, the case should be claimed for the short calendar' for hearing thereon . . . .\u201d This court recently determined that a correct interpretation of Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 19-16 does not include a hearing as a matter of right. <em>Paulus </em>v. <em>LaSala, </em>56 Conn. App. 139, 145-46, 742 A.2d 379 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 928, 746 A.2d 789 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In arriving at that conclusion, we did not read Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 19-16 in isolation, but in conjunction with Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 11-18, which provides in relevant part: \u201cOral argument is at the discretion of the judicial authority except as to motions to dismiss, motions to strike, motions for summary judgment, and motions for judgment of foreclosure. For those motions, oral argument shall be a matter of right, provided (1) the motion has been marked ready for adjudication . . . and (2) the movant indicates at the bottom of the first page of the motion or on a reclaim slip that oral argument or testimony is desired . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we concluded that \u201ceven if [Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>(1999) \u00a7 19-16] grants . . . oral argument as of right, it is not automatic but must be claimed for argument as provided in [Practice Book (1999) \u00a7 11-18]. . . . Aside from the plain meaning of the words of those sections, which do not grant oral argument as of right . . . judicial economy and practicality require a common sense reading of both sections.\u201d <em>Paulus </em>v. <em>LaSala, </em>supra, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We find that <em>Paulus </em>is dispositive of the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant did not enjoy an automatic right to a hearing and it failed to indicate any desire for one. We conclude, therefore, that the court acted properly and turn to the remaining issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Before considering the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments, we articulate the basic legal principles and standard of review applicable to the remaining issues on appeal. A trial court hears tax appeals pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a de novo and \u201cmust arrive at [its] own conclusions as to the value of [the taxpayer\u2019s property] by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and [its] own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Xerox Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>240 Conn. 192, 204, 690 A.2d 389 (1997). We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of facts unless those findings are clearly erroneous, but we invoke a plenary review of any legal conclusions. We must, therefore, decide whether the conclusions are legally and logically correct, and find support in the record. Mindful of those basic principles, we now consider each of the claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>The defendant claims that the plaintiff could not prevail on her claim of disproportionate, grossly excessive, unlawful or unequal tax treatment without introducing evidence of fair market value at trial. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs failure to establish fair market value prevented the court from determining whether the assessor complied with the mandates of \u00a7 12-64. In support of that claim, the defendant asserts that the cases addressing discriminatory tax treatment arise out of differing, and therefore nonuniform, assessment percentages applied to fair market value, not out of varying assessment methodologies. The plaintiff did not offer evidence of either assessment percentages applied or fair market value. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot, therefore, seek judicial review of the assessment because there is no \u201cauthority to substantiate [her] position that there is some inalienable right to judicial review of an assessment where it can somehow be proven that the town has acted in an unfair or discriminatory way toward one of its taxpayers. . . . This argument is not supported ... by any precedent propounded by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The plaintiff maintains that she need not introduce evidence of fair market value when her claim focuses instead on the discriminatory approach in the assessment method. The plaintiff argues that the absence of a fair market value appraisal did not preclude the referee from concluding that the assessment method was discriminatory and resulted in a disproportionate tax. The plaintiff claims that the assessor should have based the assessment of her property on 1985 fair market values using the same methodology, formula and factors he used in 1985 for similarly situated one lot parcels of land. The plaintiff does not claim any impropriety in the 1985 fair market value.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We first discuss the plaintiffs appeal under \u00a7 12-117a. As previously noted, an aggrieved taxpayer may appeal to the Superior Court. In a \u00a7 12-117a appeal, the court potentially performs two functions. Initially, the court determines whether the board\u2019s action aggrieved the taxpayer. <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Middlefield, </em>143 Conn. 100, 105, 120 A.2d 77 (1956). A taxpayer satisfactorily demonstrates aggrievement where the board\u2019s action will require the payment of an unjust and, therefore, illegal tax. Id. An affirmative finding of aggrievement is an absolute condition precedent to the second function, which involves the court\u2019s broad discretionary power to grant appropriate relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id. In exercising its discretion, the court should correct the valuation. <em>Konover </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>242 Conn. 727, 736, 699 A.2d 158 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The issue of aggrievement involves a two part analysis, which entails both factual determinations and a question of law. Whether a specific action that the assessor takes in his valuation has aggrieved a taxpayer is a question of law. See <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>166 Conn. 43, 55, 347 A.2d 89 (1974); <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Middlefield, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 105; <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Goshen, </em>65 Conn. 456, 459, 32 A. 932 (1895). \u201cWhether a property has been overvalued for tax assessment purposes is a question of fact for the trier.\u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 103, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993). In other words, in the context of this appeal, we review de novo whether the assessor\u2019s method, which continued to treat the plaintiff\u2019s property as two separate parcels after she and her husband merged the lots at the request of the commission, constitutes aggrievement for purposes of \u00a7 12-117a.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>In the present case, the referee found that the plaintiff had established aggrievement by showing that the assessor deviated from the method he had used in all other assessments for properties located on Beachside Avenue and for other waterfront properties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our question becomes whether, as a matter of law, on the basis of facts found by the referee, the plaintiff established that the assessment, which treated her properties as individual lots rather than one merged lot, resulted in an improper tax and, therefore, aggrieved her. We conclude that she was so aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Each party presented the testimony of one witness at the hearing before the referee. David P. Fugitt, a licensed, tenured general appraiser, testified for the plaintiff, and Kenneth C. Carvell, the defendant\u2019s assessor at the time of the disputed assessments, testified for the defendant. The base assessment date involved in both experts\u2019 testimony was October 1, 1985, the date of the last townwide revaluation as of the date of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We note initially that the referee is particularly cloaked with the power to make credibility determinations. \u201c[T]he acceptance or rejection of an opinion of a qualified expert is a matter for the trier of fact unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the opinion is so unreasonable as to be unacceptable to a rational mind.\u201d <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>146 Conn. 578, 586, 153 A.2d 420 (1959). Although the courts should accord an assessor\u2019s testimony substantial deference, no judicial presumption exists as to the validity of that assessor\u2019s conclusions. <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>203 Conn. 586, 589, 525 A.2d 1327 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Fugitt submitted two reports, one that analyzed the defendant\u2019s method of assessing land on Beachside Avenue and one that analyzed the defendant\u2019s method for assessing other waterfront property located in the town. Those reports and Fugitt\u2019s testimony explained the assessor\u2019s methodology. According to Fugitt, the methodology effectively involves a three step procedure: A primary site valuation, a residual acreage valuation and consideration of certain influence factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In 1985, for waterfront property in the town, the assessor assigned a value of $1.1 million to a property\u2019s \u201cprimary site.\u201d A primary site consists of a two acre building site<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with water frontage. The assessor then classified other acreage on the property, typically the acreage in excess of the two acres identified as the primary site,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as \u201cresidual acreage.\u201d Residual acreage was that land that the owner could not use as a building site and that had no potential for development. The assessor valued residual acreage at 10 percent of the value of the primary site, or $110,000 per acre. Finally, the methodology subjected certain property characteristics to an influence factor. Characteristics such as landscaping, flooding, restrictions, location, shape and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>size could, on the basis of those influence factors, increase or reduce the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Fugitt\u2019s reports indicated that the assessor, with some exception,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> employed that method for the relevant tax years. Fugitt attributes any exception to or deviation from that formula to the possibility of subdivision, irrespective of the owner\u2019s intent to subdivide.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the plaintiff cannot now subdivide the subject property due to the large residence that straddles the boundary line and because she agreed to the commission\u2019s requirement to merge the two lots, facts that neither side disputes, Fugitt determined that the assessment should not include any additional primary site value.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Carvell, on the other hand, offered a different explanation of the assessment methodology. Carvell insisted that when valuing property in Westport, the possibility of subdivision was not a factor. The relevant factor was the pricing of waterfront acreage. Carvell testified that he assigned the other properties on Beachside Avenue that contained two acres of waterfront and <em>fewer than four acres overall </em>only one primary site value of $1.1 million and that he valued the remaining acres as residual. Carvell testified further that he assessed properties containing <em>more than four acres </em>differently. Those properties received a $1.1 million value for any two acres of waterfront, a $300,000 value for any two acres of nonwaterfront and a $110,000 value for each additional acre as residual acreage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Pursuant to that formula, Carvell testified that he treated 1.39 acres of the plaintiffs 5.39 acre lot as residual acreage and the other four acres as two primary waterfront sites. The plaintiffs property had two two acre waterfront areas, and he assigned each of those two acre areas a $1.1 million value. The remaining acreage, residual acreage, was valued at $110,000 per acre.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>The referee found that the assessor utilized the methodology explained by Fugitt for property on Beachside Avenue, namely the methodology that considered the possibility of subdivision rather than waterfront acres. Furthermore, the referee\u2019s reduction of the assessment impliedly recognizes that she credited Fugitt\u2019s testimony as to the town\u2019s method and credited his analysis of the appropriate valuation of the subject property rather than Carvell\u2019s assessment scheme. As we previously discussed, that credibility determination must stand unless it is unreasonable. <em>Hutensky </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>163 Conn. 433, 438, 311 A.2d 92 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">\u201cThe claim that the property had been <em>wrongfully </em>or <em>excessively </em>assessed could have been appealed in one of two ways: (1) to the board of tax review [under section 12-111] and from there, within two months, to the Superior Court pursuant to [\u00a7] 12-111 ... or (2) by direct action to the court . . . pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 12-119.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Farmington </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>26 Conn. App. 545, 550, 602 A.2d 1047 (1992), appeal dismissed, 224 Conn. 592, 619 A.2d 852 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">A distinction exists between an excessive assessment and a wrongful assessment. The plaintiff did not maintain at trial that the assessment was excessive. Indeed, she withdrew the counts relating to fair market value and requested permission to amend the other counts to add the claim of unequal treatment. At the trial\u2019s outset, plaintiffs counsel noted that \u201cwe agree that our approach is essentially in regard to the unequal treatment.\u201d The referee also recognized that approach and stated that \u201c[t]he theory upon which the plaintiff is proceeding is based on unequal treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">\u201c [V] aiuation of property in excess of fair market value is not the only ground upon which a taxpayer may be entitled to relief. . . Any circumstances indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>a disproportionate share of the tax burden is being thrust upon a taxpayer would warrant judicial intervention.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Chamber of Commerce of Greater Waterbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>184 Conn. 333, 336, 439 A.2d 1047 (1981). We conclude that the assessor\u2019s method resulted in unfair treatment and a wrongful assessment, and, therefore, aggrieved the plaintiff. Once the plaintiff established aggrievement, the court was entitled to exercise broad discretion to correct the assessment. We cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in adopting the referee\u2019s finding that the assessor had improperly failed to apply to the plaintiffs property the methodology used and applied in 1985 to other like properties on Beachside Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">We now briefly address the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff needed to introduce evidence of fair market value to prevail. Had the plaintiff proceeded strictly under \u00a7 12-64, we would find the defendant\u2019s argument more persuasive. In light of our discussion in part IIA of this opinion, however, because the board\u2019s action aggrieved the plaintiff, she was able to proceed under \u00a7 12-117a. The defendant accurately notes that the present case is not the usual tax appeal. Appeals from assessments typically attack the assessor\u2019s fair market value determination. In those cases, a taxpayer claiming aggrievement must establish the inaccuracy of the assessor\u2019s fair market value figure and simultaneously establish the accuracy of her different figure. <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>166 Conn. 232, 234, 348 A.2d 641 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In the present case, however, the plaintiff has not argued that the assessor assessed the property in excess of its fair market value. The plaintiff attacks the method used by the assessor in calculating the current assessed value of the larger, merged lot, claiming a wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>assessment due to the assessor\u2019s unequal treatment of her lot. For that reason, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that fair market value was an integral element of the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The defendant also asseits that the plaintiff sought an interim revaluation during a nonrevaluation year, which the law forbids. We disagree that the plaintiffs action constitutes a prohibited interim assessment adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The defendant argues that the law limits interim revaluations in assessed value of real estate to specific extraordinary instances, none of which the facts of this case present. According to the defendant, the plaintiff seeks to reduce the land only assessment because the house that now straddles the boundary line has made subdivision impossible. The defendant maintains that no statutory authority exists to compel the tax assessor to conduct an interim revaluation on the basis of subdivision infeasibility, particularly when the plaintiff herself created the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The plaintiff claims that she has neither requested nor demanded that the assessor conduct an interim revaluation of the subject property and does not claim that fair market value has either increased or decreased. The plaintiff argues, therefore, that the cases and statutes concerning interim revaluations do not apply to the facts of this case. She asserts, instead, that the law allowing an assessment <em>challenge </em>to correct an existing and wrongful valuation, rather than the law forbidding a revaluation because of changed market conditions, should apply. Moreover, the plaintiff does not claim that the assessment is manifestly excessive under \u00a7 12-119, but challenges, pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, the assessor\u2019s valuation on the basis of the method he used. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>Pauker v. Roig, </em>232 Conn. 335, 338, 654 A.2d 1233 (1995). We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-64a<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> compels an interim revaluation under the limited circumstance of damage to the property requiring either complete demolition or total reconstruction. The legislature has not provided any other statutory exception, and the Supreme Court has declined to recognize nonstatutory exceptions. <em>DeSena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>249 Conn. 63, 82, 731 A.2d 733 (1999). Prior to the <em>DeSena </em>decision, certain dictum in <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of TaX Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 525 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>A.2d 91 (1987), had opened the door to the possibility that a taxpayer could compel an interim revaluation on the basis of special circumstances, such as \u201cdestruction or expansion of property, a substantial change in its use or zoning classification, or a decision by the taxpayer to go out of business . . . .\u201d Id., 436. The defendant correctly notes, however, that our Supreme Court firmly shut the door on that argument and unequivocally declined the invitation to recognize the <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>dictum as a judicial exception to the rule that only the limited circumstances provided for by statute compel assessors to conduct interim revaluations. <em>DeSena </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In <em>DeSena, </em>the plaintiff requested an interim revaluation because he had ceased operation of a nursing home on the property, the property\u2019s value had substantially declined and the assessment was greatly excessive, disproportionate and unlawful. Id., 71. The plaintiff in <em>DeSena </em>argued that a change in the use of the property, specifically contemplated by the <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>court, entitled him to an interim revaluation. Id., 73. The court rejected the argument and held that \u00a7 12-64a prescribed the unique circumstance that would require an interim revaluation. Id., 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Although the law prohibits a taxpayer from demanding that the assessor conduct an interim revaluation, the law allows a taxpayer to challenge an illegal assessment. <em>Jupiter Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>242 Conn. 363, 373, 698 A.2d 312 (1997). In <em>Jupiter Realty Co., </em>as part of the decennial revaluation,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the assessor valued the plaintiffs property during 1991. The plaintiff did not appeal from that assessment. In 1992, the assessor determined the assessed value of the plaintiffs property on the basis of the 1991 decennial revalua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>tion. The plaintiff challenged that assessment in 1992, which the board refused to reduce. Our Supreme Court reversed the board\u2019s decision and held that boards of tax review were not insulated from appeals from overvaluation during interim years. Id., 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The <em>Jupiter Realty Co. </em>court drew an \u201cidentifiable and justifiable\u201d distinction between \u201crequesting a revaluation because the original revaluation was in error and requesting a revaluation because circumstances subsequent to the initial revaluation have effected a change in the present true and actual value of the property . . . .\u201d Id., 373. The law forbids the latter because it essentially challenges the \u201clegislatively chosen ten year revaluation time period.\u201d Id. A change in today\u2019s market conditions, resulting in a different \u201cpresent\u201d true and actual value of the property, is an insufficient basis to compel revaluation. The former, however, constitutes \u201ca challenge to the decennial revaluation in a subsequent year [seeking] only to correct an already existing revaluation. It is a challenge to the manner of taxation; <em>[Uniroyal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>182 Conn. 619, 629, 438 A.2d 782 (1981)] .... We find no support for denying taxpayers the right to have their decennial revaluation reflect the property\u2019s true value at the time of the decennial revaluation in our case law concerning interim valuations. While the ultimate relief of interim revaluations and challenges to decennial revaluations might be similar\u2014a lowering of present and future assessment values\u2014the grounds for relief are quite distinct.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Jupiter Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 373-74.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>In the present case, the plaintiff does not claim any intervening change in fair market value since the 1985 valuation year. Although the merger of two lots into one lot is a change, it does not constitute a change in value as discussed in <em>DeSena. </em>Here, the assessor used 1985 data to establish the plaintiffs assessment, but did not use the same 1985 methodology he used to assess other similar property. Once the plaintiff merged the two lots into one lot, they ceased to have any independent legal existence. We hold that the plaintiff is entitled to the assessment she would have had in 1985 if the property had then been only one lot and the assessor had used the same method he used for other assessments of similar property, and that the referee\u2019s determination of an assessment figure was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim asserts that the court improperly awarded appraisal fees in the amount of $2500. We agree and set aside that part of the court\u2019s decision to award fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">In the present case, the referee\u2019s report \u201crecommends that the plaintiff receive compensation for the testimony of [Fugitt] and for preparation of [Fugitt\u2019s] reports totaling $2500.\u201d The referee arrived at that figure on the basis of two exhibits that the plaintiff introduced at trial. One exhibit, dated March 31, 1998, was Fugitt\u2019s bill in the amount of $1100 \u201cfor professional services, including preparation of report and court appearance to date.\u201d The other exhibit, dated August 12, 1998, was Fugitt\u2019s bill in the amount of $1400 for \u201cresearch and producing report (including meetings to date).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The defendant accurately points us to <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 674 A.2d 845 (1996), which held that appraisal fees constitute a nonreimbursable cost. The law expects parties to bear their own litigation expenses, except where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>legislature has dictated otherwise by way of statute. <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 217, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982). \u201cCosts are the creature of statute . . . and unless the statute clearly provides for them courts cannot tax them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Our Supreme Court determined that no existing statute authorized appraisal fee costs. <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. v. New London, </em>supra, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The plaintiff concedes that the court improperly awarded fees for the report, but contends that she is entitled to $1000 for Fugitt\u2019s testimony. The plaintiff argues in her brief that \u201c [i]t is submitted that the sum of $1000 be allowed as a cost order for Mr. Fugitt\u2019s testimony, based on his statement that his charges, in addition to those set forth on exhibits C and D, which totaled $2500, amounted to $1000.\u201d We disagree that Fugitt\u2019s statement at trial indicated that his fee for appearing in court was $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We recognize that General Statutes \u00a7 52-260 (f)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> permits costs for a real estate appraiser\u2019s testimony. The record in the present case does not contain, however, any indication as to Fugitt\u2019s costs for his court appearance. The $1400 bill for preparation of the report constitutes a litigation expense that <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>requires that the plaintiff bear. Fugitt prepared another bill for $1100 for his services \u201cto date\u201d seven months before he appeared at the November, 1998 trial. That bill also represents a nonreimbursable fee because his November, 1998 court appearance cannot be a service \u201cto date\u201d in March, 1998. The plaintiff refers us to the following portion of the transcript as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>support for her argument that she is entitled to $1000 for Fugitt\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">\u201cQ. And Mr. Fugitt, those bills [dated March 31,1998, and August 12, 1998] do not include subsequent services. Have you estimated what additional charges you\u2019re going to make for <em>the work you\u2019ve done since then, including your testimony </em>today?</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">\u201cA. Yes, it will be approximately $1000.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">A careful reading reveals that Fugitt did not state that his fee for appearing that day at trial would amount to $1000. The reference to $1000 included subsequent work <em>and </em>his testimony. We have no way of ascertaining the amount Fugitt charged only for his testimony. Because the statute explicitly limits reimbursement to testimony fees and there was no evidence at trial to establish that amount, we set aside that portion of the court\u2019s judgment awarding expert witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award of appraisal fees and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that award. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\"> The other defendant in this action is the board of ta.x review of the town of Westport.

Davis, was originally a party to this action. He quitclaimed to her, however, all of his interest in the jointly held real property at issue. Luella W.

We therefore refer in this opinion to her as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> Evidence at trial established that the Davises purchased the land and existing buildings for a total of $8.6 million. That figure, far in excess of the assessed value advanced by either the plaintiff or the defendant, is not relevant for purposes of resolving this appeal. As previously noted, the only figures relevant to this tax appeal are those relating to 1985 assessments. The pinchase price of the property has no bearing on a challenge to a 1985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>valuation.

Those lots were 66, 76, 86 and 106 Beachside Avenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b869-6\"> See footnote 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\"> Fugitt examined the assessments for properties that included more than one $1.1 million value to explain his subdivision theory. As discussed in footnote 14, those properties were located at 66, 76, 86 and 106 Beachside Avenue. Fugitt explained the assessments in terms of the owner\u2019s ability to subdivide the lot. For example, 66 Beachside Avenue contains 7.13 acres. According to Fugitt, given the placement of the dwelling, the owner could subdivide that lot into two two acre waterfront parcels and one two acre nonwateifront lot. Accordingly, he proffered, for 66 Beachside Avenue the assessor valued the two acre parcels on Long Island Sound at $1.1 million each and the other two acre lot away from Long Island Sound at $300,000. The assessor considered any remaining acreage, Fugitt explained, as residual acreage. Fugitt testified similarly in explaining the assessment value for 76, 86 and 106 Beachside Avenue, except (hat none of those parcels contained a second two acre waterfront area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> The defendant claims that the referee\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs property was subject to disproportionate taxation cannot stand, as it was based on the referee\u2019s erroneous finding that the assessor used the same methodology for all waterfront properties on Beachside Avenue. The referee found Fugitt\u2019s testimony credible as to the assessor\u2019s methodology for Beachside Avenue property and as to the deviation from that formula only where there was a possibility of subdivision. Because the plaintiff can no longer subdivide her property, the referee concluded that the assessor should have used (he same basic formula to assess the plaintiffs property that he had used to assess other properties on Beachside Avenue that could not be subdivided. In light of our determination that the referee\u2019s decision to credit Fugitt\u2019s testimony regarding the methodology was not unreasonable, we conclude that the referee\u2019s finding that the assessor used the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>methodology to assess all properties on Beachside Avenue, except for those properties that could be subdivided, was not improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\"> Carvell examined the assessments of those properties that exceeded four acres to explain his waterfront acreage theory. For example, 66 Beachside Avenue contains 7.13 total acres. It has four waterfront acres, two nonwaterfront acres and 1.13 residual acres. He assigned the four waterfront acres two $1.1 million values (one for each two acre area), the two nonwaterfront acres a $300,000 value and the 1.13 acres a value of $110,000 per acre. He explained the other properties in excess of four acres, namely, 76, 86, 106 and 60 Beachside Avenue (the plaintiffs property), similarly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\"> An examination of Carvell\u2019s testimony as a whole casts doubt on whether Carvell actually used the formula in reassessing the plaintiffs merged lot.
