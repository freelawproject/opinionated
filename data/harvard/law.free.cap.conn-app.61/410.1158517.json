Since the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court resolved the issue of retroactivity in <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 741 A.2d 902 (1999). In <em>Parra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the three year statute of limitations applied not only to defendants who pleaded guilty after the effective date of the amendment, but also retroactively to all defendants who claimed that they were not canvassed on the deportation consequences of their plea in accordance with \u00a7 54-lj. See id., 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The decision of the trial court allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
