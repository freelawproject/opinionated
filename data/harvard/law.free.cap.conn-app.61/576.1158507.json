Valin-ski. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000). The remaining claims pertain to the defendant\u2019s conviction under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-215 (c) and are (1) whether the state\u2019s evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>whether the prosecutor\u2019s representation to the jury that she would call a particular witness, but whom she did not call, deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial, (3) whether the trial court failed to instruct the jury properly regarding the effect of the defendant\u2019s stipulation that he previously had been convicted of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) and (4) whether the sequence of the court\u2019s instructions improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 131 n.19. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The relevant facts, as the jury reasonably could have found them, were set out in this court\u2019s first opinion in this matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>53 Conn. App. 23, 731 A.2d 311 (1999), rev\u2019d, 254 Conn. 107, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000). \u201cThe parties stipulated that on December 15, 1994, the defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor or drugs in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). As a result of the conviction, the department of motor vehicles (department) suspended the defendant\u2019s operating privileges on January 13, 1995. On January 14, 1995, the department issued a work permit to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\u201cOn Saturday, May 13, 1995, State Trooper Kevin Albanese stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle on Route 44 in Canaan after twice observing it swerve in and out of the oncoming lane and nearly strike a guardrail post after it drifted over the white shoulder line. While waiting for the defendant\u2019s license and registration, Albanese asked the defendant where he had been. The defendant replied that he was returning from a fishing trip with his dog. After Albanese reviewed the [special or] work permit that the defendant handed him and noticed the restrictions on the permit, he again inquired of the defendant where he had been. This time, the defendant replied that he was returning from a fishing trip with several business associates, but, when asked, was unable to supply their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cAfter receiving the defendant\u2019s information, Albanese contacted Troop B in North Canaan and confirmed that the defendant\u2019s right to operate a motor vehicle was under suspension. Albanese detected a strong odor of alcohol and noticed that the defendant\u2019s eyes were red and glassy. On the basis of the defendant\u2019s erratic driving, the strong odor of alcohol and the appearance of the defendant\u2019s eyes, Albanese believed that the defendant was operating while under the influence of alcohol. After administering three field sobriety tests, Albanese confirmed his belief. Thereafter, Albanese arrested the defendant and transported him to Troop B, where the defendant refused to submit to any further testing.\u201d Id., 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The following procedural history is also relevant to this appeal. \u201cFollowing a jury trial, a verdict of guilty was returned on the three noninfraction counts: two counts of operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. On the charge of failure to drive on the right,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court made a finding of guilty. . . . Thereafter, on June 25, 1997, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>motion to set aside the verdict on one count of operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension [in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-215 (a)] and denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal on the remaining charges and for new trial.\u201d Id., 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of operating a motor vehicle when his operator\u2019s license was under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c). Specifically, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt because he was operating his motor vehicle within the scope of a work permit; see General Statutes \u00a7 14-37a;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which he alleged as an affirmative defense to the charge of operating under suspension. The defendant claims that he proved his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we impose a two part analysis. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. . . . Second, we determine whether, from that evidence and all reasonable inferences that it yields, a trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . In this process of review, the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scales, </em>38 Conn. App. 225, 228, 660 A.2d 860 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\u201cIn determining whether the defendant is guilty, [i]t is the sole right of the . . . trier of the facts to draw all reasonable and logical inferences from the facts as it finds them to exist. ... It is also the absolute right and responsibility of the [trier] to weigh conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Furthermore, in considering the evidence introduced in a case, [triers of fact] are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor axe they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>38 Conn. App. 481, 488-89, 662 A.2d 799 (1995) [cert. denied, 237 Conn. 902, 674 A.2d 1333 (1996)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>42 Conn. App. 507, 512, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 398 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defendant stipulated that his license to operate a motor vehicle was under suspension on May 13,1995, the date in question. He argues that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that he was validly operating his motor vehicle pursuant to the work permit issued to him by the department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The state does not dispute that at the time of his arrest, the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>a valid work permit. The jury had to determine whether the defendant was operating his motor vehicle for purposes related to his employment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, thus, within the scope of the work permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The jury heard testimony from Terry Zietler, a driver improvement analyst with the department, who testified that a work permit allows an individual to operate a motor vehicle for employment purposes while the individual\u2019s license is under suspension. The defendant called Donald Bradley, a department legal adviser, as an expert witness. Bradley testified that a work permit is a term \u201cthat the department uses to indicate that the right to operate a motor vehicle is restricted in some way\u201d and described the scope of activities permitted under a work permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Albanese testified that he stopped the defendant at 4 p.m. on Saturday, May 13, 1995, after observing the defendant\u2019s vehicle cross over the midline and shoulder line of the highway. He detected an odor of alcohol about the defendant. In response to a question from Albanese, the defendant replied that he had been fishing with his dog. After reviewing the defendant\u2019s work permit, Albanese again asked the defendant where he had been. This time the defendant .responded that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>been fishing with some business associates, but he was unable to identify any of them. During trial, the defendant called one of his business associates as a witness. The business associate testified that he had been fishing with the defendant on the date in question. The state, however, impeached the business associate\u2019s testimony with a prior inconsistent statement concerning the month in which he went fishing with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The jury was called on to determine the credibility of the witnesses, which is a jury\u2019s primary function. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant had gone fishing with his dog on May 13,1995. The jury also reasonably could have concluded that fishing was not related to the defendant\u2019s employment and that the defendant was operating his motor vehicle outside the scope of his work permit. The defendant, therefore, did not prove his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that he was deprived of a fair trial pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut as a result of prosecutorial misconduct. He claims specifically that a prosecutor\u2019s \u201cknowing use of misleading testimony may violate due process.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the jury that a certain witness would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>called to testify, but who was not in fact called, was false and a misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">During trial, at the direction of the court, the prosecutor informed the jury that the state might call another witness and identified the individual by name to determine whether the individual was known to the jury. The state, however, did not call the individual to testify. The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement when it was made or when the state rested its case. He now claims that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was misleading because it gave the jury the impression that the state had more information against the defendant than it presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\u201c[T]his court will not review claims that were not properly preserved in the trial court. ... A defendant may prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial, however, if the defendant satisfies the four part standard set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>50 Conn. App. 338, 346-47, 718 A.2d 470 (1998), cert. denied, 248 Conn. 915, 734 A.2d 568 (1999). In this case, the defendant did not request that we review this unpreserved claim under <em>Golding. </em>\u201c \u2018In the absence of such a request, we have, in the past, declined to review a defendant\u2019s claim under similar circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id., 347. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s claim is devoid of legal analysis and is nothing more than a mere assertion of a violation of his right to due process. \u201cAnalysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Twin Tool Mfg. Co., </em>40 Conn. App. 36, 45, 668 A.2d 1346 (1996). We therefore decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding the effect of the stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>lation that he previously had been convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). The defendant\u2019s argument is that because the state charged him with violating both subsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 14-215 and the court failed to instruct the jury as to which of the violations the stipulation pertained, the jury was confused and had no choice but to find the defendant guilty of both charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant claims that he was prejudiced because \u00a7 14-215 (c) carries a mandatory sentence and \u00a7 14-215 (a) does not. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Although the defendant did not object at trial to the court\u2019s instruction, he seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We conclude that although his claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim involves a fundamental right to due process; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>50 Conn. App. 159, 170, 718 A.2d 437 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>33 Conn. App. 763, 769, 638 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 913, 642 A.2d 1209 (1994); the claim nevertheless fails because no constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant may prevail on an unpreserved constitutional claim of instructional error only if, considering the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pearsall, </em>44 Conn. App. 62, 68, 687 A.2d 1301, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 910, 689 A.2d 473 (1997). In making that determination, the jury charge \u201cis not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of defendant\u2019s claim. During trial, the state introduced into evidence, without objection by the defendant, a written stipulation that he previously had been convicted of violating \u00a7 14-227a (a). The stipulation correctly stated that \u201c[t]his predicate conviction is an element of the offense of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).\u201d In its instructions, the court told the jury that the defendant had been charged with violations of \u00a7 14-215 (a) and (c). The court stated: \u201cNow, in one of those counts there is a claim that the defendant was operating under suspension when his license was suspended for a conviction of a violation of [ \u00a7 14-227a]. There is a stipulation for you to consider on that that is marked as court exhibit 1, and it relates directly to those facts, those elements.\u201d Thereafter, the jury found the defendant guilty of violating both subsections (a) and (c) of \u00a7 14-215. Subsequently, the court granted the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>motion to set aside the verdict on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under suspension in violation of \u00a7 14-215 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Although the defendant claims that the jury was confused by the court\u2019s failure to state whether the stipulation pertained to subsection (a) or (c), the court\u2019s instruction clearly informed the jury that \u201cone of those counts\u201d involved the suspension of the defendant\u2019s license because of a conviction of \u00a7 14-227a. The stipulation itself, which was before the jury as court exhibit 1, clearly stated that the \u201cpredicate conviction is an element of the offense of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).\u201d Thus, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the jury was confused as to which count the stipulation applied. Furthermore, there is no claim that the stipulation did not apply to subsection (c), the charge of which the defendant was convicted. Even if the jury incorrectly applied the stipulation to subsection (a), the court\u2019s setting aside of the verdict on that count eliminated any prejudice to the defendant. Reading the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court properly instructed the jury, and there is no reasonable possibility that it was misled. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 170. Therefore, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding </em>that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial, nor does it give rise to plain error because the instructions did not affect the fairness or integrity of the proceedings or result in a manifest injustice to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>53 Conn. App. 606, 612, 733 A.2d 273 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the sequence of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof in violation of his state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant claims that the court instructed the jury that the defendant had to prove his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence immediately after charging on operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, rather than giving the instruction after the charge on operating a motor vehicle while his license was under suspension. The defendant concedes that he did not preserve this claim at trial, but maintains that we should review it pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), <em>State v. Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (plain error). The defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim involves a fundamental right to due process. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 170; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 769. We are not persuaded, however, that a constitutional violation clearly exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary for the resolution of this claim. In its charge, the court instructed the jury on the law govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ing the case and on how to apply it during deliberations. The court first instructed the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court then instructed the jury on the specific charges against the defendant. After it instructed the jury on the charge of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the court charged the jury on direct and circumstantial evidence. The court charged that the jury could rely on either or both types of evidence if the cumulative effect of the evidence on which the jury relied was that the state had proved the elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Immediately thereafter, the court instructed the jury on the effect of the defendant\u2019s work permit and his burden of having to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was operating a motor vehicle within the scope of his work permit. Later in its charge, the court repeated the instruction to the jury that \u201cthe state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating the motor vehicle\u201d and that it is the state\u2019s obligation \u201cto prove all of the elements charged against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">As we stated concerning the defendant\u2019s third claim, under <em>Golding, </em>\u201ca defendant may prevail on an unpre-served constitutional claim of instructional error only if, considering the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether the jury was misled, [i]t is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . Furthermore, [aj jury instruction is constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pearsall, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">We must determine, therefore, whether the court\u2019s instructions were improper in view of the entire charge. The defendant claims that the sequence of the court\u2019s charge improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. The defendant claims that the court presented the defendant\u2019s burden of proof on his affirmative defense of operating within the scope of his work permit immediately after giving an instruction on the charge of operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Our review of the transcript, however, reveals that after it gave the instruction on operating under the influence, the court charged the jury on direct and circumstantial evidence, and that the state must prove the elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Only then did the court instruct the jury on the effect of having a work permit and that the defendant\u2019s burden of proof was by a preponderance of the evidence. Subsequently, the court again instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving the charges against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On the basis of our review of the entire charge, we conclude that the court properly instructed the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof for every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt and on the defendant\u2019s burden of proving that he was operating within the scope of a work permit by a preponderance of the evidence. It was not reasonably possible that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>court\u2019s charge misled the jury as to the scope of the state\u2019s burden of proof. Accordingly, the record in this case does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> In the first part of a two part substitute information, the state charged the defendant with, inter alia, one count each of violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-215 (a) and (c), which provide: \u201c(a) No person to whom an operator\u2019s license has been refused, or whose operator\u2019s license or right to operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended or revoked, shall operate any motor vehicle during the period of such refusal, suspension or revocation.

In a letter dated January 9, 1995, the defendant requested an extension of the 1994 work permit. Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s work permit was extended until January 14, 1996. In the permit application, and again in his letter dated January 9, 1995, the defendant indicated that he needed the permit only to drive to meet with clients and to shoot, record and edit radio and television commercials.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 53 Conn.

When they are leaving the bar at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, that is pretty clearly outside the scope in most cases. Anything else is gray . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> We note that the defendant refers to the statement that the prosecutor made to the jury as \u201ctestimony.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statement, however, was not testimony. It is well settled that statements made by counsel are not evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 404, 631 A.2d 238 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> The stipulation clearly stated, however, that the conviction for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor was an element of \u00a7 14-215 (c). The stipulation was before the jury as court exhibit 1 and stated: \u201cThe State and the defendant do hereby stipulate to the fact that on December 15, 1994, in the Bristol Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of Operation under the Influence of Alcohol, in violation of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 14r-227a (a). <em>This predicate conviction is an element of the offense of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (c).\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> \u201c[W]e hold that a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold</em>ing., supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> The defendant invokes his due process rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. We note that the defendant, however, \u201cdoes not claim . . . that he is entitled to any greater protection under the due process clause of the state constitution than he is under the analogous provision of the federal constitution. For purposes of this appeal, therefore, we Ireat the state and federal due process clauses as embodying the same level of protection.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 237 n.11, 710 A.2d 732 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The defendant also claims that the instructions violated his right to a jury trial by an impartial jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 19, of the constitution of Connecticut. Because the defendant has failed to brief how the instructions violated his right to ajuiy trial or to an impartial jury, we decline to review the claim and deem it abandoned. <em>See Nazarko v. Conservation Commission, </em>50 Conn.

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201c[T]his court will reverse a judgment for plain error only in the truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>49 Conn.

We decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim under the plain error doctrine because we have concluded that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury did not affect the fairness or integrity of the proceedings or result in a manifest injustice to the defendant.
