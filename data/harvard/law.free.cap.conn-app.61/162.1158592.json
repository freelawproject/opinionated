On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly determined that certain moneys transferred from his mother to him and the plaintiff, Jessica Fitzgerald, constituted a gift and not a loan. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the only reference to those moneys is the following legal conclusion: \u201cThe court finds that as far as the plaintiff wife is concerned, the funds contributed by the defendant\u2019s mother for the purchase of the parties\u2019 marital home was a gift. To hold otherwise would compel a finding of fraud by the parties to induce the bank to grant the mortgage. If the defendant wishes to consider the gift from his mother as a loan, it shall be his obligation to repay it and hold harmless the plaintiff from any liability.\u201d The defendant did not seek an articulation of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u201cUnder these circumstances, [w]e . . . are left to surmise or speculate as to the existence of a factual predicate for the trial court\u2019s rulings. Our role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Conn. App. 605, 608-609, 710 A.2d 190 (1998). It is a well established principle of appellate procedure that the appellant has the duty of providing this court with a record adequate to afford review. Practice Book \u00a7 61-10; <em>Lombardi </em>v. Lombardi, 55 Conn. App. 117, 118, 737 A.2d 988 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 943, 747 A.2d 520 (2000). \u201cWhere the factual or legal basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling is unclear, the appellant should seek articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 [66-5].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>36 Conn. App. 803, 804, 653 A.2d 833, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 235 Conn. 659, 668 A.2d 710 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen the decision of the trial court does not make the factual predicates of its findings clear, we will, in the absence of a motion for articulation, assume that the trial court acted properly. \u201d <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>DeLuca, </em>37 Conn. App. 586, 588, 657 A.2d 690 (1995). We conclude that the record is inadequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim. Moreover, we assume the court acted properly in the absence of a motion for articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
