The respondent further claims that her federal and state constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>rights were violated because (1) the department\u2019s efforts at reunification were not reasonable and were especially inadequate considering that the respondent was a dependent child herself, (2) the court improperly concluded that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship prior to finding that the respondent was an unfit parent and (3) counsel for the respondent rendered ineffective assistance. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The court found the following facts. J., a twenty-six year old man, impregnated the respondent when she was twelve. At the time, the respondent, a former foster child, lived in Danbury with her maternal grandmother and two of her grandmother\u2019s adult children. M was bom on September 4, 1995, when the respondent was thirteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The respondent initially feared the department due to her own mother\u2019s experience in having children removed from her care, but she reluctantly agreed to accept assistance from the intensive family preservation service. The respondent nonetheless made poor caretaking choices for her child. A social worker who repeatedly visited the respondent\u2019s home for three months following the child\u2019s birth found that the child was not there, that the respondent did not know the name of the child\u2019s baby-sitter, that the child remained in the baby-sitter\u2019s care for several days at a time or that neither the respondent nor the child was at home and their whereabouts were unknown. In December, 1995, the respondent told the social worker that she was overwhelmed with caring for her child and wished to have the child cared for by a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On January 11, 1996, the commissioner of children and families (commissioner) filed a neglect petition on behalf of the child. Later that month, a social worker visited a home in New Milford where the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>had placed her child three weeks earlier. After the police arrested an adult male occupant of the New Milford home for a drug-related offense, the child was removed from the home and a ninety-six hour hold was invoked. On March 1, 1996, the court issued an order of temporary custody, finding that the child was in immediate physical danger from her surroundings and that removal was necessary to ensure her safety. The child was then placed in the care of a foster family, where she has been living ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">During the ensuing year, David Mantell, a psychologist, conducted a court-ordered evaluation of the respondent and recommended mental health care, a psychiatric evaluation for assessment of depression and medication, and an intensive program of individual psychotherapy. Because the respondent did not follow Mantell\u2019s recommendations and made little progress toward reunification, the department took additional steps. On April 10, 1997, the respondent entered into a service agreement with her grandmother and the department that outlined the parties\u2019 various responsibilities \u201cin creating conditions that would allow [the respondent] to be considered as a permanent caretaker for [the child] . . . .\u201d The respondent agreed to visit her daughter, to participate in psychotherapy and to show improvement in her \u201cjudgment, relationships with men, self-esteem and parenting issues.\u201d She also agreed to participate in a psychiatric evaluation and to inform the department if any of the anticipated service providers were unavailable so that the department could offer alternative resources. In addition, the respondent agreed to review her progress in six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The respondent did not live up to her obligations. She refused to complete a psychiatric evaluation and to participate in psychotherapy. On March 18, 1998, the court adjudicated the child neglected, following the respondent\u2019s nolo contendere plea, and committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>child to the care and custody of the commissioner for a period not to exceed twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">On March 18, 1998, the respondent, her attorney, her court-appointed guardian ad litem and the child\u2019s attorney agreed to court-ordered expectations whereby the respondent was required, inter alia, (1) to keep all appointments set by or with the department, (2) to make her whereabouts known, (3) to visit the child as often as the department permitted, (4) to engage in individual counseling, (5) to secure and maintain adequate housing and income, (6) to abstain from substance abuse, (7) to obtain a consistent secondary caretaker, (8) to have no \u201cinvolvement\u201d with the criminal justice system, (9) to participate in a teen mentor program and (10) to complete a psychological evaluation and follow any subsequent recommendations for treatment. The expectations included a caveat advising the respondent that the \u201c[f]ailure to achieve these goals will increase the chance that a petition may be filed to terminate your parental rights permanently so that your child may be placed in adoption. If you need help in reaching any of these expectations, contact your lawyer and/or [department] worker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On March 9, 1999, the commissioner filed a petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights. A trial was conducted in October, 1999. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the department had made reasonable efforts at reunification. The court also found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation, within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as would encourage the belief that within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, she could assume a responsible position in the child\u2019s life. The court further found that the respondent did not have an ongoing parent-child relationship with the child, within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (D),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and concluded that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the child\u2019s best interest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">At the outset, we note that \u201c[t]he standard for review on appeal [in a termination of parental rights case] is whether the challenged findings are clearly erroneous. ... On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached . . . nor do we retry the case or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . <em>In re Alissa N., </em>56 Conn.

See Practice Book \u00a7 33-1 et seq. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether one of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence. <em>...

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Before the court may grant a petition to terminate parental rights on the ground of failure to rehabilitate, it must find by clear and convincing evidence that the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the child with the parent. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>(I).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although \u201c[n]either the word reasonable nor the word efforts is . . . defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Savanna M., </em>55 Conn. App. 807, 812-13, 740 A.2d 484 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. In March, 1996, after the child was removed from the respondent\u2019s custody, the department immediately afforded the respondent visitation at the foster family\u2019s home in New Milford, the same town where she had placed the child in the care of her friends earlier that year. The department social worker explained the need for the respondent to keep her weekly appointments to visit the child, but, over time, the respondent\u2019s visits became infrequent and, for significant periods, nonexistent. Although the foster family lived thirty minutes from the respondent\u2019s home, the respondent made only thirty-one out of her fifty-one scheduled visits in 1997, and only ten out of her fifty-one scheduled visits in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In June, 1997, the social worker arranged to provide the respondent with weekly transportation to visit the child accompanied by her aunt or a social services assistant, but later that month the respondent reported that she did not need such transportation. In August, 1997, the respondent nonetheless canceled one of her scheduled visits for lack of available transportation. At that point, because the social services assistant was no longer available to provide her with transportation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>respondent\u2019s teen mentor transported her to the scheduled visits almost every week from August, 1997, to mid-January, 1998. After the mentor became a department employee and could not continue to transport the respondent, the social worker proposed that the respondent take the bus from Danbury to New Milford and offered to have a staff member accompany her initially to show her the route. Although the bus departed hourly and stopped within a seven or eight minute walk of the child\u2019s foster home, the respondent rejected the offer of assistance and refused to take public transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">After the March, 1998 neglect proceeding and the execution of expectations, the respondent\u2019s willingness to cooperate in visitation matters continued to decline. The social worker repeatedly attempted to contact the respondent by both telephone and by letter during the next several months to discuss her visitation obligations, but the respondent did not reply, despite having signed a return receipt for one of the letters in May, 1998. At that time, the department again offered transportation to the respondent, but when she finally contacted the social worker, transportation no longer was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Shortly thereafter, the social worker discussed with the respondent the possibility of terminating her parental rights. The department again addressed the respondent\u2019s visitation problems in its July, 1998 letter advising her that the child was being placed in a \u201clegal risk adoptive home,\u201d and offered to set up a visitation schedule and to help the respondent obtain transportation. In December, 1998, a social worker met with the respondent and advised her that the commissioner planned to file an action to terminate her parental rights because she had not complied meaningfully with significant parts of the expectations. The social worker specifically noted that the respondent had visited her child only a few times from the time of commitment to the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the meeting, a period of approximately nine months. The respondent replied that she had been busy working and remained unwilling to take public transportation. Only in late January, 1999, did the respondent begin to visit her child on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The respondent also resisted a psychological evaluation and counseling, which the department considered to be critical to her reunification with the child. The department recommended psychotherapy to the respondent in June, 1996, after Mantell\u2019s evaluation, but the respondent flatly rejected psychotherapy. The department firmly believed that counseling was important to help the respondent to plan her life, to become a good parent and to develop better judgment. Although department social workers and the respondent\u2019s grandmother urged the respondent to participate in individual therapy, she continued to resist even after she agreed to counseling in the April, 1997 services agreement and the March, 1998 expectations. Not until January, 1999, almost two years later, did the respondent seek therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We conclude that the court\u2019s finding that the department made reasonable efforts to reunite the respondent with her child within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (1) was legally correct and factually supported. We also agree with the court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]he evidence in this case is clear and convincing that [the department] made reasonable efforts to reunify [the respondent] with her child after the issuance of the [order of temporary custody] in March, 1996. The record reflects that [the department] offered or facilitated psychological evaluations, psychiatric evaluation, the teen mentor program, individual therapy, weekly visitation and transportation to visits. [The department] continued these efforts after the prompt and accurate psychological assessment of [the respondent] provided by [Man-tell] in June, 1996. Although he recommended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>psychiatric evaluation and [the respondent] belatedly finally began it, she did not complete it or avail herself of the follow up counseling which was available to her. By her own admission, [the respondent] refused to cooperate over a period of years. . . . Counseling was recommended, then required. Apparently none of her advisors could convince her to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The respondent argues that it was unreasonable for the department to separate her from her child after the child\u2019s birth rather than placing them together in the same foster home, to leave her at age thirteen in the care of a guardian who \u201callowed\u201d her to become pregnant at age twelve and to expect a fourteen or fifteen year old mother to ride the bus alone in an unfamiliar neighborhood for limited visits with her child. The respondent also argues that it was unreasonable for the department to provide her with court-ordered expectations that were more appropriate for an adult mother, to fail to address her special education needs, to allow the foster family to condition the child not to address the respondent as \u201cmommy\u201d and to limit her supervised visits to the home of the foster family instead of permitting lengthier, supervised visits at a neutral location.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We are not persuaded by these arguments. While placing a baby and its mother, who is still a child herself, in the same foster home might be advantageous in certain circumstances, the respondent in the present case demonstrated poor judgment and caretaking skills during the few months when she did have custody of her child. Moreover, the respondent told a department social worker that she was overwhelmed by her parenting responsibilities, expressed her wish to have a friend care for her child instead and, in the weeks immediately preceding revocation of custody, left her child in the full-time care of another family. Her argument that she should not have been allowed to remain with her grandmother after the baby\u2019s birth is irrelevant to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of reunification because it bears no relation to the department\u2019s efforts to prepare her for parenthood. Moreover, we agree with the court\u2019s conclusions that \u201c[t]he proposed bus trip to visit [the child] was not onerous or unreasonable. No meaningful evidence was offered to show that it was unsafe or that any incident of harassment occurred when she did visit or when she took [the child] out with her mentor. Most significant, [the respondent] herself admitted at trial that if she had known where the bus stopped, she would have taken it. Unfortunately, her own oppositionality prevented her from acquiring that knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The court also noted in its memorandum of decision that the respondent\u2019s \u201ceffort to challenge the amount, location and transportation arrangements surrounding visitation is belated. Testimony showed that [the respondent] attended only three of the eight treatment reviews which were held by [the department] eveiy six months concerning [the child]. She was represented by counsel, and had a guardian ad litem and a legal guardian from the inception of this matter in 1996. If the plans developed for [the child], including visitation, had been unsatisfactory, they could have been challenged and relief sought in the administrative process before [the department] and then in court. No such challenges were mounted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We are similarly unpersuaded by the respondent\u2019s remaining arguments. Contrary to her assertion, the expectations did contain provisions addressing the respondent\u2019s age-related needs. Those provisions included the assignment of a teen mentor and the requirement that the respondent participate in a complete psychological evaluation and follow any subsequent recommendations for treatment, which presumably would have addressed her special needs as a teenage parent. Furthermore, both the respondent and her grandmother agreed to the expectations. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for the respondent\u2019s educational needs, the department expressed concern that the respondent did not attend school regularly and resisted individual psychotherapy, which would have helped her develop the skills and insight required to become more self-reliant and a good parent. We also are unaware of any evidence to support the allegation that the foster family conditioned the child not to call the respondent \u201cmommy.\u201d Finally, the respondent points to no evidence to support her claims that her supervised visits at the foster home were detrimental to her relationship with her child or that the department did not allow her to visit with her child outside the foster home. Indeed, the court found that the respondent and her teen mentor took the child out of the foster home during many of their visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u201cReasonable efforts\u201d contemplates everything reasonable, not all things possible. Id. The department cannot be blamed for the fact that the respondent became a \u201cstranger\u201d to her child, as noted by the court, because of her own unwillingness to take advantage of the many opportunities that the department provided to help her develop parenting skills and to bond with her child. We conclude that the court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the department made reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, efforts at reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly terminated her parental rights on the ground of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Failure to achieve personal rehabilitation, one of six statutory grounds on which parental rights may be terminated pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3), is found when a parent of a child who has been found by the court to have been neglected fails to achieve such a degree of rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, the parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cPersonal rehabilitation as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent. . . . Our Supreme Court has held that General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) [the predecessor to \u00a7 17a-112] requires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Marvin </em>M., 48 Conn. App. 563, 578, 711 A.2d 756, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 916, 719 A.2d 900 (1998). \u201cWhat is a reasonable time is a factual determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>In re Michael L., </em>56 Conn. App. 688, 694, 745 A.2d 847 (2000). \u201cThe statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely when she will be able to assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life. Nor does it require her to prove that she will be able to assume full responsibility for her child, unaided by available support systems. It requires the court to find . . . that the level of rehabilitation she has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date she can assume a responsible position in her child\u2019s life.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 706, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). The critical issue is whether the parent \u201chas gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue.\u201d <em>In re Danuael D., </em>51 Conn. App. 829, 840, 724 A.2d 546 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The following additional facts from the court\u2019s memorandum of decision are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The department requested that Diana Martinez, a psychologist, observe interactions between the respondent and the child on three separate occasions in March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>and August, 1999, after learning that the child was distressed and withdrawn following the respondent\u2019s visits. A January, 1999 visit with the respondent and her grandmother caused the child particular distress. The visit followed a lengthy period of infrequent visitation, and, during the January visit, the respondent and her grandmother informed the child that she would be living with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Martinez first observed the respondent with her daughter in March, 1999, at the foster family\u2019s home. She noted that the respondent was passive and interacted \u201cminimally\u201d with the child, did not demonstrate active caretaking behavior or even an interest in her child and did \u201cnot know how to engage, stimulate [the child\u2019s] active imagination or recognize the value of interacting with [the child] to promote the relationship.\u201d At trial, Martinez also testified that the respondent did not bring activities that were age-appropriate for the child or know how to \u201cproactively meet the child where she was at.\u201d The child herself resisted calling the respondent by name and even avoided talking to her. She appeared, however, to have \u201ca very active imagination and command of the language.\u201d Martinez testified that the child had a tremendous vocabulary, very good expressive skills and appeared to have above average intelligence. She believed that the child possessed great potential if channeled properly, but observed that the child was guarded and vigilant around the respondent, and that the two seemed to have no affective link of comfort, security and trust. She concluded that the \u201cchild\u2019s bonding is not with the biological mother\u201d and that the respondent had no idea how to connect with her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">During two other visits in August, 1999, at the department office, which the respondent regarded as a more \u201cneutral\u201d setting than the foster home, Martinez observed the respondent and her child through a one-way mirror. At the first August, 1999 visit, the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>initially resisted entering the room and remaining alone with the respondent, who did not do anything negative. The child\u2019s foster grandmother stayed briefly and tried to reassure the child by saying that she would return. The respondent brought books to read to her daughter, but, although clearly enjoying the time with her daughter, the respondent remained generally passive. At the second visit, the child again resisted remaining alone with the respondent. She clung to her foster grandmother and stood between her and the door as if to impede her from leaving. Eventually, the child climbed onto the foster grandmother\u2019s lap and refused to get off. Thirty minutes into the session, the child said that she wanted to go home. The psychologist observed that the respondent had \u201cno sense of what to do\u201d and made minimal eye contact with her daughter. At trial, Martinez also noted that the child did not seem to recognize the respondent when she entered the room. The child appeared at ease with her foster grandmother but guarded with the respondent. Martinez concluded that from the child\u2019s point of view, relating to the respondent was like relating to a stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Martinez also noted that the child\u2019s continued growth required a setting with people who were verbal and focused on education. Martinez believed that the respondent might be able to meet the child\u2019s physical needs and even have the capacity to develop and improve her parenting skills, but that she would not know how to stimulate the child intellectually and emotionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">At the request of the respondent\u2019s attorney, the court appointed Rodolfo Rosado, a second psychologist, to observe the respondent with her daughter. Rosado\u2019s observations in many respects mirrored those of Man-tell and Martinez. Like Mantell, Rosado administered various psychological tests to the respondent and discerned a possible learning disability. He determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that her language related skills were significantly below average, but that her general intelligence was \u201clikely average.\u201d Rosado also reported that the respondent told him that she had \u201crelinquished her defiant stance and acquiesced to the expectations that were mandated by the department and the courts.\u201d Rosado further testified at trial that a possible explanation for the respondent\u2019s refusal to go to counseling is that \u201cpeople of color [like the respondent] are less likely to use professional psychological and psychiatric services as a result of having been victims of discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">As for the respondent\u2019s parental role, Rosado observed that the respondent recognized the importance of love and attention to children\u2019s needs, but that she was naive and lacked experience. Rosado concluded that the respondent\u2019s expectations did not fully prepare her for the challenges inherent in parenting and that it was unclear how she would face the conventional dilemmas and aggravations of parenthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Rosado twice observed the respondent and the child together. He commented that the child was \u201cexceptionally bright\u201d in both inteipersonal psychological skills and language skills. His reports of the interactions between the child and the respondent were similar to those of Martinez. During the first visit, at which the respondent, the child and the child\u2019s foster grandmother were present, he observed that the child did not want to separate from the foster grandmother and became anxious and increasingly distressed in her absence. Conversely, she remained relaxed and playful as long as she had the security of her foster grandmother\u2019s presence. While the respondent behaved appropriately and \u201crelated well\u201d to the child, Rosado observed \u201can inadequate parent-child attachment between [the child] and her mother.\u201d During the second visit, the child again did not want to be separated from her foster grandmother. Wdien the foster grandmother discreetly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>left the room, the child checked every ten minutes to make sure that her grandmother was nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Rosado concluded that the respondent had made progress and was not depressed, but expressed doubt about her prognosis, stating that \u201cthere is a question about [the respondent\u2019s] ability to sustain these changes and exhibit further growth.\u201d At trial, Rosado moderated his views, saying that the respondent had a \u201cfavorable prognosis\u201d and that he saw no reason why she could not be a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The court determined that the credence awarded Rosado\u2019s observations should be tempered by the fact that he might not properly understand the circumstances surrounding visitation. For example, Rosado was under the impression that all of the visits occurred in the foster home, which led him to believe erroneously that the respondent never had the opportunity to visit the child in a neutral setting. In fact, the respondent and her mentor took the child out of the house for their visits from August, 1997, to January, 1998. Rosado also did not know about the significant gaps in visitation. When queried, he testified only that the respondent had \u201cmentioned that she missed some recently because of her illness.\u201d He agreed that a break in visitation for nearly one year would have a major impact on the respondent\u2019s relationship with the child, and admitted that such a break, for a preschool child especially, would severely restrict the opportunity for a potential attachment relationship to develop between the parent and child. He also noted that one factor in any progression to more frequent or longer visits ought to be the parent\u2019s willingness to attend scheduled visits, and that without such a commitment there was no possibility of considering such a progression. His conclusion that there was no meaningful bond between the respondent and her daughter echoed that of Martinez. Rosado testified that he \u201cdid not see any behaviors or indications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>that [the child] related to [the respondent] as a unique person that qualified as a kind of bonded or secure attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">It is clear that for several years the respondent consistently refused to take her visitation and counseling obligations seriously, thus putting, as the court observed, \u201cher own needs first and those of [the child] second.\u201d While it is true that the respondent obtained employment and housing, participated in teen mentoring, was not involved in drugs and had no contact with the criminal justice system, her unwillingness to undertake specific steps to develop her parenting skills and bond with her daughter is equally important. Moreover, both psychologists noticed that the child exhibited anxiety toward the respondent and did not want to be in the same room with her in the absence of her foster grandmother. That the mother and child had no real relationship, despite the department\u2019s efforts to encourage one for more than three years, is noteworthy. Furthermore, the factual record indicates that the child is a bright, imaginative four year old who needs direction and stimulation, which the respondent does not seem able to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The respondent argues that she has made long strides toward being a responsible parent and that she was in a better position to parent the child at the time the petition was filed than when the department initially removed the child from her custody. She cites <em>In re Jessica M., </em>49 Conn. App. 229, 714 A.2d 64 (1998), judgment vacated, appeal dismissed, 250 Conn. 747, 738 A.2d 1087 (1999), and argues that if the parents of a physically abused child can be found capable of rehabilitation in the near future, so too can she, a child herself when her baby was bom, be found sufficiently rehabilitated to assume a responsible position in the life of her child within a reasonable time, especially if supported by existing social services. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In <em>In re Jessica M., </em>250 Conn. 747, 738 A.2d 1087 (1999), our Supreme Court determined that the appeal was moot.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court vacated the judgments of the Appellate Court and the trial court, and dismissed the appeal. Id., 749. Thus, the respondent\u2019s reliance on that vacated judgment is misplaced. As to the respondent\u2019s remaining argument, despite the progress that she has made in improving her own life, her relative youth does not excuse her from failing to take advantage of the many opportunities she was offered to prepare herself for parenthood and to bond with her daughter through counseling and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We conclude that the court properly found that the respondent is not prepared to assume a responsible position in the life of her child, that she is not in a position to care for the child\u2019s particular needs and that there is no reason to believe that she will be in a position to do so within a reasonable time in the future, despite her belated efforts to seek counseling and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly found that no ongoing parent-child relationship existed. For the reasons set forth below, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In part II of this opinion, we concluded that the court properly found that the respondent had failed to achieve personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B). We need uphold only one statutoiy ground found by the court to affirm its decision to terminate parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>rights. <em>In re John G., </em>56 Conn. App. 12, 20 n.4, 740 A.2d 496 (1999). \u201cTo prevail on her claim that the court improperly terminated her parental rights, the respondent must successfully challenge all of the bases of the judgment terminating her parental rights. If [any] of the grounds on which the trial court relied are upheld on appeal, the termination of parental rights must stand.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because one statutory ground for termination properly exists, namely, failure to achieve personal rehabilitation, we need not reach the respondent\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s finding of no ongoing parent-child relationship was improper. See <em>In re Shane </em>P., supra, 58 Conn. App. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The respondent next claims that the termination of her parental rights violated her substantive due process and equal protection rights as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions because the department failed to make reasonable efforts at reunification and failed to consider the respondent\u2019s age in its efforts. We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u201cEstablished wisdom counsels us to exercise self-restraint so as to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 175, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993). Where a conclusion can be based on established principles of statutory construction, the court need not determine whether constitutional principles also would require the same conclusion. See <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 527, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Having concluded in part I of this opinion that the court properly found that the department made reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>able efforts at reunification pursuant to the statutory requirement, taking into account the respondent\u2019s age-related needs, we find it unnecessaiy to address this constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The respondent\u2019s next constitutional claim is that the court improperly found that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship prior to finding that the respondent was an unfit parent. We also decline to review this claim, having previously upheld the termination judgment on the ground of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation. See part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The respondent finally claims that she was denied her statutory and constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel. She claims that counsel was ineffective because she failed to seek administrative remedies that could have resulted in (1) a more effective plan to transport the respondent to her visits with her child and (2) the provision of additional social services directed to reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We reject this claim because the evidence overwhelmingly supports the finding of the court that the department provided more than adequate social services and transportation assistance to the respondent, and that the respondent\u2019s own resistance to department efforts encouraging her rehabilitation and reunification with her child ultimately resulted in the termination of her parental rights. We accordingly conclude that the respondent has failed to meet her burden of proving that any alleged inadequacy of counsel could have affected the outcome of the termination proceedings.

App. 127, 132-33, 758 A.2d 459 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-13\"> The trial court terminated the parental rights of both parents, but only the respondent mother has appealed from the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court, upon hearing and notice . . . may grant a petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence ...
