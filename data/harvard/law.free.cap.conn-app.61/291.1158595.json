We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Because this appeal arises out of evidentiary rulings made at trial, the following facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of this appeal. The jury reasonably could have found that, on January 18, 1996, while conducting undercover drug purchases for the Middletown police department, Officer Richard Batts drove his unmarked vehicle to the side of a road where the defendant was standing and offered to purchase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>$20 worth of crack cocaine from him. The defendant walked along the street and, upon returning a few minutes later, told Batts that he should come back later because he could not get any at that time. Approximately two and one half hours later, Batts returned to the same area and waved to the defendant. The defendant directed Batts to drive into a parking lot, which was within 1500 feet of an elementary school, where he sold Batts three \u201crocks\u201d of crack cocaine for $50. Each rock was contained in its own clear plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Batts conducted a similar investigation in the same area on March 8, 1996. Batts again approached the defendant and asked him if he could buy some crack cocaine. The defendant replied that he did not have any but that he could get some. The defendant took Batts\u2019 $50, walked along the street and met with him at a nearby parking lot where the defendant gave him three \u201crocks\u201d of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">During trial, to admit the narcotics into evidence, the prosecution attempted to establish its chain of custody. Testimony from several witnesses set forth the following chain of custody with respect to the narcotics sold on January 18,1996. Batts immediately took the narcotics to Sergeant Frank Violissi, who was waiting in a nearby \u201csafe area.\u201d Violissi then brought them to police headquarters, where he and Detective Scott Aresco conducted a field test that revealed positive results for crack cocaine. Aresco then secured the narcotics in the department\u2019s evidence room. From there, they were taken to Joel Milzoff of the Connecticut department of public health toxicology laboratory on January 25,1996, where they remained until June 9,1997. A similar chain of custody was testified about with respect to the narcotics sold on March 8, 1996; however, Batts gave the narcotics to Violissi and Detective Michael Kerkes. Kerkes field-tested them, and Milzoff retained them at the toxicology laboratory, where they remained, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>as hereinafter described, from March 14, 1996, to June 9, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The defendant objected to the prosecution\u2019s various attempts to admit the evidence on the ground that the state failed to establish a complete chain of custody. The court agreed that the chain was incomplete because the state had not established custody from June 9,1997, when the evidence was no longer in the possession of the toxicology laboratory, to July 14, 1997, when the trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The prosecution was unable, however, to account for that time period without the testimony of James Gill, an inspector for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, who had been seated at the prosecution table since the trial began. Because the court previously ordered sequestration such that witnesses could not be present during other witnesses\u2019 testimony and could not discuss their testimony at any time with any witness,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court heard argument, outside the presence of the jury, as to whether Gill should be permitted to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court permitted Gill to testily that he had received the narcotics from the toxicology laboratory and delivered them to the prosecuting attorney, assistant state\u2019s attorney Russell C. Zentner. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that the narcotics did not remain at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office at all times during the six weeks prior to trial, but that Zentner occasionally had brought them to his home. The defendant requested that he be allowed to examine Zentner as a witness regarding his custody and possible mishandling of the evidence. The court denied the request on the ground that there was no compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>need to warrant calling the prosecuting attorney to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The court subsequently admitted the narcotics into evidence, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts. On August 29, 1997, the court sentenced the defendant to a total term of eleven years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The defendant first claims that the court violated the sequestration order when it allowed Gill to testify as to chain of custody because Gill had heard all previous testimony while seated at the prosecution table, thereby depriving the defendant of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">For the defendant to prevail on his claim, he must show that (1) the court violated a sequestration order and (2) he was prejudiced by the violation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>230 Conn. 591, 599, 646 A.2d 118 (1994). \u201cA violation of a sequestration order does not automatically require a new trial. . . . The controlling consideration is whether the defendant has been prejudiced by the violation. ... If the prejudice resulting from the violation is likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, a new trial must be ordered.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>187 Conn. 602, 611, 447 A.2d 734 (1982). \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to show prejudice in the trial court\u2019s failure to observe its sequestration order . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>199 Conn. 62, 69, 505 A.2d 708 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 599. Thus, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>52 Conn. App. 85, 93, 726 A.2d 119 (1999), aff'd, 253 Conn. 639, 756 A.2d 833 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">The state concedes, and we agree, that the court violated its sequestration order when it allowed Gill to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>testify. Therefore, we must consider whether the court\u2019s violation was \u201cprobably harmful to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cNot all testimony that is tainted by a violation of a sequestration order is necessarily prejudicial. Rather, [a]n inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each case is necessaiy to ascertain whether the purpose of a sequestration order has been thwarted. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 600; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>16 Conn. App. 172, 182, 547 A.2d 77, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 821, 551 A.2d 758 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201cThe primary purpose of a sequestration order is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial by preventing witnesses from shaping their testimony to corroborate falsely the testimony of others.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 90; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 67-68. It is not limited to corroborative evidence, but also includes contradictory and tailored testimony. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 600. \u201cSequestration orders assure that witnesses will testify solely on the basis of their personal knowledge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>56 Conn. App. 26, 32, 741 A.2d 321 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn 927, 746 A.2d 790 (2000). \u201cIn essence, it helps to ensure that the trial is fair.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Therefore, we must determine whether Gill\u2019s testimony was in any way tailored to the testimony he heard and, second, if it was tailored, whether Gill\u2019s testimony was likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. Id., 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The defendant argues that Gill was likely to tailor his testimony to meet the state\u2019s burden of establishing chain of custody since he saw firsthand the state\u2019s difficulty in admitting the narcotics into evidence and was aware of which gaps in the chain of custody time line needed to be accounted for. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>There is no presumption that a witness who desires a particular result because of his role in the prosecution\u2019s investigation will shape his testimony in favor of the prosecution\u2019s case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DiBella, </em>157 Conn. 330, 342, 254 A.2d 477 (1968) (finding no presumption of complicity by two police officers who \u201cconducted practically the entire investigation and desire[d] a successful result\u201d). Likewise, we are not convinced that by virtue of Gill\u2019s awareness of the state\u2019s need to account for the evidence on certain dates, he would be likely to alter his testimony. He was no more likely to alter his testimony than any other witness who is aware that his testimony involves a crucial matter. Therefore, it is necessary for us to examine Gill\u2019s testimony for evidence that he \u201cfabricated his testimony to comport with\u201d that of the preceding witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Gill testified that on June 9,1997, he went to the state toxicology laboratory at Zentner\u2019s request, whereupon he received evidence that he identified as the state\u2019s exhibits. He testified that, after signing two dated receipts for the evidence, he brought the evidence to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and gave it to Zentner. He further testified that the evidence was in the same condition at trial as it was when he first received it. No previous witness testified that Gill had received the evidence or transported it to Zentner. Milzoff previously had testified that the evidence was last at the toxicology laboratory on June 9, 1997. Therefore, Gill knew that the date from which it was necessary to account for the evidence was June 9, 1997. Gill also testified that it was his signature on two receipts in evidence, each of which identified the case, the item of evidence and the date on which he received the items.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The only testimony that could have been tailored involves the date on which Gill stated that he received the evidence because that date is consistent with Mil-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>zoff s testimony. We cannot conclude that this consistency is attributable to Gill\u2019s tailoring of his testimony. It is too technical to impact the credibility of his testimony. See id. (no evidence of complicity where substance of two state troopers\u2019 testimony was different and similarities could be attributed to standard police operating procedures); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>11 Conn. App. 80, 85, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987) (consistencies in mother\u2019s, daughter\u2019s testimony \u201cwholly explainable by reference to factors other than the order of their testimony\u201d). Rather, the consistency is likely attributable to Gill\u2019s own recollection as supported by the two receipts he signed. Moreover, cross-examination of Gill failed to call into question any consistencies between his testimony and the other witnesses\u2019 testimony that might be attributable to the fact that he already had heard their chain of custody testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 16 Conn. App. 183, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 86 (\u201c \u2018[t]he failure of trial counsel to attempt ... to show any harm that may have flowed from the violation of the sequestration order is strong evidence that he did not deem it to be prejudicial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Even if we assume arguendo that it was probable that the testimony that Gill already heard and his knowledge of the state\u2019s case tainted his testimony, we conclude that the defendant has not met his burden of showing prejudice. Even if Gill were not allowed to testify, the court could still, in its discretion, admit the narcotics evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>47 Conn. App. 590, 595, 706 A.2d 1000 (1998) (\u201c[ajppellate courts grant great deference to a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence . . . and will not disturb such rulings absent a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Moreover, the court in this case gave a curative instruction to the jury before and after Gill\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>It is well established that \u201c[i]f curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>227 Conn. 677, 694, 631 A.2d 271 (1993). \u201cOur appehate courts have always given great weight to curative instructions in assessing claimed errors . . . especially in assessing a defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 591, to support his contention that it is probable that an inspector, seated at the prosecution table throughout trial and knowing that certain facts were \u201ccrucial\u201d for the state to establish chain of custody, would tailor his testimony to that of the other witnesses. We find <em>Robinson </em>distinguishable on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In <em>Robinson, </em>our Supreme Court found it probable that a correction officer who was present during the defendant\u2019s trial tailored his testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged assault of another correction officer. Id., 601-602. In that case, however, the officer gave directly contradictory testimony after hearing the defendant\u2019s witnesses and, being a fellow officer of the victim, had a motive to shape his testimony. Id., 601-603. In this case, there is no such motive to fabricate and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>as discussed, there is nothing to suggest that Gill modified his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The court in <em>Robinson </em>also concluded that, because there was no pretrial testimony with which to rebut the correction officer\u2019s testimony, jury instructions, cross-examination and closing arguments could not obviate the harmful effects of the witness\u2019 tainted testimony. Id., 603. Although Gill did not testify before trial in this case, we conclude that the evidentiary foundation that pretrial testimony would have provided for rebuttal would have been unavailing to the defendant because the accuracy of Gill\u2019s testimony can be gauged and supported by signed and dated evidence receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We determine that the defendant has failed to show that Gill\u2019s exposure to prior testimony or his knowledge of the state\u2019s case tainted his testimony and resulted in prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his request to question Zentner regarding his custody of the evidence, thereby depriving the defendant of his constitutional right to an adequate defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">The following additional facts are necessary to address this claim. In an off-the-record conversation with defense counsel, Zentner revealed that during the period in which he retained custody of the evidence, he took it to his home. The parties then brought the matter to the attention of the court. Zentner indicated, in chambers and later on the record, that he brought the evidence home on one or two occasions to examine the sticker affixed to its packaging to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The defendant insisted that Zentner be called as a witness. The court found, however, that the defendant failed to establish, as required by the compelling need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>test, that the information sought from the prosecutor was necessary. Rather, the court found that the chain of custody of the narcotics was established without the testimony of Zentner and that, absent any claim that the evidence was tampered with during his custody of it, there would be no reason to question him. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Connecticut courts have applied the compelling need test to determine whether a prosecuting attorney can be called as a witness in a case in which he participates as an advocate. <em>State </em>v. Mathis, 59 Conn. App. 416, 423, 757 A.2d 55, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 941, 761 A.2d 764 (2000); <em>State v. Colton, </em>234 Conn. 683, 701-702, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>20 Conn. App. 290, 295-96, 567 A.2d 837 (1989). \u201cThe policy behind the compelling need test in the context of requiring a prosecutor to testify is four fold: First, there is the risk that the prosecutor may not be a fully objective witness. . . . Second, there exists the justifiable fear that, when a prosecutor takes the witness stand, the prestige or prominence of the prosecutor\u2019s office will artificially enhance his credibility as a witness. . . . Third, the jury may understandably be confused by the prosecutor\u2019s dual role. . . . Finally, a broader concern for public confidence in the administration of justice suggests the maxim that justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201cUnder this [compelling need] test, the party wishing to call a prosecutor to testify must show that the testimony of the prosecutor is necessary and not merely relevant, and that all other available sources of comparably probative evidence have been exhausted. . . . Because the decision whether to allow an attorney to be called is within the discretion of the trial court, appellate courts will reverse trial court decisions only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>when there has been an abuse of discretion. . . . The issue is only whether the trial court acted reasonably.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mathis, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 423-24. In determining whether the court abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action. <em>State </em>v. <em>Meikle, </em>60 Conn. App. 802, 817, 761 A.2d 247 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The court determined that with the testimony of Gill, the state sufficiently accounted for the evidence up until July 14,1997. \u201cAppellate courts grant great deference to a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence . . . and will not disturb such rulings absent a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. ... As a general rule, it may be said that the prosecution is not required or compelled to prove each and every circumstance in the chain of custody beyond a reasonable doubt .... It is not necessary for every person who handled the item to testify in order to establish the chain of custody. It is sufficient if the chain of custody is established with reasonable certainty to eliminate the likelihood of mistake or alteration.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 595. \u201cThe state\u2019s burden with respect to chain of custody is met by a showing that there is a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that the substance has not been changed in important respects. . . . \u2018The court must consider the nature of the article, the circumstances surrounding its preservation and custody and the likelihood of intermeddlers tampering with it . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>186 Conn. 26, 31 n.4, 438 A.2d 1183 (1982). Thus, this court has found sufficient evidence to establish an adequate chain of custody where there is testimony that evidence was transferred between law enforcement personnel, delivered and received by the state toxicology laboratory and was identified at trial as the same evidence in an unchanged condition with no indication of tampering. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 595, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>37 Conn. App. 464, 480-82, 657 A.2d 659, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 660 A.2d 859 (1995); see <em>also State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 229-33, 292 A.2d 903 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>23 Conn. App. 602, 615, 583 A.2d 1296 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In this case, the court reasonably could have found that the state established the requisite chain of custody without Zentner\u2019s testimony. Gill testified that the evidence was in the same sealed condition at trial as it was when it was in his custody. From that testimony, the court was able to infer that the evidence was not tampered with from the time it left Gill\u2019s possession to the time it appeared in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The court also questioned Zentner, on the record but outside the presence of the jury, regarding his custody of the evidence to the court\u2019s satisfaction that the evidence had not been compromised. The court further examined the evidence, again outside the presence of the jury, and determined that the tape affixed by the state toxicology laboratory to reseal the package, as testified about by Milzoff, was intact and showed no signs of tampering. Absent \u201can affirmative showing that the evidence was in some way tampered with, misplaced, mislabeled or otherwise mishandled\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 597; we conclude that the court could properly have admitted the evidence without the testimony of Zentner. Therefore, the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant did not establish a compelling need to question Zentner does not constitute an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates section 21a-277 or 21a-278 by manufacturing, distributing, selling, prescribing, dispensing, compounding, transporting with the intent to sell or dispense, possessing with the intent to sell or dispense, offering, giving or administering to another person any controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary or secondary school . . . shall be imprisoned for a term of three years, which shall not be suspended and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of section 21a-277 or 21a-278. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\"> The defendant requested sequestration of witnesses by oral motion after jury selection and prior to trial.

But apparently, the state didn\u2019t\u2014which means a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>witness or a potential witness cannot be in a courtroom when another witness testifies. But the state wasn\u2019t aware until recently, based on my rulings, that they\u2019d be calling inspector Gill. And I have exempted him\u2014 for reasons I don\u2019t need to advise you of\u2014but I have exempted him from the sequestration order, and I am allowing him to testify in that limited area.

By my doing that, I don\u2019t want to give any more weight to his credibility. You have to determine if he\u2019s credible like you would anyone else. So, because I have extended that courtesy, I don\u2019t want you to think I was trying to indicate you give it any more weight than anybody else. You treat him like any other witness, no matter who they are. Okay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
