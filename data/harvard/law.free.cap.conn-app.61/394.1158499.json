He claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for a mistrial and (2) denied his motion to suppress evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At approximately 7 o\u2019clock on the morning of September 6, 1998, Officer Chris Rubis of the Fairfield police department observed a vehicle in which the operator was not wearing a seat belt in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-100a (c) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rubis followed the car and radioed for information on the car\u2019s license plate number. In response, he learned that the license plate had not been issued for the vehicle that he was following.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>When the driver stopped to get gas, Rubis pulled in behind him and approached the driver, who was identified as the defendant. Although he could not produce any identification for himself or registration documents for the vehicle, he gave Rubis his correct name and date of birth. The defendant and his passenger both told Rubis that they were en route to Stamford despite the fact that they were headed in the opposite direction. During the ensuing conversation, the defendant volunteered the information that he had been released from jail within the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">As Rubis was speaking with the defendant and his passenger, Sergeant Tom Mrozek arrived in response to Rubis\u2019 call for backup. Mrozek assisted Rubis by performing criminal history checks which revealed that both the defendant and his passenger had records for burglary and larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">During his conversation with the defendant, Rubis observed electronic equipment and a large number of compact discs in plain view on the backseat. The defendant told Rubis that they were his and consented to Rubis\u2019 looking through them. Rubis then asked the defendant if he could take them for safekeeping until the defendant could produce documentation showing his ownership. The defendant agreed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, Rubis had no knowledge of a burglary or similar crime having taken place. Rubis determined that the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>belonged to the defendant\u2019s uncle and that the defendant had permission to use it. The defendant then produced the correct license plates and paperwork from the trunk of his car, and Rubis helped put the license plates on the vehicle. Rubis allowed the defendant to leave after issuing him a citation for operating a motor vehicle without a license and misuse of license plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The items in question were subsequently identified as having been stolen in a burglary in Fairfield. About three weeks later, as a result of further police investigation, the defendant was arrested on the charges that gave rise to this appeal. At trial, the court, after a hearing, denied his motion to suppress evidence of the items seized from the backseat of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The defendant first argues that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial on the ground that Rubis improperly testified as to the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The following additional facts are necessary for a resolution of this claim. During trial, Rubis testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">\u201cQ. . . . What drew your attention to the knapsack or the items on the backseat?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">\u201cA. I had no identification on who the operator was and I had no information on what type of vehicle [it] was at that point in time. The assisting officer, Sgt. Mrozek, called into headquarters to assist in identifying who [the defendant] was and ran his name and date of birth through the state of Connecticut criminal history check. In that criminal history check, it was determined that he\u2019s been\u2014he has past convictions for burglaries as well as larcenies, et cetera. And also in interviewing [the defendant] on scene, he told me he had just gotten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>out of jail within a year prior to that. I\u2019m not sure of the exact amount of time that we had determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendant did not move to strike the testimony or request that the court give the jury a curative instruction. Instead, defense counsel completed her cross-examination, and the trial continued with five more witnesses before the state rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The following morning, before closing arguments, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the court had failed to strike Rubis\u2019 testimony sua sponte and to instruct the jury sua sponte to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[Ejvidence that a criminal defendant has been convicted of crimes on prior occasions is generally not admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>23 Conn. App. 83, 85, 579 A.2d 564, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 822, 581 A.2d 1056 (1990). This rule, is not, however, without exception. The facts of this case present one such exception. A party may not complain when evidence he invites comes into a case. <em>State v. Smith, </em>212 Conn. 593, 611, 563 A.2d 671 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 33, 438 A.2d 815 (1981). In the present case, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination invited Rubis\u2019 reference to the defendant\u2019s criminal record. Defense counsel knew, from the suppression hearing, that Rubis was suspicious of the items in the backseat, yet counsel made no effort to interrupt Rubis\u2019 testimony, nor did she move to strike it or seek a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The defendant, nevertheless, argues that the corut had a duty to strike the testimony sua sponte and to give a curative instruction. He bases his sua sponte argument on <em>State </em>v. <em>Traficonda, </em>223 Conn. 273, 282-83, 612 A.2d 45 (1992). This reliance is misplaced. The trial court in <em>Traficonda </em>was not acting sua sponte. Rather, after a witness uttered improper testimony, \u201c[djefense counsel immediately objected, moved to strike and moved for a mistrial.\u201d Id., 281. The court struck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>witness\u2019 testimony, gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, but denied the motion for a mistrial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\"><em>Traficonda </em>is inapposite not only because in that case the court was acting in response to defense counsel\u2019s motion, but also because the court denied the motion for a mistrial. By contrast, in the present case, the only issue raised concerns the court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial. Because a mistrial was denied in <em>Traficonda, </em>we are hard pressed to rely on that case as authority for the defendant\u2019s claim that a mistrial should have been granted here sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Furthermore, when opposing counsel does not object to evidence, it is inappropriate for the trial court to assume the role of advocate and decide that the evidence should be stricken. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>16 Conn. App. 18, 27, 547 A.2d 47 (1988). The court cannot determine if counsel has elected not to object to the evidence for strategy reasons. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>23 Conn. App. 712, 717-18, 584 A.2d 473, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 809, 585 A.2d 1233, cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1252, 111 S. Ct. 2894, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1058 (1991). Experienced litigators utilize the trial technique of not objecting to inadmissible evidence to avoid highlighting it in the minds of the jury. Such court involvement might interfere with defense counsel\u2019s tactical decision to avoid highlighting the testimony. \u201cWhen subsequent events reveal that it was an imprudent choice, however, the defendant is not entitled to turn the clock back and have [the appellate court] reverse the judgment because the trial court did not, sua sponte, strike the testimony and give the jury a cautionary instruction. No limiting instruction was given at the time [of the offending] remark and none was required because none was requested.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The defendant appears to believe that a mistrial and a curative instruction are interchangeable, and that he has a right to choose which one he will utilize. He is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>mistaken. Each is a separate procedural device designed to serve a discrete function.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The defendant next claims that the seizure of the evidence from the backseat of his car was an unreasonable warrantless search in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">We first note what we are not deciding in this appeal. Although urged to do so by the parties, we are not determining whether the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal conduct to justify what is well known as a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). It is established law that law enforcement officers do not violate the fourth amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street and asking him questions if he is willing to answer. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S. Ct. 1319, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>53 Conn. App. 733, 745 n.6, 732 A.2d 785 (Hen<em>nessy, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 251 Conn. 901, 738 A.2d 1093 (1999). Our Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[effective crime prevention and detection underlie the recognition that a police officer may, in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner, approach a person for purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Perez, 181 Conn. 299, 305, 435 A.2d 334 (1980). The present case clearly fits within the principles of <em>Royer </em>and <em>Perez. </em>The defendant had stopped his automobile in a gas station when Rubis approached and questioned him. There is no suggestion that the defendant was even slightly reluctant to answer the questions. He was not in custody and was free to leave at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The officer knew that he did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant or to search the vehicle without his consent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA warrantless search ... is not unreasonable, however, under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution . . . when a person with authority to do so has freely consented.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>49 Conn. App. 738, 743, 718 A.2d 22, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 934, 719 A.2d 1175 (1998). \u201cIt is . . . well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search [or seizure] that is conducted pursuant to consent.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>189 Conn. 461, 467, 456 A.2d 1191 (1983). Whether a defendant has voluntarily consented to a search is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances. The trial court makes this determination on the basis of the evidence that it deems credible along with the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>17 Conn. App. 102, 103-104, 550 A.2d 22, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 828, 552 A.2d 1216 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Story, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u201cWhether there was valid consent to a search is a factual question that will not be lightly overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>227 Conn. 207, 226, 630 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1025, 114 S. Ct. 637, 126 L. Ed. 2d 595 (1993). Examination of the record in the present case leads us to the inescapable conclusion that the defendant\u2019s will was not overborne and that his consent was his unconstrained choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was legally and logically correct, and was properly supported by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> The defendant\u2019s statement of issues also claimed that the court improperly failed to suppress statements of the defendant derived from the allegedly illegal search. The defendant merely mentions this issue without analysis. A reviewing court will not consider an inadequately briefed issue. See <em>Middletown Commercial Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>42 Conn. App. 426, 439 n.12, 680 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 939, 684 A.2d 711 (1996). An issue merely mentioned will be deemed abandoned. <em>Fromer </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>36 Conn. App. 155, 156, 649 A.2d 540 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-100a(c) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe operator of ... a private passenger motor vehicle . . . equipped with seat safety belts . . . shall wear such seat safety belt while the vehicle is being operated on the highways of this state . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the seized evidence, Rubis testified as follows under cross-examination by defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\u201cQ. And you told him you were going to take these items in for safekeeping, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I asked him if I could and I asked him if he would be able to produce receipts, and he said he would, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t know the exact wording, but in a sense he said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\u201cQ. Well, in a sense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">\u201cQ. It\u2019s important\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">\u201cA. It\u2019s okay. He said that it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-10\"> In his brief, the defendant invoked both the United States constitution and the constitution of Connecticut. Because he has not provided a separate and distinct analysis of his claim under the state constitution, we address only his federal constitutional claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>243 Conn. 282, 288 n.6, 705 A.2d 181 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1077, 118 S. Ct. 1523, 140 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> The officer was originally attracted to the vehicle because the defendant was not wearing a seat belt. General Statutes \u00a7 54-33m expressly provides that failure of an operator to wear a seat belt \u201cshall not constitute probable cause for a law enforcement official to conduct a search of such vehicle and its contents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
