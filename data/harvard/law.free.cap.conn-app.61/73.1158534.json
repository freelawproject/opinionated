See <em>State </em>v. <em>Legrande, </em>60 Conn. App. 408, 423 n.12, 759 A.2d 1027 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Legrande, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 423-24, we upheld the court\u2019s charge to the jury that \u201c \u2018the law is made to protect society and persons whose guilt has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and not to protect those whose guilt has been so established.\u2019 \u201d We concluded in <em>Legrande </em>that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the challenged language. We conclude, on the basis of the foregoing, that the defendant in this case was not deprived of a fair trial as a result of the court\u2019s charge on the presumption of innocence. See id., 424; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>253 Conn. 280, 308-11, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>251 Conn. 220, 225-28, 740 A.2d 832 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">With regard to reasonable doubt, the defendant claims that the court improperly charged that a reasonable doubt is \u201ca real doubt, an honest doubt.\u201d The defendant did not object to the challenged language at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. Although the record is adequate for review of the defendant\u2019s claimed constitutional violation, he cannot prevail because he has not demonstrated that the challenged portion of the court\u2019s charge was constitutionally improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Our Supreme Court has upheld the use of the same instructional language that a reasonable doubt is \u201c \u2018a real doubt, an honest doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 816-20, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). \u201cIt is not . . . within our province to overrule or discard the decisions of our Supreme Court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Markeveys, </em>56 Conn. App. 716, 722, 745 A.2d 212, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 953, 749 A.2d 1203 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\"> \u201c [A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v.
