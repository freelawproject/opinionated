The trial court, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, concluded that the Montgomery County Council had authority under the Maryland Constitution and laws to enact such benefits legislation and further, that the ordinance was a local law that did not conflict with, and, therefore, was not preempted by, State or federal law. We agree. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">On November 30, 1999, the Montgomery County Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d) enacted and the County Executive signed, Montgomery County Bill No. 29-99, the \u201cEmployee Benefits Equity Act of 1999 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\u201d Generally, the Act, which became effective March 3, 2000 and applies to all active and retired County employees, extends benefits, such as health, leave, and survivor benefits comparable to those afforded the spouses of County employees, to the domestic partners of County employees. In enacting the ordinance, the Council noted the County\u2019s \u201clongstanding policy, in law and practice, against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation,\u201d as well as its belief that \u201cit is unfair to treat employees differently based solely on whether the employee\u2019s partner is legally recognized as a spouse.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-22(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the Council found that \u201cmany private and public employers provide or plan to provide benefits for the domestic partners of their employees\u201d and that \u201c[pjroviding domestic partner benefits will significantly enhance the County\u2019s ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees and will promote employee loyalty and workplace diversity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Act amended the definitions of \u201cimmediate family\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d in Chapter 19A, Ethics, of the County Code, expanding them to include domestic partners, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 19A-4(i)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (n),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thus, extending to domestic partners \u201cbenefits equivalent to those available for an employee\u2019s spouse or spouse\u2019s dependent,\u201d including those benefits available \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\u201cCOBRA\u201d), the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), and other federal laws that apply to County employment benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 33-22(b). To qualify as a domestic partner for purposes of the Act, the County employee and his or her partner must satisfy all of a number of specific requirements or, in the event a domestic partnership registration system exists in the jurisdiction in which the employee resides and the County\u2019s Director of Human Resources determines that the legal requirements for registration are substantially similar, legally register the domestic partnership. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-22(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A domestic partnership terminates, \u00a7 33-22(e) instructs, by the death of a partner or its dissolution, <em>see </em>subsection (e)(1), or the occurrence of \u201cany other change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>circumstances that disqualifies the relationship as a domestic partnership,\u201d <em>see </em>subsection (e)(2), either of which the employee is required to notify the County of within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The appellants, employees and residents of Montgomery County, filed an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, in which they requested the court to enter a declaratory judgment that the Act is invalid and an order enjoining its implementation. In their complaint, the appellants alleged, as they would later argue, that the Act exceeded the County\u2019s authority to enact local laws, conflicted with State law, was preempted by federal law, and was unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court rejected all of these arguments. Thus, it granted the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied the appellants\u2019 cross-motion, and declared the Act constitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dissatisfied with that result, the appellants noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and filed in this Court a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted while the appeal was pending in the intermediate appellate court. As indicated, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that, despite the challenges presented by the appellants, the County\u2019s action in passing the Act is authorized under the constitution and laws of this State and that it conflicts with neither State nor federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The trial court properly grants summary judgment, in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-501 (e), \u201cif the motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., </em>362 Md. 661, 675-76, 766 A.2d 617, 624-25 (2001); <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 144, 642 A.2d 219, 224 (1994); <em>Gross v. Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 255, 630 A.2d 1156, 1160 (1993). This Court, like any appellate court, reviews the grant of summary judgment to determine whether the trial court was legally correct in entering the judgment. <em>Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 530-31, 697 A.2d 861, 864 (1997); <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp., Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067, 1076 (1996); <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>335 Md. at 144, 642 A.2d at 224; <em>Gross, </em>332 Md. at 255, 630 A.2d at 1160. And, because an appellate court has \u2018 \u201cthe same information from the record and decide[s] the same issues of law as the trial court,\u2019 \u201d its review of an order granting summary judgment is de novo. <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 502, 735 A.2d 1039, 1047 (1999) (quoting <em>Heat &amp; Power v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591-92, 578 A.2d 1202, 1206 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Article XI-A of the State Constitution, known as the \u201cHome Rule Amendment,\u201d enabled counties, like Montgomery County, which chose to adopt a home rule charter, to achieve a significant degree of political self-determination. <em>See McCrory Corp. v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 16, 570 A.2d 834, 835 (1990). \u201cIts purpose was to [ ] transfer the General Assembly\u2019s power to enact many types of county public local laws to the Art. XIA home rule counties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 570 A.2d at 836, citing generally, <em>Bd. of Election Laws v. Talbot County, </em>316 Md. 332, 344, 558 A.2d 724, 730 (1989); <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 384, 470 A.2d 345, 347 (1984); <em>Mayor and Council of Forest Heights v. Frank, </em>291 Md. 331, 342, 435 A.2d 425 (1981); <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 597-598, 415 A.2d 255, 256 (1980). We explained the rationale in <em>State v. Stewart, </em>152 Md. 419, 422, 137 A. 39, 41 (1927):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201cThe wisdom of incorporating in the organic law of the state such provisions as are contained in this article had been urged for a number of years prior to its adoption, the reasons assigned by its proponents being that a larger measure of home rule be secured to the people of the respective political subdivisions of the state in matters of purely local concern, in order that there should be the fullest measure of local self-government, and that these local questions should thus be withdrawn from consideration by the General Assembly, leaving that body more time to consider and pass upon general legislation, and to prevent the passage of such legislation from being influenced by what is popularly known as \u2018log-rolling\u2019; that is, by influencing the attitude and vote of members of the General Assembly upon proposed general laws by threatening the defeat or promising the support of local legislation in which a particular member might be peculiarly interested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Sections 1 and 1A of Article XI-A empower Baltimore City and the counties in Maryland to adopt a charter form of local government. Section 2 requires the General Assembly to provide a grant of express powers for charter home rule counties. Section 3 empowers any county adopting a charter form of government, \u201c[fjrom and after the adoption of a charter,\u201d to enact local laws upon all matters covered by the express powers the General assembly was authorized to grant, \u201cexcept that in the case of any conflict between said local law and any General Public Law now or hereafter enacted the General Public Law shall control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Md. Ann.Code, Art. 25A (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), the \u201cExpress Powers Act,\u201d was the legislative response, given by Ch. 456 of the Laws of Maryland of 1918, to the directive contained in \u00a7 2 of Article XI-A. Section 5(S) of the Express Powers Act further limits a home rule county\u2019s ability to legislate. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe foregoing or other enumeration of powers shall not be held to limit the power of the county council ... to pass all ordinances, resolutions or bylaws, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article or the laws of the State, as may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>proper in executing and enforcing any of the powers enumerated in this section or elsewhere in this article, as well as such ordinances as may be deemed expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health and welfare of the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201cProvided, that the powers herein granted shall only be exercised to the extent that the same are not provided for by Public General Law; provided, however, that no power to legislate shall be given with reference to licensing, regulating, prohibiting or submitting to local option, the manufacture or sale of malt or spirituous liquors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This Court commented on the effect of these various provisions in <em>Montgomery Citizens League v. Greenhalgh, </em>253 Md. 151, 160, 252 A.2d 242, 246 (1969), in which we considered whether the legislative powers delegated to the Montgomery County Council included the power to pass a fair housing law. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 252 A.2d at 243. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\u201cThe Council, having been given \u2018full\u2019 legislative power as specified by Art. XI-A, is also given statutory power to pass \u2018all\u2019 ordinances it deems expedient under the police power and the only limit on its powers is stated to be that such an ordinance cannot be inconsistent with the provisions of Art. 25A or the laws of the State, and the further provisos \u2018that the powers herein granted shall only be exercised to the extent that the same are not provided for by public general law1 and that \u2018no power to legislate shall be given with reference to licensing, regulating, prohibiting or submitting to local option, the manufacture or sale of malt or spirituous liquors.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Therefore, counties enjoy full legislative power as specified by Art. XI-A and statutory power to pass all ordinances they deem expedient under the police power, limited only by the provisions of Art. 25A, the laws of the State, and the admonishment that such power \u201cshall only be exercised to the extent that the same are not provided for by public general law.\u201d We concluded that the county could enact a fair housing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cThe classification of a particular statute as general or local is based on subject matter and substance and not merely on form.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cole v. Secretary of State, </em>249 Md. 425, 433, 240 A.2d 272, 277 (1968), citing <em>Ness v. Supervisors of Elections of Baltimore City, </em>162 Md. 529, 536, 160 A. 8, 11 (1932) and <em>State v. Stewart, supra, </em>152 Md. at 425, 137 A. at 42. A general law is one that pertains to two or more geographical subdivisions within the State, <em>see </em>Maryland Constitution, \u00a7 4 of Article XI-A,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cdeals with the general public welfare, a subject which is of significant interest not just to any one county, but rather to more than one geographical subdivision, or even to the entire state.\u201d <em>Cole v. Secretary of State, </em>249 Md. at 435, 240 A.2d at 278. A local law, on the other hand, applies to only one subdivision, <em>see Steimel v. Bd. of Election Supervisors of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>278 Md. 1, 5, 357 A.2d 386, 388 (1976), and pertains only to a subject of local import. <em>Norris v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>172 Md. 667, 192 A. 531, 537 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This Court has recognized that even a law that is local in form or the operation of which is, by it terms, confined to a single county, may be a general law, nonetheless. That is the case when such law affects the interests of the whole state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>See McCrory, supra, </em>319 Md. at 17, 570 A.2d at 836; <em>Cole v. Secretary of State, </em>249 Md. at 434, 240 A.2d at 278 (\u201csome statutes, local in form,\u201d are \u201cgeneral laws, since they affect the interests of the whole state\u201d); <em>Gaither v. Jackson, </em>147 Md. 655, 664-65, 128 A. 769, 772-73 (1925) (\u201ca law is not necessarily a local law merely because its operation is confined ... to a single county, if it affects the interests of the whole state\u201d). Thus, whether a law is general or local is \u201cto be determined by the application of settled legal principles to the facts of particular cases in which the distinction may be involved.\u201d <em>Dasch v. Jackson, </em>170 Md. 251, 260, 183 A. 534, 537-38 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The appellants start with the premise that \u201cMaryland law expressly prohibits recognition of same-sex and common law \u2018marriages,\u2019 a fortiori, it expressly prohibits the granting of the rights of same-sex, common law marriage to same-sex partners of Montgomery County employees disguised as a domestic partners benefits ordinance.\u201d In support of that premise, they rely on <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Greenbelt Homes, </em>300 Md. 75, 83-84, 475 A.2d 1192, 1197 (1984) (quoting <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Greenbelt Homes, </em>49 Md.App. 314, 319-20, 431 A.2d 745, 748 (1981)), in which this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cOnly marriage as prescribed by law can change the marital status of an individual to a new legal entity of husband and wife. The law of Maryland does not recognize common law marriages <em>(Henderson v. Henderson, </em>199 Md. 449, 454, 87 A.2d 403 (1952)) or other unions of two or more persons-such as concubinage, syneisaktism, relationships of homosexuals or lesbians-as legally bestowing upon two people a legally cognizable marital status. Such relationships are simply illegitimate unions unrecognized, or in some instances condemned, by the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Thus, the appellants assert that the County exceeded its authority under the constitution and laws of Maryland by extending employment benefits to the domestic partners of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>employees because Maryland does not recognize either same-sex or common law marriages. They argue that \u201c[t]he County\u2019s actions are an unlawful, back-door attempt to circumvent State law which disallows same-sex unions\u201d and \u201can attempt to legitimize illegitimate relationships under Maryland law by attempting to create, in the guise of a benefits ordinance, a legal equivalency between lawful spouses and same-sex domestic partners.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They further assert that the recognition of domestic partnerships, an <em>ultra vires </em>act, \u201caffects the interests of the whole State as well as interests outside of the state\u201d and, in addition, requires the expenditure of state funds. They conclude that the provision of such benefits to domestic partners is inconsistent with federal benefits laws that do not include domestic partners among the enumerated \u201cqualified beneficiaries.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Contrary to the appellants\u2019 position, the County maintains that \u201cthe Act does not create a marital relationship between domestic partners;\u201d rather, \u201cit merely extends to domestic partners many of the employment benefits currently available to County employees\u2019 spouses.\u201d Relying upon the Home Rule Amendment and the general welfare clause, and citing the opinions of this Court in <em>Montgomery Citizens League v. Greenhalgh, 253 </em>Md. at 161, 252 A.2d at 247, and <em>Snowden v. Anne Arundel County, </em>295 Md. 429, 438, 456 A.2d 380, 385 (1983), the County argues that it clearly is authorized to extend employment benefits \u201cwhere those benefits serve a valid public purpose,\u201d in this case, \u201crecruiting and retaining qualified employees and promoting employee loyalty.\u201d Citing decisions from other jurisdictions reviewing similar laws and rejecting the argument that such laws implicate the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>interest in marriage, <em>see, e.g., Slattery v. New York, </em>266 A.D.2d 24, 697 N.Y.S.2d 603, 605 (1999), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>94 N.Y.2d 897, 706 N.Y.S.2d 699, 727 N.E.2d 1253, 95 N.Y.2d 823, 712 N.Y.S.2d 907, 734 N.E.2d 1208 (2000) (\u201cthere are enormous differences between marriage and domestic partnership, and, in light of those very substantial differences, the DPL cannot reasonably be construed as impinging upon the State\u2019s exclusive right to regulate the institution of marriage\u201d); <em>Crawford v. Chicago, </em>304 Ill.App.3d 818, 237 Ill.Dec. 668, 710 N.E.2d 91, 98-99, <em>petition to appeal denied, </em>185 Ill.2d 621, 242 Ill.Dec. 135, 720 N.E.2d 1090 (1999) (\u201cNothing in the DPO purports to create a marital status or marriage as those terms are commonly defined. Rather, the DPO addresses only health benefits extended to City employees and those residing with them\u201d); <em>Schaefer v. City and County of Denver, </em>973 P.2d 717, 719 (Colo.Ct.App.1998), <em>cert. denied </em>(April 12, 1999) (\u201cThe ordinance qualifies a separate and distinct group of people who are not eligible to contract a state-sanctioned marriage to receive health and dental insurance benefits from the City. Therefore, the ordinance does not adversely impact the integrity and importance of the institution of marriage\u201d); <em>Lowe v. Broward County, </em>766 So.2d 1199, 1206 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000), <em>review denied, </em>789 So.2d 346 (Fla.2001) (\u201cThe Act does not create a legal relationship that, because of the interest of the state, gives rise to rights and obligations that survive the termination of the relationship. Unlike a traditional marriage, a domestic partnership is purely contractual, based on the mutual agreement of the parties\u201d), it argues that because it \u201cdoes not interfere with State interests,\u201d the Act is a local law. The out of State cases have upheld these similar laws on the basis that the applicable constitutional provisions, as is the case here, delegate broad law-making authority to local governments. <em>See, e.g., Crawford v. Chicago, </em>237 Ill.Dec. 668, 710 N.E.2d at 96; <em>Schaefer v. City and County of Denver, </em>973 P.2d at 720. Only when \u201cthe enabling statute expressly limits a local government\u2019s ability to grant employment benefits to \u2018its employees and dependents,\u2019 \u201d the County asserts, \u201chave courts in some jurisdictions invalidated similar laws.\u201d <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>e.g., Arlington County v. White, </em>259 Va. 708, 528 S.E.2d 706 (2000); <em>Lilly v. Minneapolis, </em>527 N.W.2d 107 (Minn.App.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The County also asserts that it is authorized to fund the Act with State monies, which the State generally provides for any valid public purpose. It further argues that federal benefits laws do not preempt the Act because \u201cthese laws represent federal minimum standards that the County is free to exceed at its choosing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We agree with the Circuit Court that the County had the authority, and clearly so, to enact the subject benefits legislation and that the Act is a local law that does not infringe upon the Legislature\u2019s ability to regulate marriage on a statewide basis. As we have seen, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(S) of the Maryland Code, which implements Article XI-A of the Maryland constitution, authorizes counties, notwithstanding any enumeration of powers in that article, to enact \u201csuch ordinances as may be expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health and welfare of the county\u201d that \u201care not provided for by public general law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We discussed \u00a7 5(S) at length in <em>Snowden v. Anne Arundel County, swpra. </em>In that case, the issue presented was whether Anne Arundel County was empowered to enact a program to pay the costs incurred by county employees in mounting a successful defense to criminal charges arising from the performance of their duties. 295 Md. at 431, 456 A.2d at 381. We held that \u00a7 5(S) provided the authorization. Describing \u00a7 5(S) as a \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d clause that had been broadly construed to permit charter counties to legislate beyond the powers expressly enumerated in the Express Powers Act, <em>id. </em>at 432, 456 A.2d at 382, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u201cGratification would not be afforded the purposes of home rule or the reasons which prompted it if the language of \u00a7 5(S) of Art. 25A were not to be construed as a broad grant of power to legislate on matters not specifically enumerated in Art. 25A and the language of that section clearly indicates that such a construction is sound....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">.... [N]ot only does it empower legislative action designed to carry out, exercise and implement enumerated powers, it goes further to add that power is given \u2018as well\u2019 to ordain for the maintenance of peace, good government, health and welfare of the County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 456 A.2d at 382 (quoting <em>Greenhalgh, supra, </em>253 Md. at 160-61, 252 A.2d at 246). We concluded that the program was an extension of employment benefits, which was well within the scope of the authority given by \u00a7 5(S), reasoning that the public benefitted from the challenged ordinance because its provisions \u201cbetter enable[d] the County to recruit and retain qualified ... employees, and to maintain morale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 456 A.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The Act at issue in this case does not, and does not purport to, define, redefine or regulate marriage in Maryland. Indeed, the Act itself includes the purpose for which the County enacted it, setting out the County\u2019s specific findings that \u201cmany private and public employers provide or plan to provide benefits for the domestic partners of their employees\u201d and that \u201c[p]roviding domestic partner benefits will significantly enhance the County\u2019s ability to recruit and retain highly qualified employees and will promote employee loyalty and workplace diversity.\u201d Although not expressly enumerated, Home Rule counties in Maryland, by necessary implication from the powers that the General Assembly enumerated as well as \u00a7 5(S)\u2019s catchall provision, must have the power to regulate local employment and, as to that, its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We hold the purpose underlying the benefits legislation here at issue to be consistent with that which the <em>Snowden </em>court found sufficient to uphold the ordinance challenged in that case. Moreover, the reasoning of that decision applies with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>equal, if not greater, force to the case <em>subjudice.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We see no reason why, if reimbursing the private legal expenses of certain county employees charged with a criminal offense qualifies as a valid public purpose, extending to the domestic partners of county employees benefits comparable to those afforded to the spouses of county employees, does not also qualify. Thus, we agree with the County and amici\u2019s argument, and the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion, that the Act is well within the scope of the authority delegated to the County under \u00a7 5(S).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The determination that the County has the authority to pass the subject Act under \u00a7 5(S) also disposes of the appellants\u2019 argument that the Act is general, or non-local, legislation. Such benefits legislation, moreover, does not infringe upon the State\u2019s interest in marriage. This Court has invalidated ordinances passed by Home Rule counties only when they have intruded on some well defined State interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See McCrory v. Fowler, supra, </em>319 Md. at 20, 570 A.2d at 838. In <em>McCrory, </em>Montgomery County enacted an ordinance providing a private cause of action for violations of the county\u2019s employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>discrimination ordinance. Noting that \u201c[i]n Maryland, the creation of new causes of action in the courts has traditionally been done either by the General Assembly or by this Court under its authority to modify the common law of this State\u201d and that \u201cthe creation of new judicial remedies has traditionally been done on a statewide basis,\u201d <em>id., </em>citing <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981), this Court struck the ordinance down as a non-local law. <em>See Dasch v. Jackson, supra, </em>(state statute concerning the licensing of paper hangers in Baltimore City was not a \u201clocal law\u201d within the meaning of Article XI-A); <em>Gaither v. Jackson, supra, </em>(state statute providing for gubernatorial appointment of. auctioneers in Baltimore City, with payment by the auctioneers of license fees and duties to the State, was not a \u201clocal law\u201d under Article XI-A); <em>Bradshaw v. Lankford, </em>73 Md. 428, 431-33, 21 A. 66, 66-67 (1891) (because it would deprive people of the entire state of the common right to take oysters within the waters of that county, prohibition of oyster dredging in Somerset County is not a \u201clocal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">To be sure, in the Act, the requirements for domestic partnership generally parallel those for marriage. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-22(c), <em>supra, </em>n. 1. On the other hand, the Act does not create \u201ca legal equivalency between lawful spouses and same-sex domestic partners\u201d or otherwise impinge upon the State\u2019s interest in marriage. It simply provides that \u201c[a]ny benefit the County provides for the spouse ... of a County employee or the spouse\u2019s dependent must be provided, in the same manner and to the same extent, for the domestic partner of a County employee and the partner\u2019s dependents, respectively.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-22(b). And that essentially is all that it does. Nothing in the Act purports to, or can be construed to, create an alternate form of marriage, authorize common law marriage or create any legal relationship. Nor does the Act, by its terms or implication, restrict, modify or alter any rights incident to a marriage recognized in this State or give one domestic partner rights, beyond the employment benefits enumerated, against the other. And, as the State of Maryland, as amicus curiae, points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201cThe partners gain no rights in property and income of the other that are earned during the marriage and have no legally protected share in each other\u2019s estates. Termination of the relationship requires no legal process or judicial intervention, and can be done unilaterally by the filing of a notice with the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">As a matter of fact, therefore and in sum, the Act affects only the personnel policies of Montgomery County and does not implicate the State\u2019s interest in marriage or affect the State\u2019s ability to regulate marriage on a statewide basis. Moreover, the only employer the ordinance impacts is the County; it has no effect outside the County and, therefore, no statewide interests are affected. The ordinance simply has no resemblance to other enactments that we have held were not local laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">This conclusion is consistent with the results reached by our sister courts that have addressed the issue. Indeed, all of the courts that have considered domestic partnership laws, including those that have struck down such laws,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>see Connors v. Boston, </em>430 Mass. 31, 714 N.E.2d 335 (1999); <em>Lilly v. Minneapolis, supra, Arlington County v. White, supra, </em>have refused to hold that the mere enactment of such laws creates \u201ca legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>equivalency between lawful spouses and same-sex domestic partners.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Schaefer v.

Broward County, </em>766 So.2d 1199, 1206 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000) (\u201cWe disagree with Lowe\u2019s contention that the Act has created a \u2018new marriage-like relationship\u2019 \u201d); <em>Crawford v.

Paramount Communications, Inc., </em>22 F.3d 503, 510 (2nd Cir.1994). Similarly, the regulations implementing the FMLA state, \u201can employer must observe any employment benefit program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.700(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>A similar position has been taken by other courts that have considered the issue; they have overwhelmingly concluded that local domestic partnership legislation is not preempted by federal law. <em>See, e.g., Lowe, supra, </em>766 So.2d at 1207-08; <em>Slattery, supra, </em>697 N.Y.S.2d at 604-05; <em>Schaefer, supra, </em>973 P.2d at 720-21; <em>Morgan, supra, </em>492 S.E.2d at 195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Thus, to the extent that its power to do so is challenged, we hold that a home rule county that provides benefits to the domestic partners of its employees does not exceed its local lawmaking authority or otherwise undermine State and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">.
