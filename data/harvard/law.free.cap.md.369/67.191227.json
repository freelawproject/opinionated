The alternative disposition to the -University of Maryland Hospital does not contain the unlawful racially discriminatory condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The broad question before us is whether, under Maryland law, a court will enforce the illegal racially discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>condition by ordering that the proceeds be paid to the alternative beneficiary, the University of Maryland Hospital. Our answer to this question shall be \u201cNo.\u201d Instead, the provisions of the will should be applied without giving any effect to the word \u201cwhite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In the trial court, both the appellant Keswick and the appellee University Hospital filed motions for summary judgment based upon a stipulation of facts as well as numerous other documents. The trial court disposed of the case by granting the University\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Consequently, we shall set forth the facts in the light most favorable to Keswick. <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726, 728-729 (2001), and cases there cited. Nevertheless, there do not appear to be any disputed factual issues which are material to our decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Dr. Jesse C. Coggins executed six wills, with multiple codicils, over the course of his lifetime. Beginning with his original will prepared in January 1944, and in every will thereafter, Dr. Coggins left the residue of his estate in trust and provided that, upon termination of the trust, the corpus was to be distributed to the \u201cKeswick Home, formerly Home for Incurables of Baltimore City, with the request that said Home use the estate and property thus passing to it for the acquisition or construction of a new building to provide additional housing accommodations to be known as the \u2018Coggins Building....\u2019\u201d Throughout the years, Dr. Coggins and his wife were closely associated with the Keswick Home. Thus, Dr. Coggins operated the Laurel Sanitarium from which he regularly transferred patients to Keswick because of its rehabilitative capabilities. Mrs. Coggins became a nurse at the Sanitarium in 1940, and she and her husband continued to operate the sanitarium for the next 23 years. Mrs. Coggins served actively on Keswick\u2019s Board of Directors, and, toward the end of her life, Mrs. Coggins was a resident in Keswick\u2019s integrated Coggins Building. According to a memorandum by the Trustee, Mercantile Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>1986 Mrs. Coggins requested that the Trustee change some of the securities in the trust, \u201cdespite the fact that her . .. income would decline.. . . \u201d The memorandum stated that \u201c[h]er feeling is that her personal assets are also pledged to Keswick and that this gesture will enlarge the ultimate gifts which Keswick will receive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Dr. Coggins died on January 21, 1963. In his last will, dated December 27, 1962, after making a bequest of tangible personal property and a number of other bequests, Dr. Cog-gins gave the residue of his estate to the Mercantile Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company (\u201cMercantile\u201d) to be held by it as Trustee under \u201cITEM <em>5\u201d </em>of the will. The trust provided for monthly payments to four income beneficiaries until the death of the last of them. The last of these annuitants was Dr. Coggins\u2019s widow who died on September 10, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Paragraph (f) of ITEM 5 of the will stated that, upon the death of the survivor of the four annuitants,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cthe trust shall terminate and the assets thereof as then constituted together with all unpaid income shall be paid over free of trust unto the KESWICK HOME, formerly Home for Incurables of Baltimore City, with the request that said Home use the estate and property thus passing to it for the acquisition or construction of a new building to provide additional housing accommodations to be known as the \u2018Coggins Building,\u2019 to house white patients who need physical rehabilitation. If not acceptable to the Keswick Home, then this bequest shall go to the University of Maryland Hospital to be used for physical rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The clause \u201cto house white patients who need physical rehabilitation,\u201d and the alternative gift over to University Hospital, appeared for the first time in Dr. Coggins\u2019s final will executed less than one month before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">On February 7, 1963, about two weeks after Dr. Coggins\u2019s death, John T. Kenny, Vice President of Mercantile, provided a copy of the will to Keswick and stated in an accompanying letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201cOn the death of the last survivor of the four annuitants, the trust terminates, and the estate passes free of trust to the Keswick Home as directed in Item 5(f) of the Will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In 1964, Keswick\u2019s Board of Directors began to discuss a plan, prepared by Keswick\u2019s \u201cNew Building Committee,\u201d for the construction of a new building. Keswick\u2019s Board of Directors in 1969 designated the new building that was to be constructed as the \u201cCoggins\u201d building, \u201cin honor of the late Dr. Jesse C. Coggins and in appreciation of his great generosity to \u2018Kes-wick.\u2019 \u201d , Construction of the building began in 1970 and was financed by a loan from Mercantile, gifts, and a grant under the federal Hill Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291 <em>et seq. </em>Construction was completed in 1974, and the building was dedicated as the \u201cCoggins Building\u201d in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">During the next twenty years, Keswick made renovations and constructed a major addition to the Coggins Building. These were paid for by donations and bank loans. As of the date the trust terminated, Keswick had expended nearly $11 million in construction costs and capitalized repairs for the Coggins Building, which was being used to house approximately 160 residents, all of whom were or had been receiving physical rehabilitation services. After operating the Coggins building for many years, Keswick presented Mercantile with future plans that outlined a program for the expenditure of an additional $15.5 million, to be taken from the Coggins Trust, in construction costs for more additions and renovations to the Coggins Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Upon the death of Mrs. Coggins in September 1998, a Mercantile memorandum stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201cThe last beneficiary of this trust died recently. Therefore, the trust now terminates and the balance.transfers to Keswick Home. According to the will, the money is for construction of the Coggins Building. Keswick actually built the Coggins Building with their own money ($10 million) ... because they needed the building at that time and because we agreed to reimburse them from the trust when it terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Nevertheless, Mercantile did not turn over the trust proceeds to Keswick. Instead, in 1999 Mercantile filed the present interpleader action pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-221, asserting that, depending upon the will\u2019s construction, the trust assets were to be \u201cdistribut[ed] to one of two ... named, competing, and alternative beneficiaries.\u201d Mercantile stated that, in order to fulfill its obligation to distribute the trust assets properly, and being concerned that an improper distribution might subject Mercantile to liability, an order of inter-pleader was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered an order of interpleader whereby Keswick was designated as the plaintiff and University Hospital was designated as the defendant. As earlier mentioned, both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the case was presented to the Circuit Court on a stipulation of facts and several documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Keswick argued that Dr. Coggins did not intend the racial restriction to be a binding condition for Keswick to receive the bequest, and that he did not intend for the gift to fail if it became legally impossible for Keswick to comply with the racial restriction. Keswick also argued that it had \u201caccepted\u201d the bequest within the meaning of the will\u2019s language. In addition, Keswick contended that, as a matter of public policy and Maryland law, the illegal racial restriction should be excised. Keswick maintained that Maryland law does not \u201cpresent Keswick with a Hobson\u2019s choice: either violate the law or forfeit a bequest that would significantly assist Keswick in pursuing its charitable endeavors.\u201d Keswick also relied upon the federal Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982, upon the Fourteenth Amendment, upon the Maryland Constitution, upon Maryland anti-discrimination statutes, and upon Maryland cases declining to enforce conditions in wills which are impossible to perform, illegal, or contrary to public policy. <em>See, e.g., Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church, </em>192 Md. 520, 524-525, 64 A.2d 748, 749-750 (1949); <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, </em>174 Md. 87, 96-100, 197 A. 593, 597-599 (1938); <em>Ellicott v. Ellicott, </em>90 Md. 321, 331-333, 45 A. 183, 187-188 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>(1900); <em>Martin v. Young, </em>55 Md.App. 401, 404-408, 462 A.2d 77, 78-81, <em>cert. denied, </em>297 Md. 418 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">University Hospital argued that the controlling factor in the case was Dr. Coggins\u2019s intention and that, based on the language of the will as well as the surrounding circumstances, it was clear that Dr. Coggins intended for the Coggins building to \u201chouse only white patients.\u201d University Hospital argued that, if Keswick would not comply with this racial restriction, Dr. Coggins clearly intended that the trust pass to the alternative beneficiary, University Hospital. University Hospital further contended \u201cthat the racial restriction\u201d was not \u201cso heinous that it should simply be read out of the will,\u201d and that the cases under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause did not require that the racial restriction \u201c \u2018be treated as absolutely void.\u2019 \u201d University Hospital claimed that judicial enforcement of the racially discriminatory restriction would not constitute state action in violation of equal protection principles. University Hospital maintained that, because the will involved a charitable bequest, the issue was controlled by the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine under state law. Moreover, according to University Hospital, the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine would not permit the striking of the illegal racial restriction because of the presence of the gift over to an alternative beneficiary. University Hospital argued that cases striking out illegal or impossible conditions in non-charitable trusts, such as <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>174 Md. 87, 197 A. 593, were inapplicable to charitable trusts .because the latter were controlled by the Maryland Uniform Charitable Trusts Administration Act, known as the <em>cy pres </em>statute, Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 14-302 of the Estates and Trusts Article. University Hospital\u2019s position was that, even though it would be \u201cillegal for Keswick to accept the bequest on Dr. Coggins\u2019 terms,\u201d nevertheless \u201cthe principle of freedom of testation entitled Dr. Coggins to impose the racial condition.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The Circuit Court filed a written opinion which essentially adopted the arguments by University Hospital. The court entered a judgment granting University Hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment and ordering \u201cthat the proceeds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>bequest in question, ... in the amount of $28,834,000.00, plus any additional interest earned minus costs of the proceeding shall be paid to University of Maryland Medical System Corporation.\u201d Keswick appealed, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Home for Incurables v. University of Maryland Medical System, </em>357 Md. 233, 743 A.2d 245 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The issues raised and the arguments made by the parties in this Court are basically the same as those advanced in the Circuit Court. We find it unnecessary, however, to address every argument made by the parties. Instead, we shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Dr. Coggins intended the racial restriction to be a condition for Keswick to have the bequest, that Keswick\u2019s inability to comply with the illegal condition means that Keswick has not \u201caccepted\u201d the gift within the meaning of the will, and that judicial enforcement of the racially discriminatory condition, by awarding the proceeds to University Hospital, will not violate the United States Constitution, federal statutes, or the Maryland Constitution. Nonetheless, we shall hold that, under our cases dealing with illegal conditions in wills as well as the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, the bequest should be awarded to Keswick.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">This Court has long held that where a bequest is conditioned upon the commission of an illegal act or an act which is legally impossible of fulfillment, the condition is invalid on the ground of public policy. Under these circumstances, the condition will not be enforced by awarding the bequest to an alternative beneficiary; instead, the illegal condition will be excised.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Thus, in <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>174 Md. 87, 197 A. 593, the testator left her estate in trust, with directions that the trustee pay one-half of the net income to her older son William and one-half of the net income to her younger son Calvin. The will further provided that, when the younger son reached the age of 30, at which time, \u201cif William ... shall be no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>married to his present wife,\u201d the trust would terminate and the corpus would become the property of both sons \u201cequally, as tenants in common.\u201d If, however, when Calvin became 30, William \u201cshall be living with his present wife,\u201d the trust would continue as to him. He would receive a share of the income but would never receive any of the corpus which would pass under an alternative disposition. After the testator\u2019s death, William brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the viability of the condition that he divorce or cease living with his wife. In holding that the condition was unenforceable, and that William was entitled to one-half of the corpus of the trust upon Calvin\u2019s reaching the age of 30, this Court initially stated (174 Md. at 99, 197 A. at 598):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">\u201cBut under the conditions of that item, he must divorce his wife or in any event cease to live with her in order to have the corpus. He is thus afforded a financial reward for securing a divorce or ceasing to live with his wife. Since he has no valid reason for not living with her, he can secure a divorce only through fraud or collusion, and in either case the conditions which induce him to take such action for reward are against public policy. To enforce them by compliance would tend to disrupt appellant\u2019s family relations, and it is inconceivable that a more improper motive for terminating such relations could be held out to him than by the provisions in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The Court then concluded (174 Md. at 99-100, 197 A. at 598-599):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201c[T]he conditions of that item relating to appellant\u2019s marital status, both in regard to no longer living with his wife and with reference to securing a divorce from her, are void as against public policy, and ... the bequest is consequently unaffected by such conditions. These conclusions concerning those conditions are in no way affected by the expression used by testatrix in the second paragraph of that item requiring their performance by the time of her decease, for since during the twenty-three days which elapsed between the date of executing the will and death of testatrix there existed no cause entitling appellant to a divorce from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>wife, it must be assumed that he could not have procured one. That requirement must, therefore, be regarded as impossible of fulfillment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The principle applied in <em>Fleishman v. Bregel </em>has also been applied by this Court to charitable bequests. In <em>Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church, supra, </em>192 Md. at 522, 64 A.2d at 748, the testator left a sum of money to the Calvary Brethren Church \u201cfor the building of a Church to be held in trust for five years[;] if they do not build within five years then this returns to my estate.\u201d The testator died on May 14, 1942. The United States Government had restricted the use of building materials on April 9, 1942, because of the Second World War, and did not lift the restrictions until June 1947. In July 1947, more than five years from the testator\u2019s death, the Church began construction of the building. The executor and the residuary legatees appealed from a trial court order directing distribution of the bequest to the Calvary Brethren Church, relying on the noncompliance with the condition that the building be constructed within five years. Viewing the five-year building requirement as a \u201ccondition subsequent,\u201d this Court affirmed the decree on two grounds. The Court expressed the view that \u201c[w]e cannot suppose that the testatrix intended that such a condition should defeat her express desire that the appellee build a church. It started to build such a church as soon as it could, and has now constructed one----\u201d 192 Md. at 524, 64 A.2d at 749. Alternatively, the Court pointed out that the federal law restrictions made the condition legally impossible to comply with, and that \u201c \u2018[a] condition which is legally impossible of performance without violation of law may ordinarily be regarded as invalid by reason of illegality rather than of impossibility.\u2019 \u201d 192 Md. at 524-525, 64 A.2d at 750. The Court then summarized (192 Md. at 525, 64 A.2d at 750):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201cWe conclude that, from either of these points of view, the church is relieved from compliance with the condition subsequent. The testatrix could not have intended to require performance in the contingency that arose, and the church could not have performed without a violation of law. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>deed, it may be doubted if it could have performed at all, because, had it attempted to proceed without a permit, and had it been able to get the materials needed without priorities, the construction undoubtedly would have been promptly stopped by action of the authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In addition to the <em>Fleishman </em>and <em>Keyser </em>opinions, <em>see, e.g., Loats Asylum v. Essom, </em>220 Md. 11, 22, 150 A.2d 742, 748 (1959) (reiterating the holding of the <em>Keyser </em>case); <em>Ellicott v. Ellicott, supra, </em>90 Md. at 331-332, 45 A. at 187 (\u201cThe performance [of the condition] becoming impossible ..., it is dispensed with and the estate vested absolutely\u201d); <em>Hammond v. Hammond, </em>55 Md. 575, 582-583 (1881) (\u201cthe condition annexed to this bequest is ... so clearly posterior to the vesting of the legacy, that we have no difficulty in declaring it a condition subsequent, and its performance becoming impossible ..., the legatee takes unconditionally\u201d); <em>Martin v. Young, supra, </em>55 Md.App. at 406-407, 462 A.2d at 80 (\u201cFor centuries courts have recognized that impossibility of performance may modify the legal effect of the breach of a condition in a will. * * * The appellees herein insist that we follow the rule ... that, before a devise of real property made upon a condition precedent could take effect, the condition had to be performed even though performance was rendered impossible through no fault of the devisee. We decline to do so\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>University Hospital distinguishes <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>174 Md. 87, 197 A. 593, on the ground that <em>Fleishman </em>did not involve a charitable trust. University argues that the principle regarding illegal conditions in bequests, applied in <em>Fleishman, </em>has no application to charitable trust bequests, and that illegal conditions attached to charitable trust bequests are governed entirely by the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, embodied in the Maryland Uniform Charitable Trusts Administration Act, otherwise know as the <em>cy pres </em>statute, Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-302 of the Estates and Trusts Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>University Hospital asserts that \u201cthe Maryland <em>cy pres </em>statute controls this case.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief at 33). University also argues that <em>Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church, supra, </em>192 Md. 520, 64 A.2d 748, although involving a charitable bequest, is similarly distinguishable because the will in that case was written prior to the adoption of the <em>cy pres </em>statute, and that, under Maryland cases, the <em>cy pres </em>statute has no application to wills written prior to its enactment. <em>See Fletcher v. Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>193 Md. 400, 410, 420, 67 A.2d 386, 390, 395 (1949) (although stating that \u201cthe <em>cy pres </em>statute ... [is] not applicable retroactively,\u201d the Court later observed that \u201c[p]erhaps without resort to any <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, the same result might be reached by a \u2018liberal construction\u2019 of the will\u201d). <em>See also Loots Asylum v. Essom, supra, </em>220 Md. at 22, 150 A.2d at 748 (to the same effect).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The <em>cy pres </em>statute directs a Maryland court to salvage a bequest for charity and administer the bequest as nearly as possible in accordance with the testator\u2019s intent if, at the time it becomes effective, the bequest \u201cis illegal, or impossible or impracticable of enforcement,\u201d as long as \u201cthe settlor.or testator manifested a general intention to devote the property to charity ....\u201d\u00a7 14-302(a) of the Estates and Trust Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Seizing upon the statutory language that the testator have a <em>general intention </em>to devote the property to charity, University Hospital contends that, in light of the gift over to the alternative beneficiary, Dr. Coggins did not have such a general charitable intent. University Hospital, citing some cases from other states, argues for an absolute rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201cthat a \u2018general charitable intention\u2019 is not present where a testator has expressly provided a \u2018gift over\u2019 in the event that the initial charitable bequest fails for illegality, impossibility, or any other reason. See Bogert, The Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 437 (rev.2d ed.1991); <em>Connecticut Bank and Trust Co. v. Johnson Memorial Hospital, supra, </em>[30 Conn. Supp. 1, 294 A.2d 586 (1972)]----\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief at 34-35).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Furthermore, University\u2019s argument continues, there is no legal \u201csupport for Keswick\u2019s argument that a charitable bequest can be reformed or modified on some basis other than <em>cy pres.\u201d {Id. </em>at 41). As previously mentioned, University maintains that opinions of this Court such as <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>and <em>Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church, supra, </em>which would support the excising of an illegal condition attached to a bequest, have no application to charitable bequests in wills written after the enactment of the <em>cy pres </em>statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Consequently, under University Hospital\u2019s theory, the <em>cy pres </em>statute, which was intended to save charitable bequests, should be used as a sword to strike down the charitable bequest to Keswick even though, under Maryland law prior to the <em>cy pres </em>statute, the bequest to Keswick would not have failed. We decline to adopt University Hospital\u2019s construction of the <em>cy -pres </em>statute. It is not supported by the language of the statute, by the statutory purpose, by reason, or by any Maryland appellate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">There are a few cases elsewhere which do support University Hospital\u2019s position regarding <em>cy pres </em>statutes. They hold that, where there is an illegal discriminatory condition attached to a charitable bequest, and a reversionary clause or provision for a gift over if the condition is not complied with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>there is no general charitable intention and the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine does not permit a court to save the primary bequest by excising the illegal condition. Instead, under this view, a court should enforce the testator\u2019s discriminatory purpose by awarding the bequest to the alternative beneficiary. A leading case to this effect, and the case primarily relied on by University Hospital, is the 1972 opinion of the Superior Court of Connecticut in <em>Connecticut Bank and Trust Co. v. Johnson Memorial Hospital, supra, </em>30 Conn.Supp. 1, 294 A.2d 586. <em>See also Smyth v. Anderson, </em>238 Ga. 343, 348-349, 232 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Most of the cases relied on by University Hospital, however, do not involve <em>illegal </em>conditions attached to charitable bequests; instead, they involve conditions which could not be complied with for other reasons. <em>See, e.g., Jewish Guild for the Blind v. First National Bank, </em>226 So.2d 414 (Fla.App.1969); <em>Burr v. Brooks, </em>83 Ill.2d 488, 48 Ill.Dec. 200, 416 N.E.2d 231 (1981); <em>Nelson v. Kring, </em>225 Kan. 499, 592 P.2d 438 (1979); <em>Orphan Society of Lexington v. Board of Education, </em>437 S.W.2d 194 (Ky.1969); <em>City of Belfast v. Goodwill Farm, </em>150 Me. 17, 103 A.2d 517 (1954); <em>The Pennsylvania Company v. Board of Governors of the London Hospital, </em>79 R.I. 74, 83 A.2d 881 (1951). <em>See also, </em>Wilner, <em>The Cy Pres Doctrine Explored, 22 </em>Md. L.Rev. 340, 348 (1962) (citing a Pennsylvania lower court case and an Illinois case for the general proposition \u201cthat <em>cy pres ... </em>will not be applied where the trust or will provides for a specific alternate distribution effective on the failure of the primary charitable gift\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On the other hand, the position taken in the Connecticut case has been criticized, and there are decisions to the contrary. As pointed out in IVA Scott and Fratcher, <em>Scott On Trusts, </em>\u00a7 399.4A (4th ed.1987),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cit has been held that if it is expressly provided by the terms of the trust that if the restriction is illegal the property should go to a different charity, the doctrine of cy pres is not applicable and the gift over takes effect. In <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Johnson </em>a testatrix left money in trust to be used in a particular hospital for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>care of patients of the Caucasian race. She provided that if the terms of the trust should be illegal or ineffective, the money should go to other designated charities. It was held that the racial restriction was illegal, and that because there was a gift over, the doctrine of cy pres was not applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">\u201cOn the other hand, it has been held in several cases that where the restriction was illegal, the doctrine of cy pres was applicable, and that the trust should be carried on free of the restriction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">For cases applying the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine and declining to invoke the absolute rule advocated by University Hospital, some of which involve wills containing gifts over or reversionary clauses and some of which do not, <em>see, e.g., Estate of Vanderhoofven, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 940, 946-948, 96 Cal.Rptr. 260, 263-265 (1971); <em>In re Will of Potter, </em>275 A.2d 574, 583 (Del.Ch.1970); <em>Bank of Delaware v. Buckson, </em>255 A.2d 710 (Del.Ch.1969); <em>Trammell v. Elliott, </em>230 Ga. 841, 199 S.E.2d 194 (1973); <em>The Howard Savings Institution v. Peep, </em>34 N.J. 494, 170 A.2d 39 (1961); <em>In the Matter of the Trust of Van Bomel, </em>110 Misc.2d 1068, 443 N.Y.S.2d 572 (1981); <em>In the Matter of Estate of Hawley, </em>32 Misc.2d 624, 223 N.Y.S.2d 803 (1961); <em>In the Matter of Estate of Sterne, </em>147 Misc. 59, 263 N.Y.S. 304 (1933); <em>Wooten v. Fitz Gerald, </em>440 S.W.2d 719 (Tex.Civ.App.1969); <em>United States v. Hughes Memorial Home, </em>396 F.Supp. 544, 552-553 (W.D.Va.1975); <em>Wachovia Bank and Trust Co. v. Buchanan, </em>346 F.Supp. 665 (D.D.C. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As previously pointed out, the purpose of the <em>cy pres </em>statute was to save some charitable bequests which would have failed under prior law, and not to strike down bequests which would have been saved under cases like <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>174 Md. 87, 197 A. 593, and <em>Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church, supra, </em>192 Md. 520, 64 A.2d 748. Moreover, nothing in the language of the <em>cy pres </em>statute mandates a rule that a court cannot excise an <em>illegal </em>condition attached to a charitable bequest whenever the will contains an express gift over or a reversionary clause. Furthermore, where the gift over is also to a charity, it would seem that the testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>general charitable intent is confirmed. <em>See Miller v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>224 Md. 380, 389, 168 A.2d 184, 189 (1961) (\u201cthe fact that the testator bequeathed practically all of his estate for charitable purposes, is sound evidence denoting a general charitable intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">As acknowledged by University Hospital (appellee\u2019s brief at 35), no Maryland appellate case has held that a charitable bequest with an illegal condition will not be saved under the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine when the will contains an express reversionary clause or gift over. The Maryland cases dealing-with the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine have not involved <em>illegal </em>bequests. Rather, they have involved charitable bequests which could not be carried out for other reasons. Even in this situation, however, where the testator\u2019s intent is not contrary to law and public policy, the Maryland cases have not adopted the absolute rule contended for by University Hospital. Instead, the presence or absence of a gift over is merely one factor among many in determining whether the testator had a general charitable intent and whether the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine should be applied to save the charitable bequest at issue. <em>Miller v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co., supra, </em>224 Md. at 388-390, 168 A.2d at 189 (\u201c[T]here are no hard and fast rules to determine when the intent of the testator is general,\u201d and the \u201cabsence of a gift over\u201d or reversionary clause is simply \u201canother indication of a general charitable intent\u201d); <em>Gallaudet University v. DAR, </em>117 Md.App. 171, 207-208, 699 A.2d 531, 548-549 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Today in Maryland, there are few if any public policies stronger than the policy against discrimination based on race or color. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 1-51; Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-355 of the Health General Article; Code (1978, 2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-303(d) of the Education Article (mandating that the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation \u201cshall operate the medical system without discrimination based on race\u201d); <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>357 Md. 204, 218-225, 742 A.2d 952, 959-963 (1999); <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 620-625, 667 A.2d 876, 882-885 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(1995); <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 280-285, 661 A.2d 1164, 1167-1169 (1995); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 98-101, 660 A.2d 447, 461-462 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We continue to adhere to the holding in <em>Fleishman v. Bregel, supra, </em>174 Md. 87, 197 A. 593, that where a condition attached to a bequest is clearly illegal and violates a strong public policy, the illegal portion of the condition should be excised and the bequest enforced without regard for the illegal condition. Moreover, this principle is consistent with the purpose of the <em>cy pres </em>statute, and, therefore, is fully applicable to illegal conditions attached to charitable bequests.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The illegal racially discriminatory condition in Dr. Coggins\u2019s will violates Maryland public policy to as great an extent as the illegal condition involved in the <em>Fleishman </em>case. Consequently the provisions of the will should be administered as if the word \u201cwhite\u201d was not contained in the bequest to the Keswick Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED, AND THE CASE IS REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\">. Among other legal provisions, Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-355 of the Health General Article, flatly states; \"A hospital or related institution may not discriminate in providing personal care for an individual because of the race, color, or national origin of the individual.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">. We shall in this opinion sometimes refer to the Home for the Incurables of Baltimore City, or the Keswick Home, simply as \"Keswick\u201d or the \"Home.\u201d Similarly, we shall sometimes refer to the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation as \"University Hospital\u201d or the \u201cUniversity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. The <em>Keyser, Ellicott, </em>and <em>Hammond </em>opinions in this Court distinguished between \"conditions precedent\u201d and \"conditions subsequent\u201d attached to bequests. The Court in <em>Keyser, </em>192 Md. at 523-524, 64 A.2d at 749, pointed out that \"if a gift is first given and then a condition is added by later words, such condition is generally held to be\u201d a condition subsequent, \"that the law favors the early vesting of estates,\u201d and that when a \" \u2018condition subsequent becomes impossible, the general rule is that an estate granted upon such condition becomes absolute,' \u201d quoting <em>Page On Wills, </em>Vol. 3, \u00a7 1284, p. 762. The cases in this Court which have discussed \"conditions precedent\u201d and \"conditions subsequent\u201d in the context of wills and of illegal conditions or conditions which are impossible of performance, have all categorized them as \"conditions subsequent\u201d and have refused to enforce them. The opinion in <em>Fleishman v. Bregel </em>did not discuss the illegal condition there involved as a \"condition precedent\u201d or \"condition subsequent,\u201d although commentators have treated it as a condition precedent. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>e.g., </em>IA Scott and Fratcher, <em>Scott on Trusts, </em>\u00a7 65.3 at 382-383 (4th ed. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"AZA\">The trial court\u2019s opinion in the present case stated that the \u201carguments presented regarding conditions subsequent and conditions precedent ... are not pertinent to the outcome of this case and are therefore not discussed in this memorandum opinion.\u201d In this Court, Keswick argues that the illegal racial condition in Dr. Coggins\u2019s will should be excised \u201cwhether it is construed as a condition subsequent or precedent\u201d (appellant\u2019s brief at 23), although Keswick argues that it is a condition subsequent. University Hospital argues that the result in this case should not depend upon whether the condition is categorized as \u201cprecedent\u201d or \u201csubsequent,\u201d and it views the distinction as obsolete. University asserts, however, that \"[i]f the Court were to resurrect the distinction,\u201d the condition is \u201ca condition precedent.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief at 65, n. 41).</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">In our view, the illegal racial condition in Dr. Coggins\u2019s will should be excised regardless of the distinction between conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. Consequently, we need not and shall not consider whether the distinction, as applied to bequests, has any viability today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\">. Section 14-302 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201c \u00a7 14-302.

University Hospital also distinguishes <em>Keyser v. Calvary Brethren Church </em>on the basis of this Court\u2019s conclusion in the <em>Keyser </em>opinion that \u201d[w]e cannot suppose that the testatrix intended that such a condition should defeat her express desire that the appellee build a church.\u201d 192 Md. at 524, 64 A.2d at 749. As previously discussed, however, this was an alternative reason set forth in the <em>Keyser </em>opinion. Moreover, the statement was not based upon any extrinsic evidence, but was an inference drawn by this Court from the will itself. The same could be said about Dr. Coggins's last will. In December 1962, when the will was drawn, Dr. Coggins or the scrivener were undoubtedly aware that a publicly owned and operated hospital, like University, could not legally discriminate on the basis of race or color,, and thus the racially discriminatory condition was not part of the gift over. Presumably, if Dr. Coggins had known that it would in the future become a violation of Maryland statutes for a private hospital to discriminate based on race or color, he would not have attached the racially discriminatory condition to the primary bequest to Keswick.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
