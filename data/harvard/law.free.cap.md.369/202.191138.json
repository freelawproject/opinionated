State, </em>139 Md.App. 188, 207-08, 775 A.2d 406, 408 (2001), and the State, the petitioner, by filing a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, requested our review of that judgment. We granted the petition, <em>State v. Thomas, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">On May 20, 1999, the respondent, Jerrod Leroy Thomas, was charged with possession and distribution of cocaine. The respondent was tried, and ultimately convicted, by a jury in the Circuit Court for Howard County. During voir dire, the respondent asked the trial court to propound to the panel, among others, the following voir dire question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">\u201cDoes any member of the jury panel have such strong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws that it would be difficult for you to fairly and impartially weigh the facts at a trial where narcotics violations have been alleged?\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The trial court refused to do so,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> explaining that the question was \u201cfairly covered by other questions, or the Court does not find it necessary to ask\u201d it. <em>Thomas, </em>139 Md.App. at 195, 775 A.2d at 410. The trial court previously had inquired, after apprising the venire of the allegations involved in the case, whether any member of the panel knew anything about the case, had formed an opinion regarding it or had other information about the case. It had also asked whether \u201cthere [was] any other reason why any member of this panel feels that if they are picked as a juror in this case they would not be [able] to be a fair and impartial juror and decide this case based solely on the evidence in this case and the law as I would instruct you in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Following his sentencing, the respondent noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. That court, as we have seen, agreeing with the respondent, held that the lower court abused its discretion by refusing to propound the voir dire question proposed by the respondent and, therefore, reversed the judgment of conviction. <em>Thomas, </em>139 Md.App. at 193, 775 A.2d at 409. The intermediate appellate court concluded that the proposed voir dire question was \u201ca valid question reasonably likely to uncover a bias that is directly related to the crime\u201d on trial and that did \u201cpose an obstacle to impaneling a fair and impartial jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 206, 775 A.2d at 417, and, furthermore, that \u201c[n]o other question asked of the venire adequately covered the area of undue influence [the respondent] sought to discover with [the question].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 775 A.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The principles pertinent to the conduct and scope of voir dire have been addressed by this Court and the Court of Special Appeals so often as to be well-known and well-settled. We most recently reviewed them in <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000). We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cVoir dire, the process by which prospective jurors are examined to determine whether cause for disqualification exists, <em>see Boyd v.

R.D. Grier &amp; Sons Co. Inc., </em>181 Md. 415, 419, 30 A.2d 757, 758 (1943), in which the trial court\u2019s refusal to ask \u2018whether or not [jurors] or any of their immediate family [were assessables] in the Keystone Indemnity Exchange,\u2019 where the issue at trial was the enforcement of an assessment against a subscriber by Keystone and the juror\u2019s financial interest \u2018would theoretically incline him in favor of recovery of a verdict for the liquidator,\u2019 was held to be an abuse of discretion, the question being directed at determining whether any juror was biased or prejudiced. <em>See also Morford v.

Indeed, as we held in <em>Bedford, </em>\u201cany circumstances which may reasonably be regarded as rendering a person unfit for jury service may be made the subject of questions and a challenge for cause.\u201d 317 Md. at 671, 566 A.2d at 117, quoting <em>Corens v.

This case is illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The State does not disagree with these guiding principles; in fact, it cites virtually the same principles, but as penned by Judge Chasanow in <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 34-35, 638 A.2d 867, 871 (1993).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying on those principles as applied in that case,\" the State argues, diametrically opposite to the result reached by the Court of Special Appeals, that although it would not have committed error had it chosen to ask the voir dire question proposed by the respondent, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to ask the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At issue in <em>Davis </em>was the court\u2019s refusal, premised on its conclusion that the inquiry \u201c[did] not relate to cause for disqualification,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 36, 633 A.2d at 872, to ask the venire the question, whether any member of the venire or a close friend or relative, was, or had been, a member of the law enforcement community.. The Court reasoned that an affirmative answer to the question would not have established such cause, <em>id. </em>at 36-37, 633 A.2d at 872, and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZg\">\u201cFirst, the fact that a prospective juror is or was a member of a law enforcement body does not automatically disqualify that venire person. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 450, 470, 572 A.2d 573, 583 (trial judge did not err when he failed to strike former state trooper for cause where trooper indicated that he was able to render fair and impartial judgment despite earlier employment), <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 800, 580 A.2d 218 (1990). Likewise, the mere fact that a prospective juror is related to or associated with members of the law enforcement community does not constitute cause for disqualification. <em>Goldstein v. State, </em>220 Md. 39, 45, 150 A.2d 900, 904 (1959); <em>Shifflett v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 151, 156, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>560 A.2d 587, 589 (1989), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>319 Md. 275, 572 A.2d 167 (1990); <em>Baker v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 251, 254, 238 A.2d 561, 564 (1968). In general, the professional, vocational, or social status of a prospective juror is not a dispositive factor establishing cause to disqualify. Rather, the proper focus is on the venire person\u2019s state of mind, and whether there is some bias, prejudice, or preconception. Short of those instances where there is a demonstrably strong correlation between the status in question and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification, mere status or acquaintance is insufficient to establish cause for disqualification of a prospective juror. The fact that a prospective juror is employed as, related to, or associated with a law enforcement officer does not establish that the prospective juror has any undue bias or prejudice that will prevent that person from fairly and impartially determining the matter before them. <em>See Goldstein, </em>220 Md. at 44-45, 150 A.2d at 904. The inquiry must instead focus on the venire person\u2019s ability to render an impartial verdict based solely on the evidence presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 37, 633 A.2d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The State also maintains that the trial court correctly ruled that the proposed inquiry was covered by other questions designed to elicit the same information. It points out that the venire was informed that the respondent was charged with selling narcotics to an undercover police officer and asked if anyone had information about the incident, and later the venire was given \u201can additional opportunity to express any feelings or concerns that might adversely impact on their ability to be fair and impartial and to render a verdict based exclusively on the evidence presented.\u201d The State concludes, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s voir dire questions adequately ensured that potential jurors would reveal any biases they harbored about narcotics or the laws governing them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\"><em>Davis </em>is inapposite to the resolution of the case <em>sub judice. </em>There, the inquiry the respondent sought to have made was into, and about, the prospective jurors\u2019 statuses, associations, or affiliations, not their attitudes. As the passage from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number><em>Davis </em>opinion set out above demonstrates, the <em>Davis </em>Court well understood and recognized the distinction. Indeed, it emphasized that it is the venire person\u2019s state of mind, in particular, whether there is some bias, prejudice, or preconception, that is the proper focus of voir dire, rather than the professional, vocational, or social status of a prospective juror, which is not a dispositive factor establishing cause to disqualify. <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 37-38, 633 A.2d at 872-73. The <em>Davis </em>Court concluded that there must be a demonstrably strong correlation between the status, association, or affiliation and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As indicated, the respondent\u2019s concern in this case was the venire persons\u2019 attitude concerning the crime with which the respondent was charged. The Court of Special Appeals concluded, we think correctly, that such an inquiry is directed at biases, specifically, those related to the respondent\u2019s alleged criminal act, which if uncovered are disqualifying when they impair the ability of the juror to be fair and impartial. <em>Thomas, </em>139 Md.App. at 202, 775 A.2d at 415. The intermediate appellate court\u2019s analysis is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>King v. State, </em>287 Md. 530, 536, 414 A.2d 909, 912 (1980),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in which we stated, \u201c[i]t is common knowledge that a significant segment of our society believes, as a matter of public policy, that the criminal laws relating to marijuana should be modified in one way or another,\u201d and <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985), explaining \u201cthe proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his or her views on capital punishment,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals notes that it is not extraordinary for most citizens to have a bias against proscribed criminal acts and that \u201c [prospective jurors with strong feelings about drugs are not uncommon.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>139 Md.App. at 203, 204, 775 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>A.2d at 415.

Noting that the areas of inquiry that must be pursued, if reasonably related to the case at hand, \u201centail potential biases or predispositions that prospective jurors may hold which, if present, would hinder their ability to objectively resolve the matter before them, <em>id. </em>at 206, 775 A.2d at 417, citing and quoting <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 36, 633 A.2d at 872, the Court of Special Appeals opines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cLaws regulating and prohibiting the use of controlled dangerous substances harbor an unusual position within our criminal code, such that jurors may be biased because of strong emotions relating to the dangers of narcotics and their negative effects upon our cities and neighborhoods, or, on the contrary, biases may exist because of passionate positions that advocate the decriminalization of narcotics. Moreover, unlike the clear disparity in favor of the prosecution created by \u201cdeath-qualified\u201d juries, jurors with strong feelings about drug laws are as equally inclined to hold biases against the State as they are against the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 207, 775 A.2d at 418 (footnote omitted). The court held that \u201cthe potential biases sought to be revealed by [the respondent\u2019s proposed voir dire question] pose an obstacle to impaneling a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 775 A.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As we have seen, and so often reiterated, the single, primary, and overriding principle or purpose of voir dire is to ascertain \u201c \u2018the existence of cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hill, </em>339 Md. at 279, 661 A.2d at 1166 (quoting <em>McGee v.

State, </em>200 Md. 133, 140, 88 A.2d 556, 559 (1952)), and this is accomplished through the pursuit of one of the two mandatory areas of inquiry, <em>i.e., </em>\u201can examination of a juror . .. conducted strictly within the right to discover the state of mind of the juror in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 35-36, 633 A.2d at 871-72 (quoting <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 671, 566 A.2d at 117, in turn, quoting <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 564, 45 A.2d 340, 343 (1946)). We have been emphatic, even in civil cases, that \u201ca party is entitled to a jury free of all disqualifying bias or prejudice without exception, and not merely a jury free of bias or prejudice of a general or abstract nature.\u201d <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, </em>217 Md. 595, 606, 143 A.2d 627, 631 (1958).

Any circumstances that may reasonably be regarded as rendering a person unfitted for jury service may be made the subject of questions and a challenge for cause. Accordingly an examination of a juror on his voir dire is proper as long as it is conducted within the right to discover the juror\u2019s state of mind in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him. <em>Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 564, 45 A.2d 340; <em>Grossfeld v. Braverman, </em>203 Md. 498, 101 A.2d 824.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Langley v.

R.D. Grier &amp; Sons Co. Inc., </em>181 Md. 415, 419, 30 A.2d 757, 758 (1943). We agree with the intermediate appellate court: the proposed voir dire question should have been asked. The trial court abused its discretion when it refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We also agree with the intermediate appellate court that the voir dire questions actually propounded to the venire, including those on which the State relies, were not reasonably calculated to ascertain the bias the respondent sought to uncover. The general voir dire question on which the trial court relied, and to which the State directs us now, falls squarely within the class of \u201cgeneral questions\u201d rejected in <em>Davis v.

Further, we believe the issue of the trial judge\u2019s discretion is still properly before this Court. In accordance with Dingle, the circuit court must pose Question No. 10 to the venire through two questions.

It has long been the rule in Maryland that voir dire is limited to the detection of bias sufficient to challenge a prospective juror for cause and not to assist in the exercise of peremptory challenges. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 11 (stating that \u201cthe single, primary, and overriding principle or purpose of voir dire is to ascertain \u2018the existence of cause for disqualification\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 759 A.2d 819 (2000) (and cases cited therein); <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">I discern a trend in Maryland, on a case-by-case basis, to expand voir dire. The majority notes that \u201c[i]f;. . requiring the proposed inquiry could be construed to be an expansion of the voir dire process, it certainly can not be construed to be an unreasonable one.\u201d Maj. op. at 14 n. 8. This expanded right is addressed in the context of the exercise of challenges for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>cause, but, in my view, the expansion is, in reality, in the area of peremptory challenges. The discretion of trial judges in controlling voir dire is, little by little and case by case, being diminished. For example, this Court has identified ever-increasing areas of mandatory inquiry. <em>See Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 10 n. 8, 759 A.2d at 824 n. 8. We require inquiry, when requested, into racial, ethnic, and cultural bias, <em>see Hernandez v. State, </em>357 Md. 204, 232, 742 A.2d 952, 967 (1999); <em>Hill v. State, </em>339 Md. 275, 285, 661 A.2d 1164, 1169 (1995); <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 15, 595 A.2d 448, 455 (1991); religious bias, <em>see Casey v. Roman Catholic Arch., </em>217 Md. 595, 606-07, 143 A.2d 627, 632 (1958); predisposition as to the use of circumstantial evidence in capital cases, <em>see Corens v. State, </em>185 Md. 561, 564, 45 A.2d 340, 343-44 (1946); and placement of undue weight on police officer credibility, <em>see Langley v. State, </em>281 Md. 337, 349, 378 A.2d 1338, 1344 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In my view, <em>Dingle </em>represented the highwater mark in the sea change. <em>See Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 22, 759 A.2d at 831 (Raker, J., dissenting) (noting that \u201cthe true issue in this case is different in kind from the many this Court has been called upon to address\u201d). Rather than continue this case-by-case expansion of the scope of voir dire examination for cause, and in its wake continue to reverse judgments based on voir dire error, let us, once and for all, join the rest of the country and expand the purpose of voir dire in Maryland to include the informed exercise of peremptory challenges. Since we have not moved to abolish peremptory challenges,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> let us at least afford counsel the information necessary to exercise an informed challenge. To that end, I would endorse a voir dire process that would enable a lawyer to elicit sufficient informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>tion to develop a rational basis for excluding a potential juror, whether for cause or by peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">I point out that, in expanding the voir dire process, I in no way endorse unduly prolonging the jury selection process or permitting abuses known to the trial lawyer. Voir dire should not be used to make a point to the jury or to indoctrinate potential jurors, but rather to gain information to aid in the exercise of challenges. The regulation of voir dire is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the trial judge should reasonably supervise and control the voir dire process to ensure against abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Judge HARRELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. Following <em>Batson v.

State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993), we explained the limited nature of Maryland\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>process, that being to secure information to strike for cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">This Court initially adopted the rules concerning the scope of <em>voir dire </em>because allowing more extensive inquiry would unduly tax the efficiency of Maryland\u2019s judicial system. Although some litigants might benefit from broader mandatory <em>voir dire, </em>a greater number of citizens would be hindered due to the accompanying decline in their ability to gain prompt resolution of their litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">333 Md. at 42, 633 A.2d at 874. We reiterated the scope of Maryland\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>process in <em>Dingle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFG\">To be sure, Maryland has adopted, and continues to adhere to, limited <em>voir dire. </em>It is also well settled that the trial court has broad discretion in the conduct of <em>voir dire, </em>most especially with regard to the scope and the form of the questions propounded, and that it need not make any particular inquiry of the prospective jurors unless that inquiry is directed toward revealing cause for disqualification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">361 Md. at 13, 759 A.2d at 826 (internal citations omitted). Thus, \u201c[questions not directed to a specific ground for disqualification but which are speculative, inquisitorial, catechis-ing or \u2018fishing\u2019, asked in aid of deciding on peremptory challenges, may be refused in the discretion of the court, even though it would not have been error to have asked them.\u201d <em>McGee v. State, </em>219 Md. 53, 58, 146 A.2d 194, 196 (1959); <em>see Whittemore v. State, </em>151 Md. 309, 315-16, 134 A. 322, 324 (1926) (trial court properly exercised its discretion in excluding questioning concerning the juror\u2019s age because the questions were \u201cfor no specified purpose, and apparently with no question of disqualification in mind, but were merely beginning a process of examining at large, in order to form impressions and preferences, which, while they might properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>made the ground for peremptory challenges, would not test the eligibility of the jurymen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Thomas\u2019s requested question would not have elicited specific bias relevant to the charge of possession and distribution of cocaine. To ask about \u201cfeelings\u201d about \u201cviolations of narcotics laws\u201d is so broad as to elicit responses about marijuana possession and misuse of prescription drugs, among many others. It would be similar to asking in a case involving driving while intoxicated whether the jury had any \u201cfeelings\u201d about violations of the motor vehicle laws and expecting to elicit information sufficient to strike for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In reaching its decision here today, the majority relies heavily on the Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, </em>217 Md. 595, 143 A.2d 627 (1958). <em>See </em>Maj. op. at 215-16. The <em>Casey </em>decision, however, is inapposite to the majority\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In' <em>Casey, </em>the defendant, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Baltimore, requested that the trial court propound two specific questions directly related to the Roman Catholic Church and the particular parish where the plaintiff was injured, and asked if a verdict was rendered against the defendant, could the jurors \u201cfairly and impartially assess damages in the case in the same manner as if the defendant were a regular corporation or a natural person?\u201d <em>Casey, </em>217 Md. at 604, 143 A.2d at 630. The trial court declined the defendant\u2019s request and decided to simply inform the panel that one of the parties was a \u201creligious corporation,\u201d \u2014 a term laden with ambiguities \u2014 and to ask whether due to \u201creligious scruples or any other reason\u201d the jurors would not be able to conduct a fair and impartial trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The questions requested by. the church were directed toward eliciting specific information about religious bias aimed at the Roman Catholic Church and bearing directly on the trial at issue. Conversely, the question actually propounded by the trial court in <em>Casey </em>neglected to frame the bias question with precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I believe that the question requested by Thomas in the case at bar is more akin to the nebulous question posed by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>court in <em>Casey, </em>which we concluded \u201cwas not sufficient to determine possible cause for disqualification by reason of bias or prejudice or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 143 A.2d at 631. As in <em>Casey, </em>the question requested by Thomas \u201cwas in a form so general that it is likely it [would] not sufficiently indicate to the panel of jurors what possible bias or prejudice was being probed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thomas\u2019s requested question lends itself to triggering a cerebral fishing expedition in an attempt for the venire panel to look within themselves to ascertain the possible meaning of what it means to be prejudiced by \u201cstrong feelings regarding violations of the narcotics laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">I do not take exception to the notion that if requested and not otherwise adequately addressed in the questioning, the trial court should query the panel about their attitude or mental state with regard to the specific crime involved. <em>See Casey, </em>217 Md. at 605, 143 A.2d at 631 (stating, \u201cit is also well settled that parties to an action triable before a jury have a <em>right </em>to have questions propounded to prospective jurors on their <em>voir dire, </em>which are directed to a specific cause for disqualification, and failure to allow such questions is an abuse of discretion constituting reversible error\u201d) (emphasis in original). To be sure, the trial court must be free to exercise discretion in examining venire panels concerning fairness and impartiality. Any requirement that the trial court pose amorphous and ill-defined <em>voir dire </em>questions such as the question proposed by Thomas in the case at bar would undermine the long-held discretionary function of the trial judge in the <em>voir dire </em>process. As we explained in <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"aib-dedup-0\">where- the parties <em>identify </em>an area of potential bias and <em>\u2022properly request voir dire </em>questions designed to ascertain jurors whose bias could interfere with their ability to fairly and impartially decide the issues, then the trial judge has an obligation to ask those questions of the venire panel ... <em>Those voir dire questions, however, should be framed so as to identify potential jurors with biases which are cause for disqualification, rather than merely identifying potential jurors with attitudes or associations which might facilitate the exercise of peremptory challenges.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 47, 633 A.2d at 877 (emphasis added); <em>Cf.

If the majority is desirous of expanding Maryland\u2019s traditionally conservative <em>voir dire </em>process to include eliciting information to aid the attorneys in exercising peremptory challenges, then it should do so explicitly and without reservation. Until such time as that happens, litigants will be charged with the difficult task of determining' the limitations of the majority opinion in developing <em>voir dire </em>questions and trial courts will be left to speculate as to whether the <em>voir dire </em>really is designed to support strikes for cause or peremptory challenges.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
