Keat (\u201cKeat\u201d), challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on appeal, pursuant to Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>land Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Section 12-502(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, of two Orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court allowing payment of attorney\u2019s fees and extraordinary expenses out of the Estate. Petitioner further contends that the Circuit Court improperly vacated the Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court allowing for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees from the Estate based on an oral motion for summary judgment made by respondent Morgan State University (\u201cMSU\u201d or \u201cUniversity\u201d) at the hearing on the appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Circuit Court of Baltimore City had subject matter jurisdiction to hear MSU\u2019s appeal and properly granted summary judgment in favor of MSU, vacating the Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court authorizing the payment of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On January 12, 1996, Betty Keat met with an untimely death from gunshot wounds inflicted by members of the Baltimore City Police Department during an altercation in which she menacingly approached the officers, crying, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as police in Baltimore City.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Keat, who had been a professor at Morgan State University, executed a will on January 25, 1982, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">[Tjhis is a final will and testament to dispose of my property, Betty Y. Keat, being of sound mind and body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>1. House: to be sold. Proceeds to Morgan State University for repair of campus clocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">2. Stocks, mutual funds, deferred compensation, pension. Converted to cash for litigation costs, if necessary, to enforce precedent provision. Any surplus to be donated towards fund to rectify heating plant of Soper [LJibrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">6. Books: on India: to Soper [LJibrary for special collection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The house was her residence at 326 Taplow Road in Baltimore City. The will made various other distributions of Keat\u2019s personal affects, such as her china, crystal, jewelry, and personal papers; it did not contain a residuary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">On January 18, 1996, Keat\u2019s sister and sole heir at law, Janet Beyer, retained attorney Anton J.S. Keating (\u201cKeating\u201d) to file a survival action<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the Baltimore City Police officers who shot Keat. At the same time, Beyer made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>first of four payments of attorney\u2019s fees to Keating.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On or about February 20, 1996, Keat\u2019s will was admitted to probate and Beyer was appointed as Personal Representative of the Estate. Beyer engaged the services of a second attorney, David Allen (\u201cAllen\u201d), to handle the legal affairs associated with administering Keat\u2019s Estate. On April 6, 1996, Allen notified University Counsel for MSU of Keat\u2019s bequest, and informed the University that Keat\u2019s relatives were conducting an investigation of the circumstances surrounding Keat\u2019s death, which would require use of funds from the Estate to cover the costs of the investigation and any subsequent litigation arising out of it. In response, on April 29, 1996, MSU informed Allen in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">We acknowledge the intention to investigate the circumstances surrounding Ms. Keat\u2019s death. However, we do not understand why you have suggested that costs associated with those efforts take precedence over the Morgan bequest. In accordance with \u00a7 8-105(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article (Order of payment) the Morgan bequest takes precedence. Moreover, the testator did not specify that funds from the estate be used for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Neither Beyer nor Allen responded to the University\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Despite MSU\u2019s expressed concern about the costs of litigation, the Personal Representative filed a survival action on October 3,1996.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>On June 28, 1996, Beyer sold Keat\u2019s house for $95,045.94 and failed to inform MSU of the sale. On August 13, 1997, after having not heard anything from the Personal Representative or her attorneys, MSU\u2019s Office of General Counsel sent a letter to Allen inquiring as to the disposition of Keat\u2019s house and the bequest of Keat\u2019s books on India which were supposed to have been turned over to the Soper Library. Again, MSU received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On February 4, 1998, Beyer filed a Petition to Approve Expenditure of Extraordinary Expenses of Administration (\u201cExpenses Petition\u201d) in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City. The Expenses Petition requested more than $13,000 for distribution to Beyer and her relatives to compensate them for expenditures associated with cleaning and repairing Keat\u2019s house and property for sale. Although Allen was aware of communications from MSU\u2019s Office of General Counsel, notice of the Expenses Petition was served on the Soper Library, rather than on MSU\u2019s attorney. Thereafter, on March 30, 1998, Beyer filed a Petition for Attorney\u2019s Fees (\u201cFees Petition\u201d) with the Orphans\u2019 Court for services performed by Keating in the survival action. Once again, counsel for MSU did not receive notice of the Petition because it had been mailed to the Soper Library. On April 20, 1998, the Orphans\u2019 Court approved Beyer\u2019s Expenses Petition. On April 29, 1998, however, the Orphans\u2019 Court delayed acting upon the Fees Petition pending receipt of a verification, a certificate of service to interested parties, a detailed list of services performed by Keating, and a first and final administration account of the Estate. Keating subsequently filed a Petition for an Extension for filing these requested documents with the Orphans\u2019 Court on May 19,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On May 6, 1998, counsel for MSU entered his appearance in the Orphans\u2019 Court when he learned about Beyer\u2019s Expenses Petition and took exception thereto. Beyer filed a motion to strike MSU\u2019s exceptions on the basis that they were untimely filed and allegedly contained \u201cinaccurate and false allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>On June 8, 1998, Keating filed another Fees Petition requesting $40,000 from the Estate, although the Personal Representative previously had paid Keating $30,000 for his services. The Orphans\u2019 Court granted Keating an extension of time to provide the Court with the information it had requested in its April 29th Order. The Court also ordered Keating to provide his retainer agreement with the Personal Representative for his representation of the Estate in the survival action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">On July 2,1998, over two years after the sale, MSU learned that Keat\u2019s house had been sold. MSU responded by immediately filing a Petition to Order Distribution of Property (\u201cPetition for Distribution\u201d) with the Orphans\u2019 Court to facilitate its receipt of the bequest. In the Petition for Distribution, MSU objected to Beyer\u2019s failure to file a first and final administration account for the Estate and to the proposed payment of attorney\u2019s fees for any litigation arising out of Keat\u2019s death and requested that the Orphans\u2019 Court stay any further expenditures from the Estate pending review by the court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Orphans\u2019 Court scheduled a hearing on MSU\u2019s Petition for Distribution for September 29,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On September 9, 1998, without notice to MSU or a hearing, the Orphans\u2019 Court approved payment of $30,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to Keating and allowed him to request additional payment for services rendered following the disposition of the survival <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>action. Thereafter, on September 11, 1998, the Orphans\u2019 Court denied MSU\u2019s exceptions to Beyer\u2019s Expenses Petition without a hearing. MSU did not receive a copy of the September 11th Order until September 25, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">On October 1, 1998, MSU sent a letter to the Chief-Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City protesting the failure to receive notice of the petitions and the lack of hearings prior to the issuance of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s Orders of September 9 and September 11, 1998. Counsel for MSU did not learn of the June 8, 1998 Fees Petition or September 9, 1998 Order approving of those fees until he appeared before the Orphans\u2019 Court on September 29, 1998, for the hearing on the Petition for Distribution. Although MSU requested that the Orphans\u2019 Court immediately remediate the situation, the Court declined to intervene. MSU then filed an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.) Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> challenging the legitimacy of the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s Orders of September 9 and September 11, 1998. MSU asserted that, despite filing pleadings in opposition to the payments of attorney\u2019s fees and extraordinary expenses from the Estate, it never had been given the opportunity to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>heard on the merits of the issues underlying the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s Orders of September 9 and September 11, 1998.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> MSU also alleged that Beyer breached her fiduciary duty \u201cto settle and distribute the estate ... as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under the circumstances,\u201d as set forth in Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl.Vol.), Section 7-101(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The Circuit Court consolidated MSU\u2019s appeal with the ongoing survival action brought by Beyer as Personal Representative of the Estate of Betty Y. Keat against members of the Baltimore City Police Department, which had been set for trial in February of 1999. In addition, the Circuit Court, acting <em>sua sponte </em>on January 15, 1999, appointed attorney Arthur Drager to serve as counsel to represent the interests of the Estate of Betty Y. Keat.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On February 23, 1999, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the individually named police officers and the Baltimore City Police Department in the survival action. The <em>de novo </em>hearing on MSU\u2019s appeal was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on February 24,1999. During the hearing, the following discourse took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">Court: I have given this case a great deal of thought, and this case makes me' feel extremely uncomfortable. I have really been in a dilemma as to how to deal with this. I have read Mr. Drager\u2019s recommendation. I read the <em>[Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991)] case. I have real concerns about the propriety of conduct that I have seen throughout this matter, and I am extremely concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">I am concerned about the Personal Representative making expenditures without the approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court to almost half of the entire Estate, and approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court was never even sought until more than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>years after some of the expenditures had been made. That gives me a great deal of concern. I am concerned, because the original attorney for the Estate was put on notice as far back as April of '96 of an objection to a disbursement of attorney\u2019s fees, and yet, this matter went to the Orphans\u2019 Court on a petition filed twenty-three months later without a hearing in which there was an approval of the \u2014 of thirty thousand dollars, and ten thousand of it still has not been approved, which is all inconsistent with the estates and trusts article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">I guess the biggest issue before me is what do we do today. You know, from \u2014 I don\u2019t know what testimony or what evidence would even be necessary, because I don\u2019t think there is a factual dispute concerning what was done by this Personal Representative. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s disputed at all that these disbursements were made. I don\u2019t think that there is a dispute that these disbursements were made prior to the approval of the Orphans\u2019 Court. And quite frankly, the Orphans\u2019 Court hasn\u2019t even approved all of it. I am concerned about Morgan not even being put on notice after they filed an objection through the original attorney representing the Estate. And then for the Orphans\u2019 Court to almost perfunctorily sign these orders really gives me some concern....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">[T]his case makes me very uncomfortable when I read what I have read today. In fact, forty thousand dollars was disbursed before the approval was ever even obtained, and even over objection, this disbursement was made without even having a hearing....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The court then raised the issue of a summary judgment motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">Court: ... motions for summary judgment can be filed at any time in a proceeding, and it can even be done orally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-10\">Mr. Davis: I would so move, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-11\">Court: Mr. Briscoe, I will hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Mr. Briscoe: Well, I don\u2019t think that Miss Beyer should be penalized\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">Court: I want you to tell me where there is a factual dispute concerning the times these disbursements were made \u2014 don\u2019t cut me off, the amount of the disbursements that she took for herself, what the commissions would have been. I want to know where there is a factual dispute regarding anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">Mr. Briscoe: I can\u2019t see any factual disputes, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Court: I want to add to the facts that as late as July of 1998, the Personal Representative had not made a distribution, and then an order was entered petitioning to have such a distribution made. It was not until September of 1998 that the authorization by the Orphans\u2019 Court was made in the amount of thirty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">Now, I don\u2019t see any factual dispute as to any of these\u2014 of the statements that I have made, and all of the distributions to Mr. Keating were made prior to or on or about June 24th of 1997, at least a year and three months before ... the final authorization, ... And under the Estates and Trusts Article, and Section 7-601 and 602, approval is required before such a distribution can be made. So as a matter \u2014 with respect to the facts, I\u2019d like to know if there is any issue or fact that is not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">Mr. Briscoe: I can\u2019t see that there is any issue of fact as far as stated....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The Circuit Court thereupon orally granted summary judgment in favor of MSU and the next day memorialized the decision, in which it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">1. Janet Beyer, the Personal Representative, wrongfully expended estate funds in the amount of $40,000 for legal services to Anton J.S. Keating, Esquire, in violation of her fiduciary duty under Md. Estates &amp; Trusts Art. \u00a7 7-101(a) and without prior court approval; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>2. Janet Beyer, the Personal Representative, wrongfully expended estate funds in the amount of $13,309.58 for extraordinary expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Beyer filed a timely appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, wherein she challenged the subject matter jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to hear the appeal, arguing that the September 9 and September 11, 1998 Orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court were not appealable orders, and asserting that the Circuit Court erred in vacating the Orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court by granting summary judgment to MSU. <em>See Beyer v. Morgan State University, </em>139 Md.App. 609, 613, 779 A.2d 388, 390-91 (2001). The Court of Special Appeals held that the Order granting Beyer\u2019s Fees Petition on September 9, 1998, and the Order granting Beyer\u2019s Expenses Petition on September 11, 1998, constituted final appealable judgments of the Orphans\u2019 Court pursuant to Section 12-502(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, so that the Circuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction over MSU\u2019s timely filed appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 632-33, 779 A.2d at 401-02; Md.Code, \u00a7 12-502(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">With regard to Beyer\u2019s contention that the Circuit Court erred in vacating the Orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court premised on MSU\u2019s oral motion for summary judgment, the Court of Special Appeals concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Beyer had used money from the Estate to pay the legal fees of the attorney working on the tort claim prior to receiving approval from the Orphans\u2019 Court in violation of her fiduciary duties as Personal Representative of Betty Keat\u2019s Estate. <em>See Beyer, </em>139 Md.App. at 639, 779 A.2d at 406. The intermediate appellate court did find, however, that the Circuit Court erred in failing to make evidentiary findings as to whether the expenses for which Petitioner sought payment approval were extraordinary expenses which could be paid from Estate funds because the evidence was in dispute. <em>See id. </em>at 641, 779 A.2d at 407.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in part, and reversed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>part the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and remanded the matter for consideration of the legitimacy of the expenses approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court in its Order of September 11,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We granted a petition for a writ of certiorari in this case, 367 Md. 86, 785 A.2d 1290 (2001), to consider the following questions presented by Beyer, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City had subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal pursuant to Maryland Code, Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.) about the September 9 and September 11,1998 Orders entered by the Orphans\u2019 Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to vacate the September 9, 1998 Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court granting payment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to an oral motion for summary judgment?<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Beyer argues that because MSU, an interested party to the Estate, did not receive notice of the Expenses and Fees Petitions pursuant to Section 7-502(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article, the subsequent order of the Orphans\u2019 Court granting the petition was not a final judgment for purposes of triggering the appellate provisions of Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Rather, Beyer contends that because MSU did not receive notice, its appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>remedies were limited to challenging the order granting attorney\u2019s fees under the procedures set forth in Section 7-502(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article and Maryland Rule 6-416(a)(5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> What Beyer is attempting to do is take advantage of her own failure to act appropriately as the Personal Representative by bolting the door to the Circuit Court to MSU; with this we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Our analysis begins with an examination and interpretation of Section 7-502 of the Estates and Trusts Article and related Maryland Rule 6-416, governing notice of proposed payments from the Estate to the Personal Representative or an attorney, as well as Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and related Maryland Rule 6-463 concerning appeals to the Circuit Court from judgments rendered in the Orphans\u2019 Court. The principal goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislative intent behind the enactment. <em>See Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. Brennen, </em>366 Md. 336, 349, 783 A.2d 691, 699 (2001); <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645, 654 (2001); <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). The statutory language serves as the primary source for determining legislative intent. <em>See Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 731 (1986). Where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry is at an end. <em>See Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 212, 783 A.2d 194, 200 (2001); <em>Board of License Comm\u2019rs for Charles County v. Toye, </em>354 Md. 116, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>122, 729 A.2d 407, 410 (1999). Where the statutory language is ambiguous, we read it within the context of the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>See In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001); <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997). Thus, the provisions must be read from \u201ca commonsensical perspective to avoid a farfetched interpretation.\u201d <em>Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">These principles applied to statutory interpretation are identical to those used to interpret the Maryland Rules. <em>See Pickett v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>365 Md. 67, 78, 775 A.2d 1218, 1224 (2001); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 265, 757 A.2d 796, 804 (2000)(\u201cIf the words of. the rule are plain and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule.\u201d); <em>Marsheck v. Bd. of Trustees of the Fire and Police Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys. of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 402-03, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000)(interpreting the Baltimore City Code and explaining that the Court need not look beyond the text when the words used are plain and unambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">When Beyer was appointed as Personal Representative of her sister\u2019s Estate, she undertook to perform the following duties, as set forth in Maryland Code, Section 7-101 of the Estates and Trusts Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">(a) <em>Fiduciary responsibility. </em>\u2014 A personal representative is a fiduciary. He is under a general duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of the will and the estates of decedents law as expeditiously and with as little sacrifice of value as is reasonable under the circumstances. He shall use the authority conferred upon him by the estates of decedents law, by the terms of the will, by orders in proceedings to which he is party, and by the equitable principles generally applicable to fiduciaries, fairly considering the interests of all interested persons and creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">(b) <em>Time for distribution. </em>\u2014 Unless the time of distribution is extended by order of court for good cause shown, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>personal representative shall distribute all the assets of the estate of which he has taken possession or control within the time provided in \u00a7 7-805 for rendering his first account,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alc-dedup-0\">(c) <em>Exoneration for certain payments. </em>\u2014 The personal representative does not incur any personal liability by his payment of claims or distribution of assets even if he does not consider claims for injuries to the person prosecuted under the provisions of \u00a7 8-103(e) or \u00a7 8-104, if at the time of payment or distribution:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">(1) He had no actual knowledge of the claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">(2) The plaintiff had not filed on time his claim with the register.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Thus, we must first determine whether Beyer in her capacity as Personal Representative for the Estate of Betty Y. Keat breached a fiduciary duty owed to the Estate by disbursing attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered allegedly on behalf of the Estate prior to providing notice of such payment to MSU, an interested person, and prior to receiving approval by the Orphans\u2019 Court for such expenditures. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 7-502 of the Est. &amp; Trusts Art.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">A Personal Representative owes a duty to the beneficiaries of a will to act in the best interests of the Estate. <em>See Ferguson v. Cramer, </em>349 Md. 760, 769, 709 A.2d 1279, 1283-84 (1998). In fulfilling this duty, the Personal Representative is obligated to exhibit the following qualities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">1. The exercise of the care, skill and diligence of a reasonably prudent person dealing with his or her own property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">2. The exercise of good faith and loyalty to all the beneficiaries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">3. The lack of self-dealing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">4. The exercise of reasonable watchfulness over investments; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">5. The maintenance of full, accurate and precise records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJy\"><em>Kann v. Kann, </em>344 Md. 689, 708, 690 A.2d 509, 518 (1997)(quoting A.J. Gibber, Gibber on Estate Administration, at 3-1 (3d ed.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>It is undisputed that neither Beyer acting in her capacity as Personal Representative of the Estate nor Allen or Briscoe as attorneys for the Estate, nor Keating filed the requisite Fees Petition for the work allegedly performed by Keating in the survival action prior to Keating\u2019s receipt of payment of those fees. Nevertheless, Beyer reasons that, \u201c[i]f the attorney\u2019s fees would have been properly payable had preapproval payments not been made by [Beyer], then the breach of fiduciary duty resulted in no loss to the Estate.\u201d We simply cannot accept Beyer\u2019s no harm, no foul argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">When filing a petition for attorney\u2019s fees, the Personal Representative of an estate is required to give written notice to all interested persons. Such notice sets forth the amount requested from the estate and the basis for that request, and alerts interested persons that they may make a request for a hearing within 20 days of the notice being sent. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 7-502(a) of the Est. &amp; Trusts Art. As \u201c[a] legatee in being, not fully paid\u201d based on the bequest contained in Keat\u2019s will, MSU qualified as an \u201cinterested person\u201d for purposes of the notice provision of Section 7-502(a). <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 1-101(i)(3) of the Est. &amp; Trusts Art. The procedure for giving notice to interested persons of a petition for attorney\u2019s fees is set forth in Maryland Rule 6-416(a)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(3) Notice. The personal representative shall serve on each unpaid creditor who has filed a claim and on each interested person a copy of the petition accompanied by a notice in the following form:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">NOTICE OF PETITION FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES OR PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE\u2019S COMMISSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">You are hereby notified that a petition for allowance of attorney\u2019s fees or personal representative\u2019s commissions has been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">You have 20 days after service of the petition within which to file written exceptions and to request a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">Furthermore, the rule provides that \u201c[u]pon the filing of a petition, the court, by order, shall allow attorney\u2019s fees or personal representative\u2019s commissions <em>as it considers appro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>priate, </em>subject to any exceptions.\u201d Md. Rule 6 \u2014 416(a)(4) (emphasis added). The decision to allow attorney\u2019s fees is dependent upon the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to approve all, some, or none of the requested fees. <em>See Dessel v. Goldman, </em>231 Md. 428, 431, 190 A.2d 633, 635 (1963)(explaining that in allowing payment of attorney\u2019s fees from an estate, \u201cthe court must exercise sound judgment and discretion, basing its determination upon the evidence offered for its instruction and guidance and a consideration of the tests held generally applicable in fixing the size of a fee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Fees Petition failed to alert the Orphans\u2019 Court to the fact that funds already had been taken out of the Estate to pay Keating prior to receiving court approval for those expenditures. The first accounting for the Estate filed with the Register of Wills on September 9, 1997, however, reveals that as early as January 20, 1996, Beyer wrote a check from her own account in the amount of $500 to an investigator hired in relation to the survival action and subsequently reimbursed herself from the Estate without the Court\u2019s permission. Similarly, Beyer paid Keating a total of $30,000 in attorney\u2019s fees from the Estate for a period covering January 18, 1996 to September 10, 1996, more than two years before receiving approval for the payment of fees from the Orphans\u2019 Court. Due to Beyer\u2019s omission of information in the Fees Petition that these payments had been made, the Orphans\u2019 Court approved payment of the attorney\u2019s fees without knowledge of her violation of the dictates of Section 7-502(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article. Beyer\u2019s actions show a lack of good faith and loyalty towards MSU as a specific legatee of the Estate in breach of the fiduciary duty entrusted to her as Personal Representative of Keat\u2019s Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We turn now to the statutory provisions governing appeals from final judgments of the Orphans\u2019 Court and their applicability to the instant case. A party may take an appeal from \u201ca judgment of the court\u201d to either \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals of Maryland pursuant to Code, Courts Article, \u00a7 12-501,\u201d or with the exception of Harford and Montgomery Counties, \u201cto the circuit court for the county pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Code, Courts Article, \u00a7 12-502.\u201d Md. Rule 6^163. We have explained that \u201c[a] final judgment is any judgment or order which is \u2018so far final as to determine and conclude the rights involved in the action, or to deny to the party seeking redress by the appeal the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of. the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grimberg v. Marth, </em>338 Md. 546, 551, 659 A.2d 1287, 1290 (1995)(quoting <em>In re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. 424, 427, 125 A. 177, 178 (1924)).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Petitioner argues that the September 9 and September 11, 1998 Orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court, which approved the payment of $30,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to Keating from the Estate and overruled MSU\u2019s exceptions to the Expenses Petition, were not final judgments which would permit MSU to file an appeal with the Circuit Court under Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In support of this argument, Beyer attempts to extend our decision in <em>Radcliff v. Vance, </em>360 Md. 277, 757 A.2d 812 (2000), to require that an interested person who is not properly served with notice of a petition for attorney\u2019s fees must file a motion to vacate the Order of the Orphans\u2019 Court granting such fees because the \u201csubstantial irregularity\u201d caused by improper service of notice on an interested party prevents the order from being final. In its counterargument, however, MSU states, <em>\u201cRadcliff </em>simply stands for the unremarkable proposition that when a party does not receive proper notice of an orphans\u2019 court order, there is \u2018substantial irregularity\u2019 sufficient to vacate the order.\u201d We agree with MSU\u2019s assessment of the applicability of <em>Radcliff </em>to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In <em>Radcliff, </em>an interested person to an estate who did not receive notice of a petition for attorney\u2019s fees prior to the issuance of an order from the Orphans\u2019 Court approving payment of the fees challenged the court\u2019s decision by filing a petition to revoke the order with the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>Id. </em>at 283-84, 757 A.2d at 815. We concluded that because the interested person had not received notice of the petition for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Section 7-502(a) of the Estates and Trusts Article, there was a \u201csubstantial irregularity\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>proceeding which prevented the interested person from opposing the petition for attorney\u2019s fees prior to entrance of the order to pay by the Orphans\u2019 Court. <em>Id. </em>at 292-93, 757 A.2d at 820 (\u201cAn irregularity is a failure to follow required process or procedure.\u201d) In reaching this conclusion, we stated that because the interested person had not received the required notice, the order was not \u201cfinal and binding upon\u201d her. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 757 A.2d at 820. This finality language, however, cannot be manipulated <em>against </em>the position of an interested person who did not receive notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Section 7-502(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article provides that \u201c[ujnless there was fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity in the proceeding, or a request for a hearing is filed within 20 days of the sending of the notice, any action taken by the court on the petition is final and binding on all persons to whom the notice was given\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added). In the instant case, MSU did not file exceptions within twenty days of the issuance of the September 9, 3998 order granting payment of attorney\u2019s fees to Keating. Thus, for purposes of Section 7-502(b), Beyer\u2019s breach of the fiduciary duty owed to the Estate in her capacity as Personal Representative, along with the failed notice of the Fees Petition to MSU could constitute \u201csubstantial irregularit[iesj.\u201d We agree, however, with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">The language of ET \u00a7 7-502(b) and Md. Rule 6M16(c) cannot be interpreted reasonably to mean that unless and until proper notice is given, an order granting a petition for payment of attorney\u2019s fees (or a personal representative\u2019s commission) is not final for purposes of appeal. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>[Beyer\u2019s] reading of the pertinent language of ET \u00a7 7-502(b), an order granting such a petition would at one time be final as to creditors and interested parties who received proper notice and non-final as to those who did not; and that would be the case in the absence of any challenge to the order on that basis. This interpretation is practicably unworkable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><em>Beyer, </em>139 Md.App. at 631, 779 A.2d at 401. Thus, while it is true that MSU <em>could have </em>elected to file a motion to vacate the September 9 and September 11, 1998 orders in the Orphans\u2019 Court based on the \u201csubstantial irregularity\u201d in the proceedings, Section 7-502(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article <em>does not mandate </em>that an aggrieved interested person or creditor pursue this avenue of relief as adverse to any other avenue available when it did not receive notice from the very party who would seek to bar the door to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Beyer asserts that our decision in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Owrutsky, </em>322 Md. 334, 587 A.2d 511 (1991), upon which the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals based their decisions that she breached her fiduciary duty as Personal Representative, is \u201cnot on all fours with this case.\u201d In <em>Owrutsky, </em>we emphatically declared that an attorney \u201chas no right to [estate] funds, either as a commission or as an attorney\u2019s fee, unless and until an approval pursuant to \u00a7 7-601 or \u00a7 7-602 of the Estates and Trusts Article ... has been obtained from the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 587 A.2d at 516. We admonished that \u201c[appropriating any part of [estate] funds to [the attorney or Personal Representative\u2019s] own use and benefit without clear authority to do so cannot be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 587 A.2d at 516. The Court of Special Appeals likewise chastised petitioner in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">[Beyer] had no authority or discretion to use Estate funds to pay Keating\u2019s legal fee, to her personal benefit, without the prior approval of the orphans\u2019 court. Her conduct, like that of the lawyer in <em>Owrutsky, </em>amounted to an appropriation of Estate funds in clear violation of her fiduciary duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Beyer v. Morgan State University, </em>139 Md.App. at 639, 779 A.2d at 406. The <em>Owrutsky </em>analogy is extremely apt here, where the petitioner breached her fiduciary duty to give notice and secure approval before expending estate assets. <em>See </em>Md.Code, \u00a7 7-101(a) of the Est. <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Art. (mandating that Personal Representatives are fiduciaries, and as such, they must \u201cfairly consider! ] the interests of all interested persons and creditors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The premise of giving notice to parties having an interest in a particular piece of litigation is to prevent such parties from being bound by the determinations of the court where they did not have an opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>land Rule 6 \u2014 416(a)(6) clearly states, \u201c[i]f timely exceptions are not filed, the order of the court allowing the attorney\u2019s fees or personal representative\u2019s commissions becomes final.\u201d Beyer indicates a desire to force MSU into a catch-22 that was created by Beyer, whereby MSU did not receive adequate notice of the Expenses and Fees Petitions from Beyer or her attorneys acting on her behalf, and yet where the failure to receive notice would bar MSU from seeking an available avenue of redress through an appeal to the Circuit Court. To permit such a conundrum would be an obfuscation of the rules by allowing noncompliance with procedural safeguards to benefit the wrongdoer. We decline to read into the statutory framework an intention to force parties who have not received the requisite notice to file motions to vacate orders of the Orphans\u2019 Court prior to exercising their statutory remedies under Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Rule 6-463 to appeal the final judgment of the Orphans\u2019 Court to the Circuit Court. <em>See Taylor, </em>365 Md. at 181, 776 A.2d at 654 (\u201cWe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Therefore, we find that under the facts of this case, MSU was not required to file a motion to vacate the September 9 and September 11,1998 Orders in the Orphans\u2019 Court prior to seeking an appeal in the Circuit Court pursuant to Section 12-502 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Rule 6-463. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City properly had subject matter jurisdiction over MSU\u2019s appeal. We will not permit personal representatives or their attorneys the luxury of controlling an interested person\u2019s appellate remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>through their own misfeasance. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">B. Grant of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Beyer urges this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals by asserting that MSU failed to make a motion for summary judgment that was appropriate, because the motion was made orally rather than through a formal filing of pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e) states that \u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The rule does not contain any language which would require a written motion. In fact, oral motions are permitted expressly by Maryland Rule 2-311(a), which provides \u201cAn application to the court for an order shall be by motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.\u201d <em>See Crews v. Hollen-bach, </em>358 Md. 627, 638, 751 A.2d 481, 487 (2000)(discussing the trial court\u2019s decision to grant both motions for summary judgment which were filed in writing by two parties in advance of a hearing, as well as the oral motions for summary judgment submitted by three other parties at the hearing). Therefore, the form of the motion complied with the rules; the only issue is whether the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to grant the motion was legally correct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We review a lower court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. See Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>368 Md. 434, 443, 795 A.2d 715, 720 (2002). In so doing, we must determine whether there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>dispute over a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206, 209 (2001). Where there are no genuine disputes as to material facts, we must determine whether the Circuit Court was legally correct in granting MSU\u2019s oral motion for summary judgment. <em>See Maryland Dept. of the Environment v. Underwood, </em>368 Md. 160, 171, 792 A.2d 1130, 1136 (2002); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118, 127 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the transcript of the hearing before the Circuit Court shows that there was no genuine dispute of material facts between the parties, that the last of Beyer\u2019s four payments to Keating came at least fifteen months before the Orphans\u2019 Court granted approval for payment of those fees, and that MSU did not receive notice of the Fees Petition, all of which violated Section 7-502 of the Estates and Trusts Article. Accordingly, the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to grant MSU\u2019s motion for summary judgment and vacate the September 9, 1998,- Order allowing the payment of attorney\u2019s fees from the Estate was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">.

Keat returned home and hurled a few more bottles from the third-floor window of her home. A neighbor called the police for assistance. Several officers responded and entered Keat's home through the only point of entry, a window.
