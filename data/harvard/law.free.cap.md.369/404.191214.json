On September 25, 2001, the Attorney Grievance Commission, acting pursuant to Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Rule 16-709(a), filed a petition for disciplinary action against respondent, charging numerous violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), including MRPC 1.2 (Scope of representation),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MRPC 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MRPC 1.4 (Communication),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MRPC 1.15 (Safekeeping property),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>MRPC 8.1 (Bar admission and disciplinary matters),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and MRPC 8.4(a)(b)(c) &amp; (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The charges involved the complaints of Gertrude Baskerville, Linda Harten, and Bar Counsel. This Court referred the complaint to Judge William D. Quarles of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a hearing to determine findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The hearing before Judge Quarles was held on January 14, 2002. Respondent failed to appear at the hearing. Bar Counsel introduced excerpts of the transcripts from the Inquiry Panel hearings and Requests for Admissions of Facts and Genuineness of Documents in evidence. Judge Quarles found by clear and convincing evidence that Angst\u2019s conduct constituted violations of Rules 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a)(b), 1.15(b), 8.1(a)(b) and 8.4(a)(b)(c) and (d) of the MRPC. Neither party took exception to Judge Quarles\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Respondent did not appear at oral argument before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Judge Quarles\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>BC Docket No. 2000-213-3-9</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUx\">\n<em>Complaint of Gertrude Baskerville</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8h\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">In the matter of the complaint of Gertrude Baskerville, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rules 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a)(b), 8.1(a)(b) and 8.4(a)(c) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by his inaction and neglect in preparing and filing the late David Matthews\u2019 quit claim deed, transferring 1305 North Linwood Avenue to Mr. Matthews\u2019 daughter, Gertrude Baskerville and his granddaughter, Rachael Baskerville.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">On or about August 26, 1998, Respondent met with the late David Matthews at his residence and was retained to prepare a quit claim deed transferring 1305 North Linwood Avenue to Mr. Matthews\u2019 daughter, Gertrude Baskerville and his granddaughter, Rachael Baskerville. At the time Respondent was retained, Matthews was ill and had undergone treatment for cancer. Respondent charged and was paid a flat fee of $200 to prepare and file the quit claim deed. In early November 1998, Respondent met with Matthews at his residence and had him execute the quit claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>deed dated September 8, 1998. Thereafter Respondent never recorded the quit claim deed at the Land Records Office in Baltimore City. Joyce Somerville, Matthews\u2019 significant other, made numerous telephone calls on behalf of Matthews regarding the status of the filing of the quit claim deed. Respondent failed to return Somerville\u2019s telephone calls. Respondent had the signatures of Matthews and Somerville notarized in his office on or about March 26, 1999, four months after the quit claim deed had been executed and just prior to giving Somerville a copy of the deed. At the time of Matthews\u2019 death on April 10, 1999, Respondent had not recorded the quit claim deed and had lost the original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Petitioner\u2019s Investigator, Sterling H. Fletcher, spoke with Respondent concerning the recording of the late Matthews\u2019 deed. Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Fletcher that he had recorded the deed. Therefore by letters dated December 7, 1999 and December 27, 1999, Respondent was asked to provide the date when the deed was recorded and copies of any receipts for that recording to the Office of Bar Counsel. Respondent never responded to those, letters. Thereafter Mr. Fletcher left telephone messages for Respondent on January 12, January 24, January 27 and February 1, 2000 to schedule an interview with Respondent and review his file on Matthews. However Respondent never returned those telephone messages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">An Inquiry Panel was convened on August 8, 2000. Respondent failed to appear at that hearing and misrepresented to the Panel by telephone conference call that he had never received notice of that hearing. The hearing was rescheduled for November 20, 2000 and at that hearing, Respondent admitted that he did receive notice of the Inquiry Panel\u2019s August 8, 2000 hearing. However he did not open the notice letter. Further, Respondent misrepresented to the Office of Bar Counsel that the Matthews\u2019 file had been closed and was in storage at his home when, in fact, it had never left his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">By his conduct, Respondent violated all the Rules of Professional Conduct charged by Petitioner in the Petition for Disciplinary Action. Respondent failed to abide by the scope of the representation, in violation of Rule 1.2(a) by failing to record Matthews\u2019 quit claim deed. Respondent\u2019s failure to record Matthews\u2019 quit claim deed and thereafter losing the original demonstrates a lack of diligence in violation of Rule 1.3. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a)(b) by failing to communicate with Matthews and keep him informed of the status of his matter, despite repeated efforts by Matthews\u2019 significant other to speak with him. Respondent\u2019s misrepresentation to the Inquiry Panel on August 8, 2000 that he had not received notice of the hearing when, in fact, he had but had chosen not to open the notice, was in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Further, Respondent\u2019s misrepresentation to Bar Counsel\u2019s Investigator that the Matthews deed had been recorded when, in fact, it had not and the misrepresentation that the Matthews file was in storage at his home when it was still in his office violated Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c). Further, Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) by his wilful failure to respond to Petitioner\u2019s letters. Respondent\u2019s conduct throughout the handling of the Matthews\u2019 quit claim deed matter and his conduct with Petitioner violated Rule 8.4(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>BC Docket No. 2001-24-4-9</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APd\">\n<em>Complaint of Linda Harten</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY_\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">In the matter of the complaint of Bar Counsel, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rules 8.4(d) and 8.1(b) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to pay Davis and Harten Reporting Company (hereinafter referred to as Davis and Harten) and by failing to respond to the Office of Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">In 1999 Respondent represented Patricia Land in a civil suit against Kevin Huck. On March 16, 1999 Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ordered the deposition of Patricia Land from Davis and Harten. By invoice dated March 28, 1999 Respondent was billed by Davis and Harten $88.60 for a copy of Land\u2019s deposition. Respondent did not pay the $88.60 bill. On or about March 31, 1999 Respondent retained Davis and Har-ten to take the deposition of Kevin Huck and ordered a copy of the deposition of Wendy Schuller. By invoice dated April 16, 1999, Davis and Harten billed Respondent $165.10 for the deposition of Huck and a copy of the Schuller deposition. Respondent did not pay the $165.10 due to Davis and Harten. On April 12, 1999, Respondent ordered a copy of the deposition of Dr. Edward F. Aulisi from Davis and Harten. By invoice dated April 30, 1999, Respondent was billed $30.40 for Aulisi\u2019s deposition. Respondent did not pay the $30.40 bill. Although Davis and Harten provided copies of depositions ordered by Respondent and took the deposition of Huck, Respondent did not pay Davis and Harten\u2019s bills. Therefore Davis and Harten filed suit against Respondent in the District Court of Maryland for Anne Arundel County for failure to pay their bills. On April 28, 2000, -the District Court of Maryland for Anne Arundel County entered an Affidavit Judgment in favor of Davis and Harten in the amount of $284.10, plus costs of $40 against Respondent. As of the Inquiry Panel hearing held on May 31, 2001, Respondent had not paid that judgment entered against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">By letters dated July 18 and August 4, 2000, Respondent was asked to provide a written response to the Office of Bar Counsel concerning the judgment entered against him in favor of Davis and Harten. Respondent did not respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s letters of July 18 and August 4, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">By his conduct Respondent violated all the Rules of Professional Conduct alleged by Petitioner. Respondent\u2019s failure to pay Davis and Harten for providing copies of the Land, Schuller and Aulisi depositions as well as his failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to pay the bill for taking the deposition of Huck was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d). Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for a written response concerning the judgment entered against him in favor of Davis and Harten was in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">\n<em>BC Docket No. 2001-77-3-9</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aur\">\n<em>Complaint of Bar Counsel</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuL\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">In the matter of the complaint of Bar Counsel, Petitioner alleges that Respondent violated Rules 1.15(b), 8.1(a)(b) and 8.4(b)(c)(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to withhold and maintain employee withholding income taxes in trust, failing to pay withheld income tax monies to the Comptroller of the Treasury (hereinafter referred to as Comptroller), failing to file returns, and failing to maintain a separate ledger account for the with-holdings as required by \u00a7 10-906(c) of the Tax General Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Since February 1998 Respondent has maintained an office for the practice of law. In June 1998 at Respondent\u2019s request, the Comptroller of the Treasury of the State of Maryland opened an employee withholding tax account in the name of \u201cthe law offices of Gregory S. Angst\u201d, effective March 2, 1998. Respondent\u2019s withholding account was placed on a quarterly filing and a quarterly payment schedule for Maryland income taxes withheld from Respondent\u2019s employees\u2019 wages. Respondent did not pay his quarterly withholding taxes for the year 1998. Respondent failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>file an MW-508 form which is the end of year reconciliation and the W-2s to be attached for each employee for the year 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">In 1999 Respondent\u2019s filing status was changed to annual filing. Respondent through a telephone conversation with the Comptroller gave the actual tax due for 1998. However, Respondent failed to file a return and pay the amount due. By a telephone call of August 24, 1998 Respondent informed the Comptroller that he would contact his accountant and would call back the next day concerning the delinquent withholding tax payment. The Comptroller did not receive a return telephone call from Respondent on August 25,1998 and another call was placed to Respondent on September 8, 1998. The Comptroller left two further telephone messages on February 5 and March 25, 1999 without a return call from Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">On April 16, 1999 the Comptroller was able to speak to Respondent by telephone at which time Respondent indicated he would file his employee withholding tax returns that week. However, Respondent did not do so. The Comptroller left telephone messages at Respondent\u2019s office on May 20 and June 3, 1999. However Respondent did not return those telephone calls. By letter dated June 7, 1999 the Comptroller sent a delinquent notice to Respondent to which Respondent did not respond. In a telephone conversation of July 29, 1999, Respondent indicated to the Comptroller that he would call back. However he did not do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">On September 17, 1999 the [C]omptroller left another message with Respondent\u2019s office. On January 28, 2000, the Comptroller spoke with Respondent by telephone and advised that because of his failure to file and pay employee withholding taxes, they would have to file a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission. That conversation led Respondent to call the Comptroller back on February 1, 2000 at which time he gave the Comptroller the quarterly breakdown for his 1998 returns and gave the figure for his December 1999 returns. By check dated February 1, 2000 drawn on the account of Gregory Scott Angst, Attorney at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Law, Respondent paid $749.80 to the Comptroller for the taxes for the entire year of 1998 and submitted his quarterly MW-506 forms for the year 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">On March 9, 2000, the Comptroller called Respondent and left a message concerning the 1999 employee withholding returns and taxes to be paid. On March 10, 2000 the Comptroller heard from Respondent who indicated that he would file the delinquent return and pay the amount due. However Respondent did not do so. By telephone conversation on May 10, 2000 Respondent indicated to the Comptroller that he would have his accountant check his records and call them back by May 12, 2000. However the Comptroller did not hear from Respondent nor his accountant. On July 11, 2000 the Comptroller filed a Notice of Lien of Judgment for unpaid taxes against the law office of Gregory S. Angst in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Comptroller claimed a lien for delinquent and unpaid taxes in the amount of $1,068.61, plus interest of $74.65 and penalty of $192.09 for a total of $1,335.35. On or about September 13, 2000 the Comptroller received payment from Respondent and released their lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">As of the date of the Inquiry Panel hearing held on May 31, 2001 Respondent\u2019s employee withholding tax account was delinquent for his December 2000 return. The Comptroller had not received the withholding tax payment for the year 2000 nor did Respondent file the proper returns for that year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">Since 1998, Respondent has filed Maryland withholding tax returns late, has failed to file Maryland tax returns and has failed to pay trust fund income taxes withheld from his employees\u2019 wages to the Comptroller. From March 1998 through May 31, 2001, Respondent failed to fulfil his statutory obligations as an employer to withhold employees\u2019 state income taxes and to pay the appropriate amounts to the Comptroller. Respondent\u2019s actions and omissions violated \u00a7 10-906(a) of the Tax General Article. From March 1998 through May 31, 2001, Respondent failed to withhold and maintain income taxes in trust for the state as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u00a7 10-906(b) of the Tax General Article,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> failed to maintain a separate ledger account for withholdings as required by \u00a7 10-906(c) of the Tax General Article<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and regularly failed to file income tax withholding returns as required by \u00a7 10-817 of the Tax General Article.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">On August 23, 2000 Respondent misrepresented to Bar Counsel Investigator, Sterling H. Fletcher, that he had taken care of the Comptroller\u2019s lien when, in fact, it was not paid until September 13, 2000. By letters dated September 6 and October 6, 2000 Respondent was asked to provide a written response to the Office of Bar Counsel concerning the Comptroller\u2019s tax lien. Respondent did not respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s letters of September 6 and October 6, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\n<em>Conclusions of law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">By his conduct Respondent violated all the Rules of Professional Conduct alleged by Petitioner. Respondent\u2019s failure to withhold and maintain employee withholding income taxes in trust for the state as required by \u00a7 10 \u2014 906(b) of the Tax General Article and his failure to maintain a separate ledger account for the withholdings as required by \u00a7 10-906(c) of the Tax General Article violated Rule 1.15(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Further, Respondent\u2019s failure to fulfil his statutory obligations as an employer to withhold employees\u2019 state income taxes and to pay the appropriate amounts owed to the Comptroller from March 1998 through May 31, 2001 as well as his failure to file the appropriate returns when due, violated Rules 8.4(b)(c) and (d). Further, Respondent violated Rule 8.1(a) when on August 23, 2000 he misrepresented to Bar Counsel\u2019s Investigator that he had taken care of the Comptroller\u2019s lien when, in fact, it was not paid until September 13, 2000. Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the Office of Bar Counsel\u2019s letters of September 6 and October 6, 2000 is in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">In summary this Court finds that Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.2(a), 1.3,1.4(a)(b), 1.15(b), 8.1(a)(b) and 8.4(a)(b)(c) and (d) in connection with the three matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Neither party filed exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The only issue that remains is the appropriate sanction to apply under the facts and circumstances of this case. We have explained that \u201cthe purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 289, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002)(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 760-61, 736 A.2d 339, 343 (1999)). Thus by sanctioning errant attorneys we seek to \u201cpromote reliability and veracity in the legal profession and to deter other attorneys from committing violations of the MRPC.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 274, 793 A.2d 515, 534 (2002); <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jeter, </em>365 Md. 279, 290, 778 A.2d 390, 396 (2001)(\u201c[A] sanction is imposed to demonstrate to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated.\u201d). The severity of the sanction depends upon the nature and extent of the attorney\u2019s misconduct in a given case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>396, 794 A.2d 92, 105 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 568, 745 A.2d 1037, 1044 (2000)(noting \u201c[t]he gravity of misconduct is not measured solely by the number of rules broken but is determined largely by the lawyer\u2019s conduct\u201d)(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Milliken, </em>348 Md. 486, 519, 704 A.2d 1225, 1241); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 300, 614 A.2d 102, 114 (1992)(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 680, 496 A.2d 672, 680 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Bar Counsel seeks respondent\u2019s disbarment. In support of the recommendation for disbarment, Bar Counsel cites the American Bajr Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, \u00a7\u00a7 4.41, 9.21, and 9.22 (1991, 1992 Amendments). Section 4.41 states that disbarment is generally appropriate in cases involving the lawyer\u2019s failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">(a) a lawyer abandons the practice and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(b) a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">(c) a lawyer engages in a pattern of neglect with respect to client matters and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The ABA defines aggravating circumstances as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">9.21 <em>Definition. </em>Aggravation or aggravating circumstances are any considerations, or factors that may justify an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">9.22 <em>Factors which may be considered in aggravation. </em>Aggravating factors include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">(c) a pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">(h) vulnerability of victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">(i) subst\u00e1ntial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(j) indifference to making restitution</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">(k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">We previously considered similar factors in determining whether disbarment was an appropriate disciplinary sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, </em>368 Md. 419, 431, 795 A.2d 706, 711 (2002); <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 397, 794 A.2d at 105; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Mr. Matthews enlisted respondent\u2019s legal services in the uncomplicated preparation and filing of a quit claim deed transferring title of Matthews\u2019 property at 1305 North Linwood Avenue to his daughter, complainant Gertrude Baskerville, and granddaughter. Respondent had Matthews execute the deed, but never recorded it and lost the original. Mr. Matthews, who was very ill with cancer at the time he employed respondent to handle the execution and filing of the deed, died believing that his property had been transferred to his daughter and granddaughter. Thereafter, when Ms. Baskerville complained to the Attorney Grievance Commission, respondent engaged in a series of efforts to avoid inquiries from Bar Counsel concerning this matter. Respondent\u2019s conduct constitutes an abandonment of his representation of Mr. Matthews, which resulted in injury to Ms. Baskerville and her daughter who were adversely affected by the respondent\u2019s failure to transfer title to the property. The inexcusable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>neglect of work in the Matthews case coupled with respondent\u2019s attempts to conceal his neglect from Matthews\u2019 family and from Bar Counsel warrants sanction, the severity of which is aggravated by the other complaints filed with the Attorney Grievance Commission. <em>See Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 431, 795 A.2d at 712 (finding disbarment to be the appropriate sanction given the attorney\u2019s \u201ccontinuing disregard for the attorney grievance process, his apparent indifference to the tenets of his chosen profession, the dereliction of his duties to his client, and his ostensible lack of remorse for his misconduct\u201d); <em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545 (stating that although the attorney did not have a prior disciplinary record, the attorney\u2019s \u201clack of diligence, his lack of preparation, his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations\u201d and failure to respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel warranted disbarment).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Furthermore, respondent failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel with regard to all three complaints filed against him by failing to respond in a timely fashion to numerous letters from Bar Counsel, by neglecting to appear at a hearing before the Inquiry Panel on August 8, 2000, and by claiming he was unaware of the Inquiry Panel hearing because of a failure to receive notice. At the rescheduled hearing before the Inquiry Panel on November 20, 2000, however, respondent acknowledged that, in fact, he had received notification of the earlier hearing. Respondent\u2019s deceptiveness and unresponsiveness were not limited to his interactions with Bar Counsel; rather, respondent made various and assorted promises in his capacity as an attorney to all three complainants which were unfulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We also must take into consideration respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct in neglecting his statutory tax obligation pursuant to Maryland Code (1988, 1997 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) Section 10-906 and Section 10-817 of the Tax General Article. Respondent engaged in a repeated pattern of delinquency, commencing in 1998, by failing to make the appropriate employee withholding tax payments, by failing to file withholding tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>returns and pay trust fund income taxes for the monies withheld from respondent\u2019s employees\u2019 salaries. Respondent treated the delinquency notices and other inquiries from the Comptroller with the same degree of neglect he exhibited towards Bar Counsel, forcing the Comptroller to resort to filing a Notice of Lien of Judgment. Such conduct exemplifies respondent\u2019s lack of honesty and proclivity for engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Atkinson, </em>357 Md. 646, 655-56, 745 A.2d 1086, 1091 (2000) (explaining that the errant attorney need not be convicted of tax evasion in order to support a finding of dishonest conduct in violation of MRPC 8.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We recently iterated the unparalleled importance of honesty in the practice of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\"><em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 646, 790 A.2d 621, 628 (2002)(quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001)). In the present matter, respondent\u2019s dishonest and evasive conduct clearly evidence his lack of fitness to continue in the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In considering the facts and circumstances of this case in light in the context of the mandates of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, we believe that respondent\u2019s lack of diligence in representing Mr. Matthews in the execution and recording of the deed, his inattentiveness to the management of his law practice, his dishonesty and deceitfulness with regard to his interactions with all three complainants, and his uncooperativeness with Bar Counsel warrant his removal from the practice of law. Respondent has demonstrated an abundant pattern of misconduct as an attorney. <em>See Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 629 (finding disbarment to be the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ate sanction where attorney made \u201crepeated material misrepresentations that constitute a pattern of deceitful conduct, as opposed to an isolated instance\u201d in violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, and 8.4(a)(c) and (d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
