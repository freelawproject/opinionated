After maintaining in two interviews with a detective from the Montgomery County Police Department that the teacher had engaged in such conduct, Petitioner admitted that the allegations were false in a subsequent interview with an investigator for the Montgomery County Public Schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">On 23 October 2000, the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County as a juvenile court <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, found Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>delinquent for making false statements to a police officer which, if she were an adult, would violate Maryland Code (1957,1996 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 150,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for conspiring to cause a false statement to be made to a police officer in violation of that statute. The District Court placed Petitioner on probation with a number of special conditions and ordered her and her parents to pay restitution in the amount of $85, payable to the Department of Juvenile Justice, for ultimate disbursement to the teacher who was the object of the students\u2019 scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, filed on 27 July 2001, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>In re Heather B., </em>366 Md. 273, 783 A.2d 653 (2001), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that Petitioner could violate or conspire to violate Md. Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 150 where there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>no evidence that Petitioner agreed to or did give a false statement that instigated a police investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7\">2. Whether the trial judge should have recused himself after he specifically found that Petitioner was a conspirator at the trial of another alleged conspirator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">On 16 February 2000, Detective Erol Birch of the Montgomery County Police Department initiated an investigation of charges that a male physical education teacher at Roberto Clemente Middle School (\u201cRCMS\u201d) in Montgomery County had abused sexually a number of students.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of his investigation, Detective Birch interviewed the alleged victims and witnesses of the sexual abuse, including Heather B. (Petitioner), who was 12 years old at the time. In her first interview by Detective Birch, which took place on 16 February 2000, Petitioner described a number of instances in which the male teacher inappropriately had touched her and other girls, and stated that he twice had entered the girls\u2019 locker room at the school while students were changing. In addition, Petitioner told Detective Birch that some of the girls reported the instances of the teacher entering the locker room to the physical education in-house resource teacher and another physical education teacher at RCMS. Both of the latter teachers, who are female, denied that the children reported any such incidents to them. On 23 February 2000, Detective Birch conducted a second interview with Petitioner, in which Petitioner reiterated and expanded upon her previous statements regarding the alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>On 1 March 2000, Mr. Miles Alban, an investigator for the Montgomery County Public Schools, began investigating the allegations against the male teacher. According to Mr. Al-ban\u2019s testimony, he noticed \u201cminor inconsistencies\u201d in the \u201cpoint of view statements\u201d prepared by the students involved, which had been obtained by the principal of ROMS. He also was \u201cbothered\u201d by some of the language attributed to the teacher in those statements, which Mr. Alban did not believe was the kind of language an adult \u201cwould use.\u201d After reading those statements, Mr. Alban visited the girls\u2019 locker room at ROMS and spoke to the female instructors to whom some of the students allegedly had reported the locker room intrusions. While at ROMS, he discovered that \u201cit would have been impossible for [the male teacher] to stand\u201d where the students alleged he stood in the locker room, \u201cwithout being seen by one of the female instructors\u201d in the \u201cwomen\u2019s office.\u201d In addition, Mr. Alban also learned in the course of his investigation that, prior to making the allegations of sexual misconduct against the male teacher, some of the involved students had requested to meet with their school counselor regarding problems they were having with the teacher in a classroom setting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">At some point during his investigation, Mr. Alban was notified by his supervisor that one of the students \u201chad changed his story.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On 9 March 2000, Mr. Alban met with Petitioner\u2019s father at ROMS and explained that \u201csome of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>children were changing their stories.\u201d He urged Petitioner\u2019s father \u201cto talk to his daughter,\u201d who was located in a conference room at the school, \u201cand see if he could not ... elicit the truth of what happened.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s father \u201cspent about fifteen minutes\u201d with his daughter, during which she continued to \u201cmaintain!] that the story was true.\u201d At that point, Petitioner\u2019s father left Petitioner and Mr. Alban alone. Under questioning by Mr. Alban, Petitioner admitted that the allegations of sexual misconduct were false. As Mr. Alban testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">1 told [Petitioner], I said, [the teacher] had been teaching thirty years. He was going to lose his job, his wife was going to leave him, and he was going to go to jail. At that point, she said, started crying, said it didn\u2019t happen, I couldn\u2019t tell my father, he\u2019ll ground me, please don\u2019t tell my father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On 12 May 2000, the State of Maryland (Respondent) filed a petition in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Montgomery County as a juvenile court, alleging that \u201con or about\u201d 16 and 23 February 2000, Petitioner, in violation of Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 150,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">did unlawfully and knowingly with intent to deceive, in Montgomery County, Maryland, make and cause to be made a false report, statement and complaint to a Montgomery County police officer, knowing the statement, complaint and report to be false, with the intent to cause an investigation and other action to be taken as a result thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">In addition, the petition also alleged that \u201con or about and between\u201d 1 February and 25 February 2000, Petitioner \u201cdid unlawfully and wilfully\u201d conspire with six other juveniles to commit acts in violation of \u00a7 150. Specifically, the petition maintained that Petitioner conspired with the other students \u201cto make and cause to be made a false report, statement and complaint to a Montgomery County police officer, knowing the same to be false and with intent to deceive and with intent to cause an investigation and other action to be taken as a result thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>On 21 October and 23 October 2000, an adjudicatory hearing was held in the District Court. A number of individuals testified, including two of the juveniles alleged to have conspired with Petitioner. Mirella H. explained that Petitioner asked her if she \u201cwanted to help her tell a lie about [the teacher].\u201d Mirella H. agreed because she \u201cdidn\u2019t like him.\u201d Mirella H. then testified, however, that Petitioner did not tell Mirella H. that what she was saying about the teacher was false. According to Mirella H., she believed that the teacher had touched Petitioner and tho\u00faght that Petitioner was asking her to help because \u201c[Petitioner] knew that [she] didn\u2019t like him either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Likewise, Denisse V. testified at the hearing that Petitioner \u201ctold [her] what happened.\u201d Specifically, Denisse V. indicated that Petitioner told her that \u201c[s]he had seen [the teacher] come in the locker room and.that he had touched her and [Karey] R.,\u201d and also that he \u201ccame up to them and gave them a group hug.\u201d Denisse V. testified that she believed that something \u201chad happened to [Petitioner],\u201d and admitted that she told school personnel that she witnessed the alleged events, even though she did not, \u201cbecause [she] was just trying to help.... \u201d Finally, Denisse V. testified that Petitioner never told her to lie to the police and agreed that she had \u201cheard some stories and ... continued a lie that [she] had been told....\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">At the conclusion of the two day adjudicatory proceeding, the District Court found Petitioner delinquent for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>false statements to a police officer which, if she were an adult, would violate \u00a7 150, and for conspiring to cause a false statement to be made to a police officer in violation of that statute. On 21 November 2000, a disposition and restitution hearing was held. The District Court placed Petitioner on probation \u201cin the care and custody of\u2019 her parents, following a brief detention at the courthouse, and imposed a number of special conditions on her probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, the District Court ordered that Petitioner and her parents \u201cjointly pay restitution to the Department of Juvenile Justice in the amount of $ 85,\u201d by 20 December 2000, for disbursement to the victim of Petitioner\u2019s scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On 27 November 2000, Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner maintained that the District Court erred in holding that Petitioner\u2019s conduct violated \u00a7 150 because Petitioner was \u201cmerely interviewed as part of a police investigation.\u201d According to Petitioner, pursuant to our holding in <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 765 A.2d 127 (2001),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an individual must make a false statement, report, or complaint to the police with the intention of initiating a police investigation in order to violate \u00a7 150. In addition, Petitioner argued that the \u201cproof in the case at bar failed because there was no evidence that there was an agreement to violate \u00a7 150.\u201d In light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones, </em>Respondent conceded that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cadjudication of delinquency for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>making a false statement to a police officer should be reversed\u201d because Petitioner\u2019s statements to Detective Birch were made \u201conce the investigation was already in progress.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent, however, maintained that \u201cthe conspiracy adjudication should be affirmed.\u201d According to Respondent, the \u201cevidence in this case was legally sufficient to establish [Petitioner\u2019s] role in a criminal conspiracy to make false allegations to police regarding [the teacher].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court. The Court of Special Appeals held that Petitioner\u2019s actions violated \u00a7 150 because they \u201cwere \u2018part and parcel\u2019 of the plan to falsely accuse the teacher and cause the ensuing police investigation.\u201d According to the intermediate appellate court, \u201c[a] police investigation was the natural and probable result of the false statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the' evidence was \u201csufficient to show that [Petitioner] and other persons conspired to make false statements to school personnel\u201d and, by inference, to \u201ccause a police investigation to be initiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Initially, we must determine whether Petitioner\u2019s actions constituted a violation of Md.Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 150. The relevant portion of the statute provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Petitioner maintains, and Respondent concedes, that our recent interpretation of \u00a7 150 in <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 765 A.2d 127 (2001), precludes a holding that Petitioner violated \u00a7 150. In its reasoning, however, the Court of Special Appeals contended that Petitioner\u2019s case was \u201cfactually distinguishable\u201d from <em>Jones </em>because the evidence in the present case \u201cpermitted a finding that one or more persons, acting in concert, made knowingly false statements to school personnel, prior to the police investigation.\u201d Based on that evidence, the intermediate appellate court noted that the \u201ccommon sense inference to be drawn is that the statements caused the investigation\u201d because \u201c[a] police investigation was the natural and probable result of the false statements.\u201d Therefore, it was appropriate, in that court\u2019s view, to affirm \u201cthe finding of delinquency for giving false statements to a police officer.\u201d As sometimes happens, we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aky\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A person may not make a false statement, report or complaint, or cause a false statement, report or complaint to be made, to any peace or police officer of this State, of any county, city or other political subdivision of this State, or of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Police knowing the same, or any material part thereof, to be false and with intent to deceive and with intent to cause an investigation or other action to be taken as a result thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In <em>Jones, </em>a police department received a report that gun shots were fired at a residence and that \u201csomeone had been hit by a bullet.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 333, 765 A.2d at 128. An officer arrived on the scene and spoke with a neighbor who told him that the defendant, Jones, and his niece had departed the scene for the emergency room of a local hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the responding officer interviewed Jones who explained that \u201che and his niece were walking through a wooded area in the city park when a shot rang out, wounding his niece.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, however, someone in the hospital emergency room supplied a different account of the incident. When the officer re-interviewed Jones, Jones changed his story and explained that his niece was shot when he \u201copened the front door [of the residence] to peek outside\u201d at a person approaching the door. <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 334, 765 A.2d at 128. Based on \u201cJones\u2019s conflicting accounts of the shooting,\u201d he was charged with and convicted of violating \u00a7 150. <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 334, 765 A.2d at 129. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed that conviction. Drawing on our earlier interpretation of \u00a7 150 in <em>Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 560 A.2d 1108 (1989), we disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>In reversing the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, we reiterated our analysis of \u00a7 150 in <em>Choi </em>and explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJo\">\u201c[t]he statute ... does not expressly proscribe a false response to police questioning after an investigation has already begun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cAs the statutory language shows, an element of the offense is the intent to cause an investigation or other action to be taken. In our view, this element is not satisfied when a false statement results from an interview as part of an ongoing police investigation. Rather, there must be a false report of a crime or a statement with the intent to cause other action to be taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 335-36, 765 A.2d at 129 (quoting <em>Choi, </em>316 Md. at 547, 560 A.2d at 1116-17). \u201cOther action,\u201d we concluded, \u201crefers to something other than an \u2018investigation\u2019 but similar to initiating an investigation,\u201d for instance \u201cfurnish[ing] protection,\u201d \u201cengaging] in rescue efforts,\u201d \u201cresponding] to emergencies,\u201d and \u201csearching] for dangerous objects.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 337, 765 A.2d at 130 (citing <em>Choi, </em>316 Md. at 547, 560 A.2d at 1117). Therefore, where there was \u201cno evidence or suggestion that Jones made the initial report of the shooting,\u201d Jones\u2019s false initial statement to the police \u201cdid not initiate the investigation\u201d and we declined to hold that his false statement to the police constituted a violation of \u00a7 150. <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 338-39, 765 A.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In the present case, as we explained at <em>supra </em>note 3, neither party contends that Petitioner contacted the police initially. Moreover, both concede that Petitioner made false statements to the police during the investigation of the teacher. Applying the reasoning in <em>Jones, </em>where there is no evidence that Petitioner\u2019s false statements to the police initiated the investigation into the alleged misconduct and it is clear that Petitioner\u2019s false statements to the police were made only after the investigation was underway, Petitioner may not be found delinquent for making false statements to a police officer which, if she were an adult, would violate \u00a7 150. \u201cWhile lying to police officers during an ongoing investigation is not to be condoned, nonetheless it is not the type of behavior at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Art. 27, \u00a7 150, is aimed.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>362 Md. at 339, 765 A.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Likewise, although not argued by Respondent, we are unable to conclude that Petitioner violated \u00a7 150 by causing a false statement, report, or complaint to be made to the police with the intent to cause an investigation. In its brief to this Court, Respondent concedes that \u201c[n]ot addressed by the trial court, nor by either party, was what statements were made, and by whom, that <em>caused </em>the investigation to begin in the first place.\u201d Absent such evidence, Petitioner cannot be held delinquent for causing false statements to be made to the police in violation of \u00a7 150.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Next, Respondent contends that even though Petitioner\u2019s conduct did not constitute a violation of \u00a7 150, \u201c[t]he evidence in this case was legally sufficient to establish [Petitioner\u2019s] role in a criminal conspiracy to make false allegations to police, or to cause such allegations to be made, regarding [the teacher].\u201d Petitioner, on the other hand, maintains that the \u201ccrucial element of the conspiracy is the agreement\u201d and argues that in this case there was \u201cno evidence to support the conclusion that an agreement\u201d to falsely accuse \u201ca detested teacher to school officials amounted to a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 150.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that the evidence was \u201csufficient to show that [Petitioner] and other persons conspired to make false statements to school personnel,\u201d and explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">[t]he fact of the agreement between [Petitioner] and others to make false statements to school personnel was sufficient from which to infer an intent to cause a police investigation to be initiated because such an investigation was the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and probable result of the false statements that were the subject of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">For the following reasons, we are compelled to agree with Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Our review of this matter is limited to \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. 371, 380, 681 A.2d 501, 505 (1996) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Va., </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (citations and emphasis omitted). <em>See also Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97, 124 (2001); <em>State v. Pagotto, </em>361 Md. 528, 533-34, 762 A.2d 97, 100 (2000). As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">[jludging the weight of evidence and the credibility of witnesses and resolving conflicts in the evidence are matters entrusted to the sound discretion of the trier of fact. When the trier of fact is the trial court, its judgment on the evidence will be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anj\"><em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. at 379-80, 681 A.2d at 505 (citations omitted). This standard of review \u201capplies in juvenile delinquency cases. In such cases, the delinquent act, like the criminal act, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re Timothy F., </em>343 Md. at 380, 681 A.2d at 506 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">A criminal conspiracy \u201c \u2018consists of the combination of two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>363 Md. 130, 145, 767 A.2d 844, 852 (2001) (quoting <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832, 834 (1988)). It is well accepted that the essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement. <em>See Id. </em>Therefore, we ask the questions: (1) was there evidence that Petitioner and the other students had a common plan; and, (2) was the common plan a plan to make false statements to the police or cause false statements to be made to the police with the intent to cause an investigation or other similar action to be taken? Although it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Petitioner and the other students had a common plan (e.g., the students involved provided Detective Birch with similar descriptions of the teacher\u2019s alleged misconduct), the evidence does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the common plan was to commit acts within the purview of \u00a7 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">As we noted in <em>Mitchell, </em>\u201cconspiracy is necessarily a specific intent crime; there must exist the specific intent to join with another person in the accomplishment of an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose by unlawful means.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>363 Md. at 146, 767 A.2d at 853. Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">[w]hen the object of the conspiracy is the commission of another crime, as in conspiracy to commit murder, the specific intent required for the conspiracy is not only the intent required for the agreement but also, pursuant to that agreement, the intent to assist in some way in causing that crime to be committed.... Thus, if the conspiracy is to commit murder, the intent must be to commit (or have someone commit) those acts that would constitute murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ane-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>Here, the burden was on Respondent to present evidence of Petitioner\u2019s specific intent to make a false statement or cause a false statement to be made to the police in order to cause an investigation. Attempting to meet that burden, Respondent presented testimonial evidence that the students involved, including Petitioner, agreed to lie to school personnel about the teacher. According to Respondent, the agreement and subsequent actions of the students demonstrated their intent to initiate a police investigation because the \u201cnatural and foreseeable consequence\u201d of their actions was \u201cthat the police would be notified of the allegations and presumably act upon them.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">There is no direct evidence that Petitioner or any of the other students involved intended that their false statements lead to a police investigation. Although Respondent may prove the elements of a conspiracy through circumstantial evidence, <em>see Mitchell, </em>363 Md. at 145, 767 A.2d at 852; <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 292, 600 A.2d 430, 440 (1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>in our view the record here supports at best only an inference that the- students intended their false allegations to lead to professional difficulties for, not necessarily a criminal investigation of, the teacher. Specifically, based on the decision of the students to make the false allegations to school personnel, rather than to the police, and on the admitted disdain for the teacher held by a number of the students, we perceive that a rational trier of fact could infer that the agreement between the students indicated their specific intent to cause professional disciplinary action be taken by the school against him. On the other hand, we are unconvinced that evidence of the students\u2019 agreement to lie to school personnel about the teacher supports an inference that Petitioner and the other students intended their false statements further to cause a police investigation. For example, there was no evidence suggesting that Petitioner and the other children were aware of any school policy or legal requirement<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that such allegations be reported by the school administration or faculty to law enforcement authorities. On the state of this record, we are unwilling to recognize as reasonable that any rational fact-finder would infer so attenuated a conclusion as that a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>intent to cause a police investigation was the object of the conspiracy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In view of our disposition of the first issue in this, it is unnecessary for us to reach the second issue regarding whether the District Court judge erred in not recusing himself from hearing Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY; RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-13\">.
