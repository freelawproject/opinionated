Petitioner, Kevin Moye, argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for possession of marijuana and cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. We agree and therefore shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In the early morning hours of March 6, 2000, Prince George\u2019s County Police received a call that a \u201ccutting\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was in progress at 3414 Ricky Avenue in Temple Hills, Maryland. The home was leased by Yolanda and Joseph Bullock, a husband and wife, who rented out the basement to Greg Benson. All of the occupants of the Bullocks\u2019s residence were present in the home on March 6th, along with petitioner Kevin Moye, the brother of Yolanda Bullock, who may have been staying in the Bullocks\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>When the police arrived at the home, Yolanda Bullock came out of the house to meet them and stated that someone had cut her foot. She was followed by her husband, Joseph Bullock, who was uninjured. Shortly thereafter, Greg Benson came out of the house with cuts on both of his legs and told the police that someone else remained in the home. The police set up a barricade around the home and contacted the Emergency Service Team, a specialty assault weapons team, for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The police observed a black male, later identified as Moye, the petitioner, on the first floor of the Bullocks\u2019s home moving from windows on the left side of the house to windows at the front of the house. The police used a public announcement system to ask Moye to come out of the house under threat of sending in a K-9 unit. Once the K-9 announcement was made, Officer William R. Silvers, Jr. observed Moye looking through one of the windows at the back of the house on the first floor and then through a window in the back of the basement area. Thereafter, Officer Silvers saw no further movement within the house. Several minutes elapsed before Moye exited the Bullocks\u2019s home from a door leading out of the basement area which had been rented to Benson. Moye proceeded to the top of the basement steps on the outside of the home, where the officers arrested him. Officer Robert Black transported Moye to the hospital following his arrest so that he could receive treatment for a cut on his finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Following Moye\u2019s arrest, Officer Silvers testified that he and Officer Walden went to the back of the house to \u201cmake sure there were no other victims, no other suspects or weapons in the house.\u201d The officers entered the Bullocks\u2019s home through the basement door which had been used by Moye to leave the home. The basement area, as described by Officer Silvers, consisted of a small hallway opening into a larger living area bounded on one side with a long counter area encasing a sink, kitchen cabinets, and drawers. Three of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>drawers were open or partially opened and contained several small baggies of marijuana, a small digital scale betraying white residue, and a dinner plate upon which rested a razor blade and white residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Officer Silvers noticed a missing ceiling panel above the counter area. When he stood on the counter top to look into the ceiling, he discovered a bag containing marijuana and crack cocaine. No other drugs or paraphernalia were found anywhere else in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Bullocks, Benson, and Moye were all indicted with charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Rep. VoL, 2001 Supp.), Art. 27, Section 286(a)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of cocaine in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Rep. VoL), Art. 27, Section 287,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol., 2001 Supp.), Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Section 286(a)(1), possession of marijuana in violation of Maryland Code (1957,1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, Section 287, conspiracy to violate the controlled dangerous substances law of Maryland with regard to the cocaine, and possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. VoL), Art. 27, Section 287A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>On September 27, 2000, trial commenced against both Moye and co-defendant, Greg Benson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State conceded that at no time did the police find drugs on the person of Kevin Moye, nor had he been tested for drugs at the time of his arrest. The State presented evidence that the digital scale found in the basement area tested positive for cocaine residue, although no drug testing was conducted on the plate upon which white powder residue was found. The evidence established that there was 0.07 grams of marijuana contained in the small baggies found in the counter drawers and 60.22 grams of marijuana along with 29.82 grams of cocaine in the bag found in the ceiling panel of the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Moye moved for judgment of acquittal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at the close of the State\u2019s case, arguing that the decision in <em>Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 697 A.2d 462 (1997), disposed of the issues in the case. Moye asserted that the State had failed to demonstrate that he had exercised dominion or control over the drugs found in the basement of the Bullocks\u2019s home and failed to show that he had known that the drugs existed. The trial court granted the motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine but denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>motion as to all other charges. Neither Moye nor Benson called any witnesses, and at the close of the case Moye renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal as to all remaining counts. At that juncture, the trial judge granted the motion with regard to the charge for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The case proceeded to the jury on the charges of possession of cocaine, possession of marijuana, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The jury returned its verdict on September 28, 2000, finding Moye guilty of possession of cocaine, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia, and not guilty of posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sion with the intent to distribute marijuana.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On October 23, 2000, the trial court sentenced Moye to four years imprisonment for possession of cocaine concurrent with one year for possession of marijuana, with all but two years suspended and credit for time served and fined him $100.00 for possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On January 22, 2001, Moye filed a Motion for Modification and Reduction of Sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345, arguing <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe controlled dangerous substances and paraphernalia recovered in this case were located in a residence where [Moye] had been present but was not a resident,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat neither any controlled dangerous substance nor paraphernalia were recovered from [Moye\u2019s] person.\u201d The trial court denied the motion on July 2, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Petitioner appealed the final judgment to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction. <em>See Moye v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 538, 541, 776 A.2d 120, 122 (2001). The Court of Special Appeals held that Moye\u2019s \u201cresidence at a house in which marijuana and cocaine were found in plain view, combined with his presence in the specific area the drugs were located, was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 776 A.2d at 122. In reaching its holding, the Court of Special Appeals emphasized that the facts of this case were distinguishable from <em>Taylor v. State, supra, </em>and the cases cited therein, because those cases involved situations where controlled dangerous substances were located in a closed container or outside of the plain view of the accused. <em>See Moye, Id. </em>at 547-48, 776 A.2d at 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Moye filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court, which we granted, 366 Md. 274, 783 A.2d 653 (2001), to consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>1. Where drugs and paraphernalia were found in open drawers in the basement of a private residence, and the record shows that Petitioner and the lessees of the house live upstairs and that the basement is rented to a fourth individual, is Petitioner\u2019s mere presence in the basement sufficient to sustain convictions for possession of CDS and possession of paraphernalia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">2. Did the instruction given fail to inform the jury that it could convict Petitioner of possession of CDS and possession of paraphernalia only if it found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Petitioner did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the CDS and paraphernalia?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision and Moye\u2019s conviction on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, we need not and will not address petitioner\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"> The standard of review for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478-79, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979) and <em>Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 182-83, 502 A.2d 496, 498 (1986)). We give \u201cdue regard to the [fact finder\u2019s] finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675, 685 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998) (quoting <em>Albrecht, </em>336 Md. at 478, 649 A.2d at 337). Although our analysis does not involve a re-weighing of the evidence, we must determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by either direct or circumstantial evidence by which any rational trier of fact could find Moye guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>various possession charges. <em>See White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 162, 767 A.2d 855, 862 (2001); <em>Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 128, 321 A.2d 767, 770 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The State\u2019s case against Moye for possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of paraphernalia depended on circumstantial evidence of joint and constructive possession of the contraband. While a valid conviction may be based solely on circumstantial evidence, it cannot be sustained \u201con proof amounting only to strong suspicion or mere probability.\u201d <em>White, </em>363 Md. at 163, 767 A.2d at 862 (explaining that \u201c[circumstantial evidence which merely arouses suspicion or leaves room for conjecture is obviously insufficient\u201d) (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 458, 697 A.2d at 465)(internal quotations omitted). A conviction based solely on circumstantial evidence should be sustained only where \u201cthe circumstances, taken together, are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 537, 573 A.2d 831, 834 (1990); <em>West v. State, </em>312 Md. 197, 211-12, 539 A.2d 231, 238 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Moye was convicted of possession of cocaine and marijuana in violation of Art. 27, Section 287, and possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Art. 27, Section 287A. The Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.) Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 276-304 defines possession as \u201cthe exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons.\u201d Md.Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 277(s). We have further defined \u201ccontrol\u201d of CDS as exercising a \u201crestraining or directing influence oyer\u201d the item allegedly possessed. <em>See Garrison, </em>272 Md. at 142, 321 A.2d at 777. For the State to prove that Moye had control over the drugs or paraphernalia, the \u201cevidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited ... drug in the sense contemplated by the statute, <em>i.e., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or direct influence over it.\u201d <em>See McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 474, 701 A.2d at 686 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 596, 463 A.2d 872, 874 (1983))(in-ternal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The State did not need to show that Moye exercised sole possession of the drugs and paraphernalia. Rather, a person may have actual or constructive possession of the CDS, and the possession may be either exclusive or joint in nature. <em>See Taylor, </em>346 Md. at 458, 697 A.2d at 465; <em>see also Henderson v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 384, 392, 283 A.2d 418, 422 (1971). Here, the State advanced the theory that Moye and co-defendant Benson had joint and constructive possession of the marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia found in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">' Knowledge is an essential element of crimes of possession of CDS under Section 287 or 287A. For, as we explained in <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">an individual ordinarily would not be deemed to exercise \u201cdominion or control\u201d over an object about which he is unaware. Knowledge of the presence of an object is normally a prerequisite to exercising dominion and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0z\"><em>Id. </em>at 649, 547 A.2d at 1046 (explaining that although the Maryland statute is silent with regard to a knowledge or <em>scienter </em>requirement, the statutory scheme as a whole \u201cindicates an intention on the part of the General Assembly to require <em>scienter </em>as an element of the \u00a7 287 offenses\u201d). Therefore, in order to be found guilty of a violation of \u00a7 287 or \u00a7 287A, the accused \u201cmust know of both the presence and the general character or illicit nature of the substance ... such knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence and by inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 547 A.2d at 1047. Thus, we must determine whether the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that Moye exercised a knowing dominion or control over the drugs and paraphernalia for which he has been convicted of possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">We believe that our decisions in <em>Taylor v. State, supra, Garrison v. State, supra, McDonald v. State, supra, </em>and <em>White v. State, supra, </em>direct the resolution of the case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>police officers responded to a complaint about a possible controlled dangerous substances violation at a beach motel. 346 Md. at 454-55, 697 A.2d at 463. The occupants admitted the officers to the room and permitted the police to search their belongings. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 697 A.2d at 463-64. When the officers entered the room, Taylor was lying on the floor, either asleep or pretending to be asleep. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 697 A.2d at 464. One of the other occupants of the room, Chris Myers, took a baggie of marijuana out of his own carrying bag and informed the officers that it was his marijuana, as well as directing the officers to another of his bags which also contained a baggie of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 697 A.2d at 464. Although the officer testified that he smelled a strong odor of marijuana in the room, he did not observe anyone smoking it, no marijuana was visible upon entry into the room, and the ashtrays were all clean. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 697 A.2d at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">We reversed Taylor\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, some of the same charges facing Moye, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">under the facts of this case, any finding that he was in possession of the marijuana could be based on no more than speculation or conjecture. The State conceded at trial that no marijuana or paraphernalia was found on [Taylor] or in his personal belongings, nor did the officers observe [Taylor] or any of the other occupants of the hotel room smoking marijuana. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, [the officer\u2019s] testimony established only that Taylor was present in a room where marijuana had been smoked recently, that he was aware that it had been smoked, and that Taylor was in proximity to contraband that was concealed in a container belonging to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">The record is clear that [Taylor] was not in exclusive possession of the premises, and that the contraband was secreted in a hidden place not otherwise shown to be within [Taylor\u2019s] control. Accordingly, a rational inference cannot be drawn that he possessed the controlled dangerous substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 459, 697 A.2d at 465-66. We explained that \u201cmere proximity to the drug, mere presence on the property where it is located, or mere association, without more, with the person who does control the drug or property on which it is found, is insufficient to support a finding of possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460, 697 A.2d at 466 (quoting <em>Murray v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 694, 696 (9th Cir.1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In our analysis in <em>Taylor, </em>we discussed <em>Garrison v. State, supra, </em>in which we also reversed a conviction for possession with intent to distribute heroin based on insufficient evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of possession of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, Section 286(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 697 A.2d at 466-67. With regard to whether Garrison knew the drugs were on the premises, we noted that the heroin was seized from a bathroom where Garrison\u2019s husband was attempting to dispose of the drugs, while Garrison was lying in bed in another room. <em>See, Garrison, </em>272 Md. at 126, 321 A.2d at 769. Under such circumstances we concluded that, \u201c[t]he seized heroin was not in the plain view of [Garrison], nor was there a juxtaposition between her (in the front bedroom) and the contraband being jettisoned by her husband in the bathroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 321 A.2d at 771. Although Garrison had a possessory interest in the house, she was not the sole occupant of the home at the time the drugs were found. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we reasoned, \u201c[t]he appellant and her husband may well have jointly participated in the distribution of heroin, but on this record there was no substantive evidence offered which showed directly or supported a rational inference that she had \u2018the exercise of (either) actual or constructive dominion or control\u2019 \u2014 solely or jointly with her husband \u2014 over the 173 glassine bags of heroin seized while being discarded by her spouse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 321 A.2d at 777. In analyzing whether there had been \u201cmutual use and enjoyment of the contraband,\u201d we noted that although Garrison had needle marks which were approximately two weeks old, there were no fresh marks upon her body or other evidence indicating recent use. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 321 A.2d at 769, 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Subsequent to our decision in <em>Taylor, </em>we had another occasion to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of possession of CDS. In <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 474, 701 A.2d 675, 685 (1997), McDonald was convicted of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute and possession of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 701 A.2d at 686. McDonald personally had signed for delivery of a United Parcel Service (UPS) package which contained eighteen pounds of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>When the police executed a search warrant for McDonald\u2019s home half an hour after the package was delivered, they found McDonald standing over the UPS package with the drugs exposed. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 701 A.2d at 686. In applying the reasoning of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>Dawkins, </em>we concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support McDonald\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 701 A.2d at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In our most recent case analyzing the rudiments of possession we were called upon to determine whether the passenger in a car was in possession of CDS found in its trunk. <em>See White, </em>363 Md. at 153, 767 A.2d at 857. During the search of the trunk, the police found a box full of pots and pans which had concealed within it a separate package of 194 grams of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 767 A.2d at 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Similar to Moye\u2019s predicament, the State\u2019s case against White rested solely on <em>circumstantial </em>evidence that White had joint and constructive possession of the cocaine found in the co-defendant\u2019s trunk. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 767 A.2d at 862. Ultimately, we reversed White\u2019s conviction, finding that even if we assumed the evidence in the record was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that White had knowledge that the drugs were in the trunk of the car, there was insufficient evidence to establish that he exercised dominion and control over them. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 767 A.2d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In applying the logic espoused in <em>Taylor </em>and its progeny to the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are left with nothing but speculation as to Moye\u2019s knowledge or exercise of dominion or control over the drugs and paraphernalia found in the Bullocks\u2019s basement. Similar to the defendant in <em>Taylor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Moye did not have any ownership or possessory right in the premises where the drugs and paraphernalia were found. Joseph Bullock testified at trial that he and his wife, Yolanda, leased their home and that the couple rented out the basement to Greg Benson, who had been residing there for several months prior to March 6, 2000. He further testified that at the time of the incident, Moye was \u201cliving\u201d in the house with him and his wife.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No evidence was adduced at trial as to how long Moye had been staying at the Bullocks\u2019s home. On this record, therefore, we cannot conclude that Moye had any ownership or possessory right to or in the Bullocks\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">There is also nothing in the record establishing Moye\u2019s proximity to the drugs during the time he was in the basement. The evidence failed to establish where Moye was located in the basement in relation to the substances in question and the duration of his sojourn. The trial testimony established that one of the officers observed Moye looking out of a window at the back of the basement shortly before he exited the house. The record does not indicate where the window at the back of the basement was in relation to the drugs and paraphernalia found in the counter drawers. The photographs entered in evidence at trial, however, show that the window above the counter area where the drugs were found was covered completely with cardboard, which would have made it impossible for the police to have observed Moye through that vantage point.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The State\u2019s argument and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis in its opinion below emphasized that the illicit substances attributable to Moye were located in the open in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>basement area. In distinguishing our decision in Taylor; the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">In this case, unlike <em>Taylor </em>and the cases it relied on, both marijuana and cocaine were in the open and were not concealed. The marijuana was in an open drawer, as was the dinner plate with the white powdery residue, and a razor blade on top of the plate.... Although [Moye did not live] in the basement where the drugs were located, there was free access between the upstairs and the basement. Moreover, the police observed [Moye] in the basement of the residence where the cocaine and marijuana were discovered. [Moye\u2019s] residence in the premises and his presence in the room where the plain view contraband was discovered allows a reasonable inference that [Moye] was aware of and possessed the illegal drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">139 Md.App. at 548-49, 776 A.2d at 126. The State and the Court of Special Appeals, however, have gauged the \u201copenness\u201d of the location of the drugs from the perspective of the individual searching for the drugs, rather than from the perspective of the accused whose knowledge and awareness of the drugs are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The photographs of the basement area show one small baggie of marijuana in the open drawer to the right of the sink. That drawer also contained a box of kitchen bags, photo negatives, and the instructions booklet for the sink\u2019s garbage disposal unit. Two other photographs depict two counter drawers to the left of the sink containing baggies of drugs, the plate upon which the razor blade rested, the digital scale, and additional odds and ends such as coupons, packing tape, and what appears to be a phone book. These photographs were taken by someone standing directly over the open drawers. In contrast, an additional photograph taken within a few feet from the counter area reflects only the plate in the left hand drawer, and a box of kitchen bags in the right drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The State also failed to produce any evidence concerning Moye\u2019s presence in the basement in the vicinity of the drugs. Although Moye suffered a cut on his finger which required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>hospital treatment, the police found no blood in the basement. In addition, the knife used in the cutting incident, to which the police had responded, was found upstairs in the main portion of the house, rather than in the basement. Because the record does not adequately disclose the duration of Moye\u2019s visit to the basement, it is impossible to tell if, during the time he traveled into the basement from the first floor of the home prior to exiting through the basement door, he had, in fact, stood over the drawers in the counter and had the \u201cplain view\u201d vantage point urged by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Further, there were no facts established at trial as to whether Moye was present in the room with the drugs for any given amount of time other than to say that he left the Bullocks\u2019s home through the basement door. The State offered no evidence to suggest any relationship between Benson and Moye which would have established that Moye frequented the basement of the Bullocks\u2019s home or that he was aware of what items were stored in the drawers of the counter area. Thus, we are confronted with a situation where a person has been convicted of possessing controlled dangerous substances and yet we cannot gauge whether he even knew the contraband was in the basement and controlled or exercised dominion over the CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We also conclude that based on the evidence in this record, no reasonable inference could be drawn that Moye was participating with others in the mutual enjoyment of the contraband. There is no evidence concerning whether Moye, Benson, or the Bullocks were observed using drugs on the night in question. Although the facts may lead a trier of fact to believe that <em>someone </em>may have been using marijuana in the Bullocks\u2019s home, the evidence fails to establish <em>who </em>may have been using it, and <em>when </em>such use may have taken place.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals relied on its decisions in <em>Davis v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 48, 262 A.2d 578 (1970) and <em>Cook v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 122, 578 A.2d 283 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 276 (1991), in its determination that drugs found by the police in plain view combined with an accused\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d in the home or room in which it is found are sufficient to support a conviction for possession of controlled dangerous substances. The facts of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Cook </em>are distinguishable, however, from the facts and circumstances in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Davis </em>came long before this Court discussed the <em>scienter </em>requirement for possession of CDS in <em>Dawkins v. State, supra. </em>Thus, the court\u2019s analysis relied solely on whether Davis exercised dominion or control over the CDS. Davis was charged with and convicted of having control of a prohibited narcotic drug pursuant to an earlier version of Maryland\u2019s Controlled Dangerous Substances Law. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 277 (making it unlawful for a person to \u201cpossess\u201d or \u201chave under his control\u201d any prohibited narcotic drug); <em>see also Bryant v. State, </em>229 Md. 531, 537, 185 A.2d 190, 193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>(1962)(stating that \u201cSection 277 makes the possession of narcotics and the control of narcotics two separate offenses\u201d). At that time, the term \u201ccontrol\u201d meant \u201cto exercise restraining or directing influence over, <em>viz., </em>to relate to authority over what is not in one\u2019s physical possession.\u201d <em>See Davis, </em>9 Md.App. at 52, 262 A.2d at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In <em>Davis, </em>an undercover officer went to Davis\u2019s apartment on February 28, 1968 and purchased $50.00 worth of marijuana from Davis\u2019s wife, Maxine Green. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 262 A.2d at 580. The officer did not enter the apartment to complete the transaction, and did not observe Davis at that time. <em>Id. </em>On March 23, 1968, the police obtained and executed a search warrant for Davis\u2019s apartment, and observed \u201cin plain view on the living room coffee table two small pieces of hashish and a razor blade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Davis had not been present in the apartment when the police commenced the search, but he arrived home prior to the police\u2019s discovery of a metal box found on top of the stereo which contained \u201cmarijuana pipes, a bottle cap, an eye-dropper, a needle, a piece of cotton still in the bottle cap, a small postal scale and an envelope containing marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 262 A.2d at 580. Davis was convicted of control of marijuana based on separate indictments for February 28, 1968 and March 23, 1968. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50, 262 A.2d at 579-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On this evidence, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Davis\u2019s conviction for possession of marijuana based on the February 28, 1968 incident was clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 262 A.2d at 581. The court reasoned that where an individual, like Davis, does not have exclusive possession of a home or apartment where narcotics are found, \u201cit may not be inferred that he knew of the presence of the narcotics and had control of them, unless other incriminating circumstances are shown which tend to buttress such an inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 262 A.2d at 581. The court explained that the only evidence' linking Davis to the transaction taking place on February 28, 1968 was that Davis \u201cwas a co-lessee of the premises, resided there at least two nights weekly, and had an intimate personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>relationship with the co-lessee Green.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 262 A.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The court affirmed Davis\u2019s conviction stemming from the March 28, 1968 search of his apartment based on the fact that Davis was a co-occupant of the apartment where drugs were found in plain view on the coffee table, that he entered the premises shortly after the police began executing a lawful search warrant and discovered the drugs, and that Davis\u2019s arms bore fresh needle marks which \u201cpermitted an inference that he knew of the presence of, and was directly connected with\u201d the drugs and paraphernalia found on the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 262 A.2d at 583. The court opined that the inference supported the conclusion that Davis \u201ccontrolled\u201d the drug, although \u201cthe State [was] not required to show that the accused\u2019s control of the narcotic drug was knowing and wilful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 262 A.2d at 581. Thus, for the March 23, 1968 incident, the State established that Davis had a possessory interest in the premises where the drugs were found, that the drugs were located prominently on a coffee table, and that Davis bore physical markings indicative of his recent use and enjoyment of the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56, 262 A.2d at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The <em>Davis </em>court\u2019s analysis of the March 23, 1968 evidence supporting conviction remains distinguishable from the present case, because in <em>Davis, </em>the evidence showed a clear connection between the contraband and the accused, while there is a lack of such a nexus in the present case. To the contrary, the circumstances surrounding Moye\u2019s convictions more closely resemble those that warranted reversal, based on the insufficiency of the evidence emanating from the February 28,1968 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We are equally unpersuaded by the application of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Cook </em>to the instant case. In <em>Cook, </em>the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Cook for possession with intent to distribute cocaine based on a theory of constructive possession. <em>Cook, </em>84 Md.App. at 135, 578 A.2d at 289. Presumably the Court of Special Appeals relied on <em>Cook </em>because of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>fact that like Moye, neither Cook nor his co-defendant, William Darby, had a possessory interest in the home where the CDS were found. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 578 A.2d at 289. The facts presented in <em>Cook, </em>however, are distinguishable from those adduced in the instant case, because in <em>Cook, </em>the evidence introduced at trial showed that Cook and his co-appellant, William Darby, had knowledge of and exercised control over the CDS. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 578 A.2d at 289 (\u201cone could not conclude, by any stretch of the imagination, that appellants were unaware of [the drugs\u2019] presence.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In sum, the circumstantial evidence presented by the State in this case fails to establish the requisite knowledge and exercise of dominion or control over the CDS and paraphernalia for which Moye was convicted under Sections 287 and 287A. Accordingly, Moye\u2019s convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana in violation of Maryland Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 287 and possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of \u00a7 287A are hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
