At each level of administrative and judicial consideration of Petitioner\u2019s application, compliance with Anne Arundel County\u2019s \u201cStandards and proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>dures for granting or denying rezoning\u201d was the required focus. Anne Arundel County Code (\u201cCounty Code\u201d), Article 3, \u00a7 2-105. Of greatest debate was (and is) the meaning and scope of County Code, Art. 3, \u00a7 2-105(a)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">(a) Rezonings shall be granted or denied in accordance with appropriate zoning regulations, but a rezoning may not be granted except on the basis of an affirmative finding that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">(3) transportation facilities, water and sewerage systems, storm drainage systems, schools, and fire suppression facilities adequate to serve the uses allowed by the new zoning classification, as defined in Article 26, Title 2, Subtitle 4, Part 2 of this Code, are either in existence or programmed for construction; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">According to Petitioner, the reference in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) to \u201cArticle 26, Title 2, Subtitle 4, Part 2 of this Code,\u201d the \u201cAdequacy of Facilities\u201d part of the \u201cSubdivision\u201d Article (\u201cthe AOF Part\u201d) of the County Code, necessarily incorporates the entirety of that part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Petitioner identifies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>number of sections within the AOF Part which provide, as an alternative to the actual existence of the needed facilities to serve the proposed development, that a developer\u2019s agreement, proffered at the time subdivision approval is sought, to provide the needed facilities may satisfy the adequacy requirements. By parity of reasoning, Petitioner maintains that a developer\u2019s agreement at rezoning should satisfy the requirement that adequate facilities are \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>dents in this ease (Anne Arundel County and neighboring homeowners) maintain that the reference in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) to the AOF Part does not incorporate, by its terms, each of the alternative means provided in the AOF Part for establishing that facilities are, or will be, adequate. According to Respondents, Petitioner does not satisfy the requirement for a zoning reclassification because it did not demonstrate that the enu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>merated facilities were in existence or programmed for construction in the relevant governmental capital improvements program (the County\u2019s or the State Highway Administration\u2019s).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s writ of certiorari, <em>Annapolis Mkt. v. Parker, </em>364 Md. 534, 774 A.2d 408 (2001), to address the meaning of Art. 3, \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) of the County Code. Petitioner presents the following rephrased question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4A\">Whether, in determining if public facilities are adequate to support a zoning reclassification under Anne Arundel County Code, Art. 3, \u00a7 2~105(a)(3), which requires adequate public facilities (defined by reference to the Adequacy of Facilities ordinance) to be \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction,\u201d the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals may consider evidence of future improvements to existing facilities agreed to be undertaken by a developer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">I. <em>Relevant Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Petitioner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> owns 32.93 acres of real property (\u201cthe Property\u201d) located in Annapolis, Maryland. As described by the Court of Special Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">[t]he Property fronts Bestgate Road, a four-lane divided highway with a raised medium strip. A portion of the Property contains steep slopes and nontidal wetlands close to Cabin Branch, which drains into Saltworks Creek. A Baltimore Gas and Electric overhead utility line transverses the northeast portion of the Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">The land to the immediate west of the Property is zoned W[ ]l[-]Industrial and developed as the Annapolis Commercial Park, a 400,000 square foot industrial park. Adjacent to the Property to the east is a cemetery and a church. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>property is zoned residential. Two residential subdivisions, Woodlawn and Saltworks on the Severn, lie to the north of the Property. These subdivisions do not have access to Bestgate Road and are separated from the site by Cabin Branch. Across Bestgate Road to the west of the Property is a large, commercial EPA building and land zoned Town center. The Property is within clear sight of the Annapolis Mall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">Approximately 30 acres of the Property are zoned R5 Residential; the remaining two acres are zoned R1 Residential. [Petitioner] sought to build a \u201cnovel mix-use\u201d development that would integrate residential, commercial, and retail uses in one location. The project was described as \u201ca street with offices and residential over retail, a town square, that it stands to a community building which looks out to this stream valley park.\u201d The northern portion of the Property, in the area of Cabin Branch, would not be developed. [Petitioner] was advised by County officials that such a project could be accomplished only by C3 Commercial zoning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">On 3 March 1998, Petitioner filed an application to rezone the Property to C3 Commercial. Pursuant to County Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 11-102(b), Petitioner, as an \u201capplicant for rezoning,\u201d had the \u201cburden of proof, including the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion, with respect to any question of fact.\u201d As provided in County Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 ll-102(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the rezoning could not be granted \u201cexcept on the basis of an affirmative finding that\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>(1) there was a mistake in the zoning map or the character of the neighborhood has changed to such an extent that the zoning map should be changed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">(2) the new zoning classification conforms to the County General Development Plan in relation to land use, number of dwelling units or type and intensity of nonresidential buildings, and location;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">(3) transportation facilities, water and sewerage systems, storm drainage systems, schools, and fire suppression facilities adequate to serve the uses allowed by the new zoning classification, as defined in Article 26, Title 2, Subtitle 4, Part 2 of this Code, are either in existence or programmed for construction; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">(4) there is compatibility between the uses of the property as reclassified and the surrounding land uses, so as to promote the health, safety, and welfare of present and future residents of the County; .... <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Following a hearing, the County\u2019s Administrative Hearing Officer, on 15 July 1998, denied Petitioner\u2019s application for a zoning reclassification. According to the Hearing Officer, Petitioner had not met its burden of proof \u201cwith respect to the issue of change ....\u201d <em>See </em>County Code, Art. 28, \u00a7 11\u2014 102(c)(1). Petitioner appealed the decision of the Hearing Officer to the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals (\u201cthe Board\u201d). <em>See </em>County Code, Art. 3, \u00a7 1-104 (\u201cA ... corporation ... aggrieved by a decision of the Administrative Hearing Officer may appeal the decision to the County Board of Appeals.\u201d). Pursuant to County Code, Art. 3, \u00a7 2-105(a), the Board, in order to grant the reclassification, was required to render affirmative findings regarding the same factors as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>were at issue at the first administrative hearing. <em>See supra </em>note 6 and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Relevant to this appeal, Petitioner, in the hearing before the Board, presented evidence regarding water supply systems, on-site storm drainage systems, sewerage systems, and roads. It did not present any direct evidence regarding fire suppression facilities, off-site storm drainage systems,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or schools. On 21 May 1999, the Board nonetheless determined \u201cthat the Petitioner ha[d] presented sufficient evidence to meet the standards for the requested rezoning.\u201d It made the following findings and conclusions regarding the requirements of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">The public facilities are adequate to serve the uses permitted by the C3 zoning classification. <em>See </em>Art. 3, Section 2-105(a)(3). The Board finds persuasive the testimony of the Petitioner\u2019s expert engineer, Mr. Terry Schuman, regarding adequacy of facilities. He described the water, sewer and storm drainage systems that would be utilized by the subject property. It is his opinion that the systems would be adequate to serve the uses permitted within the C3 zone. Indeed, Mr. Dooley<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> testified that there were no issues related to adequacy of public facilities except for transportation facilities. With regard to testimony by Ms. Catherine Bartelman,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Board finds the proposed location of storm water management facilities by the Petitioner may not reflect the final location or size thereof. There was no showing, however, that the construction of storm water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>management facilities on the subject site would be impossible or insufficient to control the storm water runoff therefrom. The Board notes that the County requires that future developments not affect or decrease the velocity and quantity of storm drainage and the County will review plans for storm water management prior to the approval of any development of the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">The Board also concludes that the transportation facilities will be adequate to serve the uses proposed by the C3 zoning classification. The Board finds persuasive the testimony of Mr. Schmid<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> relative to the transportation network in the neighborhood. Mr. Schmid noted that several improvements to the roadway network would be required in order for any development of this site to meet the adequacy of transportation facilities requirement. The Boards [sic] finds that the accomplishment of the proposed traffic improvements is reasonably probable of fruition. <em>See Montgomery Co. v. Greater Colesville Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>70 Md.App. 374, 521 A.2d 770 (1987). Additionally, the Board notes improvements to transportation facilities will be required prior to approval of any subdivision of this Property. Specifically, Council Bill 72-86 ... provides that roads shall be considered adequate if road improvements or other mitigating efforts are provided by the subdivider.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No development can take place on the subject site without meeting the requirements of adequacy of transportation facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The Chairman of the Board dissented from the Board\u2019s opinion. In his dissent, the Chairman maintained that Petitioner did not meet its burden in satisfying the rezoning standards of \u00a7 2-105(a). Specifically, the Chairman contended that Petitioner failed to establish the adequacy of transpor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tation facilities because the necessary improvements to the problem intersections were \u201cnot programmed for construction.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3). In addition, the Chairman noted that \u201cthere [wa]s not one scintilla of evidence that indicate[d] that schools [we]re adequate to serve the development of th[e] [P]roperty with apartments as proposed by the Petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">On 18 June 1999, neighboring homeowners of the Property filed a Petition for Judicial Review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Sometime later, Anne Arundel County moved for and was granted leave to intervene in the proceeding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to Respondents, the Board ignored the requirements of \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3) mandating that it find adequate facilities either be \u201cin existence or programmed for construction\u201d in order to grant a reclassification. Specifically, Respondents maintained that the Board erred in applying the \u201creasonably probable of fruition\u201d standard in its consideration of transportation facilities, and it mistakenly granted the reclassification where neither adequate storm drainage systems or adequate schools were shown to be \u201cin existence or programmed for construction.\u201d Petitioner, on the other hand, supported the application of the \u201creasonably probable of fruition\u201d standard to transportation facilities and argued that the Board\u2019s determination regarding the feasibility of storm drainage systems was \u201cwithin the province of the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The Circuit Court reversed the order of the Board. In its opinion and order of 15 February 2000, the Circuit Court concluded \u201cthat the Board ... was incorrect in finding that the adequate facilities ordinance was complied with\u201d because \u201cno storm water management plan was ever presented to the Board\u201d and \u201cno showing was made that the schools in the area were adequate under a C[ ]3[-]zoning classification.\u201d In addition, the Circuit Court also held that a developer\u2019s \u201cpromises to make [traffic] improvements\u201d did not satisfy the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ment of being either \u201cin existence or programmed for construction.\u201d According to the Circuit Court, Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201ca promise of [adequate] facilities\u201d is sufficient under \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) \u201cflies in the face of\u2019 the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In its brief, Petitioner maintained that the Board \u201cconducted a thorough and fair fact-finding hearing on [the] application for zoning reclassification ....\u201d In addition, Petitioner argued that the reference in \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3) to the AOF Part permitted the Board to include a developer\u2019s promise to provide adequate facilities in the definition of \u201cin existence or programmed for construction.\u201d Respondents, on the other hand, maintained that the Board \u201cignored the plain language of the Code which specifically requires adequate traffic facilities to be either \u2018in existence or programmed for construction,\u2019 \u201d and contended that Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the AOF Part was \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d Respondents also argued that the Circuit Court correctly reversed the Board\u2019s action granting Petitioner\u2019s application for reclassification because \u201cthe record [wa]s devoid of information on issues for which [Petitioner] h[eld] the burden of proof,\u201d i.e. the adequacy of storm drainage systems and schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Although the Court of Special Appeals \u201crecognize[d] that \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3) refers to the subdivision regulations of Article] 26,\u201d it read that reference as relating to the \u201cdefinitional aspects of \u2018adequate\u2019 as outlined in [\u00a7 ] 2-415(c)(l),\u201d but not the acceptable levels of what constitutes the actual or theoretical existence of any facility for land use decision purposes. Therefore, \u201cthe Board erred, as a matter of law, in disregarding the plain language of the statute that requires that adequate facilities be \u2018in existence or programmed for construction,\u2019 \u201d the latter of which the intermediate appellate court found did not include a developer\u2019s promise. The Court of Special Appeals also noted that \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) requires that \u201cadequate off-site storm water drainage systems\u201d and adequate schools be \u201cin existence or programmed for construction before a rezoning may be grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>ed.\u201d According to the intermediate appellate court, facts regarding the off-site storm water drainage system were not \u201cclearly established in the record,\u201d and Petitioner \u201cfailed to direct [the court] to any evidence supporting a finding that ... schools were adequate to support the rezoned property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We shall supply additional factual content <em>infra </em>as necessary in the application of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cWe review an administrative agency\u2019s decision under the same statutory standards as the Circuit Court.

According to Petitioner, therefore, \u201c[ajdequate facilities are \u2018programmed for construction,\u2019 [under \u00a7 2-105(a)(8),J if the County agrees to provide the facility as a public capital project <em>or </em>if the developer agrees to construct the facility.\u201d Respondents, on the other hand, maintain that the reference in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) to the AOF Part does not incorporate all of the levels of commitment acceptable at subdivision and argue that facilities are only \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d if they are provided for in either the County\u2019s relevant current adopted capital program or, in the case of state roads, the current State consolidated transportation program. For the following reasons, but in a limited way, we must agree with Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Pursuant to the rules of statutory interpretation observed in Maryland, the conundrum of words and intent presented in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) and the AOF Part are the starting point for our review of the subsection in question. <em>See Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v.

As we recently explained in <em>Underwood, </em>it is a \u201c \u2018generally recognized rule of statutory construction that a qualifying clause ordinarily is confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase....\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Underwood, </em>368 Md. at 175-76, 792 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>A.2d at 1139 (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Dixon, </em>280 Md. 444, 451, 373 A.2d 1245, 1249 (1977)). In keeping with that rule, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the reference in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) to the AOF Part is intended to modify the first portion of the subsection requiring \u201cfacilities adequate to serve the uses allowed by the new zoning classification.\u201d <em>See Md. Div. Of Labor and Indus. v. Triangle Gen. Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 420, 784 A.2d 534, 542 (2001) (explaining that \u201c[w]here statutory provisions are \u2018clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995) (citation omitted)). As written, therefore, \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) mandates that, at the time rezoning is Considered, facilities must meet the operational adequacy requirements enumerated in the AOF Part of the Subdivision Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Standing alone, the qualifying phrase \u201cas defined in Article 26, Title 2, Subtitle 4, Part 2\u201d could also be read to modify the subsequent portion of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3), which requires that adequate facilities be \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction.\u201d Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3), however, the placement of the statutory reference in the middle of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3), modifying the first portion of the subsection, prevents such a spillover application of the qualifying phrase to the latter portion of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3). <em>See Webb v. Balt., </em>179 Md. 407, 409, 19 A.2d 704, 705 (1941) (\u201cIt appears also that subsequent clauses should not be limited by independent precedent clauses unless the intention be clearly expressed.\u201d). As a result, in interpreting the requirement of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) that adequate facilities be \u201ceither in existence or programmed for construction,\u201d we cannot simply defer, in the absence of clearer legislative intent, to the various levels of commitment permitted in the AOF Part to bring the adequate facilities to fruition. Instead, we must utilize our rules of statutory interpretation in an attempt to \u201cascertain and effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tuate the intent of\u2019 the Anne Arundel County Council with regards to this provision. <em>Underwood, </em>368 Md. at 175, 792 A.2d at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">It is undisputed that the \u201cin existence\u201d portion of \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) mandates that adequate facilities be in place at the time of reclassification. Our focus here, therefore, is on the meaning of \u201cprogrammed for construction.\u201d Although the term is not individually defined in the Anne Arundel County Code, it is utilized in the \u201cRoads\u201d section of the AOF Part which provides, in pertinent part, that an access road is adequate if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">there is an appropriation for at least 30% of the construction cost with the remainder <em>programmed for construction </em>in the County\u2019s current adopted capital program or the current State consolidated transportation program for any additional roads or road improvements that in combination with existing roads and intersections would meet the [operational adequacy requirements] of this subsection.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASP\">County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-415(c)(2) (emphasis added). According to Respondents, our interpretation of \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d should mirror the use of that term in County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2^115 and should include only the construction of or improvement to facilities contained in the County\u2019s capital improvements program<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or, where applicable, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>prevailing State consolidated transportation program. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">On 18 July 1978, the Anne Arundel County Council (\u201cthe County Council\u201d) first enacted the \u201cAdequacy of Services and Facilities\u201d Article of the County Code for purposes of subdivision review. <em>See </em>Anne Arundel County Council, Bill No. 54-78 (18 July 1978). Similar to the AOF Part in effect at the time of final administrative action on Petitioner\u2019s application, the Article included a section, with multiple subsections, regarding the adequacy of water systems, storm drainage systems, sewerage systems, roads, schools, and fire suppression facilities. <em>See id. </em>As originally enacted, the \u201cRoads\u201d subsection provided, for purposes of final subdivision plat approval, that adequate access roads be in existence, the County have awarded a contract for their construction, or the subdivider agreed to undertake their construction. <em>See </em>Anne Arundel County Council, Bill No. 54-78, \u00a7 2. It did not provide that adequate access roads could be \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d as such.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In direct response to the 1978 enactment, the County Council amended, in the following year, the \u201cBoard of Appeals\u201d Title of the County Code to provide, in part, that \u201cin all cases of zoning reclassification,\u201d the zoning officer\u2019s memorandum \u201cshall include an affirmative finding\u201d that \u201c[tjransportation facilities, water and sewerage systems, storm drainage systems, schools and fire suppression facilities adequate, as defined in section 13-133 [ (the AOF section) ], to serve the uses allowed by reclassification are either existing or programmed for construction.\u201d Anne Arundel County Council, Bill No. 47-79, \u00a7 1 (15 May 1979). Although this appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>be the first time that the term \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d appeared in the Zoning Article of the Code, at the time of the amendment, Anne Arundel County had a capital program in place \u201cto receive and expend funds for capital projects\u201d <em>(see </em>Anne Arundel County Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 702-706 (1964)), and provided a definition of \u201ccapital improvements program\u201d in the Subdivision Article of the Code <em>(see </em>Anne Arundel County Council, Bill No. 76-69, \u00a7 2 (1 December 1969)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, absent a legislative indication to the contrary, we presume the County Council\u2019s choice of the word <em>\u201cprogrammed </em>\u201d in the rezoning subsection was directly related to the use of that term in the County\u2019s \u201ccapital improvements <em>program.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). <em>See Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 673, 659 A.2d 1347, 1350 (1995) (\u201cWhen a word susceptible of more than one meaning is repeated in the same statute or sections of a statute, it is presumed that it is used in the same sense.\u201d). <em>See also Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 346, 772 A.2d 1225, 1235 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[A]ll parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part, and all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>281 Md. 593, 596, 380 A.2d 1052, 1055 (1977)); <em>Whack, </em>338 Md. at 673, 659 A.2d at 1350 (\u201cWhen we are called upon to interpret two statutes that involve the same subject matter, have a common purpose, and form part of the same system, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>we read them <em>in pari materia </em>and construe them harmoniously\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">In support of this finding, following the amendment of the Board of Appeals process for zoning reclassifications, the County Council amended the \u201cRoads\u201d section of the AOF Part to provide, as the Code currently does, that a portion of the construction costs of adequate access roads could be \u201cprogrammed for construction in the County\u2019s current adopted capital program or the current State consolidated transportation program.\u201d <em>See </em>Anne Arundel County Council, Bill No. 72-86, \u00a7 2 (27 October 1986). Because the County Council did not define separately \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d at the time of this amendment of the \u201cRoads\u201d section, it is only appropriate to conclude that the drafters utilized the phrase in the \u201csame sense\u201d as in \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) of the rezoning requirements. <em>See Whack, </em>338 Md. at 673, 659 A.2d at 1350. As such, the expressed attributes of \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d in the \u201cRoads\u201d section reflect the County Council\u2019s intention that adequate facilities qualify as \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d at rezoning if evidence was adduced that the cost of constructing or improving those facilities needed to achieve adequacy (in the face of the actual and assumed impacts, including that of the proposed rezoning) was included in (1) the County\u2019s current adopted capital program, or, where state roads are concerned, (2) the current State consolidated transportation program. Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, there is no indication that the County Council intended that \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d also include at rezoning a third alternative available at the time of subdivision consideration.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>A literal across-the-board employment of the \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d requirement of \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3) in conjunction with the operational adequacy requirements of the AOF Part, however, is not without inherent limitation in its application. For example, as provided in the \u201cstorm drainage\u201d section of the AOF Part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">(b) A storm drainage system shall be considered adequate if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">(1) the on-site drainage system installed by the subdivi-der will be capable of conveying through and from the property the design flow of storm water runoff originating in the subdivision, as determined in accordance with criteria specified in the Design Manual, in addition to flows from upstream subdivisions for which plats have been recorded and other approved development and undeveloped land upstream in the natural watershed of the proposed subdivision, without resulting in erosion, sedimentation or flooding of the receiving channel and downstream properties; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8b\">County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2 \u2014 418(b)(1). Consistent with an interpretation of \u00a7 2 \u2014 105(a)(3) as thus far explained in this opinion, the above subsection would require that at rezoning a \u201ccapable\u201d on-site drainage system \u201cinstalled by the subdivi-der\u201d be \u201cprogrammed for construction\u201d in the County\u2019s capital improvements program. By its own terms, this interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>erroneously requires two incompatible levels of commitment to bring the adequate facilities to fruition \u2014 future installation by the subdivider and, at the same time, the potential dedication of governmental resources for the project. <em>See Triangle, </em>366 Md. at 425-26, 784 A.2d at 545 (explaining that it is \u201ca natural presumption that the Legislature \u2018does not intend to use words in vain or to leave a part of its enactment without sense or meaning, but intends that every part of it shall be operative.\u2019 It is for that reason that we avoid reading a statute in such a way as to render a word or phrase \u2018surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Welsh v.

As evidenced in the AOF Part, on-site facilities of a non-capital program nature traditionally are provided by the developer and typically are not constructed until the time of actual development. <em>See </em>County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-414(c)(2) (providing, as an alternative, that a \u201cproposed subdivision shall be considered to be adequately served by fire suppression facilities\u201d if \u201cthe subdivider will install a sufficient number of 5,000 gallon capacity underground water storage tanks so that no structure in the subdivision will be located more than 2,000 feet from a tank ....\u201d); County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-417(d) (mandating that a \u201cprivate community sewerage system shall be considered adequate if the design is authorized and approved by appropriate State and County authorities in accordance with\u201d the operational adequacy requirements of the sewerage section); County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-418(b)(l) (explaining that a \u201cstorm drainage system shall be considered adequate\u201d if \u201cthe on-site drainage system installed by the subdivider will be capable of conveying through and from the property the design flow of stormwater originating in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>subdivision\u201d and various flows from upstream); County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-419(d) (providing that a \u201cprivate community water supply system shall be considered adequate if the design and installation of the system is authorized and approved by appropriate State and County authorities in accordance with\u201d the operational adequacy requirements of the water section); County Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 2-419(e) (mandating that \u201cindividual water supply systems or multiuse water supply systems shall be considered adequate if the design and installation of the system is authorized and approved by appropriate State and County authorities\u201d).

By its own terms, therefore, \u00a7 2-105(a)(3) excludes from consideration at zoning as an acceptable level of commitment facilities that are characterized merely as \u201creasonably probable of fruition\u201d and/or those the provision of which at the time of subdivision may be proffered by the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In recognition of \u201c \u2018the fundamental right of a party to be apprised of the facts relied upon by [an administrative] agency,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bucktail, L.L.C. v.

(Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>added). Pursuant to that mandate, for example, the relationship of the existence of an approved community water supply system to the adequacy of fire suppression facilities should be made meaningfully explicit in the Board\u2019s decision. In the absence of that, we are unable to conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding regarding the adequacy of those facilities. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene v.

Specifically, although Petitioner offered general evidence regarding the adequacy of water systems,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it is not apparent on this record that the testimony was intended also to address the adequacy of fire suppression facilities. <em>See supra </em>pages 32-33.

It may be argued, with some persuasive force, that it is illogical to require that adequate facilities be in existence or programmed for construction in the County's capital improvements plan or the State's consolidated transportation program at rezoning when, later in the developmental process at subdivision, a developer\u2019s agreement to provide the facilities is deemed an acceptable alternative. The County\u2019s intent, as divined here, is not, however, a wholly irrational scheme. In particular, it provides a means for the County to regulate the public impacts of the development of property at the time of rezoning, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>also provides an assurance that, regardless ol' the development plan for the property, facilities will be adequate to serve the desired reclassification. It also precludes frustration of the County\u2019s capital improvements planning process by the introduction of unassuined capacity impacts. At subdivision, if the developer were to agree to provide the programmed improvement, the County may re-assign the public funds to another project and thereby indirect public benefits flow from the developer\u2019s provision of the facility. We note that this case does not present a situation where the County seeks to impose an adequacy of facilities test solely at the point of the building permit application stage.</p>\n<p id=\"AKi\">We need not dwell on whether the County's apparent choice to structure its zoning and subdivision adequacy of facilities requirements in this way could be more logical, more beneficent to the applicant's desires, or is in step with the way adjacent political subdivisions address the question.

Although the issue is unlikely to arise in practice, a distinction between publicly owned and privately owned off-site facilities is necessary here.
