The plaintiffs argue that the Department violated the federal Medicaid Act when it denied, based on the regulation, preauthorization for their respective \u201clife-saving\u201d liver transplant operations. They contend that for eligible persons under the age of 21, federal law requires only that the medical service be \u201cnecessary,\u201d and that the state regulation, by requiring that the service also be \u201cappropriate,\u201d adds an element not allowed by federal law. The plaintiffs maintain that, with regard to persons under the age of 21, the Department is prohibited from making determinations based, in part, on the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the procedure in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Before setting forth the facts of the case, we shall briefly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>review the medicaid program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress enacted the Medicaid Act in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C: \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq.; </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430-456. The Act was designed to enable states, as far as practicable, to furnish medical assistance to individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services. To that end, the Act established a medical assistance program, which is a jointly funded collaboration between the states and the federal government. It is a voluntary program, in which a state may elect, but is not compelled, to participate. When a state elects to participate in the medicaid program, it prepares and submits for approval by the federal Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that administers the Federal Medical Assistance Program, a state medicaid plan for the provision of medical assistance that complies with the federal Medicaid Act and with the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(a); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430-456. If the federal agency approves the state plan, then the state qualifies for federal funding, whereby the federal government will reimburse the state up to 50% of the cost of the medicaid program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(b). The federal Office of Inspector General periodically audits state operations to determine whether the operations are \u201ccost-efficient\u201d and whether \u201c[f]unds are being properly expended.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.33(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">While the federal government establishes broad policy, secures state compliance with the statute, and dispenses federal funds to supplement state spending on medicaid, there exists some latitude for each state to determine which of its citizens qualify for this form .of medical insurance and which services its program will provide. The state agency charged with dispensing the state medicaid program is responsible for interpreting, administering, and complying with federal medic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>aid statutes and regulations. Within broad federal rules, each state decides eligibility groups, types and range of services, payment levels for services, and administrative and operating procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Maryland has chosen to participate in the medicaid program. It does so through the Maryland Medical Assistance Program, operated by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol, 2001 Supp.) \u00a7 15-103 of the Health General Article. The program\u2019s director, or a designee, is responsible for the approval or denial of applications for preauthorization for payment. Preauthorization, or approval from the Department, is required before one can receive medical assistance benefits. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.09.06.01B(30).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Although the federal Medicaid Act only mandates that states provide medical assistance for those classified as \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s state plan is designed to provide comprehensive health care services for \u201ccategorically needy\u201d and \u201cmedically needy\u201d persons. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 15-201.1, 15-103 of the Health-General Article; COMAR 10.09.06.01B(21). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A), (C) (listing those who quality as \u201ccategorically\u201d and \u201cmedically\u201d needy, respectively). Under the Maryland Medicaid Plan, \u201ccategorically needy\u201d includes \u201caged, blind, or disabled persons, or families and children,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who are otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>who meet the financial eligibility requirements for FIP, SSI, or Optional State Supplement.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.02B(11). Essentially, \u201ccategorically needy\u201d persons are those whose income levels are so low that they qualify to receive cash assistance from an approved state program, and they cannot afford to pay for basic needs or medical assistance. The \u201cmedically needy,\u201d on the other hand, are \u201cpersons who are otherwise eligible for Medical Assistance, who are not categorically needy, and whose income and resources are within the limits set under the [sjtate [p]lan.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.02B(38). <em>See Jaffe v. Sharp, </em>463 F.Supp. 222 (D.Mass.1978) (defining the \u201cmedically needy\u201d as individuals and families whose income exceeds that of categorically needy but is nevertheless insufficient to cover medical care). Included among the \u201cmedically needy\u201d under the Maryland Medical Assistance Plan are persons under the age of 21. COMAR 10.09.24.03D(2). Taurus Jackson currently qualifies for medical assistance in Maryland as either categorically or medically needy, and he \u201cmay select any ... category for which technical eligibility may be established.\u201d COMAR 10.09.24.04M(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Taurus Jackson is under the age of 21 and, as pointed out above, is qualified for medicaid benefits. When Taurus was ten years old, he developed end stage liver disease. In July 1992, Taurus received preauthorization by the Department for a liver transplantation and underwent surgery, but the-new liver failed a month later. Consequently, in September 1992, Taurus was preauthorized by the Department for a second liver transplantation and again underwent surgery. During this period, Taurus had been placed in foster care facilities, and he was not always given his prescribed medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">About two and a half years later, in March 1995, Taurus was treated for chronic rejection but with minimal results. His liver function continued to deteriorate, and his primary health care provider, Johns- Hopkins Hospital, determined that Taurus was going to die without another liver transplant. The Hospital requested preauthorization for Taurus\u2019s third liver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>transplantation. In ruling on this request, the Department considered Taurus\u2019s complicated past post-operative recovery, whereby his own behavioral problems and the failure to adhere to medication requirements contributed to his previous liver failures. The Department denied the preauthorization request, stating that \u201ca third transplant was not necessary or appropriate for preapproval for reimbursement\u201d because Taurus \u201cremains at great risk for future transplant failure.\u201d The Hospital and Taurus requested that the Department reconsider, and the Department asked for supplemental information to be submitted regarding Taurus\u2019s psychiatric condition and related behavioral problems. Johns Hopkins Hospital submitted supplemental information that Taurus\u2019s psycho-social problems had improved, but the Department found that this information was insufficient. The Department again denied the preauthorization request, stating that Taurus\u2019s liver transplantation \u201cprocedure does not meet criteria for approval.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">On June 27, 1996, a matching liver was found for Taurus. Johns Hopkins Hospital, believing that the liver transplantation procedure was necessary in order to keep Taurus alive, performed at its own expense a successful transplant operation. Taurus remains alive today.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Jessica Nettles was 14 years old when she was diagnosed with liver failure, chronic hepatitis, and an immune deficiency disease. She was qualified for medicaid benefits. In January 1995, Johns Hopkins Hospital, which was Jessica\u2019s primary health care provider, requested and received preauthorization from the Department for a liver transplantation for Jessica. No liver became available during the 60 day authorization period, and, as a result, the preauthorization expired. Consequently, in June 1995, the Hospital sought recertification for a liver transplantation for Jessica. This time, the Department requested supplemental information regarding Jessica\u2019s other diagnosed medical problems and how they would affect her liver transplantation surgery and chances of recovery. Johns Hopkins Hospital submitted supplemental information and stated that the other diseases would not affect Jessica\u2019s chances of a successful liver transplantation. The Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>denied the recertification, stating that, because it could not predict how Jessica\u2019s other diseases would affect the liver transplantation surgery, it considered the \u201cliver transplant in [Jessica\u2019s] situation experimental.\u201d Johns Hopkins Hospital requested that the Department reconsider its decision, and the Hospital submitted additional information, including outside experts\u2019 opinions that Jessica would certainly die without the liver transplant and that the operation would be successful even in light of Jessica\u2019s other medical problems. Nevertheless, the Department again denied Jessica\u2019s preauthorization request, stating that her liver transplantation was not \u201cappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">On April 30,1996, Johns Hopkins Hospital was notified that a matching liver was available for Jessica. Since the Hospital believed that a liver transplant was the only way to reverse Jessica\u2019s end stage liver disease and to save her life, the Hospital at its own expense performed a transplantation that day. Jessica eventually died in September 1997 of liver failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In May 1998, Taurus Jackson and Jackie Vandergrift, personal representative of the estate of Jessica Nettles, by their next friend, Johns Hopkins Hospital, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Howard County against the Director of the Medical Care Financing and Compliance Division of the Medical Assistance Program, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department violated the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>by the application of COMAR 10.09.06.06C to requests for preauthor-ization of life-saving liver transplantation services for both Taurus and Jessica, and by the denial of preauthorization for the \u201cmedically necessary\u201d liver transplantations. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, relying upon the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as Maryland case-law. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested a declaration that COMAR 10.09.06.06C is invalid because it goes beyond what is authorized by federal law. They sought an injunction preventing the Department from further using CO-MAR 10.09.06.06C when making preauthorization decisions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>state covered services because of the regulation\u2019s allegedly illegal \u201cappropriateness\u201d requirement. The Department moved to dismiss, contending that (1) the case was moot, (2) the suit was barred by sovereign immunity, and (3) the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Circuit Court for Howard County, without any written declaration of rights or written opinion, assumed that the case was not moot and was not barred by sovereign immunity, but granted the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court did not explain why, in its view, the complaint failed to state a claim. The plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed on the ground that the case had become moot. The plaintiffs then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted. <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>359 Md. 668, 755 A.2d 1139 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The plaintiffs have emphasized that they are not seeking money damages or reimbursement for the expenses associated with Taurus\u2019s third liver transplant operation or Jessica\u2019s liver transplant operation, and that they are not seeking injunctive relief requiring payment for those operations. Instead, they are seeking \u201cprospective relief\u2019 in the form of a declaratory judgment and an injunction concerning the validity of COMAR 10.09.06.06C and the Department\u2019s requirement that the medical service be \u201cappropriate\u201d before it will preauthorize the service for children. (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 28). The Department in this Court reiterates the three arguments made in the courts below, namely that the case is moot, that sovereign immunity bars the action, and that the challenged regulation is not inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat this case is moot because [the children] have already received liver transplants from Hopkins .... \u201d The plaintiffs argue that the issue concerning the validity of the challenged regulation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cis justiciable because it is capable of repetition yet evades review. The Program has adopted a regulation that allows it, in violation of Federal law, to deny preauthorization of medically necessary transplantation services for children based on considerations of \u2018appropriateness.\u2019 The Program applied this regulation to JHH\u2019s requests to preauthorize medically necessary, life-saving liver transplantations for the Children, and denied preauthorization based on a cost-benefit analysis. The denial of preauthorization for transplantation services based on an illegal cost-benefit analysis evades review because a new preauthorization must be obtained every 60 days and the operation must be performed immediately as soon as the organ becomes available or the child will die. COMAR 10.09.06.06D. Further, this issue is capable of repetition because the Program has a permanent regulation authorizing it to deny medically necessary operations for children based on a cost-benefit analysis.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 20).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Department responds by arguing that the particular issue in this case is not \u201c \u2018capable of repetition\u2019 \u201d because each case involving a preauthorization request depends upon the \u201c \u2018factual circumstances\u2019 \u201d of that case. (Respondent\u2019s brief at 11). The Department also asserts that there are not very many preauthorization requests for transplant operations under the Maryland medicaid program, and that, if a similar issue arises in the future, \u201c \u2018there should be no difficulty in having it passed upon as a live issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12-13).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Although the action brought on behalf of the estate of Jessica Nettles is moot, Taurus Jackson\u2019s action challenging the validity of the Department\u2019s regulation is not moot. Moreover, Taurus Jackson\u2019s action does <em>not </em>fall into that \u201crare\u201d category of cases where \u201c[w]e have addressed moot questions when \u2018the public interest clearly will be hurt if the question is not immediately decided,\u2019 [and] if the issue is \u2018likely to recur frequently ....\u2019\u201d <em>In re Adoption No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 488, 687 A.2d 681, 695 (1997), quoting <em>Lloyd v. Supervisors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 43, 111 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>379, 382 (1954).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, in light of the relief being sought, Taurus Jackson\u2019s action represents a live controversy, and the suit is clearly allowed under Maryland and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Taurus is presently qualified for medicaid benefits, and he is under the age of 21. In light of Taurus\u2019s prior history, his present liver might well begin to fail, and Johns Hopkins Hospital would likely seek preauthorization for another liver transplant operation. Under these circumstances, Taurus and the Hospital would again face the strong possibility of having the preauthorization denied under the \u201cappropriate\u201d prong of COMAR 10.09.06.06C which, they contend, violates federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Maryland law expressly recognizes that these circumstances present a live controversy subject to a declaratory judgment action. The subtitle of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act dealing with agency regulations provides, in Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article, as follows (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c \u00a7 10-125. Declaratory judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">(a) <em>Petition authorized. </em>\u2014 (1)A person may file a petition for a declaratory judgment on the validity of any regulation, whether or not the person has asked the unit to consider the validity of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">(2) A petition under this section shall be filed with the circuit court for the county where the petitioner resides or has a principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">(b) <em>Authority to consider. </em>\u2014 A court may determine the validity of any regulation if it appears to the court that the regulation or its threatened application interferes with or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>impairs <em>or threatens to interfere with or impair a legal right or privilege of the petitioner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">(c) <em>Unit as party. </em>\u2014 The unit that adopted the regulation shall be made a party to the proceeding under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">(d) <em>Finding of invalidity.\u2014 </em>Subject to \u00a7 10-128 of this subtitle, the court shall declare a provision of a regulation invalid if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">(1) the provision violates any provision of the United States or Maryland Constitution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">(2) the provision exceeds the statutory authority of the unit; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">(3) the unit failed to comply with statutory requirements for adoption of the provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Taurus is a person who has filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of a regulation, and he contends that the application of the regulation \u201cthreatens to interfere with or impair a legal right or privilege\u201d of Taurus under the federal and state medicaid law. The legal issue, concerning the validity of a portion of the regulation, is a substantial one. In light of the past and present circumstances, there is a real possibility that the regulation may in the future be applied adversely to Taurus. This is precisely the type of controversy for which the cause of action under \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Moreover, a multitude of cases in this Court recognize the availability of actions for declaratory judgments or injunctions challenging the validity of statutes or regulations which may, in the future, be applied to or adversely affect the plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Maryland HMO\u2019s v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>356 Md. 581, 741 A.2d 483 (1999) (a member of an HMO, whose future medical insurance premiums might be affected by a hospital rate regulation methodology adopted by the Commission, may bring an action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction challenging the methodology adopted by that government agency); <em>Maryland Aggregates v.

Director, Department of Chesapeake Bay Affairs, </em>261 Md. 585, 276 A.2d 200 (1971) (a suit for a declaratory judgment and an injunction based on the invalidity of a state statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">As the above-cited cases illustrate, when a statute or a regulation such as COMAR 10.09.06.06C may adversely affect a plaintiff in the future, and when the plaintiff has standing to challenge the enactment, the plaintiffs action in a circuit court, against the appropriate government official or agency, for a declaratory judgment or injunction based on the alleged invalidity of the enactment, represents a live controversy. <em>See Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 390-391, 37 A.2d 880, 884 (1944), where this Court held that, when a plaintiff may be \u201cdirectly affected by the challenged statute,\u201d his declaratory judgment action attacking the statute is not \u201cmoot\u201d and that \u201c \u2018the controversy presented is ... real and substantial.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The above-cited cases are also dispositive of the Department\u2019s reliance upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Where a statute or regulation is invalid, sovereign immunity does not preclude a declaratory judgment action or suit for an injunction against the governmental official who is responsible for enforcing the statute or regulation. As Judge Delaplaine explained for the Court in <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>183 Md. at 389, 37 A.2d at 883, \u201cif a person is directly affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>by a statute, there is no reason why he should not be permitted to obtain a judicial declaration that the statute is unconstitutional.\u201d The Court in <em>Davis </em>went on to point out that, in addition, \u201ca court of equity has power to restrain the enforcement of a void statute or ordinance at the suit of a person injuriously affected.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Specifically with regard to sovereign immunity, the <em>Davis </em>opinion held (183 Md. at 393, 37 A.2d at 885):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cAlthough a State may not be sued without its consent, an officer of the State acting under color of his official authority may be enjoined from enforcing a State law claimed to be repugnant to the State or Federal Constitution, even though such injunction may cause the State law to remain inoperative until the constitutional question is judicially determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Police Comm\u2019n v.

In <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 356, 597 A.2d 432, 437 (1991), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cMoreover, as to a claim for prospective relief, a state officer or employee is a \u2018person\u2019 under \u00a7 1983 regardless of the capacity in which he is acting.

As previously mentioned, the Circuit Court assumed that this action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief was neither moot nor barred by sovereign immunity, and the court resolved the case on its merits. Instead of filing a written declaration of rights, however, the Circuit Court\u2019s decision consisted of a brief order stating that \u201cthe court finds [that] the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which the requested relief could be granted. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Even if we agreed with the Department that the challenged regulation did not violate federal law, we would be required to reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s decision for failure to file a written-declaratory judgment. The Court in <em>Harford Mutual v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-415, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997), explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cThis Court has reiterated time after time that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, \u2018the trial court must render a declaratory judgment.\u2019 <em>Christ v.

As this Court stated many years ago, \u2018whether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u2019 <em>Case v. Comptroller, </em>219 Md. 282, 288, 149 A.2d 6, 9 (1959). <em>See also, e.g., Christ v.

State Farm, </em>363 Md. 106, 117 n. 1, 767 A.2d 831, 837 n. 1 (2001), Judge Wilner for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cOnce again, we are presented with a declaratory judgment action in which there is no written declaratory judgment. We have admonished trial courts that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the court must enter a declaratory judgment and that judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the status of the thing in controversy, <em>must be in writing. </em>It is not permissible for the court to issue an oral declaration. The text of the judgment must be in writing. <em>See Harford Mutual Ins. Co. v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997); <em>Ashton v.

Nor, since the 1997 amendment to Maryland Rule 2-601(a), is it permissible for the declaratory judgment to be part of a memorandum. That rule requires that \u2018[e]ach judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.\u2019 When entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment. Although the judgment may recite that it is based on the reasons set forth in an accompanying memorandum, the terms of the declaratory judgment itself must be set forth separately. Incorporating by reference an earlier oral ruling is not sufficient, as no one would be able to discern the actual declaration of rights from the document posing as the judgment. This is not just a matter of complying with a hyper-technical rule. The requirement that the court enter its declaration in writing is for the purpose of giving the parties and the public fair notice of what the court has determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><em>See also, e.g., Baltimore v.

Doe, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 444, 97 S.Ct. at 2370, 53 L.Ed.2d at 472; <em>Miller v. Whitburn, </em>10 F.3d 1315, 1316-1317 (7th Cir.1993); <em>Pittman v. Secr., Florida Dept. of Health and Rehab.

These mandatory medical services include (1) inpatient hospital services; (2) outpatient hospital services; (3) laboratory and x-ray services; (4) nursing facility services for persons age 21 and over, early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (EPSDT services) for persons under the age of 21, and family planning services and supplies furnished to individuals of childbearing age; (5) physician services; (6) nurse-midwife services; and (7) nurse practitioner services. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(1-5), (17), (21). EPSDT services include certain screening, vision, dental, and hearing services (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396d(r)(1)-(4)) as well as \u201csuch other <em>necessary ... </em>treatment ... to correct or ameliorate ... conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>discovered by the screening services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(r)(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Maryland\u2019s EPSDT screening services provide \u201cpreventive health care ... including medical and dental services, in order to assess growth and development and to detect and treat health problems in medical assistance individuals under 21 years old.\u201d COMAR 10.09.23.01B(8).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The EPSDT program covers \u201call medically necessary services to correct physical and mental problems identified during the EPSDT screenings, that are allowable under the federal Medicaid program .... \u201d COMAR 10.09.23.05C.

The plaintiffs assert that Maryland wrongfully requires both a \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and an \u201cappropriate\u201d analysis, which resulted in the Department\u2019s denial of Taurus\u2019s and Jessica\u2019s preauthori-zation requests for their required liver transplantation procedures. Consequently, the plaintiffs insist that the Maryland program illegally adds a second criterion to the. liver trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>plantation preauthorization process \u2014 that the procedure not only be necessary, but also be <em>appropriate. </em>COMAR 10.09.06.06C.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The challenged regulation expressly states that preauthorization decisions are based upon an \u201cappropriateness\u201d analysis, which takes into consideration such factors as the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of the treatment. COMAR 10.09.06.06C.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cNecessary\u201d is defined as \u201cdirectly related to diagnostic, preventative, curative, palliative, or rehabilitative treatment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cAppropriate\u201d is defined as \u201can effective service that can be provided, taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the recipient and the relative cost of any alternative services which could be used for the same purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In measuring the \u201ceffectiveness,\u201d the plaintiffs assert that the Maryland program illegally focuses on the idiosyncrasies of each individual patient, thereby permitting the Department to claim that certain liver transplants are \u201cexperimental.\u201d These factors go beyond that which is considered \u201cnecessary,\u201d or that which is the \u201conly option for treatment\u201d in order to sustain lives!

Doe, supra, </em>432 U.S. at 441, 97 S.Ct. at 2369, 53 L.Ed.2d at 470. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). For example, regulations implementing the Medicaid Act require that each medical service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>provided by a state be \u201csufficient in amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 440.230(b). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(B), (C). A state may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service to an otherwise eligible recipient \u201csolely because of the diagnosis, type of illness, or condition.\u201d 42 C.F.R. 440.230(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Whether or not organ transplantations are a service that is required to be funded by the states, in accordance with the federal Act, has been the subject of some debate. Before 1985, the Medicaid Act contained no provision specifically covering organ transplantations. In 1985, however, Congress amended the Medicaid Act to add a provision specifically referring to them. In essence, the amendment merely delineates conditions for federal funding of organ transplants. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(i)(1). For example, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(i)(1) provides that a state must have written standards which embody the state\u2019s Medicaid plan regarding the coverage of organ transplants. Those state standards must guarantee that similarly situated individuals are treated alike, and any restrictions which the state imposes must assure accessibility of high quality care to all eligible individuals. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Maryland, however, has made it clear, through COMAR 10.09.06.04, that the state <em>will fund </em>organ transplantations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>more, \u201c \u2018once a state has adopted a policy to cover a category of organ transplants, it may not arbitrarily or unreasonably deny services to an otherwise eligible Medicaid recipient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dexter v. Kirschner, </em>984 F.2d 979, 984 (9th Cir.1992), quoting <em>Meusberger v. Palmer, </em>900 F.2d 1280, 1282 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">As the Court has stated, once Maryland elected to participate in the federal Medicaid program, it agreed to comply with all mandates provided in the federal Medicaid Act and other related provisions. The federal requirement most relevant to this appeal is that participating states are required to administer periodic medical screenings to persons under 21, and to provide medically necessary treatment for such ailments and conditions that are discovered during those screenings. The federal program makes no mention of utilizing an \u201cappropriateness\u201d analysis in determining whether a medicaid-eligible child should receive medically necessary treatments provided through EPSDT services. Nevertheless, the Maryland medicaid provision regarding preauthorization of services, COMAR 10.09.06.06C, requires that medically necessary treatment for a medicaid-eligible child must also be \u201cappropriate,\u201d which is beyond the dictates of federal law. The federal guidelines allow states no discretion to use an \u201cappropriateness\u201d test in deciding whether a person under 21 can receive medically necessary treatment. Therefore, because the provision imposes additional criteria upon qualified recipients, which illegally denies services to those who would normally receive medically necessary treatment, we agree with the plaintiffs that COMAR 10.09.06.06C is partially invalid under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND C\u00c1SE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\n<em>FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">.
