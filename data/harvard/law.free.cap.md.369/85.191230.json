Glynn of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Md. Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 16-711(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">After an evidentiary hearing held on 24 September 2001, the hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16, and 8.4(d). Petitioner, pursuant to Md. Rule 16-711(b)(2)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, filed with this Court exceptions to the findings of facts and conclusions of law, and a recommendation for sanction (2 year suspension and specific conditions for reinstatement). Respondent filed a reply to Petitioner\u2019s exceptions and a recommendation for sanction (urging an unspecified \u201cremedial form of sanction,\u201d though earlier he proposed a conditional public reprimand).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">From the evidentiary record below, the hearing judge, in a memorandum dated 11 October 2001, explained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANc\">In his complaint, Bar Counsel contends that the Respondent engaged in professional misconduct as defined by Rule 16-701 (k) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure in cases involving: Renee B. Johnson [ (for her son, Artinus Shands) ], Darr[o]n C. Addison, Lillian Johnson, Samuel C. Veney, D[ruce]lla Mann, Diane Postal and Robert Yinger, in two (2) separate matters. At hearing, Bar Counsel voluntarily dismissed the allegations with respect to Samuel C. Veney. It should be noted that the Mann, Postal, and Yinger cases were brought to the attention of Bar Counsel voluntarily by Respondent. All of the matters which remain for consideration by the Court were civil matters. It is undisputed that these cases were either dismissed for want of prosecution or barred by limitations as a result of Respondent\u2019s professional lapses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During all relevant periods, the Respondent did not maintain professional liability insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Bar Counsel alleges that Respondent behaved unethically and unprofessionally in violations of the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">Rule 1.1 Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Rule 1.16 Declining or Terminating Representation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apq\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">By pleading, Respondent admits Ms violation of Rule 1.1 but adds that at all times he \u201cwould deny that he does not possess the required legal knowledge or skill to competently represent his clients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Respondent admits the alleged violation of Rule 1.3 regarding Diligence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">Respondent admits the alleged violation of Rule 1.4 regarding Communications; only with respect of sub[ Jsection (a), but denies violating subparagraph (b) of the Rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">Respondent admits violating Rule 8.4 regarding Misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">Respondent denies that he violated Rule 1.16 regarding Declining or Terminating Representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Continuing, the hearing judge noted that \u201cRespondent\u2019s presentation focused on the issue of mitigation,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and summarized his evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">[Respondent] called as witnesses, Richard E. Vincent, Director of Lawyer Counseling for the Lawyer Assistance Committee of the Bar; and Dr. John E. Davis, an expert in psychiatry<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and substance abuse. He also testified on Ms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>own behalf regarding his personal history with particular emphasis on his contention that his abuse of cocaine was at the root of his professional derelictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Both expert witnesses and Respondent contended that the root cause of Respondent's] professional failures was his drug abuse. They emphasized that he cooperated fully with Bar Counsel, apologized for his failings, and offered to make his clients whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">Richard Vincent contended that in cases involving drug abuse, it is particularly important that a \u201chammer\u201d continue to hang over the head of the drug abuser to ensure continued compliance with a program that requires the avoidance of drug use. Both witnesses stated that during the period of his professional derelictions, the Respondent was struggling through a very bad divorce, and for a time was involved in an additional relationship which he found emotionally overwhelming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">Likewise, they testified that they had worked extensively with Respondent and that he had \u201cembraced the recovery program.\u201d He continues to be supervised by Dr. Davis to insure that he not use illegal drugs and regularly attends therapy and meetings of Narcotics Anonymous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">Dr. Davis believed that the Respondent\u2019s use of drugs, in the context of his family and social problems, created a psychological state of extreme distractibility. Dr. Davis concluded that it was Respondent\u2019s drug use that caused him to miss various filing deadlines resulting in the dismissal of all lawsuits in the cases alleged by Bar Counsel. However, he testified that since seeking drug treatment and acknowledging his drug abuse problems which date back to the mid 90\u2019s, he is now handling only criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">Respondent\u2019s defaults occurred principally between the period of 1998 and 2000. Earlier, he was functioning effectively as an attorney. Respondent emphasized that he feels great remorse and hopes to compensate his former clients for the consequences of his failures. Also, he indicated that he was amenable to supervision by another attorney, if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>were permitted to continue to practice law in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Based on the evidence presented and inferentially satisfied to a clear and convincing standard, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent \u201cviolated the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged, with the exception of Rule 1.4(b) with respect to which,\u201d the hearing judge found \u201cno specific evidence was offered.\u201d In addition, although Respondent \u201cchallenged the allegations concerning Rule 1.16,\u201d the judge found that \u201cthe record support[ed] a finding that he violated th[at] rule.\u201d It was \u201cplain\u201d to the hearing judge, \u201cthat [Respondent\u2019s] continued representation of clients was impaired by the use of drugs, thereby violating the rules of professional conduct.\u201d \u201cAccordingly,\u201d he found \u201cRespondent in violation of Rules 1.1, 1.3,1.4(a), 1.16, and 8.4[ (d) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The hearing judge went on to explain that \u201c[t]he central issue in this case eoncem[ed] whether the Respondent\u2019s drug abuse was the root cause of subsequent professional derelictions.\u201d On that issue, the hearing judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARk\">[t]he record clearly establishes, and the Court is persuaded by [a] preponderance of the evidence, that for two decades Mr. Garfield practiced criminal law successfully in the courts of the State of Maryland and was regarded both by his fellow practitioners and the Bench as an asset to the Bench, Bar and Community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">The Court is persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent\u2019s professional failures were substantially the result of drug abuse. While he may have struggled with his domestic and relationship problems, it was his drug abuse that pushed him across the line which separates those who struggle and succeed, if only barely, from those who fail....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Respondent\u2019s expert witnesses and the testimony of Respondent support these findings. They are also supported by the timing of Respondent[\u2019]s failures which seem related to his most severe drug abuse, and by the nature of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>failures, which seem the product of his inability to focus on detailed office responsibilities. This is particularly true in those areas of the law which he was the least experienced and expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">The Court will not presume to speculate about exactly how Respondent\u2019s other struggles played into his addiction, and how they all worked to undermine his professionalism. It seems plain on this record in this case, that but for drug abuse, Respondent would have been an unlikely candidate for professional discipline. (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Respondent filed no exceptions to the hearing judges findings of fact or conclusions of law. On 29 October 2001, Respondent recommended a sanction of a public reprimand subject to \u201ccontinued drug therapy,\u201d monitoring by Mr. Vincent\u2019s office, limitation of his practice to criminal law, and \u201csupervision by an attorney subject to reporting requirements to Bar Counsel.\u201d Petitioner, on 2 November 2001, filed with the Court exceptions challenging the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he was \u201c \u2018persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent\u2019s professional failures were substantially the result of drug abuse.\u2019 \u201d According to Petitioner, the hearing judge\u2019s findings \u201c[we]re inconsistent with the evidence from the Respondent\u2019s own testimony and the testimony from Respondent\u2019s own expert.\u201d Based on Standard 4.42 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Petitioner recommended a sanction of a two year suspension from the practice of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On 20 November 2001, Respondent filed a reply to Petitioner\u2019s exceptions disagreeing \u201cwith Petitioner\u2019s claim that [the hearing judge\u2019s] findings were inconsistent with the evidence,\u201d and suggesting \u201cthat a remedial form of sanction would be more appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">We recently explained in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 253, 793 A.2d 515, 521 (2002), that \u201c[a]s the Court of original and complete jurisdiction for attorney disciplinary proceedings in Maryland, we conduct an independent review of the record.\u201d (Citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997)). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 288, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002) (quoting Garland). \u201cThe hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact will be accepted unless we determine that they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sachse, </em>345 Md. 578, 589, 693 A.2d 806, 811 (1997) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Boyd, </em>333 Md. 298, 303, 635 A.2d 382, 384 (1994))). As to \u201cthe hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, however, \u2018our consideration is essentially <em>de novo,\u2019 </em>as \u2018the ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 322, 786 A.2d 763, 768 (2001) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe, </em>357 Md. 554, 562, 745 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 473 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The only exception in this matter was taken by Petitioner regarding the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s \u201cprofessional failures were substantially the result of drug abuse.\u201d This exception relates to whether we should treat Respondent\u2019s drug addiction as a mitigating factor in our determination of the appropriate sanction for Respondent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">When considering sanctions, it is well settled that: [t]he purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. The public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of this legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. By imposing such a sanction, this Court fulfills its responsibility to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the Bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates the disciplinary rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dunietz, </em>368 Md. 419, 428, 795 A.2d 706, 711 (2002) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 289, 793 A.2d at 542-43 (citations omitted)). <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 642, 790 A.2d 621, 626 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 405, 784 A.2d 516, 532-33 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 31-32, 762 A.2d 950, 966 (2000). \u201c \u2018Of course, what the appropriate sanction for the particular misconduct is, in the public interest, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 428-29, 795 A.2d at 711 (citation omitted), and \u201ctak[es] account of any particular aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 481 (1996) (citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In this case, the hearing judge, based on evidence presented by Respondent, found that Respondent\u2019s professional failures \u201cwere substantially the result\u201d of his drug abuse. That finding is significant because we \u201chave recognized addiction to drugs as a mitigating factor when the addiction is \u2018to a substantial degree responsible for the conduct of the attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mandel, </em>316 Md. 197, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>201, 557 A.2d 1329, 1331 (1989). Indeed, even in cases otherwise warranting disbarment, we have held that \u201c \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 \u201d specifically, \u201cserious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions,\u201d including drug addiction, can justify a lesser sanction. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Williams, </em>335 Md. 458, 474, 644 A.2d 490, 497 (1994) (\u201cWe have said that a sanction less severe than disbarment is not warranted absent evidence that the addiction, to a substantial extent, was the responsible, precipitating and root cause of the misappropriation.\u201d). Petitioner took exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding on this matter, maintaining that his finding was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Respondent\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Respondent\u2019s expert. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"> As we explained at <em>supra </em>page 97, we review the factual findings of a hearing judge under a clearly erroneous standard. In determining whether the findings here meet that standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">we recognize that the judge \u201cmay elect to pick and chose which evidence to rely upon\u201d and that \u201can attorney in a disciplinary proceeding need only establish factual matters in defense of an attorney\u2019s position by the preponderance of evidence, including whether mitigating circumstances existed at the time of the alleged misconduct.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hines, </em>366 Md. 277, 291, 783 A.2d 656, 664 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17-18, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In rendering his finding regarding Respondent\u2019s substance abuse, the hearing judge relied, in part, on the testimony of Dr. Davis (Respondent\u2019s therapist and an expert in psychology with a focus on substance abuse) and Mr. Vincent (director of the Lawyer Assistance Program for the Maryland State Bar Association), both of whom emphatically stated that, but for his addiction, Respondent would not have perpetrated the seven instances of professional misconduct admitted to have occurred here. In particular, when asked his opinion \u201cas to whether there was a connection\u201d between Respondent\u2019s substance abuse and the miscondhct \u201calleged in Bar Counsel\u2019s petition,\u201d Dr. Davis described it as \u201ca one-to-one correlation.\u201d According to Dr. Davis,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">[t]he connection is that once you begin to use these substances and use them in large doses or use them regularly, it begins to create changes in brain function. And the changes that occur in brain function are primarily distracti-bility so that when you\u2019re using these drugs, they have not only an acute effect, that is the effect from the drug that\u2019s in the blood stream, but they have a post-acute effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">... They injure the brain networks and the networks don\u2019t work right, and it takes a while for the body to heal and repair these. He gave a history of repeated use of these drugs, of the cocaine to go up, the tranquilizers to come down so he could sleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">And that kind of up and down creates disruption of the normal function of the brain pathways. But the practical result of that is that you spend an inordinate amount of time just kind of controlling yourself and functioning. And the niceties that we normally look out [sic] that require higher brain function are not working very well. And when you\u2019re hung over, you\u2019re not functioning very well in other aspects of your life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>... [H]e was not as attentive on his game under those conditions as he would be normally, and so several of these cases fell through the cracks, and it\u2019s perfectly understandable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion, \u201cbased on thirty years of experience,\u201d \u201cbut for the substance abuse, [Respondent] would not have had these problems.\u201d \u201c[I]f you take the drug out of it,\u201d Dr. Davis explained, Respondent \u201cwould have been able to function. When you add that and you incapacitate him physically and mentally with the drugs and the substances and the acute and post-acute effects of the drugs, then not many people could deal with that. And he couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Likewise, Mr. Vincent testified that \u201cat one time\u201d Respondent\u2019s failure to file complaints and prosecute cases \u201cdidn\u2019t happen in his practice.\u201d According to Mr. Vincent, when he \u201clooked for a cause\u201d of Respondent\u2019s professional problems, \u201csubstance abuse reared its ugly head, and there it was. These things didn\u2019t happen earlier.\u201d Thus, Respondent\u2019s substance abuse was \u201cthe only cause\u201d Mr. Vincent pin-pointed for the professional failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Based on this testimony, it was not clearly erroneous for the hearing judge to conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Respondent\u2019s drug addiction caused his professional failures in the seven personal injury cases. Respondent provided clear and convincing evidence, through the testimony of his witnesses, that he suffered from a drug addiction and that his escalating addiction caused him to violate the MRPC as charged. We overrule Petitioner\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s finding on that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">We turn to the determination of the appropriate sanction to impose for Respondent\u2019s violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16, and 8.4(d). Citing Standard 4.42 of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, <em>see supra </em>note 11, Bar Counsel recommends that Respondent be suspended for two years from the practice of law, that his reinstatement be conditioned upon his submitting proof that each of his clients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in the personal injury matters \u201chave been made whole or have otherwise had their losses satisfied,\u201d and that, if reinstated, he continue to be monitored \u201cby the lawyer counseling committee of the Maryland State Bar Association with quarterly reports to Bar Counsel for a period of two years subsequent to\u201d his reinstatement. Respondent, we suppose, urges us to impose a public reprimand, subject to his continued drug therapy, monitoring by the Lawyer Assistance Program for the Maryland State Bar Association, a limitation' his practice be confined to criminal law, and supervision by an attorney subject to reporting requirements to Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In determining the appropriate sanction in attorney grievance actions, we may consider a number of mitigating factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 330, 786 A.2d at 772-73 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Tolar, </em>357 Md. 569, 584-85, 745 A.2d 1045, 1053-54 (2000) (issuing a public reprimand for an attorney\u2019s client neglect and failure to communicate where the attorney was \u201c \u2018well respected\u2019 \u201d and had remorse for her misconduct)). The application of varying sanctions in cases involving client neglect can be explained by this Court\u2019s appraisal of the mitigating and aggravating factors in the individual cases. Generally, if there are a number of mitigating factors present, or an absence of aggravating factors, we are apt to find that a less severe sanction will serve our stated purpose of protecting the public. <em>See, e.g., Tolar, </em>357 Md. at 585, 745 A.2d at 1053-54 (citing the attorney\u2019s \u201cremorse for her misconduct\u201d and holding that a public reprimand would \u201cserve the purpose of protecting the public just as well as a short suspension\u201d); <em>Brugh, </em>353 Md. at 479, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>727 A.2d at 915 (finding that an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in one year was not merited where the attorney did not fail to cooperate with Bar Counsel and did not misappropriate funds). In cases involving the presence of highly aggravating factors, for instance where an attorney avoids, ignores, or does not cooperate with Bar Counsel or misappropriates client funds, we are more inclined to impose a more severe sanction than in those cases in which, for example, the attorney was cooperative with Bar Counsel throughout the attorney grievance process or did not misappropriate funds. <em>Compare Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 430-31, 795 A.2d at 711-12; <em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545 <em>with Brugh, </em>353 Md. at 479, 727 A.2d at 915. <em>See also Brugh, </em>353 Md. at 479, 727 A.2d at 915 (explaining that in <em>David, </em>331 Md. 317, 628 A.2d 178 (1993), a harsher sanction was imposed because \u201cthere were two other aggravating circumstances,\u201d specifically, \u201cthe lawyer failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel, and, in one case, he received funds belonging to the client and failed to remit them in a timely manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">There are both mitigating and aggravating factors in this case. In Respondent\u2019s favor, there is no indication that he acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, he admittedly was suffering from personal problems at the time of his violations, and he has displayed a great deal of remorse for his actions. In addition, Respondent has maintained a cooperative attitude throughout these proceedings, evidenced, in part, by his voluntarily providing to Bar Counsel the names of three additional clients whose cases he neglected, and has indicated a desire to remediate the consequences of his neglect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Upon accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the hearing judge\u2019s findings regarding Respondent\u2019s drug addiction, <em>see supra </em>pages 100-101, the scope of Respondent\u2019s sanction is also mitigated by the existence of his addiction, which was found to have caused his professional failures, and by his current effort to seek treatment for his addiction. We have \u201clong recognized ... that rehabilitative efforts by an attorney may mitigate the severity of misconduct not warranting disbarment.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gilbert, </em>856 Md. 249, 256, 739 A.2d 1, 5 (1999) (citing <em>Kenney, </em>339 Md. at 588, 664 A.2d at 858-59). In this case, Respondent has demonstrated an intention to rehabilitate himself and is participating in a recovery program.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Regarding aggravating factors, the record reveals that on 1 September 1999, Respondent received a private reprimand for failing to expunge two criminal records. In addition, Respondent has \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law,\u201d <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 396 n. 10, 794 A.2d at 105 n. 10 (citation omitted), and the violations at issue here involve multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>offenses, specifically the violation of five of the MRPC in his representation of six clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Considering all of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the appropriate sanction to be imposed in this matter is an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in thirty (30) days. Due to the nature of Respondent\u2019s offenses, his admitted inability to perform his professional duties, and our obligation to impose a sanction which will \u201cprotect the public\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate! ] to members of this legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated,\u201d <em>Dunietz, </em>368 Md. at 428, 795 A.2d at 711 (citation omitted), we are unwilling to accept Respondent\u2019s recommended sanction of a public reprimand. At the same time, however, \u201c[w]e are not unmindful of the benefits of returning a rehabilitated attorney to the productive practice of law,\u201d and recognize that we \u201ccould be doing a disservice by forever barring\u201d Respondent from \u201creturning to the practice of law\u201d or by prolonging his absence to such an extent that it would be difficult for him to return. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Our sanction, therefore, takes cognizance of the particular circumstances in this case, but also gives due regard to our obligation to protect the public, by ensuring that Respondent does not reenter the practice of law until he demonstrates and provides relative assurance that he is capable of doing so successfully. In seeking reinstatement, attention should be given to the matters underlying the various conditions proposed by the parties in their sanction recommendations here.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715(0, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST CRAIG STEVEN GARFIELD; RESPONDENT\u2019S SUSPENSION SHALL COMMENCE THIRTY DAYS FROM THE FILING OF THIS OPINION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">.
