McCoy, the respondent, a member of the Delaware bar, by the Supreme Court of Delaware, pursuant to a complaint filed by clients, whom the respondent represented in a medical malpractice action, and with one of whom he had financial dealings, filed a Petition For Disciplinary Action against the respondent, charging the respondent with various, and multiple, violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812, seeking reciprocal and other sanctions.

Noel, of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, for hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>16-711.a.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Following the hearing, the hearing court made findings of fact, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u201cBC Docket No. 2000-472-00-8</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">Complaint of Jane and Wayne Nock</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u201cOn or about June 24, 1999, the Respondent filed a civil action in the Circuit court for Baltimore City on behalf of his clients, Jane C. and Wayne E. Nock (hereafter \u201cthe Nocks\u201d). The Nocks, residents of Delaware, were suing Walker L. Robinson, M.D. Dr. Robinson practiced medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. On or about December 8, 1999, Dr. Robinson filed an Answer to the Complaint. Thereafter, the Respondent failed to pursue the litigation on behalf of the Nocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cThe Respondent failed to comply with the Circuit Court\u2019s Scheduling Order with regard to the designation of expert witnesses and failed to communicate with the Nocks concerning the status of their litigation. The Respondent abandoned the Nocks without explanation or advice, failed to notify the Nocks of his decertification by the Court of Appeals on April 12, 2000,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> failed to withdraw his appearance and failed to appear at hearings set by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u201cBC Docket No. 2001-269-00-3</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">Complaint of Bar Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u201cBy Opinion and Order of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware dated January 17, 2001, Respondent was found to have violated the Delaware Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (DLRPC), specifically, DLRPC 1.2(a), failing to abide by a client\u2019s decision, DLRPC 1.3, failing to act with diligence and promptness in representing a client, DLRPC 1.15(a), commingling funds, DLRPC 1.15(b), failing to promptly deliver funds to a client upon request, DLRPC 1.15(d), failing to maintain proper books and records, DLRPC 1.16(d), failing to take reasonable steps to protect a client\u2019s interest upon termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>nation of representation, DLRPC 3.4(c), knowingly disobeying the Court of Chancery\u2019s Order to cooperate with the Receivers and knowingly refusing to fulfill his annual registration obligations, DLRPC 8.1(b), willfully failing to respond to the office of Disciplinary Counsel\u2019s request for information, and DLRPC 8.4(d), engaging in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u201cThe facts underlying the findings of the Delaware Court are as follows. On or about July 1998, the Respondent began giving Jane Nock advice with regard to her business, Delaware Heritage Basket Company (hereafter \u201cDHB\u201d). In return for his legal services, Ms. Nock offered to give the Respondent twenty-five percent (25%) of the business. In August 1998, Ms. Nock\u2019s business checking account was closed by her bank due to a series of checks having been written with insufficient funds. Respondent allowed checks and deposits relating to DHB to be processed through one of his bank accounts. Client funds were commingled with the Respondent\u2019s own funds and transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u201cIn September 1998, Ms. Nock\u2019s financial difficulties became acute as the police seized her records and her arrest was imminent. She apparently had a falling out with Respondent and retained new counsel, John Sandy. Mr. Sandy then sought return from Respondent of all funds being held in his possession on behalf of Ms. Nock.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201cAlthough Respondent recognized that he owed Ms. Nock money in December 1998, the Respondent did not pay these funds until June 1999 when the Delaware Office of Disciplinary Counsel instructed him to do so. Because Respondent did not maintain adequate records relating to Ms. Nock\u2019s business, the amount that Respondent calculated he owed Ms. Nock could not be substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u201cIn another matter, the Respondent represented Joseph Mascelli during the period November 1997 to April 1999 in the matter of a judgment entered against Mr. Mascelli in connection with a debt on a lease of commercial real estate. Respondent failed to carry out his client\u2019s instructions to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>matter and, as a result, subjected his client to actions by the sheriff against his assets. Respondent failed to return promptly the seven hundred fifty dollar ($750) retainer paid by Mr. Mascelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u201cThe Respondent failed to respond in a timely manner to requests by the Delaware Office of Disciplinary Counsel with regard to both the Nock and the Mascelli matters and failed to provide the Supreme Court of Delaware with the required 1999 annual registration statement or to pay the required registration assessment. On July 13, 1999, the Supreme Court held a hearing on a rule to show cause why the Respondent should not be suspended from practice. The Respondent failed to appear and the Supreme Court of Delaware issued an Order suspending Respondent indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u201cThereafter, Respondent failed to communicate with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and, on July 16, 1999, two Receivers were appointed by the Court of Chancery. The Order specifically obliged Respondent to cooperate with and assist the Receivers in notifying and protecting the interests of his clients. Respondent failed to cooperate with or assist the Receivers, failed to respond to repeated attempts by the Receivers to communicate with him about receivership matters, failed to promptly provide the Receivers, upon their repeated requests, with his active client files and related information about pending client matters or with certain accounting records for his law practice, and failed to provide the Receivers with access to his law office so that the Receivers could readily obtain client files and other information needed to carry out their obligations pursuant to the Court of Chancery\u2019s Order. Respondent also failed to assist the Receivers in their efforts to deal with his non-compliant real estate escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s conduct resulted in a great burden to the Receivers and was prejudicial to the interests of his clients, many of whom were in bankruptcy, in their active legal matters. The Respondent\u2019s lack of cooperation and failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>turn over account ledgers made it difficult for the Receivers to make a determination as to refunds owed to clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On these findings, the hearing court concluded, as to the Nocks\u2019 complaint, that the respondent violated each of the rules charged, except 1.16 and 8.1, as to which it made no findings at all. As, to Bar Counsel\u2019s complaint, noting that, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-710.e, a final adjudication in a disciplinary proceeding by a judicial tribunal as to an attorney\u2019s guilt of misconduct is conclusive proof of that misconduct, and thus clear and convincing evidence of its commission, the healing court concluded that the respondent violated the Maryland Rules corresponding to those that the Delaware Supreme Court had determined that the respondent had violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">No exceptions have been taken to the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The petitioner has, however, recommended a sanction, that the respondent be disbarred. This sanction is justified, the petitioner submits, by the findings of the hearing court in the Nocks\u2019 matter, as well as by the findings of the Delaware Supreme Court in the reciprocal discipline case. In addition, the petitioner informs us that the respondent has a prior history of disciplinary action, this Court, in 1998, having previously reprimanded the respondent, who consented to that sanction after he had been found by the Supreme Court of Delaware to have violated that State\u2019s counterparts of Maryland Rules 1.3, 1.4 and 8.4(a)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The findings of fact made by the hearing court are reviewed to determine if they are based on clear and convincing evidence, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 287, 614 A.2d 102, 108 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 298, 572 A.2d 174, 179 (1990). Indeed, the \u201chearing court\u2019s findings of fact are prima facie correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>and will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997) (citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 347, 624 A.2d 503, 505 (1993)). Moreover, in reciprocal discipline cases, as the hearing court noted, \u201c[al final adjudication in a disciplinary proceeding by a judicial tribunal ... that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct is conclusive proof of the misconduct in the hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule.\u201d Rule 16-710(e). <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n of Md. v. Richardson, </em>350 Md. 354, 365-66, 712 A.2d 525, 530-31 (1998); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gittens, </em>346 Md. 316, 324, 697 A.2d 83, 87 (1997); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Willcher, </em>340 Md. 217, 221-22, 665 A.2d 1059, 1061 (1995); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Saul, </em>337 Md. 258, 267-68, 653 A.2d 430, 434 (1995); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hopp, </em>330 Md. 177, 185-86, 623 A.2d 193, 197 (1993); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sparrow, </em>314 Md. 421, 425-26, 550 A.2d 1150, 1152 (1987); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Parsons, </em>310 Md. 132, 142-43, 527 A.2d 325, 330 (1987); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Haupt, </em>306 Md. 612, 614-15, 510 A.2d 590, 591-92 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bettis, </em>305 Md. 452, 455, 505 A.2d 492, 493 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 171, 482 A.2d 497, 498 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Rosen, </em>301 Md. 37, 39, 481 A.2d 799, 800 (1984). There is sufficient evidence to support the hearing court\u2019s findings with respect to the Nocks\u2019 matter. Consequently, those findings are not clearly erroneous. In addition, that the respondent was found, by the Supreme Court of Delaware, to have engaged in misconduct conclusively establishes that he engaged in that misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">This brings us to the determination of the appropriate sanction to be imposed. To be sure, the Nocks\u2019 complaint is not a reciprocal discipline matter and is separate from the reciprocal discipline complaint. Nevertheless, we will address the latter first because the Delaware Supreme Court imposed the ultimate sanction of disbarment and if we, as we often do, impose the same sanction, there will be no need further to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>consider another sanction for the misconduct in which the respondent engaged in the Nocks\u2019 matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">This Court has often imposed sanctions, in reciprocal discipline cases, of facially equal severity to those imposed by a sister state, <em>see, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sabghir, </em>350 Md. 67, 83, 710 A.2d 926, 934 (1998); <em>Richardson, </em>350 Md. at 365-66, 712 A.2d at 530-31; <em>Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 324, 697 A.2d at 87; <em>Bettis, </em>305 Md. 452, 505 A.2d 492; <em>Moore, </em>301 Md. 169, 482 A.2d 497; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>300 Md. 297, 305-06, 477 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hines, </em>304 Md. 625, 500 A.2d 646 (1985); <em>Rosen, </em>301 Md. 37, 481 A.2d 799. We have pointed out, however, that there is no requirement that this should be done, that we need not impose the same sanction as that imposed by the jurisdiction in which the misconduct occurred. <em>See Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 324, 697 A.2d at 87. In fact, we have instructed that this Court is duty-bound to assess for itself the propriety of the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction and that recommended by the petitioner. <em>Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 326, 697 A.2d at 88. Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cWhen the Court considers the appropriate sanction in a case of reciprocal discipline, we look not only to the sanction imposed by the other jurisdiction but to our own cases as well. The sanction will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case, but with a view toward consistent dispositions for similar misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>Willcher, </em>340 Md. at 222, 665 A.2d at 1061 (1995) (quoting <em>Parsons, </em>310 Md. at 142, 527 A.2d at 330). We have deferred to the action taken by the jurisdiction in which the misconduct occurred where the purpose of attorney discipline is the same in both jurisdictions. <em>Gittens, </em>346 Md. at 327, 697 A.2d at 88. In any event, the burden is on the respondent to demonstrate \u2014 in Maryland, the burden of establishing factual matters in defense must be carried by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d <em>Powell, </em>328 Md. at 288, 614 A.2d at 109; <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>322 Md. 603, 605, 589 A.2d 52, 53 (1991)\u2014that less severe discipline than that imposed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>other jurisdiction, or no discipline, should be imposed in this State. <em>People v. Calder, 897 P.2d </em>831, 832 (Colo.1995); <em>The Florida Bar v. Friedman, </em>646 So.2d 188, 190 (Fla.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">In the reciprocal discipline case, the misconduct occurred in Delaware. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the purpose of attorney discipline in Delaware differs from that in Maryland. Indeed, Delaware authority demonstrates that it is, in fact, the same. <em>See In re Kevin M. Howard, 765 </em>A.2d 39, 45 (Del.2000) (\u201cThe goals of lawyer discipline are to protect the public, to protect the administration of justice, and to preserve confidence in the legal profession.... Furthermore, the punishment imposed by the Court also must deter other lawyers from similar misconduct.) (Footnote omitted). <em>See also In re Figliola, 652 </em>A.2d 1071, 1076 (Del.1995). And the respondent, who, as we have seen, did not appear in these proceedings, has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that a less severe sanction should be imposed in these proceedings than that imposed in the proceedings in the State of Delaware. Considering the particular facts and circumstances of this reciprocal discipline case, with a view toward consistent dispositions in such cases, as we must, including the seriousness of the misconduct found to have been engaged in, we conclude that deferring to the jurisdiction where the misconduct occurred is appropriate in this case and that the appropriate sanction in this case is that imposed by the Supreme Court of Delaware, namely disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715(c), FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST THOMAS V.
