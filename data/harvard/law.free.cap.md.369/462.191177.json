Powell, respondent, alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (hereinafter \u201cMRPC\u201d). The Commission charged respondent with violating MRPC Rules 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 16-607 (Commingling of Funds),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.4(c) and (d) (Misconduct),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>8.1(a) and (b) (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court referred the matter to Judge Paul A. McGuckian of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16 709(b) and 16-711(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Judge McGuckian made the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>\u201cProcedural Background</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">\u201cOn February 27, 2001, the Court of Appeals of Maryland ordered that the charges contained in the Petition for Disciplinary Action filed by the Attorney Grievance Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>mission of Maryland, Petitioner, in this matter be transmitted to this Court to be heard and determined in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-709 <em>et seq. </em>On April 20, 2001, the Respondent, Robert D. Powell, was served with the Petition for Disciplinary Action, the Order of the Court of Appeals, a Writ of Summons issued by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County directing Respondent to file a written response to the Petition within fifteen (15) days of service. On April 20, 2001, Respondent was also served with Petitioner\u2019s Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions of Fact and Genuineness of documents and a Request for Production of Documents. On May 14, 2001, Respondent\u2019s Answer was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">\u201cOn June 14, 2001, Petitioner filed a Motion for Sanctions Upon Respondent\u2019s Failure of Discovery. Respondent did not oppose this Motion. On July 27, 2001, this Court granted Petitioner\u2019s Motion and entered an Order directing that the Petitioner\u2019s Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents be admitted, that the responsive pleading filed by Respondent be stricken, that Respondent be prohibited from introducing at trial any evidence to oppose the claims of Petitioner as set forth in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, and that judgment by default be entered against the Respondent and in favor of the Petitioner finding that the Rules of Professional Conduct have been violated as alleged in the Petition for Disciplinary Action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\n<em>\u201cFindings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cThis Court finds the following facts have been established by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cThe respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on April 2, 1974. He currently maintains an office for the practice of law in Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">\u201cOn or about June 10,1998, Bar Counsel received a notice dated June 5, 1998 from Crestar Bank of an overdraft on an attorney trust account entitled \u2018Law Offices of Robert D. Powell, P.C.,\u2019 account number 209800191 (hereafter \u2018the trust account\u2019). Thereafter, on or about June 11, 1998, Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Counsel sent a copy of the overdraft notice to the respondent and requested that respondent provide a full explanation for the overdraft and financial records such as client ledger cards, deposit slips, canceled checks, and monthly bank statements for each month from January 1998 to June 1998. The respondent was also asked to respond within ten (10) days of the receipt of Bar Counsel\u2019s letter. Respondent received Bar Counsel\u2019s letter on June 15,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cOn or about June 22, 1998, respondent wrote to Bar Counsel and falsely represented that the overdraft was the result of a bank error, and that he had asked the bank to verify this information, withdraw its Notification of Account Status of June 5, 1998, and communicate directly with Bar Counsel\u2019s office. Thereafter, Bar Counsel received no communication from Crestar Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cOn or about July 17, 1998, Bar Counsel sent another letter to respondent and advised that the file on the overdraft would remain open until supporting documentation was forwarded to Bar Counsel. This letter was received by respondent on August 11, 1998. Bar Counsel did not receive a reply from respondent, and, on or about August 24, 1998, Bar Counsel sent another letter to respondent and advised that, if Bar Counsel did not receive an explanation for the overdraft within ten (10) days, he would docket the file because of respondent\u2019s failure to respond. The letter was delivered to the respondent on August 24, 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cBar Counsel received a letter from respondent dated September 1, 1998 in which respondent again falsely represented that the overdraft was the result of a bank error. Respondent\u2019s explanation was that on June 5, 1998, he went to the bank to make a deposit. Due to a long line, a bank officer agreed to complete the transaction for him. He left a check and a deposit ticket with this bank employee at about 10 a.m. on Friday, June 5, 1998. That transaction, however, was not credited to the account until Monday, June 8,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cRespondent failed to provide with his letter of September 1, 1998 the documents previously requested by Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Counsel in letters dated June 22, July 11, July 27 and August 24,1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cOn September 23, 1998, Bar Counsel sent another letter to respondent notifying him that the matter had been formally docketed and an investigation would be conducted. Bar Counsel for the fourth time requested monthly bank statements, deposit slips, client ledger cards, and canceled checks for the trust account and asked that respondent identify the source/sources of funds deposited into the trust account for the period January 1 through September 23, 1998. Respondent failed to respond to this letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cOn October 16, 1998, Bar Counsel sent another letter to respondent and requested for the fifth time that respondent provide, within five (5) days, the financial records itemized in the September 23, 1998 letter. On or about October 28, 1998, respondent sent Bar Counsel a letter and enclosed with this letter copies of bank statements for the trust account for the period January through September 1998 and photocopies of the front and back of canceled checks covered by the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cIn his letter of October 28, 1998, respondent acknowledged that he deposited personal funds to the trust account. Respondent falsely stated in this letter that there were no client funds in the account during the period in question. In this letter, respondent also represented that he had deposited funds into the trust account from the sale of property owned by his father. These deposits were made in December 1997 and January 1998.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cRespondent represented in the October 28, 1998 letter that he thereafter transferred some of the funds to accounts in his and his father\u2019s name at Crestar Bank. Respondent falsely represented that these accounts were jointly titled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">\u201cBank records obtained pursuant to Bar Counsel subpoena demonstrate that the transactions conducted on June 5, 1998 by Respondent were as follows: Respondent wrote a check in the amount of $2,500 payable to himself on Crestar Bank account number 86405-5684, entitled \u2018Ralph Piccola POA Robert D. Powell\u2019; deposited $1,100 of these funds to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the trust account; deposited $1,200 of these funds to an account at Crestar Bank titled \u2018Law Office of Robert D. Powell, P.C.\u2019; and received $200 in cash. The records reflect that these transactions occurred at approximately 4:05 p.m. Ralph Piccola is the name of the respondent\u2019s late father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201cBank records obtained pursuant to Bar Counsel subpoena also reveal that respondent continued to use the account titled in his late father\u2019s name, an interest bearing money market account, long after his father\u2019s death on or about March 2, 1998. Respondent failed to remove his father\u2019s social security number as the tax identification number on this account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cThe bank records also demonstrated that respondent used both the trust account and the account titled in his lather\u2019s name for personal and business expenses, thereby misrepresenting the character and ownership of these accounts in order to avoid the claims of creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cRespondent failed to respond in a timely manner to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for records relating to his trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cRespondent failed to open an estate to probate the funds remaining in the account titled in his father\u2019s name at the time of his father\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\n<em>\u201cConclusions of Law</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">\u201cThe Court finds clear and convincing evidence that the following Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) were violated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">\u201cThe respondent deposited earned fees and money he received from his father into a bank account he titled as an attorney trust account. He used this account for personal and business purposes. Such conduct constitutes clear and convincing evidence of commingling in violation of both MRPC 1.15(a) and Maryland Rule 16-607.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">\u201cNot only did respondent misuse his attorney trust account, he also used an account titled in the name of his father for personal and business purposes after his father\u2019s death in March 1998, thereby misrepresenting the owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ship of the funds in both these accounts. Even though there were funds in the father\u2019s account at the time of his death, respondent failed to open an estate to probate these assets. This Court finds that respondent engaged in this conduct in an effort to hide assets from creditors\u2019 collection efforts. Such conduct provides clear and convincing evidence that Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and or misrepresentation in violation of MRPC 8.4(c). Such deceptive and dishonest conduct by a member of the Bar has a negative impact on the image and perception of the legal profession and is clear and convincing evidence that respondent engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MRPC 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cWhen asked to explain the cause of the overdraft on his attorney trust account, the respondent first delayed in providing the requested records and then, in his letter of October 28, 1998, made false statements of material fact to Bar Counsel concerning the transactions conducted on June 5, 1998. His representation that he had a single deposit to make on the morning of Friday, June 5, 1998, which, due to a bank error, did to get credited until the following Monday was shown to be false by the bank\u2019s records which establish that he made two deposits and a cash withdrawal after 4 P.M. on Friday, June 5,1998. There is clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated MRPC 8.1(a) and (b) by knowingly making false representations of material facts and failing to timely respond to demands for information from Bar Counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Throughout Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, respondent failed to provide Bar Counsel with requested documents related to the trust account and his financial records. After Bar Counsel filed the Petition for Disciplinary Action, respondent filed an answer, but failed to respond to the request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents, interrogatories, or request for production of documents. It is apparent from the record, findings of fact and conclusions of law that as a result of respondent\u2019s blatant disregard of Bar Counsel\u2019s request for discovery in these proceedings, Judge McGuckian granted the relief sought by Bar Counsel and prohibited respondent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>presenting any evidence at the proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bar Counsel then introduced into evidence documents marked as Exhibit No. 1, a request for admission of fact and genuineness of documents, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge McGuckian permitted respondent to argue in response to the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but precluded respondent from testifying or otherwise presenting any evidence. Judge McGuckian found that the averments of Bar Counsel in its petition were well supported by Exhibit No. I.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The matter was set for a hearing before this Court on February 28, 2002. Neither party filed any exceptions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Judge McGuckian\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Respondent appeared pro se and addressed the default found by Judge McGuckian. He explained to this Court that he did not satisfy petitioner\u2019s discovery requests because he had not received the motion from Bar Counsel with respect to discovery or Order of July 27th, 2001. He also advised this Court that his medical problems interfered with his participation in this case and that he was prepared to provide discovery and to defend the matter on the merits. In response thereto, this Court deferred a decision in this matter in order to give respondent an opportunity to comply with the discovery requests of Bar Counsel and to file his answers with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals on or before April 22, 2002. Respondent was advised, by Order of this Court, that in the event he filed the answers within the specified time, this Court would again refer the matter to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for an evidentiary hearing as to the charges contained in the petition for disciplinary action. Respondent also was advised that if he failed to file the answers within the appropriate time, this Court will proceed to consider the case on the present state of the record and enter its disposition in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On April 23, 2002, one day late, respondent filed his responses to petitioner\u2019s discovery requests. In response thereto, Bar Counsel filed a motion requesting this Court to strike the untimely answers on the grounds that the answers were untimely, incomplete, not in compliance with the rules governing discovery, evasive, and in one instance, demonstrably false. We agree with Bar Counsel that respondent has failed to satisfy his obligation to provide the requested information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Respondent was uncooperative with Bar Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>during the investigative stage of these proceedings, and continued to stonewall Bar Counsel\u2019s efforts to gain discovery throughout these proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>er this case on the present state of the record and the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing judge as set forth on October 24, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The hearing judge found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated MRPC 1.15(a), 8.1(a) and (b), 8.4(c) and (d), and Rule 16-607 as alleged by Bar Counsel in the petition for disciplinary action. Based upon our independent review of the record, we agree with the findings and hold that Bar Counsel presented clear and convincing evidence of respondent\u2019s wrongdoings.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We turn now to the appropriate sanction. Bar Counsel recommends disbarment as the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In imposing discipline on an attorney for violation of the MRPC, the primary purpose is to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession and not to punish the lawyer. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n. v. </em>Snyder; 368 Md. 242, 793 A.2d 515 (2002). Attorney disciplin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ary proceedings also are aimed at deterring other attorneys from engaging in similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">It has long been the position of this Court that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for intentional dishonest conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001). In cases warranting disbarment, such as those involving intentional dishonesty, fraud, misappropriation and the like, we will not accept as compelling extenuating circumstances \u201canything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Respondent engaged in intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation. He failed to cooperate with Bar Counsel and when given the opportunity by this Court to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s request, he again refused to provide the required information. The hearing judge found that respondent deposited earned fees and money he received from his father into a bank account titled as a trust account. Respondent used this account for personal and business purposes. Respondent used an account titled in the name of his father for personal and business purposes after the death of his father, thereby misrepresenting the ownership of the funds. He did not open an estate to probate these assets. Respondent engaged in this conduct in an effort to hide assets from his creditors. Respondent\u2019s trust account was overdrawn, and when asked by Bar Counsel to explain the cause, he delayed in providing the requested information and later provided false explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In determining an appropriate sanction, an attorney\u2019s prior discipline history is an appropriate consideration. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Franz, </em>355 Md. 752, 736 A.2d 339 (1999). After a disciplinary action, this Court expects a renewed commitment to professional standards and ethical conduct. Respondent was previously sanctioned in 1992 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>received an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in not less than six months for conduct amounting to negligent misappropriation of client funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Respondent has presented no mitigating circumstances to justify a sanction less than disbarment. The appropriate sanction in this case is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.

Respondent argued that the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law were not based on evidence, bxxt merely upon an Order of Default. Respondent is incorrect. Respondent admitted at the Inquiry Panel hearing that until recently, he did not know that it was impex\u2019mis-sible to use a trust account as a personal account. In addition, petitioner\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, received as evidence by the hearing judge, consisted of respondent\u2019s bank records, correspondence between Bar Counsel and respondent, respondent\u2019s law office records for the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>account, and the transcript of the June 22, 2000 inquiry panel hearing in this matter. Judge McGuckian found that \"the averments of Bar counsel [were] amply documented in Exhibit 1.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. In response to petitioner\u2019s request for production of documents, respondent refused to produce any documents. In his written re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>sponse, he indicated that Bar Counsel had the documents already, and that as to other bank accounts, he was searching for the records and would supply them when he found them. Bar Counsel maintains that it has never received any documents from respondent. Interspersed throughout his answers, respondent asserted, without merit, that petitioner's requests were overbroad, not relevant, not within the scope of Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry, not applicable, or that sometime in the future, the information would be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">Examples of respondent's answers to petitioner\u2019s request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-\">Request no. 22: Admit, that respondent deposited personal funds into Crestar Account Number 209300191.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APWC\">Response: Objection.

An attorney is required to cooperate with Bar Counsel during the investigative process. Once a petition for disciplinary action is filed, an attorney is obligated to provide requested discovery in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the Maryland Rules of Procedure. We pointed out in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 255, 760 A.2d 1108, 1119 (2000) that \"[t]he practice of law carries with it special responsibilities of self-regulation, and attorney cooperation with disciplinary authorities is of the utmost importance to the success of the process and the integrity of the profession.\u201d In this regard, we noted, quoting from the Washington Supreme Court in <em>In re Clark, </em>99 Wash.2d 702, 663 P.2d 1339 (1983), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ars\">\"The [disciplinary authority\u2019s] investigation of a complaint is an integral part of the machinery for handling charges regarding the ethics and conduct of the attorneys admitted to practice before this court. Public confidence in the legal profession, and the deterrence of misconduct, require prompt, complete investigations. The process of investigating complaints depends to a great extent upon an individual attorney\u2019s cooperation. Without that cooperation, the [disciplinary authority] is deprived of information necessary to determine whether the lawyer should continue to be certified to the public as fit. Obviously, unless attorneys cooperate in the process, the system fails and public confidence in the legal profession is undermined. If the members of our profession do not take the process of internal discipline seriously, we cannot expect the public to do so and the very basis of our professionalism erodes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a7q-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 1341-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
