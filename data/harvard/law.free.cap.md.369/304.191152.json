Liverpool, Petitioner, against Baltimore Diamond Exchange, Inc., d/b/a Radcliffe Jewelers, Respondent, as a civil action in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County. Petitioner\u2019s complaint for money damages was based on Respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the Maryland Layaway Sales Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), codified in Maryland Code (1978, 1990 RepLVol.), Commercial Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 14-1101-14-1110.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The instant case requires that we address the construction and interpretation of the Act for the first time since its enactment in 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The issue here is whether Petitioner\u2019s purchase in October 1998 of a certain watch from Respondent\u2019s jewelry store constituted a layaway agreement subject to the obligations and remedies provided under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a bench trial on 2 November 2000, the District Court judge found that the disputed sales transaction constituted a \u201cbona fide C.O.D. transaction\u201d as defined by the Act and, as such, was expressly excluded from the additional protections afforded under the Act by virtue of \u00a7 14 \u2014 1101(g)(3), which provides that a laya<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>way agreement \u201cdoes not include a bona fide C.O.D. transaction.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Concluding that the Act did not apply under the circumstances, the trial judge deducted Respondent\u2019s lost profit from Petitioner\u2019s down payment of $4,620, and entered a judgment in Petitioner\u2019s favor for the balance in the amount of $2,870, together with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-103<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 12M08(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> alleging that the trial judge erred as a matter of law by mis-characterizing the sale as an exempt \u201cC.O.D. transaction.\u201d The Circuit Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s timely petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Liverpool v. Balt. Diamond Exch., Inc., d/b/a Radcliffe Jewelers, 3</em>66 Md. 274, 783 A.2d 653 (2001), which raised the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">(1) Does an agreement for the sale of consumer goods, which satisfies the definition of a \u201cspecial order transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tion,\u201d also have to satisfy the definition of a \u201clayaway agreement\u201d in order to be protected by the Maryland Layaway Sales Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">(2) Can an agreement that satisfies the definition of a \u201cspecial order transaction\u201d also constitute a \u201cC.O.D. transaction\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\n<em>The Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We recount the underlying facts as reviewed by the Circuit \u2022Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">This appeal arises from an October 22, 1998 transaction Mr. Liverpool conducted at The Baltimore Diamond Exchange, doing business as Radcliffe Jewelers (\u201cRadcliffe\u2019s\u201d) in Towsontowne Center, while shopping for a Christmas present for his wife. Mr. Liverpool selected a Philippe Charriol<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> watch from a catalogue of goods sold at Radcliffe\u2019s. Although the price listed in the catalogue was $10,500, Mr. Liverpool negotiated the price down to $7,000. Because the item had to be special ordered, he was told he had to put down at least a 50% deposit. Mr. Liverpool paid a downpayment of $4,620, with the balance to be paid when the item was delivered prior to Christmas. The sales receipt that was issued did not mark the item as a special order. Radcliffe\u2019s stated this was an \u201coversight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">The watch that was ordered is characterized as a \u201climited edition watch.\u201d Radcliffe\u2019s placed a special order for the watch, which included Mr. Liverpool\u2019s particular specifications, and checked with the manufacturer to see if it would be available, since it was a limited piece. The order was placed by Radcliffe\u2019s in late October, and Radcliffe\u2019s was billed for the item. When it was delivered, Radcliffe\u2019s attempted on numerous occasions to page Mr. Liverpool, but received no response. According to Mr. Liverpool\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>testimony, when the watch was not available by Christmas, it slipped his mind until he returned to the store the following year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\">The testimony was disputed as to what occurred thereafter, but specific findings on what then occurred are of no real consequence to the legal analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At some point, Mr. Liverpool demanded his money back, and the store refused. The watch was ultimately sold for $5,250 which constitutes a loss of profit on the original transaction with Mr. Liverpool of $1,750.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">At trial, Mr. Liverpool contended that Radcliffe\u2019s violated the provisions of Maryland\u2019s Layaway Sales Act, Md. Commercial Law (\u201cCL\u201d), \u00a7 14-1101, <em>et seq., </em>and accordingly sought treble damages on his initial downpayment of $4,620, together with attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $4,500. [The District Court judge] ultimately found that the sale constituted a bona fide C.O.D. transaction, and therefore was not governed by the Layaway Sales Act. Accordingly, [she] determined that Mr. Liverpool was entitled to a return of his deposit of $4,620, less the $1,750 in lost profit, and entered judgment in the amount of $2,870.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">As we recently stated in <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. Miller, </em>362 Md. 361, 372, 765 A.2d 587, 593 (2001),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In an action tried without a jury, an appellate court \u2018will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 Md. Rule 8 \u2014 131(c). However, \u2018[t]he clearly erroneous standard for appellate review in [Md. Rule 8-131] section (c) ... does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u2019 <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chem. Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202, 1205 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apu-dedup-0\">In the present case, there are no genuine disputes as to the material facts. As the issue is solely a question of statutory construction and, thus, a question of law, we review the matter <em>de novo. See Total Audio-Visual Sys., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 394, 758 A.2d 124, 128 (2000); <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 575, 709 A.2d 749, 756 (1998); <em>Lacy v. Arvin, </em>140 Md. App. 412, 421, 780 A.2d 1180, 1185-86 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Petitioner contends his purchase of the watch was a \u201cspecial order transaction,\u201d and that \u201cthe Layaway Sales Act [applies] if the sale is either a ... layaway agreement or a special order transaction\u201d as defined by the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 14-1101(g)(1) &amp; (2), 14-1101(k). Petitioner further asserts that the C.O.D. exclusion does not apply under the circumstances, arguing that the Act \u201cexplicitly dictates that a transaction cannot be both a \u2018special order transaction\u2019 and a \u2018C.O.D. transaction\u2019 \u201d simultaneously. Accordingly, Petitioner asserts \u201cthe trial court and Circuit Court erred in finding that [Petitioner\u2019s] transaction with [Respondent] was not subject to the Maryland Layaway Sales Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Respondent does not dispute the characterization of the sale as a special order transaction, nor is it disputed that a special order transaction is within the scope of the Act. The real controversy, Respondent explains, is whether a special order transaction is subject to the C.O.D. exclusion. Respondent argues that the Legislature\u2019s placement of the C.O.D. exclusion immediately following the definition of layaway agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ment in \u00a7 14 \u2014 1101(g)(1), as enlarged to include special order transactions in subsection (g)(2), made it \u201cclear that the General Assembly intended the C.O.D. exclusion to apply to a Tsjpecial order transaction.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, Respondent asserts this sales transaction was \u201can excluded C.O.D. transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The Maryland Layaway Sales Act, presently codified at Md.Code (1978, 2000 Repl.Vol.), Commercial Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7 14-1101-14-1110, was enacted initially in 1978. <em>See </em>Chapter 673 of the Acts of 1978. The stated purpose of the Act is to \u201cregulatfe] layaway salesL ][and] requir[e] certain disclosure! ][and] rights of cancellation and refund.\u201d The statute establishes procedures to be followed by a seller and a buyer who enter into a layaway agreement and provides for their respective remedies in case of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Section 14-1101 contains definitions of ten basic terms used in the Act. Among, them, a \u201clayaway agreement\u201d is defined in \u00a7 14-1101(g) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\"><em>Layaway agreement. </em>\u2014 (1) \u201cLayaway agreement\u201d means a contract for the retail sale of consumer goods,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> negotiated or entered into in the State, under which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">(i) Part or all of the layaway price<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is payable in one or more payments subsequent to the making of the layaway agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>(ii) The consumer goods are specific existing consumer goods identified from the seller\u2019s stock or inventory at the time of the making of the layaway agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">(iii) The seller retains possession of the consumer goods and bears the risk of their loss or damage until the layaway price is paid in full.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\"><em>(2) \u201cLayaway agreement\u201d includes a \u201cspecial order transaction, </em>\u201d <em>as defined in this section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>(3) \u201cLayaway agreement\u201d does not include a bona fide C.O.D. transaction.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">(4) \u201cLayaway agreement\u201d does not include any form of layaway agreement where the buyer can default without any penalty, other than a maximum service charge of $1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">As indicated above, subsection (g)(3) expressly excludes from the definition of layaway agreement a \u201cbona fide C.O.D. transaction,\u201d which is further defined in \u00a7 14-1101(d) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\"><em>C.O.D. transaction. </em>\u2014 \u201cC.O.D. transaction\u201d means an agreement by which the seller requires the buyer to pay the full cash price of the consumer goods upon delivery or tender of delivery by the seller, less any down payment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> made by the buyer. A C.O.D. transaction does not include an agreement by which the seller requires the buyer, to pay interim payments before delivery or tender of delivery of the consumer goods by the seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Subsection (g)(2) provides that a layaway agreement \u201cincludes a \u2018special order transaction,\u2019 \u201d which is separately defined in \u00a7 14-1101(k) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\"><em>Special order transaction. </em>\u2014 \u201cSpecial order transaction\u201d means a contract for the retail sale of consumer goods, negotiated or entered into in the State, under which either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(1) Consumer goods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">(1) Are ordered by the buyer to the buyer\u2019s unique specifications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">(ii) Are not carried by the seller, either in the seller\u2019s showroom nr warehouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(iii) Are ordered from a manufacturer or supplier; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(iv) Are not resalable by the seller at the sale price negotiated with the buyer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(2) Consumer goods which have been altered at the request of the buyer so that the goods are no longer salable to the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">In accordance with the Act, a sales transaction that qualifies as a layaway agreement must be in writing, signed by the parties,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and contain certain disclosures relative to the terms of the agreement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, the Act establishes certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>obligations of the seller in a layaway sales transaction,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>provides the seller remedies in case of buyer default.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the event a seller fails to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 14-1102, 14-1103, or 14-1104, the buyer is provided remedies in accordance with \u00a7 14-1109, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">(a) <em>Remedies of buyer. </em>\u2014 If the seller fails to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 14-1102, 14-1103, or 14-1104, the buyer, before delivery by the seller and acceptance by the buyer of consumer goods purchased under a layaway agreement, may cancel the layaway agreement and receive from the seller a refund of all payments made under the layaway agreement and the return of any goods or property traded in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 Any seller who makes a layaway sale in violation of this subtitle is liable to the buyer for a penalty amount equal to three times the amount paid by the buyer under the layaway agreement, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.

Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416, 780 A.2d 1137, 1147 (2001). In <em>Mayor of Baltimore v.

In this regard we have instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">When the statute to be interpreted is part of a statutory scheme, it must be interpreted in that context. That means that, when interpreting any statute, the statute as a whole must be construed, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. Thus, statutes on the same subject are to be read together and harmonized to the extent possible, reading them so as to avoid rendering either of them, or any portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v.

We recently explained the rules applicable when the terms of a statute are ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8N\">\u2018When the words of a statutory provision are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, and we examine the circumstances surrounding the enactment of a legislative provision in an effort to discern legislative intent, we interpret the meaning and effect of the language in light of the objectives and purposes of the provision enacted.

In addition, we seek to avoid construing a statute in a manner that leads to an illogical or untenable outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>Webster, </em>359 Md. at 480, 754 A.2d at 1012 (quoting <em>Lewis v.

We agree.

In this vein, Petitioner argues the Circuit Court erred by imposing upon Petitioner the impossible task of proving \u201cthe elements of both a \u2018special order transaction\u2019 and a \u2018layaway agreement\u2019 \u201d simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Petitioner correctly points out that the definitions of \u201clayaway agreement\u201d and \u201cspecial order transaction\u201d are incompatible.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On the one hand, to qualify as a layaway agreement, a sales transaction must be for consumer goods that are \u201cidentified from the seller\u2019s stock or inventory at the time of the making of the layaway agreement.\u201d \u00a7 14-1101(g)(l)(ii). In contrast, a \u201cspecial order transaction\u201d requires the sales transaction to be for consumer goods \u201cnot carried by the seller, either in the seller\u2019s showroom or warehouse,\u201d and \u201cordered from a manufacturer or supplier.\u201d \u00a7 14 \u2014 1101(k)(l)(ii), (iii). Accordingly, while the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cincludes\u201d in subsection (g)(2) may appear to introduce \u201cspecial order transaction\u201d as an illustration of a \u201clayaway agreement,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>mutual exclusivity of the respective elements when read in conjunction with each other, introduces an element of ambiguity that requires judicial interpretation of the term \u201cincludes\u201d as it is used in subsection (g)(2).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Admittedly, the term \u201cincludes,\u201d by itself, is not free from ambiguity. <em>See Housing Auth. of Balt.

Section 14 \u2014 1106(b) provides a seller with the option to cancel a layaway agreement if a buyer is more than fifteen days late in making a scheduled payment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 14-1106(a) at <em>supra </em>note 14, and to recover liquidated damages under one of two schemes: (1) if a buyer defaults under a layaway agreement eight or more calendar days after the date of its execution, a seller may \u201cretain ... an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the layaway price or the total amount paid by the buyer to the date of default, whichever is less,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 14-1106(c) <em>supra </em>note 14; or (2) if a buyer defaults under a special order transaction, the seller may \u201cexercise all rights and remedies available at either law or equity, including those rights and remedies as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code, Title 2 \u201cSales,\u201d Subtitle 7 \u201cRemedies,\u201d of the Commercial Law Article,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 14-1107 <em>supra </em>note 14. The legislature\u2019s inclusion of two distinct remedies dependent on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>a special order transaction is involved is a clear indication of its intent to provide parallel protection for both a layaway-agreement within the meaning of subsection (g)(1) and special order transactions as defined in \u00a7 14 \u2014 1101(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Moreover, such a construction is consonant with the legislative history of the Act. Several years prior to the enactment of the Layaway Sales Act, the Consumer Protection Division (\u201cDivision\u201d) of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, in accordance with its rule-making powers,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> promulgated proposed regulations governing layaway sales transactions under the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) former 02.01.04 Lay-Away Agreements. <em>See </em>2:29 Md. R. 1743-44 (Dec. 24, 1975). The Division\u2019s action was prompted by its findings that layaway agreements were \u201chandled inconsistently\u201d and \u201carbitrarily structured,\u201d and that layaway sellers provided inadequate \u201cdocumentation and disclosure of the rights and obligations of the merchant and consumer ... all to the detriment of the consumer.\u201d COMAR former 02.01.04.02, Findings. <em>See also </em>2:29 Md.

The proposed regulations, <em>inter alia, </em>defined the term \u201clay away\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and proscribed certain conduct as \u201cunfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d and a violation within \u00a7 13-301 of Maryland\u2019s Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), Md.Code (1975), Commercial Law Art., \u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq.

See </em>COMAR former 02.01.04.04F. <em>See also </em>2:29 Md. R. at 1744. Section 12-615(a), as it pertained to layaway agreements, gave a buyer the option to cancel a layaway agreement \u201cbefore delivery or tender of the goods by the seller,\u201d <em>see </em>subsection (a)(1), and essentially limited a seller\u2019s liquidated damages in such cases to' a maximum of ten percent of all payments made by the buyer, including any down payment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See </em>subsection (a)(2). <em>See also State v.

The proposed regulations were subsequently adopted, without change. <em>See </em>3:13 Md. R. 720 (June 23, 1976). Notably, the Statement for Reasons of Adoption accompanying that section advised that the original draft of the proposed regulation had been modified to avoid \u201clanguage which might have brought special orders within the definition of \u2018layaway,\u2019 \u201d an aspect which \u201cmerchants had generally considered onerous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Less than one year later, and in apparent response to merchant concern that a layaway seller was not sufficiently protected in case of buyer default in special order transactions under the remedy provided in subsection .04F., the Division adopted a new regulation exempting special order transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>from regulation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See </em>COMAR former 02.01.04.06, Exemption. <em>See also </em>4:16 Md.

R. 1253 (August 11, 1978). Moreover, \u201clayaway agreement\u201d as defined by \u00a7 14-1101(g) was expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cinstallment sale agreement\u201d as defined in RISA. <em>See </em>Chapter 673, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1978. <em>See also </em>Md.Code (1975, 1978 Supp.), Commercial Law Art., \u00a7 12-601; Md.Code (1975, 1978 Supp.), Commercial Law Art., \u00a7 14-1108 (noting that RISA \u201cdoes not apply to any sale of consumer goods regulated by [Title 14, Subtitle 11]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A comparison of the Act\u2019s relevant provisions with the layaway regulations in effect prior to its enactment, presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>strong correlation between the respective treatment of special order transactions and the remedies available to a layaway seller in case of buyer default. It is clear that the legislature intended to address the merchant concern of an inadequate seller\u2019s remedy in special order transactions by its introduction of \u00a7 14-1107, which allows a seller the right to exercise \u201call rights and remedies available\u201d under the U.C.C., including, as here, the right to recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price of the goods, together with incidental damages. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 2-706. This distinct and heightened remedy effectively eliminated the need to exclude special order transactions under the scope of the Act, while extending the obligations and remedies provided under the Act under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Moreover, our construction is commensurate with the statutory scheme under the CPA,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Md.Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1998 Supp.), Commercial Law Art., \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 <em>et. seq. See </em>\u00a7 13-102 (recognizing the \u201cmounting concern over the increase of deceptive practices in connection with sales of merchandise,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 13-102(a), the General Assembly declared its intention to \u201cset certain minimum statewide standards for the protection of consumers across the State.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 13 \u2014 102(b)). <em>See also CitaraManis v.

We can think of no reason that a consumer in a special order transaction should be afforded any less protection than a consumer in a layaway sales transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The common thread in both sales transactions is the potential imposition of a penalty in case of buyer default. As previously indicated, a seller\u2019s liquidated damages upon buyer default in a layaway sales transaction, as defined in subsection (g)(1), is limited to \u201c10 percent of the layaway price or the total amount paid by the buyer to the date of default, whichever is less.\u201d \u00a7 14-1106(c). On the other hand, a seller\u2019s liquidated damages upon buyer default in a special order transaction, as defined in \u00a7 14-1101(k), includes \u201call rights and remedies\u201d under the U.C.C., which conceivably could expose a special order purchaser to considerably greater liability than under \u00a7 14-1106(c). \u00a7 14-1107. Certainly, the need for \u201c[a] clear and concise statement of all consequences of buyer\u2019s default\u201d is, if arguably not greater, at least equally as important in a special order transaction as it is in a layaway sales transaction. \u00a7 14-1103(12). Communication to consumers of potential penalties in case of buyer default in a special order transaction is in keeping with the objectives of the CPA. In light of the statute\u2019s text, legislative history, and the Act\u2019s role within the statutory scheme of the CPA, we conclude that the most reasonable reading of subsection (g)(2) is to infer a legislative intent to extend application of the Act to encompass special order transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We turn now to consider whether the special order transaction in the instant case was properly excluded in accordance with \u00a7 14 \u2014 1101(g)(3), which provides that a \u201c \u2018[l]ay-away agreement\u2019 does not include a bona fide C.O.D. transaction.\u201d Our inquiry is twofold: first, we must determine whether Petitioner\u2019s special order purchase of the watch constituted a \u201cbona fide C.O.D. transaction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14-1101(d); if the answer is yes, we must then determine whether a special order transaction can also constitute a C.O.D. transaction. In accord with well-established principles of statutory construction, \u201c[wjhere the statute to be construed is a part of a statutory scheme, the legislative intention is not determined from that statute alone, rather it is to be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>cerned by considering it in light of the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 129, 756 A.2d at 992 (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted). Accordingly, our inquiry requires a review of the appropriate U.C.C. provisions as well as the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Petitioner argues that a \u201cspecial order transaction\u201d and \u201ca bona fide C.O.D. transaction\u201d are mutually exclusive concepts, and proof that his watch purchase was a special order transaction is dispositive that the sale was not a C.O.D. transaction subject to exclusion. Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that it is \u201cundisputed that this was a bona fide C.O.D. transaction,\u201d arguing that by \u201cPetitioner\u2019s own evidence, the parties agreed that. [Petitioner] would make a down payment with the balance due upon delivery of the watch.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The crux of this dispute, Respondent contends, is whether there is anything in the Act to prevent a special order transaction from also being an exempt C.O.D. transaction. \u201cC.O.D.,\u201d however, was not an express term of the contract between the parties. Based on this, we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s purchase of the watch was not a \u201cbona fide C.O.D. transaction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14-1101(d), and accordingly was not excluded by subsection (g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">A common type of commercial sales transaction is a sale on \u201cC.O.D.\u201d. The initials are an abbreviation of the words \u201ccollect on delivery\u201d or \u201ccash on delivery.\u201d <em>See </em>Bieber\u2019s dictionary of legal abbreviations 136 (5th ed.2001); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 250 (7th ed.1999). Section 14-1101(d) defines a \u201cC.O.D. transaction\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>an agreement<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> by which the seller requires the buyer to pay the full cash price<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> of the consumer goods upon delivery or tender of delivery by the seller, less any down payment made by the buyer. A C.O.D. transaction does not include an agreement by which the seller requires the buyer to pay interim payments before delivery or tender of delivery of the consumer goods by the seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It is clear from a plain reading of subsection (d) that a C.O.D. transaction is established at the option of the layaway seller and by consent of the buyer. What is less obvious is that the term \u201cC.O.D.\u201d or its equivalent, <em>see supra, </em>is a term of art that does not concern merely the simultaneous disposal of a seller\u2019s duty to tender delivery of the goods and a buyer\u2019s duty to pay for them. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-301.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Rather, it also denotes a buyer\u2019s consent to forgo his right of inspection of the goods prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>payment, and must be an express term of the contract for sale after due negotiation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-513(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">While the U.C.C. does not define expressly the term \u201cC.O.D.,\u201d it provides that a delivery \u201cC.O.D.,\u201d or like terms, implicitly creates limitations on a buyer\u2019s right to inspect goods. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-513(3). Section 2-513 deals generally with a buyer\u2019s right of inspection and contract limitations upon that right, and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner.

Section 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>310 addresses the time for payment of goods, and states that \u201c[ujnless otherwise agreed ...

The Official Comment to \u00a7 2-310 notes that paragraph (a) \u201cgrants an opportunity for the exercise by the buyer of his preliminary right to inspection before paying.\u201d \u00a7 2-310, cmt. 1. Remarking on the right to inspect under \u00a7 2-513, it is noted that \u201cif the seller wishes to demand payment before inspection, <em>he must put an appropriate term into the </em>contract.\u201d \u00a7 2-310, cmt. 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Section 2-512 concerns payment by a buyer before inspection. The Official Comment explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">This section applies to cases in which the contract requires payment before inspection <em>either by the express agreement of the parties or by reason of the effect in law of that contract. </em>The present section must therefore be considered in conjunction with the provision on right to inspection of goods which sets forth the instances in which the buyer is not entitled to inspection before payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00a7 2-512, cmt. 6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">It is clear that under the U.C.C. a provision for delivery C.O.D., by the very nature of the transaction, deprives a buyer of an entitled right to inspect the goods before making payment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-513(3)(a). While a buyer may waive his or her right of inspection, <em>see </em>\u00a7 2-315(1), there must be some indicia of his or her consent to do so, either expressly or by agreeing to payment terms which are inconsistent with a right to inspect. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-513(3)(a), (b). An agreement between the parties that payment by the buyer is a condition to receipt of the goods, merely reflects the common commercial practice that payment and delivery are concurrent conditions, <em>see supra </em>note 31, and it is not an adequate expression of a buyer\u2019s intent to waive his or her right to inspect the goods prior to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Consideration of the legislative history concerning the C.O.D. exemption under prior layaway regulations lends sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>port to this conclusion.

This inspection is merely to determine whether the goods conform to the contract, and is not to be regarded as a \"condition precedent to'the passing of title\u201d or to be confused with the \" examination\u2019 of the goods or of a sample or model of them at the time of contracting which may affect the warranties involved in the contract.\u201d \u00a7 2-513, cmts. 8 &amp; 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b371-5\">. While not a condition of the term, \u201cC.O.D.\u201d is frequently used in connection with a carrier delivering goods to a buyer at a location other than the seller's place of business, whereby the buyer has agreed to pay the full cash price on the amount due to the carrier, who then forwards the payment to the seller. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 250 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cBy consenting to this delivery term, the buyer agrees to pay simultaneously with delivery and appoints the carrier as the buyer's agent to receive and transmit the payment to the seller.\u201d). Likewise, \u201cC.O.D.\u201d is a trade term in contracts with carriers that instructs the carrier as to the method of delivery and payment. <em>See </em>67 AmJur. 2d <em>Sales </em>\u00a7 552 (1985) (\"A common type of commercial transaction is a sale on a \u201cc.o.d.\u201d basis.... [A]nd its use clearly has for an object an instruction to the carrier or transporter not to deliver the goods until the price therefor is collected.\u201d). That was not the circumstance here. The testimonial evidence indicates the mutual understanding of the parties that the Respondent would order the watch from the manufacturer, that the watch would be shipped directly to Respondent, and that Respondent would page Petitioner when it was available for pick-up at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Another circumstance that might warrant delivery C.O.D. is where the seller wishes to protect himself from a buyer of doubtful credit by demanding cash on delivery. <em>See Cermetek, Inc. v. Butler Avpak, Inc., </em>573 F.2d 1370, 1379 (9th Cir.1978) (\u201cThe seller generally utilizes a C.O.D. contract because he either does not trust the buyer or does not intend to advance credit.\u201d). There is no indication here that Respondent demanded cash payment for the unpaid balance on ihe watch. To the contrary, Petitioner testified that \"any form or fashion that I paid, I would receive the watch.\u201d Respondent did not dispute Petitioner's contention. Accordingly, we can discern nothing from the surrounding circumstances of the sale to implicate an understanding between the parties that this would be delivery \"C.O.D.\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. We recognize that a special order transaction within the meaning of \u00a7 14-1101(k) and a C.O.D. transaction within the meaning of \u00a7 14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>1101(d) are not mutually exclusive by their definitions. While we do not decide whether the C.O.D. exclusion of subsection (g)(3) applies to a special order purchase, it begs the question as to why the method of delivery would dictate whether a buyer is entitled to threshold notice concerning the potential imposition of penalties where the buyer is in default.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
