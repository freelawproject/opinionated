After the first emergency suspension hearing was held on April 26, 1999, appellees <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> could not obtain judicial review until they exhausted them administrative remedies. They have never filed any petition for review of administrative agency actions. Appellees, therefore, have failed to exhaust such remedies. The various lower courts in this case have overlooked, the fact that appellees failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and, therefore, this case and its prior proceedings, were never properly before any court. The lower courts should not have exercised jurisdiction in this case to rule on any of the proceedings in any of the cases other than to dismiss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">We are going to discuss the complete history of the case, although the proceedings after the original emergency suspension hearing are not relevant to our holding in the case at bar. After the original emergency suspension hearing concluded, the courts, under the circumstances of this case, should not have exercised jurisdiction to consider any issues raised from that point until the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">In April of 1999, Officer John Doe<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was suspended with pay from the Montgomery County Police Department (Police Department) pending an investigation into allegations that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>officer had used excessive force in the performance of his duties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Doe was assigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the investigation, and his power to make arrests was suspended. Officer Doe was notified that pursuant to section 734A(2)(iii), he would be provided a prompt hearing before a one-member hearing board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to that hearing, Officer Doe did not seek a show cause order from the trial court in respect to the one-member composition of the hearing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On April 26, 1999, an emergency suspension hearing was held before a one-member hearing board and after the hearing the chief continued Officer Doe\u2019s suspension. On June 29, 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge 35, Inc. and Officer Doe, appellees, filed a \u201cVerified Petition in Support of Show Cause Order and/or Complaint for Declaratory Relief\u2019 in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County purporting to be pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Article 27, section 734 of the LEOBR<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Maryland Code (1973, 1998 RepLVol.), section 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In their petition against the Chief of Police, Charles Moose, and the Police Department,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appellees challenged the Police Department\u2019s failure to convene a three-member hearing board for the emergency suspension hearing and also challenged the conduct of the hearing. Because the parties had not exhausted them administrative remedies, the Circuit Court should have dismissed the action. Instead, it found that the administrative hearing had been unfair and did not address the other issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A new emergency suspension hearing was scheduled, with the hearing board to consist of only one member.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On February 9, 2000, prior to the scheduled second emergency suspension hearing, appellees again filed a \u201cVerified Petition in Support of Show Cause Order and/or Complaint for Declaratory Relief\u2019 in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County pursuant to section 734 and section 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>In their petition, appellees sought to have the Circuit Court issue an order stating that appellants had to conduct the emergency suspension hearing on the reasonableness of Officer Doe\u2019s emergency suspension before a three-member hearing board. Again, the Circuit Court should, for the reasons we have mentioned and shall explain further, have dismissed the action. The Circuit Court, however, determined that the LEOBR did not require appellants to use a three-member hearing board. Appellees appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which should have vacated the judgment and directed the trial court to dismiss the action. Instead, it remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a determination of all of the issues in this case. The Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court had only addressed whether Officer Doe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>would have been entitled to a three-member emergency suspension hearing board pursuant to the LEOBR. The Circuit Court, according to the Court of Special Appeals, failed to address whether Officer Doe would have been entitled to a three-member emergency suspension hearing board pursuant to the Police Department\u2019s regulations. The Court of Special Appeals thus held that it could not reach the merits of the dispute because the Circuit Court had failed in a declaratory judgment action to issue a written order fully addressing the rights of the parties. The Court of Special Appeals apparently did not perceive that appellants had not exhausted their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">On remand, the Circuit Court determined that both the LEOBR and the Police Department\u2019s administrative regulations required a three-member emergency hearing board. The Circuit Court, however, should have dismissed the action even though the Court of Special Appeals had remanded. Appellants filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to further consideration by that court. Appellants present two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cI. Under the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights, does the requirement for a \u2018prompt hearing\u2019 mean that the charges against the officer must be disposed of promptly, or does the provision require an additional hearing before a three-member board to address the sole issue of the reasonableness of the suspension prior to addressing the charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">II. Do the administrative procedures of the Montgomery County Police Department require a three-person hearing board to review the police chiefs decision to suspend an officer\u2019s police powers with pay?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">We do not address either of appellants\u2019 questions. We are going to vacate the decision of the Circuit Court and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss all <em>judicial </em>proceedings now, or heretofore, pending, arising out of the two petitions for show cause and declaratory judgment actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>We hold that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellees failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as is required before the commencement of either of the declaratory judgment actions. Because the parties had not exhausted all administrative remedies, neither the Circuit Court, nor the Court of Special Appeals, should have addressed any issues in the framework of declaratory judgment actions. The declaratory judgment actions should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We also hold that the show cause provisions of section 734 were not applicable to the case at bar in respect to the only emergency suspension hearing properly held because the emergency suspension hearing had already been held when appellees first filed for relief under that section. Once the first emergency suspension hearing was held, the show cause provision of section 734 of the LEOBR was not available to appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In this very unusual procedural case, Officer Doe was initially subjected to an \u201cemergency suspension hearing.\u201d At no time prior to that initial emergency suspension hearing did appellees request a show cause order challenging the one-member composition of the emergency suspension hearing board. The applicable statute, section 734, permitting show cause orders in such cases, requires them to be filed prior to the commencement of such hearings. That was not done prior to the initial emergency suspension hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Shortly after the conclusion and decision in the initial emergency suspension hearing, appellees filed a combined action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. One thrust of their action was an effort to require appellants to \u201cshow cause,\u201d pursuant to section 734, as to why a three-member emergency suspension hearing board was not required. As we have indicated, and will discuss <em>infra, </em>such a show cause petition must be filed prior to the \u201ccommencement\u201d of such a hearing. Accordingly, this type of action was not then available to appellees and should not have been considered by any of the lower courts. Another thrust of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>appellees\u2019 efforts was for a declaratory judgment that a three-member emergency suspension hearing board was required. At the time of appellees initial filing of an action in the Circuit Court, there had not been, and, in fact, as far as the record reflects, has never been to this point, a subsequent hearing on the merits. Therefore, administrative remedies had not at that time, and never have, been exhausted. A declaratory judgment action was, therefore, not permitted at that time, or since, or now, as we explain, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The trial court to which the issues were presented should have dismissed the action. What then should have occurred was for a hearing on the merits before a three-member hearing board pursuant to the LEOBR and any subsequent reviews as statutorily appropriate. Instead, the Circuit Court for Montgomery <em>County </em>directed certain actions, which it should not have directed. It should not have authorized any reconvened or additional emergency suspension hearing because the administrative remedies had not been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Thereafter, prior to the new emergency suspension hearing improperly directed by the Circuit Court, appellees filed a show cause and declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court reasserting their claims. That is the instant action. These issues, however, were not properly before the Circuit Court because it could not properly direct or permit another emergency suspension hearing. Officer Doe had already had the only emergency suspension hearing to which he was at that point entitled. He had not asked for court intervention prior to that hearing. At that point, the issue of the validity of a one-member board had to await the resolution of the merits hearing before a three-member board, <em>ie., </em>had to await the exhaustion of administrative remedies. For the same reason, these issues are not properly before us. There has, even now, been no exhaustion of administrative remedies. After the original emergency suspension hearing, the only action left was for appellees and appellants to hold a hearing on the merits pursuant to the LEOBR. Once all administrative remedies had been exhausted, appellees could then have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">After the initial emergency suspension hearing, the Circuit Court should have dismissed appellees\u2019 petition and then a hearing on the merits pursuant to the LEOBR could have been held if necessary. Because administrative remedies had not been exhausted, the Circuit Court should not have ruled on appellees\u2019 petition. Therefore, any hearings, other than a hearing on the merits, and any further judicial review was inappropriate. At that point, the only action left was for a hearing on the merits pursuant to the LEOBR. All of the lower courts should have dismissed all of the actions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Section 734</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Appellees\u2019 first contention in their \u201cVerified Petition in Support of Show Cause Order and/or Complaint for Declaratory Relief\u2019 is that pursuant to section 734 Officer Doe was being denied a right under the LEOBR \u2014 his alleged right to a three-member emergency suspension hearing board. We hold that appellees were barred from applying for show cause relief under section 734, seeking the implementation of a three-member emergency suspension hearing board, after that first emergency suspension hearing had been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">A party being denied a right under the LEOBR can apply for a show cause order under section 734. Section 734 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">\u201c \u00a7 734. Application to court for show cause order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Any law enforcement officer who is denied any right afforded by this subtitle may apply at any time <em>prior to the commencement of the hearing before the hearing board, </em>either individually or through his certified or recognized employee organization, to the circuit court of the county where he is regularly employed for any order directing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>law enforcement agency to show cause, why the right should not be afforded.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">As section 784 clearly states, appellees would have had to have applied for a show cause order before the first emergency suspension hearing seeking to require the Police Department to show cause why appellees\u2019 alleged right to a three-member hearing board was not being provided at the emergency suspension hearing. Appellees were aware that the Police Department was planning on the hearing board only consisting of one member at the first emergency suspension hearing. In the memorandum sent to Officer Doe to inform him of his police powers being suspended, the Police Department stated that the board would only consist of one member. At that time, appellees did not apply to the circuit court for a show cause order pursuant to section 734. Officer Doe proceeded with the emergency suspension hearing and then, before a merits hearing before a three-member board could be held, filed an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County protesting the Police Department\u2019s failure to have a three-member emergency suspension hearing board. Once the first emergency suspension hearing commenced, appellees were then barred from seeking a show cause order under section 734 as to the already held emergency suspension hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Appellees\u2019 second contention in their \u201cVerified Petition in Support of Show Cause Order and/or Complaint for Declaratory Relief\u2019 is that they are entitled to declaratory relief stating that the emergency suspension hearing boards should consist of three members. After the first emergency suspension hearing, no subsequent hearing on the merits before a three-member board that would exhaust appellees\u2019 administrative remedies was held prior to the instant declaratory judgment action. We hold that the Circuit Court should not have addressed appellees\u2019 concerns in either of the declaratory judgment actions because appellees had not, and still have not, exhausted their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Appellees filed for relief under the declaratory judgment statutes, codified at Maryland Code (1978, 1998 Repl.Vol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>section 3-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The courts of this state, however, have, in cases involving administrative agency actions, held that, generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a party may seek a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court. We examined the application of the declaratory judgment statutes to administrative proceedings in <em>Secretary, Department of Human Resources v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 409 A.2d 713 (1979), when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cOrdinarily, where a statutory administrative remedy is provided, it will be deemed to be exclusive.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 649, 387 A.2d 260, 265 (1978); <em>Schneider v. Pullen, </em>198 Md. 64, 68, 81 A.2d 226, 228 (1951). More particularly, the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Md.Code (1974) \u00a7 3-409(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article expressly provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Tf a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>This Court has consistently held that because, under the Declaratory Judgment Act, statutory administrative remedies are exclusive, the administrative procedures established must be exhausted before a litigant may seek declaratory relief from a trial court. <em>Soley v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526-27, 356 A.2d 254, 257 (1976); <em>Tawes v. Williams, </em>179 Md. 224, 228, 17 A.2d 137, 139 (1941).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">In <em>Soley, </em>277 Md. at 526, 356 A.2d at 257, this Court articulated the underlying rationale for this requirement. There, Judge Levine said for the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u2018The rule requiring exhaustion of administrative or statutory remedies is supported by sound reasoning. The decisions of an administrative agency are often of a discretionary nature, and frequently require an expertise which the agency can bring to bear in sifting the information presented to it. The agency should be afforded the initial opportunity to exercise that discretion and to apply that expertise. Furthermore, to permit interruption for purposes of judicial intervention at various stages of the administrative process might well undermine the very efficiency which the Legislature intended to achieve in the first instance. Lastly, the courts might be called upon to decide issues which perhaps would never arise if the prescribed administrative remedies were followed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Thus, this Court recognized that when the Legislature enacts a comprehensive remedial scheme in which a claim is to be determined by an administrative agency and reviewed in an administrative appeal before judicial review is available, it establishes, as public policy, that such a procedure produces the most efficient and effective results. In order to effectuate this public policy, trial courts generally should not act until there has been compliance with the statutory comprehensive remedial scheme. For the same reasons, an appellate court, on its own motion, ordinarily will raise the issue of exhaustion of statutory administrative remedies, even though not raised by the parties. <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington, Nat\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 594, 386 A.2d 1216, 1222 (1978); <em>Commission on Medical Discipline v.

Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>27 Md.App. 702, 706, 343 A.2d 544, 546 (1975). Indeed, because the parties cannot, by agreement, cause an appellate court to act contrary to public policy, such a court will consider this question even though all of the parties desire judicial intervention. <em>See Eastgate Assocs. v.

As stated in <em>Secretary, Department of Human Resources v. Wilson, supra, </em>286 Md. at 645, 409 A.2d at 717: \u201cIndeed, because the parties cannot, by agreement, cause an appellate court to act contrary to public policy, such a court will consider this question [exhaustion of remedies] even though all of the parties desire judicial intervention. Accordingly, we have, on our own motion, raised the issue of exhaus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tion of statutory remedies here.\u201d (Citations omitted.) There are a few limited exceptions to the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the case at bar does not fall within any of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The administrative remedy available to Officer Doe in the case at bar is enunciated in the LEOBR<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the administrative procedures of the Police Department, specifically Function 'Code 301.C-Administrative and Suspension Hearing Boards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Officer Doe was suspended pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>734A(2)(i), which allows for an emergency suspension with pay if \u201cit appears that the action is in the best interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>public and the law enforcement agency.\u201d Once Officer Doe received an emergency suspension, he was entitled to a prompt hearing under section 734A(2)(iii). Pursuant to Function Code 301. C, the prompt hearing after the emergency suspension is for a hearing board to determine if the suspension, as an emergency suspension, was reasonable under the circumstances. The issue that the parties in the case <em>sub judice </em>would like resolved is whether the emergency suspension hearing board is required to have three members.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Under the circumstances here present, the LEOBR provided Officer Doe with two different opportunities to obtain relief from administrative determinations. Prior to the commencement of the emergency suspension hearing, appellees could seek relief pursuant to section 784, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cAny law enforcement officer who is denied any right afforded by this subtitle may apply at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing before the hearing board ... to the circuit court ... for any order directing the law enforcement agency to show cause why the right should not be afforded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">After the emergency suspension hearing and a subsequent three-member board hearing on the merits, and upon the completion of the hearing board\u2019s decision pursuant to section 781, section 732 <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201c \u00a7 732. Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">Appeal from decisions rendered in accordance with \u00a7 731 shall be taken to the circuit court for the county pursuant to Maryland Rule 7-202. Any party aggrieved by a decision of a court under this subtitle may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d [<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Therefore, an officer involved in an investigation and hearing first has an opportunity prior to the commencement of a hearing to apply for a show cause order as to why the officer is being denied a right and, then, upon the final decision on the merits of the three-member hearing board under the LEOBR and Function Code 301.C,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> has an opportunity to seek judicial review in the Circuit Court. The statutes provided appellees with an opportunity to redress any problems both prior to' the commencement of the emergency suspension hearing and at the completion of the administrative process, after a final decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">We have held that, generally, a court may not provide a statutory or administrative regulation interpretation through an action for declaratory judgment until all administrative remedies have been exhausted. In <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Mass Transit Administration, </em>294 Md. 225, 449 A.2d 385 (1982), we were examining whether administrative remedies had to be exhausted in cases where a declaratory judgment seeking a statutory interpretation had been filed. The Mass Transit Administration (MTA) denied the applications of three women seeking to be bus drivers, because MTA\u2019s physician determined that.the three women were overweight. The three women filed complaints with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (Commission), alleging that MTA had unlawfully discriminated against them. After an investigation of the complaints by the Commission, it was determined that MTA had engaged in discrimination based on physical handicaps in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1979 RepLVol.), Article 49B, section 16(a)(1). MTA would not concur with the Commission\u2019s findings, so the Commission had the matter set for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Before the hearing was held, MTA filed a bill for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commission in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. MTA asserted that obesity was not a physical handicap and that the Commission did not have the authority to consider obesity as a physical handicap. MTA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>requested that the Circuit Court grant a declaratory judgment determining whether obesity is a physical handicap under Article 49B, section 16. The Commission filed an answer asking for the bill for declaratory and injunctive relief to be dismissed because MTA had failed to. exhaust its administrative remedies. The Circuit Court held that MTA did not have to exhaust its administrative remedies because a question of statutory interpretation was involved. The Circuit Court entered a declaratory judgment stating that the Commission could not find that obesity was a physical handicap unless the Commission could demonstrate that the obesity was caused by bodily injury, birth defect, or illness. The Commission appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and MTA filed a cross-appeal. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to the case being heard in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We held that MTA had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and we cited the general rule that \u201cstatutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies must ordinarily be pursued and exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 449 A.2d at 387. We then examined whether MTA was required to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to a statutory interpretation. Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cAlthough there may be cases in some other jurisdictions supporting the trial court\u2019s view that administrative remedies need not be exhausted if the question is one of statutory interpretation like that presented here, this view is contrary to the settled law of Maryland. This Court has consistently held that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial review remedies must be exhausted in cases involving the interpretation of statutory language. <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s </em>Co[unty] <em>v.

More specifically, normally a party cannot obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>statutory interpretation involving the application of a statute by the appropriate administrative agency until all administrative remedies have been exhausted. Appellees failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to seeking a statutory interpretation through a declaratory judgment action. While both parties in this case would like for us to address whether an emergency suspension hearing requires a three-member hearing board, we cannot address the issue because this case is not properly before us.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Additionally, we hold that once the first emergency suspension hearing was held, appellees were barred from applying for a section 734 show cause order. Appellees failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, therefore, the Circuit Court should have dismissed appellees\u2019 petition. All other actions filed and proceedings held after the initial emergency suspension hearing, other than a hearing on the merits pursuant to the LEOBR, should have been dismissed by all of the lower courts. The case should never have been before any of the courts, including this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE CASE; COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLANTS AND 50% BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Judge RAKER concurs in the judgment only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\">.

It had been the practice of the Police Department to have emergency suspension hearings before a three-member hearing board. At the end of 1998, the Police Department changed its policy and started holding the emergency suspension hearings before a one-member hearing board. Regardless of the number of members serving on the emergency suspension with pay hearing board, Officer Doe would have still been entitled to a subsequent hearing on the merits before a three-member hearing board pursuant to the LEOBR. The emergency suspension hearing was held strictly to review the reasonableness of the chief's actions in transferring Officer Doe to administrative duties prior to a resolution on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\">.
