Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 758 A.2d 124 (2000), should be reconsidered and overruled. Having granted the petition for certiorari filed by Patrick M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Plein, the appellant, while the appeal was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see </em>367 Md. 722, 790 A.2d 673, 2002 Md. LEXIS 55 (2002), and considered the arguments presented at oral argument, we decline the invitation, joined in by the appellee, Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, which argues, consistent with its position in that case, that <em>Total Audio-Visual </em>was wrongly decided, to overrule that decision and, instead, reaffirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>this Court considered \u201cwhether, under the Labor and Employment Article, an employee is entitled to unemployment benefits on the basis of his or her employment with a previous employer where that employee voluntarily resigned a permanent and satisfactory job with that previous employer in order to take a job with another employer,\u201d 360 Md. at 390, 758 A.2d at 125, concluding that, under the circumstances of that case, the employee was not. <em>Id. </em>That conclusion was dictated by our interpretation of Maryland AnmCode Lab. &amp; Empl.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 8-1001(1991, 1999 Repl. Vol.) and, in particular, the phrase \u201cgood cause,\u201d as therein used.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Section 8-1001, in its entirety, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Grounds for disqualification. </em>\u2014 (1) An individual who otherwise is eligible to receive benefits is <em>disqualified </em>from receiving benefits <em>if the Secretary finds that unemployment results from voluntarily leaving work without good cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(2) A claimant who is otherwise eligible for benefits from the loss of full-time employment may not be disqualified from the benefits attributable to the full-time employment because the claimant voluntarily quit a part-time employment, if the claimant quit the part-time employment before the loss of the full-time employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">(b) <em>Finding of good cause. </em>The Secretary may find that a cause for voluntarily leaving is good cause <em>only </em>if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(1) <em>the cause is directly attributable to, arising from, or connected with:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>(i) the conditions of employment;

or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">(3) to attend an educational institution\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Noting that \u00a7 8-1001(b) was the applicable section because it was there that the Legislature defined \u201cgood cause\u201d in terms of two permitted and definitive findings, 360 Md. at 397, 758 A.2d at 130, and the rules of statutory construction that we determined to be relevant, <em>id. </em>at 395, 758 A.2d at 128, we concluded that \u00a3Ta] plain reading of \u00a7 8-1001 makes clear that leaving employment for a better paying job does not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Focusing on the difference between subsection (b)(1), which permits a finding of good cause only when the reason for voluntarily leaving employment \u201c \u2018is directly attributable to, arising from, or connected with\u2019 either a condition of employment or an action of the employment unit,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>and subsection (b)(2), in which the triggering event is the employee\u2019s being laid off without fault, <em>id., </em>we reasoned that \u201cgood cause must be found, if at all, under subsection (b)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 758 A.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Analyzing subsection (b)(1), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u201cUnder subsection (b)(1), to be good cause, the reason for voluntarily leaving employment must be job related, see <em>[Board of Educ. of Montgomery County v.] Paynter, </em>supra, 303 Md. [22] at 29, 491 A.2d [1186] at 1189-90 (1985), and more particularly, relate to the conditions existing on the claimant\u2019s job or involve acts by the claimant\u2019s employment unit. See \u00a7 8 \u2014 1001(b)(1). An offer of greater pay by another employer to induce the claimant\u2019s voluntary termination does not qualify; because such offers are conditions of the offered employment and thus only relate to the conditions of the future employment. Although, to be sure, while affecting employment conditions generally, and, perhaps, the claimant\u2019s employment in some way, they surely are not \u201cdirectly attributable to, arising from or connected with\u201d the conditions existing in the employing unit from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>which the claimant resigned. If an offer of greater pay can be \u201cgood cause\u201d for an employee voluntarily to terminate otherwise satisfactory employment, then any condition of future employment which compares favorably with the claimant\u2019s present employment and is offered and accepted, as an inducement to the claimant to leave that employment, must also be considered \u201cgood cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">360 Md. at 398, 758 A.2d at 130. In <em>Paynter, </em>this Court construed the predecessor to that section, Maryland Ann.Code art. 95A, \u00a7 6 (1957, 1979 RepLVol.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It concluded that art. 95, \u00a7 6(a) was unambiguous, \u201ccommand[ed] that good cause be job related,\u201d and recognized as an alternative valid circumstance for voluntarily leaving work, one \u201cof such necessitous or compelling nature that the individual had no reasonable alternative other than to leave the employment.\u201d 303 Md. at 29-30, 491 A.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Relying on <em>Paynter </em>for confirmation of the interpretation given \u00a7 8-1001(a), the <em>Total Audio-Visual </em>Court was persuaded by the fact that the statutory scheme, as reflected in \u00a7 8-1001, remained as it was when <em>Paynter </em>was decided. 360 Md. at 400, 758 A.2d at 131. Section \u00a7 8-1001(c), like art. 95, \u00a7 6(a) before it, we pointed out, places circumstances for voluntarily leaving work into two categories, thus, drawing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>distinction between those that are work related and those that are not work related. Therefore, we opined: \u201c[njot being directly related to, attributable to or connected with the employee\u2019s employment or the actions of that employing unit, offers of higher pay as an inducement to leave existing employment must fall, if at all, into this latter category,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 401, 758 A.2d at 131, that is, they must meet the \u201cnecessitous and compelling\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>Under that stricter test, we reiterated, \u201cmore needs to be shown than that the precipitating event or cause \u201c \u201c \u2018would reasonably [have] impelled] the average able-bodied qualified worker to give up his or her employment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Paynter, </em>303 Md. at 36-37, 491 A.2d at 1193, in turn quoting <em>Uniweld Products, Inc. v. Indus. Relations Comm\u2019n, Etc., </em>277 So.2d 827, 829 (Fla.App. 4 Dist. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The Court also was persuaded by the absolute disqualifications prescribed in \u00a7 8-1001(d). In that regard, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cBy denying unemployment benefits to employees who leave work to go into business, to relocate with a spouse or to go to school, that section makes clear that purely personal reasons for leaving work will not suffice as a predicate for unemployment benefits. It is difficult to reconcile, except on that basis \u2014 going into business for oneself is a personal matter \u2014 why the Legislature would permit an employee, who voluntarily terminates permanent and otherwise satisfactory employment for increased wages, on the theory that his or her prospects and financial condition are thereby improved, to be eligible for unemployment benefits, while at the same time denying the same right to a claimant, who, for the same reasons, voluntarily leaves work to go into business for him or herself. Accepting more money and changing jobs is as much of a gamble and thus, as much of a personal matter, as going into business for oneself. In our view, it is unmistakably clear that \u00a7 8-1001(a) was not designed to provide benefits when the precipitating cause for the voluntary leaving of the employment was for higher pay or a better job. Instead, it was designed to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>hardship to persons who lose their jobs, through no fault of their own.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>360 Md. at 400-01, 758 A.2d at 131-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Finally, we found \u00a7 8-611, especially the prohibition contained in subsection (e)(4), to be both instructive and consistent. <em>Id </em>at 402, 758 A.2d at 132. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cUnder \u00a7 8-611(e), ... \u201c[t]he Secretary may not charge benefits paid to a claimant against the earned rating record of an employing unit if ... (4) the claimant left employment voluntarily to accept better employment or enter training approved by the Secretary.\u201d (Emphasis added). If, given the specific provisions of \u00a7 8-611(e)(4), the earned rating record of the employing unit which the claimant left voluntarily to accept better employment cannot be charged for the benefits payable as a result of a subsequent lay off, then it seems strange indeed that, as to that employing unit, leaving employment voluntarily to accept better employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ment would be considered good cause for leaving work. Thus, while, pursuant to \u00a7 8 \u2014 1001(a), a claimant may be eligible for unemployment benefits, the determination whether those benefits should or may be paid is employer specific.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reading \u00a7 8-1001 (a) as the appellee proposes would render \u00a7 8 \u2014 611(e)(4) meaningless. See, <em>Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge No. 35 v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 180, 680 A.2d 1052, 1065 (1996) (\u201c[n]or should we interpret a statutory scheme so as to render any part of it meaningless or nugatory.\u201d),\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIqD\"><em>id. </em>at 404, 758 at 133, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c[the claimant] was not, at the time of his voluntary departure eligible for unemployment benefits because the claimant left his employment with the petitioner for other employment and, in fact, entered into that employment. Therefore, the [claimant] could not, at that time, have received unemployment benefits for the simple and inescapable reason that he was employed. That he subsequently becomes unemployed, and therefore eligible, because of the actions of the subsequent employer does not change the situation. The claimant\u2019s unemployment results from the subsequent employer\u2019s laying him off and not from the petitioner\u2019s actions. Rather, it was the claimant\u2019s inadvertent actions which led to his unemployment through the, perhaps very reasonable, acceptance of employment that supposedly paid better.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 405, 758 A.2d at 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The appellant in this case was employed by Atlas Tile &amp; Terrazzo as a tile setter\u2019s helper, a job that paid $9.00 an hour. He accepted employment with Home Depot, U.S.A., at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Ellicott City store, as a sales associate in the floor and wall department. That job paid $12.00 an hour with the prospect of receiving, after a waiting period, a health insurance plan and stock purchase options and, after one year, two weeks vacation and sick leave. The appellant left his employment with Atlas and began working at Home Depot on August 14, 2000. On September 27, 2000, he was laid off, unexpectedly and through no fault of his own. His application for unemployment benefits was denied on the authority of <em>Total AudioVisual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">This case demonstrates, the appellant submits, the devastating impact that <em>Total Audio-Visual </em>has had on workers, \u201cespecially the working poor striving to pull themselves out of poverty and better their conditions of employment,\u201d a conclusion with which the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (hereinafter \u201cDLLR\u201d), the appellee, takes no issue. For that reason, he strenuously argues for the overturning of <em>Total Audio-Visual. </em>In support of that result, the appellant offers a number of arguments. Although, as the appellant points out, the claimant\u2019s perspective was not represented in <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>the claimant in that case having chosen not to participate in the appeal, many of the arguments he offers are not new ones. In fact, DLLR, the appellee in that case and the purported appellee here, made many of them in its attempt to uphold the decision to award unemployment benefits to the <em>Total Audio-Visual </em>claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">DLLR argued unsuccessfully in <em>Total Audio-Visual </em>that unemployment benefits were properly awarded in that case precisely because a claimant who leaves a position for other employment with similar responsibilities and substantially better pay has left with good cause under \u00a7 8-1001; that the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8-1001 was consistent with the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, and the remedial nature of the Unemployment Insurance Law; and, citing <em>Paynter, supra, </em>303 Md. 22, 491 A.2d 1186, as well as cases from other jurisdictions, that the Board\u2019s decision was consistent with the standards set by this Court addressing the issue whether leaving one\u2019s job to accept better employment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>a cause which would impel the average reasonable worker to leave his or her job. 360 Md. at 392, 758 A.2d at 127. Those arguments, repeated here by the appellant, are fortified by the claimant\u2019s perspective and perhaps more eloquently stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In addition, the appellant challenges the Court\u2019s use of \u00a7 8-611(e) as support for its interpretation of \u00a7 8-1001, contending that the Court\u2019s statement of the scope of \u00a7 8-611 conflated two concepts, namely, \u201cwhether the period of employment with the [first employer] may be used to calculate the claimant\u2019s unemployment benefits\u201d and \u201cwhether those benefits are chargeable to the [first employer],\u201d <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>360 Md. at 403, 758 A.2d at 132-33, to one, only the latter to which that section had any applicability. He also maintains that those sections are perfectly consistent, representing \u201cthe legislature\u2019s attempt to strike a correct, delicate balance in furtherance of the purposes of unemployment insurance, such as income security, economic stimulus and stability, welfare avoidance\u201d and other goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>the Court equated leaving employment for other employment with better pay to leaving employment to become self-employed, a circumstance that we have seen is specifically excluded as providing good cause for voluntary termination of employment. We said, more particularly: \u201cAccepting more money and changing jobs is as much of a gamble and thus, as much of a personal matter as going into business for oneself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 758 A.2d at 132. The appellant takes issue with this comparison. Instead, he sees the issue as one involving competence. While the DLLR is competent to assess the relative ranking of jobs based on an evaluation of the wages and benefits each offers, the appellant submits, it has no such competence when it comes to business plans and prospects. Thus, he argues,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201callowing benefits to those who quit for a better job is very different from allowing benefits to every would-be entrepreneur who wants to start a new business. The former represents a manageable inquiry with an objective standard: was the second job better in terms of wages and benefits? The latter would supplant the function of agencies like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>U.S. Small Business Administration in providing income support to fledgling businesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Finally, the appellant disagrees with the <em>Total AudioVisual </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Paynter. </em>The <em>Total AudioVisual </em>Court determined that interpreting \u00a7 8-1001 as precluding a finding of good cause when an employee leaves otherwise satisfactory employment for employment paying higher wages was consistent with <em>Paynter\u2019s </em>good cause analysis. <em>See </em>360 Md. at 400-01, 758 A.2d at 131-32. Using the same analysis, the appellant asserts that his decision to leave a small company paying a low wage and go with a national company, paying more and with the promise of future, excellent benefits, \u201cis manifestly reasonable.\u201d He continues: \u201cIndeed, for low-wage workers and their families, leaving low-paying jobs that do not provide benefits is not only reasonable, it is often necessary to provide for basic necessities and lift them out of poverty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">DLLR disagrees that \u00a7 8-1001(d) supports the interpretation of \u00a7 8-1001 to preclude benefits when a claimant leaves employment for better pay, contending that such an interpretation renders that subsection surplusage, such provision disqualifying employees who quit a job to become self-employed, to accompany a spouse to a new location or to attend an educational institution not being necessary. It explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cThe .decision of these employees to leave their jobs has nothing to do with any \u2018actions of the employing unit,\u2019 \u00a7 8-1001 (b)(1)(ii), but rather implicates, by necessity, the \u2018conditions of employment\u2019 prong of the disqualification statute. If the Legislature shared the Total Audio Visual majority\u2019s interpretation that prospective events such as \u2018future employment\u2019 lack the requisite relationship with \u2018the conditions existing on the claimant\u2019s job,\u2019 ..., there would have been no need to specifically identify these three situations as causes or circumstances requiring disqualification for benefits. The General Assembly enumerated these situations, however, because it understood that each <em>is </em>\u2018directly attributable to, arising from, or connected with ... the conditions of employment, \u00a7 8 \u2014 1001(b)(l)(i), just not the type that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>warrants unemployment compensation. The' Legislature made a different policy judgment with respect to the decision to leave employment for a higher paying position.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axa-dedup-0\">Resolution of the case <em>sub judice, </em>as it was in <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>360 Md. at 393, 758 A.2d at 127, is a matter of statutory construction. As such, the Court\u2019s function, consistent with the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation, <em>see Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000) and the cases cited therein, is to discern and effectuate the intention of the Legislature. In <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>this Court, albeit, and perhaps significantly so, a sharply divided one, determined, and held, that the General Assembly did not intend that a person who voluntarily terminates his or her otherwise satisfactory employment for other employment with better pay be eligible to receive unemployment benefits when laid off through no fault of his or her own by the subsequent employer. It is well settled that the Legislature is presumed to be aware of decisions of the Court of Appeals, <em>Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 154, 716 A.2d 1029, 1040 (1998); <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 698, 668 A.2d 1, 4 (1995); <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 150, 626 A.2d 946, 952 (1993); <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 93, 581 A.2d 9, 12 (1990); <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174, 1177 (1984). Moreover, the Legislature has shown itself quite capable, and willing, to act decisively and swiftly when the Court does not accurately discern its intent or when it believes the Court has gotten it wrong. <em>See, e.g., </em>1995 Md. Laws 248, overruling, at the next legislative session, the effects of our decision in <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone W., </em>336 Md. 303, 315, 648 A.2d 439, 445 (1994); <em>see also Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 405, 754 A.2d 389, 404 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Legislature\u2019s inaction, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the same extent to which it acts to effect a change in a statute that this Court recently has interpreted, in the process mis-characterizing the Legislature\u2019s intent, must be considered in that light.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In each of the last two legislative sessions, in 2001 and 2002, bills were introduced in the House of Delegates and the Senate to overrule this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Total AudioVisual. </em>In 2001, introduced as HB 1038, in the House, by Delegate Busch, and cross-filed as SB 665, in the Senate, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Senator Ruben, the legislation did not make it out of the Economic Matters Committee in the House or the Finance Committee in the Senate. Although gaining sponsors, the legislation fared no better in the 2002 session. HB 336 was introduced in the House by Delegates Sher, Barve, Hurson, Moe, Hubbard, Goldwater, Howard, Mandel and Grosfeld and, in the Senate, SB 257 was introduced by Senators Ruben, Della and Stone. HB 336 was withdrawn and SB 257 again received an unfavorable report in the Finance Committee. Being aware of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Total Audio Visual </em>and given the legislative activity over the past two years \u2014 the consistent efforts to effect the overruling of that decision \u2014 , it is clear that the Legislature not only understands the issue and this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8-1001, the critical legislative enactment, but, in the absence of legislative action to amend \u00a7 8-1001 to reflect a different interpretation, it is equally clear that the Legislature agrees with this Court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">DLLR, in addition to supporting the appellant\u2019s position as a substantive matter, argues, relying on State v. <em>Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 79, 785 A.2d 1275, 1285 (2001), that this Court \"is not compelled to reaffirm <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>as the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>is a flexible rather than rigid rule under which cases may be overruled when they are wrongly decided and contrary to established principles.\u201d The purpose of <em>stare decisis </em>to insure that people are guided in their personal and business dealings by prior court decisions, through the established and fixed principles they announce, is not undermined, it submits, because only DLLR\u2019s Board of Appeals would be affected by a decision overruling <em>Total Audio-Visual, </em>the employers not being chargeable, pursuant to \u00a7 8-611(e)(4), for benefits paid under circumstances there, and here, involved. DLLR concludes, in any event,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis should yield and Total Audio Visual should be overruled because the Board\u2019s interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tion of the unemployment insurance law is consistent with the language of the statute, its purpose and remedial nature, and its legislative history.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We do not disagree that the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>is flexible and requires that a balance be struck between fixed and established rulings, for the sake of such rulings, and correct rulings and principles. Indeed, we have not hesitated in an appropriate case to strike that balance. The most recent occasion, as DLLR rightly acknowledges, was in <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001). In that case, we overruled <em>Cardinell v. State, </em>335 Md. 381, 644 A.2d 11 (1994), which only a few years before had held for the first time that the State had a common law right of appeal in criminal cases. In overruling that case, we were sensitive to the <em>stare decisis </em>concerns, but recognized that the doctrine was not absolute. Acknowledging that our prior decisions are not lightly to be set aside \u201c \u2018because it is advisable and necessary that the law should be fixed and established as far as possible, and the people guided in their personal and business dealings by established conclusions, not subject to change because some other judge or judges think differently,\u2019 \u201d <em>Green, </em>367 Md. at 79, 785 A.2d at 1285 (quoting <em>Townsend v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard Inc., </em>186 Md. 406, 417, 47 A.2d 365, 370 (1946)), we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cNevertheless, the rule of stare decisis is not an absolute. The United States Supreme .Court has stated that \u201cit is common wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an \u2018inexorable command.\u2019 \u201d <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 854, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2808, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992). This Court also has recognized that \u201cit is sometimes advisable to correct a decision or decisions wrongly made in the first instance if it is found that the decision is clearly wrong and contrary to other established principles.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>186 Md. at 417, 47 A.2d at 370; <em>see also Hearst Corp. v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>269 Md. 625, 643-44, 308 A.2d 679, 689 (1973) (\u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis, important as it is, is not to be construed as preventing us from changing a rule of law if we are convinced that the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life.\u201d (quoting <em>White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 354, 223 A.2d 763, 767 (1966)); <em>Greenwood v. Greenwood, </em>28 Md. 369, 381 (1868) (\u201cPrevious decisions of this court should not be disturbed ... unless it is plainly seen that glaring injustice has been done or some egregious blunder committed.\u201d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On the other hand, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s awareness of our cases, we have been reluctant to overrule our prior decisions where it is likely that the Legislature, by its inaction, indicates its adoption, or at least acceptance, of the interpretation reflected in the opinion announcing the decision. This principle was well stated by Judge Eldridge in <em>Jones v. State, </em>362 Md. 331, 337-38, 765 A.2d 127, 130-31 (2001) (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301, 1305 (1981)), in which he observed for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation. <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Adm., </em>277 Md. 399, 406, 354 A.2d 817 (1976). This presumption is particularly strong whenever, after statutory language has been interpreted by this Court, the Legislature re-enacts the statute without changing in substance the language at issue. <em>Harbor Island Marina v. Calvert Co., </em>286 Md. 303, 322-323, 407 A.2d 738 (1979); <em>Director v. Cash, </em>269 Md. 331, 345, 305 A.2d 833 (1973) <em>cert. denied sub nom. Vucci v. Boslow, Director, Patuxent Institution, </em>414 U.S. 1136, 94 S.Ct. 881, 38 L.Ed.2d 762 (1974); <em>Macke Co. v. St. Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; Taxation, </em>264 Md. 121, 132-133, 285 A.2d 593 (1972); <em>Stack v. Marney, </em>252 Md. 43, 49, 248 A.2d 880 (1969). Under these circumstances, it is particularly inappropriate to depart from the principle of stare decisis and overrule our prior interpretation of the statute. <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>282 Md. 641, 657-658, 387 A.2d 260 (1978). <em>See also Flood v.

State, 324 Md. 335, 342-343, 597 A.2d 427, 430-431 (1991).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><em>See also Baltimore City Police v.

But, as we have seen, the matter has twice been presented to the General Assembly for its correction. We have recognized that it is appropriate generally that the Legislature balance the equity or fairness of a particular statutory provision. <em>Philip Electronics v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 229, 703 A.2d 150, 159 (1997). That is particularly the case when, as here, the Legislature has been accorded the opportunity to address the issue and has declined to do so. Accordingly, although not the exact situation addressed in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Williams, </em>we believe this case falls under that rule and, so, we will decline the parties\u2019 invitation to overrule <em>Total Audio-Visual. </em>The Legislature remains an available avenue for redress, indeed, perhaps the only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">ELDRIDGE, CATHELL and BATTAGLIA, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\">.
