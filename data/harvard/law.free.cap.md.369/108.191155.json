Petitioner was then the target of a \u201csting\u201d operation conducted by the Internal Investigation Division (\u201cIID\u201d) of the Respondent Department. Petitioner apparently had been the subject of an earlier \u201cintegrity test\u201d and passed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Continuing its investigation of Petitioner, IID assembled an assortment of items, including $76 in \u201cmarked\u201d currency, in a fictitious \u201clost\u201d fanny pack that was turned over to him on 4 December 1997 by undercover officers posing as citizens. This effort was to determine whether Petitioner would process the property in accord with departmental policies. Although Petitioner properly processed several items in the fanny pack, the currency was not processed nor a receipt created for it by Petitioner before the end of his work shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The following day, Petitioner was ordered to report to his station house and, upon arrival, was issued a written emergency suspension order by the on-duty lieutenant, acting at the direction of his superior officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner then was ordered to empty his pockets. It was discovered that Petitioner had co-mingled the marked currency with his own funds, except for $5 of the $76 that he had spent. On 6 December 1997, Petitioner was suspended, with pay, pending further investigation or a determination by a hearing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Petitioner appeared before a three member administrative disciplinary hearing board<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on 27 April 1998, to answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>charges of eight essentially theft-related violations of the Anne Arundel County Police Department rules, regulations, and procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a three-day evidentiary hearing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at which Petitioner and his counsel were present and fully participating, the Board, in a unanimous decision, found Petitioner \u201cguilty\u201d of all eight charges. Pursuant to \u00a7 731 of the LEOBR, the Board, in its 15 May 1998. memorandum to the Chief, effectively recommended termination of Petitioner\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After considering several mitigating factors, the Board also suggested that Petitioner receive credit for any leave to which he was entitled prior to termination, thereby affording him the opportunity to bridge his time of employment to meet the twenty-years of service necessary for vesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>of retirement benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On 2 June 1998, after reviewing the record, the Chief accepted the Board\u2019s recommendation of termination, but decided to make the termination effective immediately.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On 1 July 1998, pursuant to \u00a7 732<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the LEOBR and in accordance with Maryland Rules 7-201-7-210,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Petitioner sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>County of his termination, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>various errors of law, including an alleged error that the Board had applied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof, rather than the clear and convincing evidence standard required by the circumstances, in its assessment of whether the Department had proven the charges. On 3 January 2000, the Circuit Court filed its Opinion and Order affirming the termination decision. Of particular relevance, the Circuit Court, citing <em>Meyers v. Montgomery County Police, </em>96 Md.App. 668, 626 A.2d 1010 (1993), acknowledged that the preponderance of the evidence standard may be used by an LEOBR hearing board <em>(see Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 708, 626 A.2d at 1030), but concluded that the Board in this case actually considered and decided the case utilizing the clear and convincing standard. Accordingly, even assuming the clear and convincing standard was required to be used by the Board as Petitioner argued, the Circuit Court found no error because the record, in its judgment, satisfied that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Petitioner filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, raising due process violations and other errors of law, and again asserting an alleged error concerning the appropriate standard of proof to be applied in a local police department action under the LEOBR. In a published opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel County Police Dep't, </em>136 Md.App. 419, 452, 766 A.2d 169, 187 (2001). With regard to the proper standard of proof, the Court of Special Appeals found that the preponderance of the evidence standard was the correct standard to apply in a LEOBR case involving a local police disciplinary personnel action, but disagreed with the Circuit Court that the Board had utilized the preponderance of the evidence standard, not the clear and convincing standard, in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which was granted. <em>Coleman v. Anne Arundel Police, </em>364 Md. 461, 773 A.2d 513 (2001). We also granted Respondent\u2019s conditional cross-petition. The Maryland Chiefs of Police Association was permitted to file an amicus brief in support of Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Petitioner presents'the following issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">Whether <em>Everett v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>307 Md. 286, 513 A.2d 882 (1986), the Due Process Clause, or both, require clear and convincing evidence \u2014 and not a mere preponderance of the evidence \u2014 to (1) convict a police officer of eight theft-related disciplinary charges, (2) terminate his career within nine months of retirement, and (3) deny him more than one million dollars in actuarially calculated retirement benefits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In Respondent\u2019s conditional cross-petition, the following question was presented:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_z\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err by failing to hold that the Petitioner\u2019s trial Board used the clear and convincing standard?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\n<em>The Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We recount the underlying facts as framed by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">On December 4, 1997, the Internal Investigation Division (IID) of [Respondent], Anne Arundel County Police Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), conducted an investigation targeting [Petitioner], a nineteen year veteran of the force. A number of items were assembled to be turned over to [Petitioner] to determine whether he would properly process them. The following articles were put into a green cloth fanny pack: three Tylenol tablets, a clear plastic baggy with white residue, two black film canisters with leafy vegetable residue, a Mickey Mouse key chain with a key and toy baseball bat attached, and a total of $76.25, consisting of three nickels, one dime, two $20 bills, three $10 bills, one $5 bill, and one $1 bill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Two Howard County detectives, posing as ordinary citizens, turned the fanny pack over to [Petitioner]. They advised him that they had found the pack containing no identification outside a convenience store. [Petitioner] asked them no questions and let them leave without taking down any information. [Petitioner] radioed in for a case number for the recovered property and potential controlled dangerous substances (CDS) and then returned to the police station. [Petitioner] then called the convenience store and spoke with the clerk, who indicated that no one had reported lost or stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">[Petitioner] prepared the suspected CDS for forwarding to the laboratory for testing. He placed the CDS into a sealed envelope, labeled the envelope appropriately, had the envelope witnessed, and recorded it in the logbook. These actions comported with departmental regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Petitioner separated the bills from the rest of the items left in the fanny pack. He filled out a \u201cRecovered Property Form\u201d on which he made the following notations: \u201cMickey Mouse key chain with one key\u201d and \u201c3 nickels, 1 dime American currency.\u201d These items were placed in a blue envelope. Neither the Tylenol tablets nor the bills were turned in.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">[Petitioner] has maintained that it was his understanding that he needed a supervisor to count the paper currency, seal the envelope containing it, and sign the envelope. Because there was no supervising officer on duty that evening, and he believed it unwise to leave the money on his desk, [Petitioner] put it in his shirt pocket. He took it with him with the intention of having it signed in later by a supervisor. Believing that he would see his direct supervisor at some point during the shift, [Petitioner] did not seek out a supervisor. Instead, he went back out to work on making his performance levels for DWIs and traffic tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">[Petitioner] took the money home with him. The next morning, he put it with the rest of his money, and took it with him to a court appearance. He stopped by a fast food restaurant and paid with a five dollar bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>After court and pursuant to orders to return to the station, [Petitioner] was ordered by the on-duty lieutenant that afternoon, Lieutenant Kenneth Schlein (\u201cLt. Schlein\u201d), to empty his pockets and, after he did, to surrender the money to him. Schlein testified at the hearing that the following exchange, initiated by [Petitioner], took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB5\">[[Petitioner]]: It\u2019s here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">[Lt. Schlein:] What\u2019s here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[[Petitioner]]: All the money from last night: sixty-five dollars;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I knew it was a setup; It was stupid of me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">[Petitioner] pulled a money clip out of his pocket and took $71 from the total amount he had and began comparing the bills himself to the ones an IID officer had photocopied the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Lt. Schlein confronted [Petitioner] with the five dollar difference, and [Petitioner] stated that he must have spent the money. [Petitioner] was served an emergency suspension notice the same day. On December 12, 1997, he was charged with violating eight Anne Arundel County Police Department rules, regulations, policies and/or procedures. We quote from the Statement of Facts contained in [Petitioner\u2019s] brief, which accurately summarize[s] the charges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">Charge 1 alleged that Cpl. Coleman failed to conform to \u201cMd. Ann.Code art. 27, section 342\u201d (the theft offense statute) when he \u201cstole the $76 instead of reporting its recovery and submitting it ...\u201d Charge 2 alleged that Cpl. Coleman violated the integrity of the reporting system when he \u201cfailed to submit [an] accurate and complete recovered property incident report.\u201d Charge 3 alleged that Cpl. Coleman engaged in conduct unbecoming a police officer by committing \u201ctheft\u201d in that he \u201cstole the $76.00\u201d and his \u201cconduct was criminal, dishonest and improper.\u201d Charge 4 alleged that Cpl. Coleman neglected his duty and had an unsatisfactory performance \u201cby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>stealing $76.00.\u201d Charge 5 alleged that Cpl. Coleman violated the reporting requirement regarding property or contraband by committing \u201ctheft\u201d when he \u201cstole the $76.00 instead of reporting its recovery.\u201d Charge 6 alleged that Cpl. Coleman failed to comply with the Recovered Property Form by \u201cnot put[ting $76] on Recovered Property Form.\u201d Charge 7 alleged that Cpl. Coleman violated the truthfulness requirement by \u201cintentional misrepresentation by not mentioning $76.\u201d Charge 8 alleged that Cpl. Coleman violated his oath of office and the Code of Ethics by the fact that he \u201cstole the $76 ..., was dishonest in thought and deed, and showed disrespect for ... the law against theft.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The hearing before the Board was originally scheduled to take place on February 8, 1998. Pursuant to [Petitioner\u2019s] request, the hearing was continued to February 9, 1998. After an additional request by [Petitioner], the hearing was again postponed from February 9, 1998, to March 11, 1998. Additional correspondence then took place between IID and [Petitioner] wherein [Petitioner] requested hearing dates of April 27, 28, and 29, 1998. The Chair of the Board, Lieutenant Thomas Rzepkowski (\u201cLt. Rzepkowski\u201d), granted this further continuance, and the hearing began on April 27, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In the meantime, on or about April 6, 1998, [Petitioner] was placed on Family and Medical Leave pursuant to the FMLA due to mental illness. [Petitioner\u2019s] personal physician, Dr. Dvoskin, identified his illness as \u201cadjustment disorder with depressed mood, consider major depression.\u201d Dr. Dvoskin certified that [Petitioner] was unable to perform his duties and that it would not be possible for the Department to offer him reasonable accommodations so that he could continue working.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The Board convened for a hearing that lasted three days. On May 15, 1998, the Board sent its disposition and recommendation to the Chief. In its report, the Board made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>extensive findings of fact and unanimously found [Petitioner] guilty of all eight charges. The Board was also unanimous in its recommendations for punishment. It recommended termination in connection with Charges 1, 8, 4, 5, 7, and 8, and twelve day suspensions in connection with Charges 2 and 6. The Board, in light of the fact that [Petitioner] was so close to retirement, also stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">In recommending this punishment, it is <em>not </em>the intent of the Board to allow Corporal Coleman to safely retire and avoid the stigma of being \u201cfired.\u201d The recommendation <em>is </em>for termination. However, the Board carefully listened to and considered the mitigating factors which Defense Counsel persuasively explained, including the financial impact to innocent family members. The Board also scrupulously viewed Corporal Coleman\u2019s 19+ year personnel folder. With minor exception, Corporal Coleman\u2019s work history is positively portrayed with sufficient commendations for good work performance. In the absence of any evidence offered to the contrary, the Board felt that it did not want to take away that which Corporal Coleman had apparently earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">In fashioning its recommendation, the Board decided to ask the Chief of Police to consider allowing Corporal Coleman to be credited for any leave which he was lawfully entitled to prior to actual termination. The Board did not have access to actual numbers credited to Corporal Coleman, but the Board intended Corporal Coleman to be terminated the moment his leave ran out. The Board also did not have particular knowledge of accepted County policy regarding retirement eligibility details, but the Board did not intend to give anything additional to Corporal Coleman to allow him to reach his actual retirement date. If his numbers gave him the time permitted by contract to leave County service at 20-years, he would then be terminated at that first available date. (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The Chief issued his final order on June 2, 1998, immediately terminating [Petitioner\u2019s] employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Coleman, </em>136 Md.App. at 425-29, 766 A.2d at 172-174 (alterations in original) (citation omitted). We will include additional administrative factual findings as necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>Scope of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">No statute expressly establishes the scope of judicial review of an administrative proceeding initiated by a county police department pursuant to the LEOBR. <em>See Montgomery County v. Stevens, </em>337 Md. 471, 482, 654 A.2d 877, 882 (1995); <em>Younkers v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>333 Md. 14, 17, 633 A.2d 861, 862 (1993) (noting that unlike the scope of review established under the State Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when a state police agency is involved, Md.Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1993 Cum.Supp.), State Government Art., \u00a7\u00a7 10-201-10-226, the LEOBR is silent as to a specified scope of judicial review <em>ht </em>a disciplinary action involving a county police officer). We have concluded that the scope of judicial review in a LEOBR case \u201c \u2018is that generally applicable to administra tive appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 482, 654 A.2d at 882 (quoting <em>Younkers, </em>333 Md. at 17, 633 A.2d at 862). Thus, to the extent that the issue under review turns on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, judicial review is narrow. It is \u201c \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence\u2019 in the administrative record as a whole \u2018to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United Parcel v.

Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999), \u201cwe owe no deference to agency conclusions based upon errors of law.\u201d <em>State Ethics v.

Petitioner\u2019s sole issue before us, namely, whether an incorrect standard of proof was applied in the assessment of whether the Department proved the charges, presents a purely legal question.

The primary purpose of the LEOBR is \u201c \u2018to guarantee certain procedural safeguards to law enforcement officers during any investigation or interrogation that could lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County P.D. v.

Section 728(b) of the LEOBR sets forth specific standards for the investigation of a law enforcement officer\u2019s alleged misconduct. If the investigation results in the recommendation of some action, such as a \u201cdismissal, transfer, loss of pay, reassignment, or similar action which would be considered a punitive measure,\u201d before an agency can take such action,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> notice must be provided to the officer \u201cthat he is entitled to a hearing on the issues by a hearing board.\u201d \u00a7 730(a). Section 730 provides a detailed recitation governing the conduct of the hearing and the introduction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This Court has been asked, by both parties, to determine the requisite standard of proof to be applied in a LEOBR administrative disciplinary proceeding involving a local department\u2019s action. That this is at all an open question stems from the combination of the General Assembly standing mute in the LEOBR statute as to the appropriate burden of proof to be applied in proceedings brought under its auspices and the State APA not applying directly to such local government proceedings. Where the legislature has not spoken, judicial interpretation is often required to \u201cfill in the blanks.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 400, at 150 (2d ed.1993). <em>See also, e.g., Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger, </em>366 Md. 29, 100, 782 A.2d 807, 850 (2001).

Montgomery County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>96 Md.App. 668, 626 A.2d 1010 (1993), in which the preponderance of the evidence standard was determined by the intermediate appellate court to apply in an administrative disciplinary proceeding brought by a local police department under the LEOBR, where the police officer was charged with excessive use of force in making an on-duty arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">In the present case, the Department promulgated standards and procedures to be used by its departmental boards. Those standards and procedures specify that disciplinary charges against an officer be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s first contention essentially is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Everett </em>mandates otherwise, arguing that the burden of clear and convincing evidence, as opposed to the less rigorous standard of preponderance of the evidence, is required by the nature of the charges in the present case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>assertion primarily relies upon this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Everett, </em>which Petitioner contends stands for the proposition that proof by clear and convincing evidence is required in an administrative adjudicatory hearing whenever the charging allegation involves \u201cfraud, dishonesty, or a serious criminal offense.\u201d Petitioner argues that the allegations of his theft-related misconduct include all of these elements, which, in a civil judicial forum, requires proof by the clear and convincing standard. Noting that the fixed burden of persuasion ought to be the same in an administrative proceeding as it is in a civil judicial proceeding involving allegations of like nature, Petitioner argues that the allegations of his theft-related misconduct must be supported by the higher evidentiary standard of clear and convincing evidence. <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 303, 513 A.2d at 891. In addition, Petitioner argues that his administrative charges constitute serious misconduct that, if charged criminally, would constitute a crime under the Maryland theft statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 342. Indeed, Petitioner claims that the allegations, and the severity of the potential punishment he faced, are even more serious than the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>in <em>Everett </em>and <em>Meyers, </em>and thus necessitate application of the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Petitioner\u2019s second contention is that the holdings of the U.S. Supreme Court under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and of this Court concerning Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, dictate application of the clear and convincing standard of proof under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Everett v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>307 Md. 286, 513 A.2d 882 (1986), this Court was asked whether a regulated public utility provider (BGE) must prove allegations of fraud or criminal conduct against a customer by a preponderance of the evidence, or by the more demanding standard of clear and convincing evidence, in an administrative hearing before the Maryland Public Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). The customer, an individual, challenged BGE\u2019s intended termination of her residential utility service. BGE wished to terminate Everett\u2019s service at her then-present address for alleged non-payment of fraudulently obtained service at a prior residence. Upon receiving notice of the proposed termination, and the grounds on which it was based, Everett filed a complaint against BGE with the Commission, denying the allegations and requesting a hearing on the matter. The Commission ordered BGE to answer the complaint and assigned the matter to a hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">BGE\u2019s response to Everett\u2019s complaint alleged two instances of \u201cfraudulent[ ] use[ ][of] gas and electric service supplied from BG &amp; E\u201d during an antecedent three (3) year period, 1977-80, by applying for service under a fictitious or other family member\u2019s name. <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 290-91, 513 A.2d at 884. BGE also alleged that on two separate occasions after Everett\u2019s service had been denied for non-payment, she had her service restored without BGE\u2019s knowledge or permission. Following the hearing, the examiner issued a proposed order in which he concluded that BGE bore the burden of proof by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>clear and convincing evidence. At that time, neither the Commission\u2019s enabling statute or its regulations addressed the question of what standard of proof applied in such circumstances. Applying the clear and convincing standard to the record evidence,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the hearing examiner ultimately determined that BGE had not met its burden. The utility appealed to the Commission, which determined that the appropriate standard of proof was preponderance of the evidence, and, upon application of that standard, concluded that the utility had sustained its charges of fraudulent use. Accordingly, Everett\u2019s complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Everett sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of the Commission\u2019s order. The court determined that proof by clear and convincing evidence was the appropriate standard, and reversed the Commission\u2019s order and remanded the case to the Commission for further proceedings. BGE and the Commission appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court concluded the preponderance of the evidence standard was appropriate and reversed the circuit court. Everett petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Focusing on the \u201cnature\u201d of the dispute between the parties before the Commission, the Court first determined that Everett\u2019s claimed use of a fictitious name in applying for utility service amounted to an allegation of fraud. Casting about for an appropriate standard of proof in a legislative and administrative vacuum, the Court noted that, under a long-standing common law principle, similar allegations must be proven by clear and convincing evidence if made in civil judicial proeeed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ings. <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 300-01, 513 A.2d at 889-90 (citing <em>Peurifoy v. Cong. Motors, Inc., </em>254 Md. 501, 517, 255 A.2d 332, 340 (1969)). Addressing the other allegations leveled by BGE against Everett, the Court determined that Everett\u2019s supposed unauthorized use of service could support a criminal charge under Md.Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 192,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and accordingly, the conduct alleged by BGE amounted to an allegation of the commission of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Recognizing that the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard is generally applied in civil cases in courts and administrative proceedings,\u201d the <em>Everett </em>Court explained that \u201ccertain cases require a more exacting standard because of the seriousness of the allegations.\u201d <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 301, 513 A.2d at 890 (citing McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 337 at 959 (E. Cleary 3d ed.1984)). The Court also reviewed its decisions in <em>First Nat. Bank of S. Md. v. U.S.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>275 Md. 400, 411, 340 A.2d 275, 283 (1975) (applying the clear and convincing evidence standard where there was an allegation of fraud) and <em>Rent-A-Car v. Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., </em>161 Md. 249, 267, 156 A. 847, 855 (1931) (explaining that when a crime is imputed in a civil case, something more than a mere preponderance of the evidence must be produced to prove the conduct). Ultimately we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">[Wjhere a utility alleges that a customer engaged in conduct amounting to fraud or to a crime and such conduct constitutes the sole basis of the customer\u2019s alleged responsibility for prior unpaid bills, the utility must prove its allegation by clear and convincing evidence to justify termination of service for non-payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 304, 513 A.2d at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Petitioner claims in the instant case that close scrutiny of the \u201cnature\u201d of his alleged conduct reveals that each of the eight allegations for which he was charged and found \u201cguilty\u201d encompasses essentially the traits of fraud and dishonesty, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>well as the criminal offense of theft. Petitioner notes that this Court has determined that theft is the \u201cembodiment of deceitfulness,\u201d and, as such, is included among the <em>crimen falsi Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 270, 619 A.2d 105, 108 (1993). <em>See Wicks v. State, </em>311 Md. 376, 382, 535 A.2d 459, 461(1988).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In an effort to align the facts of his case with those in <em>Everett, </em>Petitioner strains to argue that theft embodies, or is the equivalent of, common law fraud, assumedly because of its shared characteristics of deceitfulness and/or dishonesty, thereby requiring the elevated standard of proof of clear and convincing evidence under <em>Everett. See First Nat. Bank of S. Md., </em>275 Md. at 411, 340 A.2d at 283 (holding that when \u201cfraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct\u201d is imputed, \u201csomething more than a mere preponderance of the evidence must be produced\u201d). Equating the burden of proof in an administrative proceeding to be the same as in a parallel civil judicial proceeding involving allegations of the same nature, Petitioner concludes that allegations of his theft-related misconduct, like fraud, must meet the higher evidentiary standard of clear and convincing evidence. <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 302, 513 A.2d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Alternatively, Petitioner contends that the administrative charges lodged against him constitute allegations of serious wrongdoing that, in a criminal context, could constitute a crime under Maryland\u2019s theft statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 342. Petitioner observes that theft, a common law crime codified at Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 340-45, is a <em>malum in se </em>offense, meaning the conduct is \u201cinherently evil,\u201d Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law 33-34 (3d ed.2000). Hence, Petitioner reasons that theft is a serious criminal offense that requires, under the reasoning of <em>Everett, </em>at least the clear and convincing standard of proof when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>charged in an administrative context. <em>See Everett, </em>307 Md. at 302, 513 A.2d at 890; <em>Rent-A-Car, </em>161 Md. at 267, 156 A. at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Petitioner allows that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in <em>Meyers v. Montgomery County Police Dep\u2019t, </em>96 Md.App. 668, 626 A.2d 1010 (1993), may be distinguished from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Meyers, </em>the Court of Special Appeals addressed the appropriate burden of proof in a LEOBR administrative disciplinary case in which an officer was charged with two violations of the Montgomery County Police Department\u2019s (\u201cDepartment\u201d) \u201cuse of force\u201d directive as a result of actions taken by him during an arrest. Following a hearing conducted in accordance with the LEOBR, Officer Meyers was found \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201ckick[ing] and stomp[ing]\u201d a citizen with his foot while the citizen was lying prone and handcuffed on the ground. <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 708, 626 A.2d at 1030. The hearing board recommended a short suspension as the sanction. The chief ultimately determined that Officer Meyers should receive a letter of reprimand in his file for this misconduct. <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 671, 626 A.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected Officer Meyers\u2019s argument that the holding in <em>Everett </em>required the clear and convincing standard of proof in his LEOBR proceeding where the administrative allegation \u2014 use of excessive force \u2014 amounted to an allegation of criminal conduct. <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 694, 626 A.2d at 1023. The intermediate appellate court offered several reasons why <em>Everett </em>was distinguishable from Meyers\u2019s case. First, the court noted the special nature of the domain of the Public Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), observing that, \u201cthe expertise the Commission brings to its proceedings, as opposed to the LEOBR proceedings that are conducted by laypersons, and the heightened judicial deference given to Commission decisions [by the courts of this State] as compared to other administrative agencies,\u201d might explain the Court\u2019s imposition of the clear and convincing standard in <em>Everest. Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 693, 626 A.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The court further distinguished <em>Everett, </em>noting that at least one of the charges in <em>Everett </em>amounted to an allegation of fraud. The court found <em>Everett </em>to be inapposite in Meyers\u2019s case, where the administrative allegation could not be construed reasonably to state a claim sounding in fraud. Moreover, the court noted, Officer Meyers\u2019s case involved an internal dispute between a public employee and the agency (Montgomery County Police Department) that employed him, contrasted to <em>Everett </em>which involved a dispute between a public consumer and a regulated utility before the administrative agency responsible for the field of public utility regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">As in the present case, the police officer in <em>Meyers </em>cited <em>First Nat. Bank of S. Md. v. U.S.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>275 Md. 400, 340 A.2d 275 (1975), and <em>Rent-A-Car Co. v. Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., </em>161 Md. 249, 156 A. 847 (1931), as additional support for his contention that the clear and convincing standard was appropriate because allegations against him \u201camounted to an allegation of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 695, 626 A.2d at 1023. The court described the factual predicates of those cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">[T]he First National Bank of Southern Maryland [\u201cBank\u201d] brought an action against U.S.F. &amp; G., the Bank\u2019s insurer, on a fidelity bond for the recovery of losses the Bank incurred as a result of a Bank employee\u2019s allegedly dishonest and fraudulent acts. The Bank claimed that the employee\u2019s conduct fell within the terms of the fidelity bond, which covered, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ny loss through any dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act of any of the Employees.... \u201d The Court of Appeals stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">When fraud, dishonesty or criminal conduct is imputed, something more than a mere preponderance of evidence must be produced; the proof must be \u201cclear and satisfactory\u201d and be of such a character as to appeal strongly to the conscience of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 694, 626 A.2d at 1023.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">With regard to <em>Rent-A-Car, </em>the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In that case, a car rental company brought suit against its insurer when the insurer failed to pay a loss resulting from a fire. The insurer argued in its defense that the insured had intentionally started the fire that caused the loss in an effort to defraud the insurer. Following a judgment for the insurer, the insured appealed. The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis that a jury instruction required the defendant to prove its allegation of fraud by a preponderance of the evidence, (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">The Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The defense in this case amounted to a charge that the appellant, its officers and employee, had committed a serious criminal offense. In such cases the rule in England is that even in civil cases something more than a mere preponderance of evidence is required to establish guilt, and, whatever the law may be elsewhere, that appears to be the law of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">[T]he general rule is stated as follows in <em>Jones on Evidence, </em>sec. 195: \u201cWhen fraud or criminal conduct is imputed the decisions frequently declare that something more than a mere preponderance of evidence must be produced, and that the proof must be clear and satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\"><em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 694-95, 626 A.2d at 1023 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The <em>Meyers </em>court rejected Offieer Meyers\u2019s argument, interpreting <em>Everett, First Nat. Bank of S. Md., </em>and <em>Rent-A-Car, </em>to stand for the proposition that \u201cwhile the clear and convincing standard <em>must </em>be applied in a civil [judicial] proceeding in which fraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct is alleged, this requirement d[id] not automatically extend to administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 695, 626 A.2d at 1023 (emphasis added). This interpretation, the appellate court explained, was permitted and supported by the merely directory nature of the language employed by the <em>Everett </em>Court when it stated, \u201c \u2018where allegations involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>fraud or criminal conduct, something more than a preponderance of the evidence <em>may </em>be required in proving these charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 695-96, 626 A.2d at 1023-24 (quoting <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 302, 513 A.2d at 891) (emphasis added). Finally, the <em>Meyers </em>court noted that the holding in <em>Everett, supra, </em>was limited closely to the facts of that case. <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 696, 626 A.2d at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">While Petitioner concedes that the preponderance of the evidence standard properly was approved in <em>Meyers, </em>he distinguishes the case <em>sub judice </em>based on a comparison of the nature of the misconduct charged in each case. He argues that while Meyers\u2019s misconduct amounted to assault and battery had it been asserted in a criminal context, the same misconduct alleged in a civil context as a tort need be proved only by the lower standard of preponderance of the evidence. On the other hand, Petitioner asserts, \u201cfraud and theft require proof by clear and convincing evidence in a civil context;\u201d accordingly the clear and convincing evidence standard should be applied in a parallel contested administrative adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The most widely applied measure of the ultimate burden of persuasion in civil cases is by a preponderance of the evidence, and generally that standard also is applicable in administrative proceedings. <em>Calvert County Planning Comm\u2019n v. Howlin Realty Mgmt., Inc., </em>364 Md. 301, 327, 772 A.2d 1209, 1224 (2001); <em>Everett, </em>307 Md. at 301, 513 A.2d at 890; <em>Bernstein v. Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>221 Md. 221, 232, 156 A.2d 657, 663 (1959). This was so, and acknowledged to be, at the time <em>Everett </em>was decided. In judicial proceedings, however, this Court has said that \u201cthere are some factual issues that impinge so directly and significantly on fundamental rights as to require more than mere preponderance of the evidence to resolve adversely to the person affected.\u201d <em>Howlin, </em>364 Md. at 327, 772 A.2d at 1224 (citing <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (declaring unconstitutional a New York statute that required a preponderance of the evidence to support termination of parental rights and requiring, instead, clear and convincing evidence); <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>(civil commitment of person to mental institution); <em>Woodby v.

Mack, </em>329 Md. 188, 618 A.2d 744 (1993) (requiring clear and convincing evidence for withdrawal of life sustaining medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Not all cases, judicial or otherwise, that warrant imposition of the clear and convincing standard, however, concern situations implicating individual liberties. As we have previously stated, allegations of fraud ordinarily must be established through clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Everett, </em>307 Md. at 302, 513 A.2d at 890; <em>First Nat. Bank of S. Md., </em>275 Md. at 411, 340 A.2d at 283. <em>But see Krouse v. Krouse, </em>94 Md.App. 369, 376-81, 617 A.2d 1098, 1102-04 (1993) (finding in will caveats, the caveator need prove fraud by only a preponderance of the evidence). <em>See also Owens-Illinois v.

This is so because, unlike the intermediate appellate court, we have the authority, and shall exercise it in this instance, to overrule <em>Everett. </em>We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">At the time <em>Everett </em>was decided, the contours of general state administrative law principles in Maryland were materially different than now. The Court then did not have the benefit of a broad public policy pronouncement by the State legislature that expressed a particular standard of proof requirement relative to contested administrative cases. Seeking a principled basis for its decision in the absence of such a policy, the <em>Everett </em>Court sought guidance, by analogy, from the common law, which traditionally required the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>standard of clear and convincing evidence to prove allegations of fraud in civil judicial proceedings. The Court drew on that analogy to decide <em>Everett. </em>The relevant legal terrain, however, has changed since <em>Everett </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It is instructive that the General Assembly, in its 1993 revision of Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), State Government Art., \u00a7\u00a7 10-101-10-305, established, for the first time, preponderance of the evidence as the generally applicable standard of proof to be used by covered state administrative agencies in contested case hearings, including, of particular relevance here, disciplinary actions by the Maryland State Police under the LEOBR. <em>See </em>APA \u00a7 10-217. This enactment occurred seven years after <em>Everett </em>was decided by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The State APA was enacted initially in 1957, <em>see </em>Chapter 94, Acts of 1957 (originally codified at Md.Code (1957), Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244-256), and is currently codified at Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl-Vol., 2001 Supp.), State Government Art., \u00a7\u00a7 10-101-10-305. The purpose of the State APA is to provide a \u201cstandard framework of fair and appropriate procedures for agencies that are responsible for both administration and adjudication of their respective statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Bragunier Masonry Contractors v. Md. Comm\u2019r of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>111 Md.App. 698, 705, 684 A.2d 6, 9 (1996). The APA prescribes procedures for two types of proceedings: (1) procedures for the adoption of regulations, <em>see </em>APA \u00a7\u00a7 10-101-10-139, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>(2) adjudicatory procedures for deciding contested cases, <em>see </em>APA \u00a7\u00a7 10-201-10-227.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It \u201capplies to all state administrative agencies not specifically exempted.\u201d <em>Bragunier, </em>111 Md. App. at 705, 684 A.2d at 9. <em>See </em>APA \u00a7 10-203 (expressly excluding certain entities from the contested cases subtitle of the APA). Although the Executive branch state agencies excluded from the embrace of the State APA\u2019s contested cases provisions include some substantial portions of the State bureaucracy (the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission, the State Department of Assessments <em>&amp; </em>Taxation, and the Public Service Commission, to name a few), the bulk of the Executive branch agencies are included. This judicially noticeable fact gives weight and impetus to the broad sweep of the fundamental principles of State administrative law which should extend to similar proceedings beyond those conducted by administrative bodies strictly covered by the State APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">A state police officer confronted with disciplinary proceedings is entitled to protections afforded by the contested cases provisions of the APA, <em>see </em>APA \u00a7 10-202, as well as those provided under the LEOBR. <em>See </em>\u00a7 727(b)(1) (defining \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d to include members of the Department of the State Police). <em>See also Md.

Everett, </em>307 Md. at 303, 513 A.2d at 891 (explaining that the APA expressly excludes from its coverage the proceedings of the Public Service Commission). The standard of proof to be applied in such contested case hearings under the APA is that of, \u201cthe preponderance of evidence unless the standard of clear and convincing evidence is imposed on the agency by regulation, statute,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or constitution.\u201d <em>See </em>APA \u00a7 10-217.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">County police agencies, as we noted earlier, are not included within the purview of the State APA. <em>See Stevens, </em>337 Md. at 482, 654 A.2d at 882 (citing <em>Younkers, </em>333 Md. at 17, 633 A.2d at 862, the Court noted that \u201cagency action taken pursuant to the LEOBR by county police departments is not reviewed according to a statutorily defined standard.... \u201d). Moreover, as previously indicated, the LEOBR is silent on the standard of proof to be applied in a police disciplinary action. That is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>not to say, however, that the Hearing Board in the present case was left adrift entirely in determining the burden of persuasion to be applied in its LEOBR proceeding. Respondent promulgated departmental standards and procedures, discussed <em>supra </em>note 15, providing that charged departmental violations must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence standard. There is no statute or other regulation that has been brought to our attention, or that we could find, that imposes a higher burden in a local police department LEOBR proceeding. The departmental standard in the present case obviously is consistent with APA \u00a7 10-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In the absence of a legislative or regulatory enactment to the contrary, we believe that the preponderance of the evidence standard applied under analogous circumstances in <em>Meyers</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>should apply generally in LEOBR proceedings to encourage uniformity of treatment of police in disciplinary matters, even where there are allegations of serious misconduct that might be cognizable as criminal if alleged in a judicial forum. This standard makes for more efficient and understandable LEOBR proceedings. This is of particular concern where the hearing boards are composed ordinarily of \u201c \u2018laypersons\u2019 who do not specialize in presiding over proceedings or hearing disputes under the LEOBR____\u201d <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 693, 626 A.2d at 1022.

We\u2019re not lawyers. We\u2019re not judges ... we don\u2019t study or practice on a regular daily basis, ... the case, pertaining to the issue which you have addressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Moreover, a public policy of uniformity in law enforcement disciplinary matters is consistent with the LEOBR\u2019s policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>uniformity discussed by the Court in <em>Moats, </em>324 Md. at 527-29, 597 A.2d at 976-77. In <em>Moats, </em>the Court denied two police officers the right to waive the procedures under the LEOBR in lieu of pursuing a grievance under a collective bargaining agreement through their union. The Court emphasized that the legislative intent behind the LEOBR was to provide a uniform system of discipline that enhanced law enforcement\u2019s effectiveness and the public trust, and avoided the deleterious effects of \u201cinconsistent application\u201d of the LEOBR. <em>Moats, </em>324 Md. at 527-28, 597 A.2d at 976 (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted). Determining that the General Assembly intended for the LEOBR to provide an exclusive procedural remedy for law enforcement officers facing disciplinary charges, the Court discussed its legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abt\">The General Assembly in 1987 passed Senate Bill 860, and in 1988 it passed Senate Bill 227. The intent of these bills was \u2018to allow law enforcement officers to elect to waive rights under the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights and elect in the alternative a procedural or substantive right or guarantee under a collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 ... Each of these bills was vetoed by the Governor.... [T]he Governor expressed concern that this legislation would result in an \u2018inconsistent application of the [LEOBR]\u2019 ...

In <em>Addington, </em>the Supreme Court considered the appropriate standard of proof to be applied in an involuntary civil commitment proceeding. The Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The function of a standard of proof, as that concept is embodied in the Due Process Clause ... is to \u2018instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.\u2019 <em>In re Winship, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>397 U.S. 358, 370 [, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1075, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) ] (Harlan, J., concurring). The standard serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">441 U.S. at 423, 99 S.Ct. at 1808, 60 L.Ed.2d 323. Remarking on the evolution of the law in this area, the Supreme Court recognized the emergence of three different, supposedly distinct, standards of proof for different types of cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">At one end of the spectrum is the typical civil case involving a monetary dispute between private parties. Since society has a minimal concern with the outcome of such private suits, plaintiffs burden of proof is a mere preponderance of the evidence. The litigants thus share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">In a criminal case, on the other hand, the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment. ... This is accomplished by requiring under the Due Process Clause that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">The intermediate standard, which usually employs some combination of the words \u201cclear,\u201d \u201ccogent,\u201d \u201cunequivocal,\u201d and \u201cconvincing,\u201d is less commonly used, but nonetheless \u2018is no stranger to the civil law.\u2019 One typical use of the standard is in civil cases involving allegations of fraud or some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing by the defendant. The interests at stake in those cases are deemed to be more substantial than mere loss of money and some jurisdictions accordingly reduce the risk to the defendant of having his reputation tarnished erroneously by increasing the plaintiffs burden of proof. Similarly, this Court has used the \u201cclear, unequivocal and convincing\u201d standard of proof to protect particularly important individual interests in various civil cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 423-24, 99 S.Ct. at 1808, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (citations omitted). Applying the balancing test developed in <em>Mathews, </em>the Supreme Court determined that clear and convincing evidence \u2014 not the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 adequately satisfied appellant\u2019s procedural due process rights in the civil commitment context presented there. <em>See Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 433, 99 S.Ct. at 1813, 60 L.Ed.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In <em>Santosky, </em>the Supreme Court held that the heightened standard of clear and convincing evidence \u2014 not preponderance of the evidence \u2014 was mandated in termination of parental rights proceedings. Evaluating the issue under the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test, the Court found \u201cthe private interest affected [was] commanding; the risk of error from using a preponderance standard [was] substantial; and the countervailing governmental interest favoring that standard [was] comparatively slight.\u201d <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 758, 102 S.Ct. at 1397, 71 L.Ed.2d 599.

Petitioner claims deprivation of two private interests: (1) a \u201cproperty\u201d interest in his continued employment as a police officer and, by corollary, his pension benefits; and/or (2) a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cliberty\u201d interest based upon the deleterious nature of the charges lodged against him that, with a finding of \u201cguilt,\u201d would result in damage to his reputation in the community at large and/or result in the attachment of a stigma that would preclude other employment opportunities. For purposes of our analysis, we shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Petitioner demonstrated a cognizable property or liberty interest in his continued employment with the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Nevertheless, a review of the remaining two factors under <em>Mathews </em>persuades us that the preponderance of the evidence standard satisfies Petitioner\u2019s due process rights here.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Our inquiry under the second factor in <em>Matheios </em>is twofold: we must first consider \u201cthe risk of an erroneous deprivation of [Petitioner\u2019s] interest through the procedures used\u201d in compliance with the LEOBR; we then appraise the \u201cprobable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d as proposed by Petitioner. <em>Id. </em>In this vein, we weigh \u201cboth the risk of erroneous deprivation of private interests resulting from use of a \u2018fair preponderance\u2019 standard and the likelihood that a higher evidentiary standard would reduce that risk\u201d to determine \u201cwhether a preponderance standard fairly allocates the risk of an erroneous factfinding between the[] two parties.\u201d <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 761, 102 S.Ct. at 1399, 71 L.Ed.2d 599. <em>See Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 702, 626 A.2d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The LEOBR provides essentially a two-phase administrative process in law enforcement disciplinary actions. The first phase regulates the procedures to be followed at interrogation or investigation of an officer\u2019s alleged misconduct. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 728(b). The second phase concerns an adjudicatory proceeding before a hearing board if an investigation or interrogation results in a recommendation that the officer be subject to any disciplinary action. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 730-731. The procedural safeguards mandated by \u00a7 730 guarantee an officer, <em>inter alia, </em>notice that he is entitled to a hearing on the issues before a hearing board, <em>see </em>\u00a7 730(a); the right to present evidence and argument with respect to the issues involved and the right to be represented by counsel, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00a7 730(d); the right of cross-examination of the witnesses who testify, <em>see </em>\u00a7 730(f); and the right to compel attendance of witnesses by summons, <em>see \u00a7 </em>730(j). Moreover, if the hearing board recommends the imposition of a disciplinary sanction, the chief of police makes the final determination whether to impose punishment based upon the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the hearing board. <em>See </em>\u00a7 731(c). Finally, the LEOBR provides for judicial review of a final order by the police chief. <em>See \u00a7 732.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">There is no question here that Petitioner was afforded the panoply of rights provided by the LEOBR. Petitioner received a written, detailed notice of the pending charges; he retained legal counsel to represent his interests; he was given a copy of the investigation and discovery; he was granted a pre-termination evidentiary hearing that was conducted over a three-day period before a three-member hearing board comprised of his peers; he was provided with a written decision by the hearing board containing its findings; he was provided a written decision from the Chief explaining his reasons for the termination; and he has taken full advantage of his right to judicial review. As we indicated earlier, <em>supra </em>pages 122-123, the LEOBR grants extensive procedural protections and rights to law enforcement officers in disciplinary proceedings that are not available to the general public. We conclude that the multi-tiered protections prescribed by the LPJOBR, when conducted properly as here, adequately protect against the risk of arbitrary decision-making and limits the risk of an erroneous deprivation of Petitioner\u2019s due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Nor do we find that implementation of the heightened standard of proof sought by Petitioner would so significantly reduce the risk of error that it should be implemented regardless of any additional administrative or financial burdens it would entail. Candor requires that we acknowledge the difficulty a lay panel may encounter in perceiving the subtle distinctions and nuances between these two abstract standards when called upon to apply it. <em>See Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 425, 99 S.Ct. at 1809, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (discussing the difficulty lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>jurors may have in understanding the differences among the three standards of proof, Chief Justice Burger observed, \u201cwe probably can assume no more than that the difference between a preponderance of the evidence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt probably is better understood than either of them in relation to the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). <em>See also Wills v.

This precise sentiment was reflected by the Chair of Petitioner\u2019s Hearing Board when he expressed his uncertainty about the board\u2019s ability to effectively differentiate between the two standards, <em>see supra </em>page 142. That is not to say the adoption of a standard of proof is an \u201cempty semantic exercise.\u201d <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 424-25, 99 S.Ct. at 1808-09, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (quoting <em>Tippett, </em>436 F.2d at 1166 (Sobeloff, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The standard of proof as adopted by the courts \u201c \u2018reflects the value society places on individual liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tippett, </em>436 F.2d at 1166).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Finally, under <em>Mathews, </em>we must consider \u201cthe Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d 424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. at 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18. While a heightened evidentiary standard would place a limited fiscal or administrative burden on county and municipal police agencies, we must \u201cweigh heavily in their favor their interest in the internal discipline of the Police Department.\u201d <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 705, 626 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>at 1028. It also serves the public\u2019s interest that the chief law enforcement executives are empowered to remove expeditiously corrupt officers from departmental ranks. Moreover, the adoption of a scheme that would mandate a higher level of proof in a local police department disciplinary action versus one initiated in the State police organization would create an inexplicable disparate impact between officers within the overall law enforcement community itself. This would not comport with LEOBR\u2019s public policy of uniformity discussed <em>supra </em>page 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Based on our evaluation of Petitioner\u2019s due process claims under <em>Mathews, </em>we conclude that the procedures afforded under LEOBR adequately protect an officer against an erroneous deprivation of his or her due process claims. The evidentiary standard of preponderance of the evidence, added to the array of other protections, strikes the appropriate balance between protecting the private interests of an officer accused of misconduct and a law enforcement agency\u2019s interest in maintaining internal discipline. We therefore conclude that the correct evidentiary standard to be applied under LEOBR in local police agency cases is the preponderance of the evidence standard. Accordingly, we do not address Respondent\u2019s questions presented in its conditional cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-11\">.

Respondent\u2019s rules controlling the standard of proof for the Board to use are found in both the Administrative Hearing &amp; Suspension Boards Manual and the Trial Board Procedures Manual.

The statute, however, does appear to contemplate indirectly that such'rules may exist. For example, \u00a7 734B addresses the Legislature's intent to preempt conflicting legislative and regulatory enactments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5N\">[T]he provisions of this subtitle shall supersede any State, county or municipal law, ordinance, or regulation that conflicts with the provisions of this subtitle, and any local legislation shall be preempted by the sub ject and material of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aph\">In addition, \u00a7 728(c) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8l\">This subtitle does not limit the authority of the chief to regulate the competent and efficient operation and management of a law enforcement agency by any reasonable means including but not limited to, transfer and reassignment where that action is not punitive in nature and where the chief determines that action to be in the best interests of the internal management of the law enforcement agency.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">. In Maryland, there are three recognized standards of proof to test the sufficiency of the evidence in differing contexts: (1) proof by preponderance of the evidence; (2) proof by clear and convincing evidence; and (3) proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 373-74, 620 A.2d 295, 296 (1993); <em>Meyers, </em>96 Md.App. at 687-89, 626 A.2d at 1019-20; <em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>76 Md.App. 488, 502, 547 A.2d 636, 642-43 (1988). The Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions are instructive with regard to defining those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence is defined in the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">To prove by a preponderance of the evidence means to prove that something is more likely so than not so. In other words, a preponderance of the evidence means such evidence which, when considered and compared with the evidence opposed to it, has more convincing force and produces in your minds a belief that it is more likely true than not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">If you believe that the evidence is evenly balanced on an issue, ihen your finding on that issue must be against the party who has the burden of proving it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">MPJI 1:7 (3d ed.2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">Proof by clear and convincing evidence is defined in the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>To be clear and convincing, evidence should be \"clear\u201d in the sense that it is certain, plain to the understanding, and unambiguous and \"convincing\u201d in the sense that it is so reasonable and persuasive as to cause you to believe it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\">MPJI 1:8 (3d ed.2000). <em>See also Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 317-20, 413 A.2d 170, 177-78 (1980). The preponderance and clear and convincing standards are used in civil matters, in both judicial and administrative contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"AMn\">The highest standard of proof, firmly entrenched in, and reserved for, our criminal justice system, requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and is defined in the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab6\">The State has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.... However, the State is not required to prove guilt beyond all possible doubt or to a mathematical certainty. Nor is the State required to negate every conceivable circumstance of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaW\">A reasonable doubt is a doubt founded upon reason. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires such proof as would convince you of the truth of a fact to the extent that you would be willing to act upon such belief without reservation in an important matter in your own business or personal affairs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARkd\">MPJI-Cr. 2:02 (2001). <em>See also Wills, </em>329 Md. at 375-85, 620 A.2d at 297-302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">.
