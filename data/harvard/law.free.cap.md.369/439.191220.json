In response to the issuance of that license, Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., Varsity Auto Repair, Inc., and Windsor Service, Inc., appellees, appealed the approval of appellant\u2019s towing license application to the County Board of Appeals of Baltimore County (Board of Appeals). The Board of Appeals .reversed the decision of the DPM. Appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, which affirmed the decision of the Board of Appeals. Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to. consideration by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Jordan Towing, Inc. v. Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., </em>367 Md. 722, 790 A.2d 673 (2002). Appellant presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">\u201cA. Did the Board of Appeals commit error in finding that Windsor Service, Inc., Hebbville Auto Repair, Inc., and Varsity Auto Repair, Inc. have standing to raise an Equal Protection challenge in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">B. Did the Board of Appeals commit error in concluding that the actions of the Department of Permits and Development Management were subject to an Equal Protection analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">C. Did the Board of Appeals commit error in its determination that the actions of the Department of Permits and Development Management violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In their brief to this Court, the appellees have presented the following responses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201c1. Do Hebbville, et al. have standing? Are Hebbville, et al. aggrieved persons? Has Jordan misstated the issue? Is the issue untimely raised?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">2. Consistent with <em>Pollard\u2019s Touring, </em>is the County Board of Appeals finding (based on established criteria) that Jordan failed to prove need [entitled to] due deference under the narrow scope of judicial review of factual inferences and application of law to facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">3. Is the County Board of Appeals interpretation reasonable, as a matter of statutory construction, that it is impermissible to utilize racial diversity and/or racial orientation in a service area to find a need for additional service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">4. Is the County Board of Appeals finding proper, on this record, that county issuance of the license conflicted with the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">5. Does the license application comply in other respects with the county towing ordinance?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>We answer appellant\u2019s first question in the negative\u2014 appellees had standing before the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Section 24-225 of the Baltimore County Code, which states, \u201c[a]ny person who is aggrieved by a decision of the department of permits and licenses shall have the right to file an appeal\u201d conferred standing upon appellees to challenge, via an appeal to the Board of Appeals, the granting of appellant\u2019s towing license. Appellant contends that this independent basis for standing does not confer standing upon the appellees to raise a constitutional challenge to the granting of appellant\u2019s towing license.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Circuit Court, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201cThe protestants [appellees] clearly have demonstrated they have standing to pursue this action. As the other licensed towers in the district, the business that is presently divided between them will be reduced or diminished by decisions which affect the ability of other towers to be licensed in their district. It is clear that they have been disadvantaged by the decision to permit another tower to be licensed in their region. For this reason, standing has been adequately demonstrated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">We affirm this finding of the Circuit Court that appellees had standing before the Board of Appeals and the Circuit Court challenging the granting of appellant\u2019s license. At the administrative level appellees were \u201caggrieved\u201d under the relevant Baltimore County Code section because their businesses are directly affected by the issuance of an additional towing license in the geographical area where they alone hold licenses. A party is aggrieved and there is standing if the party suffers some \u201cspecial damage ... differing in character and kind from that suffered by the general public.\u201d <em>Weinberg v. Kracke, </em>189 Md. 275, 280, 55 A.2d 797, 799 (1947); <em>see Sugarloaf Citizens Assn. v. MDE, </em>344 Md. 271, 686 A.2d 605 (1996);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Inlet Associates v. Assateague House Condo. Assn., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>313 Md. 413, 545 A.2d 1296 (1988); <em>Becker v. Litty, </em>318 Md. 76, 566 A.2d 1101(1989); <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289 (1967). In <em>Sugarloaf </em>344 Md. at 295, 686 A.2d at 617, this Court discussed aggrievement and emphasized that standing does not depend on the type of issue raised or its likelihood of success and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">\u201cTherefore, standing to challenge governmental action, and the merits of the challenge, are separate and distinct issues .... \u2018The fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a ... court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated\u2019.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">For the reasons stated <em>supra </em>and under the facts of this case, appellees were proper parties to this action and had standing when they appealed the DPM\u2019s decision to the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We do not directly answer the remaining questions. We shall, however, affirm the decision of the Board of Appeals reversing the issuance of the towing license to appellant. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>hold that the Baltimore County Code provisions at issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>cannot be interpreted, <em>under the facts here present, </em>in such a way as to permit the granting of a towing license to appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">a. The Towing Application Process</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The case <em>sub judice </em>involves an application by appellant for a towing permit, which is regulated under the Baltimore County Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provision regarding the license requirement reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cSec. 24-226. License required to engage in towing business; storage facilities required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in towing disabled vehicles from the scene of a motor vehicle accident occurring within the county without first having obtained a license from the department of permits and licenses to do so as hereinafter provided or during the suspension or revocation thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The DPM is vested with the authority to determine whether to approve an application for a towing license in accordance with section 24-229, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">\u201cSec. 24-229. Approval of new license towers; location requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">(a) New licensed towers shall be approved by the Department of Permits and Licenses based upon the need for additional service. If the need does not exist, the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tion will not be approved. The transfer of an existing license shall be treated in the same manner as a new license, and any such transfer shall be subject to all provisions applicable thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">While the Baltimore County Code does not specify the criteria<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to be considered in determining the \u201cneed for additional [towing] service,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the typical practice within the DPM when a towing license application is submitted for a specific geographical area is to refer the application to the Baltimore County Police Department (BCPD) for investigation and review of the need for additional towers in a particular area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The BCPD then reports back to the DPM and the DPM ultimately issues or declines to issue the license. If a license is issued, a towing business is assigned the specific geographical area within Baltimore County in which it can operate and is notified by the police whenever a disabled vehicle needs to be removed from an accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Unlike the Baltimore County Code, which does not define or clarify \u201cneed\u201d in the code sections pertaining to new towers, the BCPD does utilize specific \u201cneed\u201d criteria to assess the need for additional service when forming its report for the DPM. The \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d memorandum issued to all of its precincts by the BCPD, and presumably available to applicants,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201cNEED CRITERIA[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018need\u2019 as presented in Section 24-229 of the Baltimore County Code specifies the Police Department\u2019s need for an additional tower in the applicant\u2019s area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cWhen determining \u2018need\u2019, the following factors shall be considered by the Police Department\u2019s Towing Unit when processing an application [for] a Baltimore County Towing License.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201c1. The geographical location of the tower with respect to the heavily traveled roadways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">2. The number of accidents with disabled vehicles on these heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">3. The proximity of other licensed towers, both in terms [of] miles and minutes between the applicant\u2019s location and the licensed towers location that are currently servicing the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">4. A history of the previous year; late response times and no response times for the licensed towers currently servicing the area. The number of years experience, number of trucks and number of complaints of the licensed towers currently servicing the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">5. The growth potential for the particular geographical area in which the applicant is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>6. The average daily traffic count for the heavily traveled roadways in the applicant\u2019s area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">7. Whether or not the application is for a location where a tow license had previously been in existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">8. The quality of the operation of the applicant, including the number of trucks, the number of years experience in towing, and whether or not the tower is in a position to furnish specialized services; such as heavy duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The criteria are facially race neutral. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no contention otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">It has been the longstanding practice of the DPM to interpret need as set forth in the Baltimore County Code by only using the same eight factors which are relied upon by the BCPD. The DPM has not, in the past, resorted to other definitions of need outside of the listed criteria of the BCPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">b. Appellant\u2019s Towing Application Process</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">On November 3, 1998, appellant first applied for a towing license in the Woodlawn area of Baltimore County where appellees in this case were already licensed to tow. In the ten years prior to appellant\u2019s application, no new towing licenses had been issued by Baltimore County and when appellant applied for his towing license there were no African-American towers licensed in Baltimore County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Appellant\u2019s application was reviewed by Mr. Eugene Freeman, the Chief of the DPM, and sent to the BCPD traffic management unit where it was reviewed by Officer Denker. Prior to appellant\u2019s application being submitted to the DPM, Mr. Freeman and Mr. Earl Jordan<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> discussed the issuance of towing licenses in Baltimore County. Mr. Freeman advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Mr. Jordan about the eight provisions constituting the \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d that would have to be considered and indicated that the Baltimore County Code had long been interpreted to require proof of a need for additional tow trucks to satisfy these criteria. Mr. Freeman also told Mr. Jordan that, as things stood, there was no need for additional tow trucks almost anywhere in Baltimore County. Mr. Jordan questioned whether there were any African-American towers in Baltimore County, and, if not, he questioned the fairness of the licensing policy. In response, Mr. Freeman stated, \u201c[a]nd I gave a pause, and I thought, and I said, \u2018Frankly, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair; however, in order to remedy the situation, I think probably what has to be done is is [sic.] that we need to \u2014 there' has to be a change in the Baltimore County [C]ode.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">After further consideration of the Baltimore County Code and what he perceived to be a problem, Mr. Freeman concluded that because the DPM had the authority pursuant to section 24-229 to approve or disapprove licenses based upon \u201cneed,\u201d which is not specifically defined by the Baltimore County Code, he could determine need in other ways or define need beyond the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Therefore, to define need, Mr. Freemen departed from the criteria and turned to the definition of need in both <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>and <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary.. </em>Based upon these expansive definitions, Mr. Freeman then concluded that need was not to be limited to the stated requirements, <em>i.e., </em>the \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d for the approval of additional licensed towers, but rather that need could be based on inclusiveness and diversity. Mr. Freeman acknowledged that the consideration of appellant\u2019s towing license was based on the sole fact that appellant was a minority owned business and that absent concerns for diversity, the license would not be approved because there would be no justification for an additional license pursuant to the criteria typically used.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On May 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>1999, in order, allegedly, to be fair and inclusive and to promote diversity in light of Baltimore County\u2019s policy against any form of discrimination,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Mr. Freeman granted appellant\u2019s license application.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Following the issuance of the license to appellant, a timely appeal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was noted by appellants, existing licensed towers in the Woodlawn area, to the Board of Appeals. On June 31, 2001, the Board of Appeals issued an opinion and order reversing the DPM\u2019s approval of the license and denying appellant\u2019s license application. The Board of Appeals determined that the DPM was arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory in issuing appellant\u2019s license and found that the granting of the license violated the \u201cEqual Protection clause.\u201d Appellant sought judicial review of the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On July 7, 2001, the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Board of Appeals. Appellant then filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. As we have indicated, we granted certiorari on our own motion prior to this case being heard by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In our recent case of <em>Gigeous v. ECI, </em>363 Md. 481, 769 A.2d 912 (2001), Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, discussed the review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201cWe review an administrative agency\u2019s decision under the same statutory standards as the Circuit Court. Therefore, we reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691, 694-95 (1974). Moreover, in <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 650 A.2d 226 (1994), we stated generally that \u2018[jjudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow. The court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 336 Md. at 576-77, 650 A.2d at 230 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119, 1124 (1978)); <em>see also Liberty Nursing Center, Inc. v. Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 442, 624 A.2d 941, 945 (1993) (\u201cJudicial review of agency fact finding is narrow in scope and requires the exercise of a restrained and disciplined judicial judgment.\u201d (Citing <em>Supervisor v. Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 626, 547 A.2d 190, 195 (1988))).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cWe expounded upon this doctrine in <em>Board of Physician v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 729 A.2d 376 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a \u2018court\u2019s task in review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 ... Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.... Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68-69, 729 A.2d at 381....</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u201cWe, however, \u2018may always determine whether the administrative agency made an error of law. Therefore, ordinarily the court reviewing a final decision of an administrative agency shall determine (1) the legality of the decision and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(2) whether there was substantial evidence from the record as a whole to support the decision.\u2019 <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch. v. Employment Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701, 708 (1985). Regarding the substantial evidence test, we explained in <em>Baltimore Lutheran High School, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">That is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency, but it must not itself make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662, 490 A.2d at 708. Substantial evidence is defined as \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390 (1961)). In <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., supra, </em>we further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">The scope of review is limited to whether a reasoning mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. In applying the substantial evidence test, the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the <em>expertise </em>of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken. The reviewing court also must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, since decisions of administrative agencies are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity. Furthermore, not only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch., </em>302 Md. at 662-63, 490 A.2d at 708 (citing <em>Bulluck, </em>283 Md. at 512-13, 390 A.2d 1119); <em>see Motor Vehicle Administration v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Board of Appeals, the administrative agency whose decision is being reviewed, reached the proper result in that appellant\u2019s license should not have been granted. The record before the Board of Appeals establishes that the DPM did not apply the proper need standards as interpreted under the Baltimore County Code when granting appellant\u2019s towing license. The proper basic need standards for the DPM, or Mr. Freeman, to have applied when considering appellant\u2019s towing license should have been the \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d detailed <em>supra. </em>This is how the Baltimore County Code need provisions have consistently been interpreted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, the outcome of the case <em>sub judice </em>rests upon the error of the DPM in not applying the proper standards to appellant\u2019s towing license application. The Board of Appeals was correct in finding the actions of the DPM to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">In <em>Pollard\u2019s, supra, </em>a towing license case arising out of Baltimore County, the intermediate appellate court recently and clearly indicated the proper standards to apply when issuing licenses to conduct towing operations in Baltimore County. The court in <em>Pollard\u2019s </em>discussed the \u201ceight need criteria\u201d and established that the criteria, even though unpublished in the Baltimore County Code,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> are the standards to be used in a towing license case. Judge Moylan, writing for that court, specifically referenced the Board of Appeals\u2019 opinion in that case where the Board of Appeals noted <em>\u201cbased upon prior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>practices, these eight criteria have become established criteria in which the department </em>[DPM] <em>has established the \u2018need\u2019 factor, and upon which the towing companies have relied in filing for a towing license.\u201d Pollard\u2019s, </em>137 Md.App. at 294, 768 A.2d at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">There have also been towing cases before the County Board of Appeals for Baltimore County<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> where the Board of Appeals either reversed the DPM granting of a towing license or upheld the denial of a towing license because the need criteria were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In order for a new license to issue, it must first be established that any license issued results from, or would result from, the satisfaction of a need proven by an assessment of the eight need criteria related to population, growth potential, number of accidents, response times, complaints, etc. It is the submission of the application which triggers the DPM and, in turn, the BCPD to assess the need for additional towing services in that particular geographical area pursuant to the established \u201cNeed Criteria.\u201d Mr. Freeman acknowledged to Mr. Jordan, and in his testimony before the Board of Appeals, that these criteria have become established standards for the DPM to use when assessing the \u201cneed\u201d factor under section 24-229, which states that \u201cnew licensed towers shall be approved by the department of permits and licenses based upon the <em>need </em>for additional service.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The record that was before the Board of Appeals establishes that the license approval in the instant case was flawed from the start. Appellant, when presenting its license application to the DPM, based its claim of need not upon actual need for additional towers in Baltimore County, but solely upon its minority status as an African-American business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>wanting to serve a district with a substantial African-American population currently without a minority-owned towing company and that this lack of minority participation was unfair. Thereafter, the record reflects that when appellant\u2019s application, basing need solely upon its minority status, was submitted to the DPM, Mr. Freeman stated that there was no need as traditionally interpreted. The only party initially involved in appellant\u2019s licensing application to apply the proper need standards was the BCPD. When appellant\u2019s application was submitted to the BCPD, Officer Denker\u2019s report not only summarized the facts bearing on need for additional service, but his report also stated that there were four existing towing companies making responses, nearly twenty tow trucks, zero complaints in the previous record year, and a small projection of population increase for the next decade. Then again at the hearing before the Board of Appeals, Officer Denker repeated that his facts and figures showed appellant did not meet the \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d consistently applied in the past. The BCPD \u201cNeed Criteria\u201d memorandum that was issued, and the evidence of BCPD\u2019s actual use of the criteria, establish that the BCPD has consistently interpreted the Baltimore County Code section\u2019s reference to need by the standards of the \u201cNeed Criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The need criteria have been recognized by the intermediate appellate court in <em>Pollard\u2019s, </em>have been established as the applicable standards in past Board of Appeals\u2019 opinions, have been relied upon by previous applicants in applying for a towing license, have been consistently used by the BCPD when preparing reports for the DPM, and most importantly, have been accepted by the DPM by prior consistent practice when considering license applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The record establishes that Mr. Freeman decided to issue a license to appellant based solely upon his determination that the towers of Baltimore County should be diverse, and, therefore, need existed for a licensed minority applicant without regard for the established criteria. Mr. Freeman simply circumvented the standards. Ultimately, Mr. Freeman granted appellant\u2019s license based solely on appellant\u2019s race. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Mr. Freeman\u2019s focus on expansive definitions of the word \u201cneed\u201d in two dictionaries ignores the long-standing interpretation of the provision used by the applicable administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We have previously indicated that, generally, an administrative agency should follow its own established rules, regulations and procedures.

Subsequently in a series of cases, the Supreme Court, relying on the <em>Accardi </em>case, has recognized a rule of federal administrative law that, with some excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tions, an administrative agency is required to follow its own procedures or regulations. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

The Court of Special Appeals has taken the position that, in situations where the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine is applicable, it does not matter whether-one was prejudiced by the failure of the agency to follow its procedures or regulations. <em>See, e.g., Board of Education of Baltimore Co[unty] v.

Thus, the judicial review section of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act provides that a reviewing court may \u2018reverse or modify the [administrative] decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision ...

Such a departure from past consistent interpretation and practice is a matter better addressed either by a legislative entity, or by the adoption of a regulation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">As we have pointed out from the record, there was sufficient evidentiary support for the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision to reverse the decision of Mr. Freeman based upon the ground that the proper need standards were not applied. At the hearing before the Board of Appeals, there was significant testimony regarding the eight factors used by the BCPD in addressing the \u201cneed\u201d criteria of section 24-229. Specifically, there was the testimony of Mr. Freeman himself that there was no need as traditionally interpreted, there was Officer Denker\u2019s report from his investigation showing no need for another licensed tower, and there were other witnesses who testified to the lack of need for additional towers in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Therefore, there was no evidence on the record showing that actual need existed for an additional licensee in the Woodlawn area of Baltimore County, or in the county as a whole, for that matter. We hold that the Board of Appeals was correct when it found that \u201cthere is insufficient testimony or evidence to support the granting of a license solely on the basis of the fact that the owners of appellant are African-American.\u201d When the Board of Appeals stated that appellant\u2019s license could not be issued \u201csolely\u201d on race, it impliedly found the opposite \u2014 that the standard criteria had not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Board of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of its own regulation or practice is owed deference. In <em>King, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, detailed the deference owed to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">\u201c... [A] great deal of deference is owed to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation.

More important, agency rules are designed to serve the specific needs of the agency, are promulgated by the agency, and are utilized on a day-to-day basis by the agency. A question concerning the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule is as central to its operation as an interpretation of the agency\u2019s governing statute.

This principle applies even if the non-constitutional ground was not raised by any party in the case.
