Hardison, (10 Tex. R. 467,) but it was argued below, and I suppose will be here, that by the approval the claim became a quasi judgment, (Neill v. Hodge, 5 Tex. R. 487,) which could not be contested by any subsequent action in the County'Court, and as the case had come by appeal from that Court, which had no jurisdiction to try this question, under the authority of Aulanier v. The Governor, (1 Tex. R. 668,) the District Court could not entertain it, even though it could upon an independent proceeding, had for this purpose, have cancelled the approval of the claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In reply to this we urge, 1st. That the minors were made parties, and the case reinstated for the very purpose of settling the validity of this claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">2nd. If the claim was barred by the Statute, (which the exceptions admit,) neither the administrator or Chief Justice had authority to give it validity against the estate, and their approval of the claim being beyond their jurisdiction, was absolutely void, and that a judgment is void may be shown in any tribunal, and between, any parties, where it is set up and rights are claimed under it. (Towns v. Springer, 9 Geo. 130; 12 U. S. Dig. p. 382, Sec. 103.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-6\">3rd. But if these positions were not correct, and although this defence could not be set up in the County Court in answer to Hillebrant\u2019s petition for payment, and the District Court, on the appeal, acquired only such jurisdiction as the Court in which it originated had, yet these facts would not make this an exception to the general rule under our system, that a defendant may in his answer (or third parties may come in and) set up independent facts which would have entitled the party to relief in equity, and that to save costs and to prevent multiplicity of suits, the matter alleged in the answer of the guardian should have been enquired into, instead of affirming the judgment of the County Court, and enforcing the minors to file-a new suit to have the judgment thus rendered set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-7\"><em>Yoakum &amp; Taylor, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_q\">From the uniform decisions of this Court, we understand an allowed and approved claim to be in the nature of a judgment. This judgment will not be set aside, except it be brought within the rule laid down in Neill v. Hodge. (5 Tex. R. 490.) Then it is done by a proceeding in equity, alleging the ignorance of facts or fraudulent misrepresentation. Nothing of the sort is alleged here. After a lapse of ten years a party in most cases would be unable to prove an account, as his testimony in that time would disappear. As a party would not be entitled to have a new trial to enable him to plead the Statute of Limitations, surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>a judgment would not be set aside by an appellate tribunal, for that purpose, especially after the lapse of so many years.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-5\">Lipscomb, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At2\">Hillebrant had a claim against the estate of J. W. Burton, deceased ; he presented it to the administrator of Burton, Green; it was allowed; and on the first day of March, A. D. 1844, it was approved by the Probate Judge. Subsequently one Jasper was appointed administrator <em>de bonis \u25a0non </em>of the estate of <em>Burton; </em>and on the 16th day of October, A. D. 1848, Hillebrant filed his petition with the Probate Judge, setting forth his claim, its allowance, and approval by the Probate Judge, its being ranked among the acknowledged debts \u25a0of the succession, the failure of the administrator to pay it, and that he had paid other debts not of a superior rank to it; \u2022prayed the administrator be required to make an exhibit of the \u2018Condition of the estate, and for an order of sale of a portion of the lands belonging to the said estate, to pay the whole amount \u2022of the claim, or if the estate was not able to pay the whole, that he should be paid his proportion out of the assets of the \u25a0estate. The administrator filed an answer, asking time 'to make his return. There was an order of sale, from which the \u25a0\u2022administrator appealed to the District Court. Before the appeal was decided, Jasper, the administrator <em>cle bonis non, </em>was removed, and Miller was appointed in his place. Afterwards, on a suggestion to the Court, that the infant heirs of Burton were interested in the appeal, Moore was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>to the infant heirs. He, on the 10th March, 1858, filed an answer, alleging that the claim of the petitioner Hille'brant, had been acknowledged and approved after it was barred by the Statute of limitations, and praying that the allowance of the same be set aside or annulled. To this answer, Hillebrant demurred, and his demurrer was sustained and the petition dismissed. The guardian sued out a writ of error, to reverse the judgment of the District Court, dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>We have repeatedly decided that the approval of a claim by the Probate Court, after it was allowed by the executor or administrator, is a <em>quasi </em>judgment, which cannot, at a subsequent Term, be set aside by the Probate Court. (See Swinston v. Walker\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 3 Tex. R. 93; Neill v. Hodge, 5 Tex. R. 490; Toliver v. Hubbell, 6 Tex. R. 166; Finley v. Carothers, 9 Tex. R. 517; Jones\u2019 Adm\u2019r v. Underwood, 11 Tex. R. 116.) The Probate Court could not review its decision, nor could it be revised by the District Court, when carried into that Court by an appeal; because, if the Court from whence the appeal is taken, cannot take cognizance of the subject matter, the Court to which the appeal is taken cannot. (See Aulanier v. The Governor, 1 Tex. R. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">There can be no doubt, at this day, that an administrator o\u00edan executor cannot charge the estate he represents, by the acknowledgment of a debt barred by the Statute of limitations. (See Moore\u2019s Administrator v. Hardison, 10 Tex. R. 467.) But to set aside a judgment of the Probate Court, approving such allowance, proceedings for that purpose must be instituted in the District Court. (See Adm\u2019r of Jones v. Underwood, cited above.) If the guardian had commenced proceedings in the District Court, and showed the fact that the claim was barred before its allowance and approval, there can be no question but the claim would have been set aside and annulled, if the suit for that purpose was brought in time. After a long delay, it would not be enquired into, because the debt may have been valid, and not barred, by reason of some one of the exceptions in the Statute of limitation, the evidence of which may have been lost by lapse of time; hence a Court of Equity would not be disposed to disturb the judgment, nor would our District Court, governed by principles of equity. We do not say whether the lapse of time is so great in this case, as to cut off the enquiry whether it was a valid debt against the estate when allowed and approved; because that question is not before us. We believe that the main question presented in this case has been so well settled by the cases referred to, as to render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>any further discussion unnecessary. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
