The State.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-5\">Proof that the defendant played and bet money at Rondo, within the county, within a year before the finding of the indictment, is sufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-6\">Appeal from. Rusk. Indictment for betting \u201c money upon a \u201c certain gaming table, commonly called Rondo, then and there \u201c exhibited for gaming.\u201d Statement of facts and bill of exceptions as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-7\">Be it remembered, that on the trial of the above stated case, the State introduced as a witness, N. G. Bagley, who testified that within twelve months before the finding of said indictment, he saw the defendant, George H. Ramey, play and bet money upon a game called rondo, describing the rolling of the balls into the pocket, so as to constitute the game of rondo as witness understood it; that said game was played upon a billiard table proper, in the county of Rusk, aforesaid; that it was not a game of billiards. This was all the evidence on the part of the State. The defendant introduced none; and the case was tried on the State\u2019s testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-8\">The Court charged the jury as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\"><em>\u201c </em>If the jury believe from the proof, that defendant bet at a <em>\u201c </em>game of rondo, in this county, within twelve months next be- <em>\u201c </em>fore the finding of the indictment, he is guilty as charged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the Court to charge the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-11\">\u201c That if the table, on which the playing at rondo by defend- \u201c ant occurred, was proved to have been a billiard table, in <em>\u201c </em>order to convict the defendant, it must also appear from the \u201c proof, that said table, at the time of said playing, was kept <em>qt \u201c </em>used as a gaming table, otherwise they must find for the de- <em>\u201c </em>fendant; which charge the Court refused to give unquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>fiedly, but gave the same with the following addition, to wit: \u201c The Court adds, that if the game of rondo be played on a \u201c table of any kind, it is, whilst the game is being played, a \u201c rondo table, in the eye of the law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvG6\">The Court also charged verbally, \u201c that it made no differ- \u201c ence whether the playing at rondo was in a private dwelling \u201c or in a public place <em>; </em>that betting upon and playing the said \u201c game was equally against the law, in either case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The defendant then asked the Court to charge as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-7\"><em>\u201c </em>That proof of a single playing at rondo, on a billiard table, \u201c without the knowledge or consent of the keeper of such bil- \u201c liard table, will not constitute said billiard table a gaming \u201c table, in the sense in which those terms are used in the Stat- \u201c ute against betting at a gaming table or bank;\u201d which the Court refused to, give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-8\">The defendant excepted to the charges given, and to the refusal to charge as asked by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">The foregoing embraces all the instructions given and asked to be given in charge to the jury, and also all the evidence in the case, and the same is agreed to, <em>&amp;c.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-10\"><em>Bowden &amp; OMlton, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0V\">I. The Court should have given the first charge asked by defendant. The qualification is foreign to the matter embraced in the instruction desired, and must necessarily have misled the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-11\">II. The verbal charge was also erroneous. It certainly was not intended by the Legislature to make so sweeping a prohibition of an innocent amusement, even in places the most private, as the Court supposed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-12\">III. The last charge asked should have been given. Article 566 (Hart. Dig.) prohibits the keeping or exhibiting a gaming table. The next Section enacts that if any person shall bet at such gaming table, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, &amp;c. It is contended that a gaming table must be kept or exhibited, before the betting referred to can be indictable. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Court held the proof of the betting alone sufficient to make out the offence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-5\"><em>Attorney </em>General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUA\">Article 1477, (Hart. Dig.) which constitutes the law of this charge, makes no reference to the exhibiter or exhibition, either expressly or by any reasonable intendment. The second paragraph of the Article, (1478) too, allows this charge to be made in the most general terms, and to be established by very limited proof, of which the matter now insisted on forms no part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-6\">If it be essential to <em>\u201c </em>betting at rondo,\u201d that the game or table, when in operation, should have an exhibiter, (to make out the offence on the part of the better,) then is this essential ingredient embraced in the allegation and proof that he \u201c did bet at a gaming table called rondo,\u201d &amp;c. But this is not at all an essential ingredient in the offence here indicted for.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-7\">Wheeler, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMz\">There was no error in the qualification, appended by the Court, to the charge first asked by the defendant. The Court might well have refused the charge. The proof of the betting of money by the defendant, upon the game charged to have been played upon the table, was proof sufficient, as against the party charged with the betting, that the table was at the time kept or exhibited for gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The further charge asked was rightly refused, for the very sufficient reason that it neither was law, nor if law, was it warranted by the evidence. A single playing, or the playing of one unlawful game, was sufficient to constitute the table, for the time, a gaming table, within the meaning of the law, in as far as concerned the culpability of the parties concerned in the betting, whether with or without the consent of the owner or keeper of the table. But there was no proof to warrant the assumption, which the charge contained, that the playing was without the knowledge or consent of the keeper. The fair and reasonable presumption would be, that it was with his knowledge and consent, if that were material to make out the offence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>as against the parties playing and betting at the table. If the charge asked, therefore, had been good law, which it' was not, it was rightly refused, because not warranted by the evidence. There is no error in the charge and rulings of the Court, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
