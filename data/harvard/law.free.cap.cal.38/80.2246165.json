To which defendant objected, on the ground that it did not appear that any of the grantees named in the patent were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>entitled to purchase the premises in dispute under the provisions of the Act of Congress, under which the patent was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">The Court overruled the objection, admitted the patent, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">The plaintiff then deraigned title to himself from one of the patentees, and rested his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">It was admitted that the town of Vallejo had existed, as such, since the year 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">The defendant then offered in evidence a copy of the Proclamation of the President of the United States, issued in 1850, reserving from sale certain tracts or parcels of land therein mentioned, and offered to prove that the premises sued for were embraced within the limits of such reservation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">To which the plaintiff objected, on the grounds of irrelevancy and immateriality.

Brown, </em>for Respondent. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-8\">So far is the Act horn prohibiting the sale or entry of town sites, that it expressly authorizes it. Admitting, however, that this is. not so, and that town sites could only be entered by the town authorities, the defendant is precluded from taking advantage of the objection. The patent is absolutely conclusive upon him. <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>13 Cal. 478; <em>Doll </em>v. <em>Meador, </em>16 Cal. 324.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-9\">Rhodes, J., delivered the opinion of the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The plaintiff claims title to the premises under a patent issued by the United States to Frisbie and others, by virtue of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1863, granting the right of pre-emption, etc., to the purchasers of the Suscol rancho. (12 U. S. Stats. 808.) The Act provides that, after the public surveys have been extended over .the rancho, the <em>bona fide </em>purchasers from M. G. Vallejo, or his assigns, may enter the lands which they had purchased and reduced to possession, when the claim of Vallejo to the rancho was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States; that joint entries may be made by co-terminous purchasers, so as to enable them to adjust their boundaries; that the claims of such purchasers should be presented to the Register and Receiver within a specified time, together with the proof of such purchase, settlement and possession; that the case of each claimant should be \u201cadjudged by the Register and-Receiver,\u201d under instructions from the Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the General Land Office, and that their adjudication, together with the proof, should be transmitted to the Commissioner for final confirmation. The patent, although not expressly provided for in the Act, issues in pursuance of the entry, as the usual and, perhaps, necessary mode, in the absence of any other provision, for the transmission of the legal title to the purchaser. The patent grants certain tracts of land to the patentees \u201caccording to their respective interests therein, as purchasers from Vallejo or his assigns and it was stipulated that the premises in suit were a part of such tracts, and had been conveyed by Vallejo to Frisbie before the claim of Vallejo was rejected. The patent is the record of the Government that the land was subject to entry by the patentees under the Act of Congress, and was entered by them in conformity to law; and is conclusive evidence of the regularity, as well as the validity, of the action of the officers in passing upon and finally confirming their claim as purchasers from Vallejo or his assigns. <em>(Doll </em>v. <em>Meador, </em>16 Cal. 324; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>25 Cal. 251; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>27 Cal. 483; <em>Carder </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>28 Cal. 100; <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>29 Cal. 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">This rule is of course subject to the qualification expressed in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Winn </em>(11 Wheat. 380), that, if the patent be void upon its face, or were issued without authority, or were prohibited by law, or if the Government, in whose name the patent issued, had no title, it may be attacked collaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The defendant does not connect himself in any manner with the source of title; and, under the rule stated, he is not permitted to inquire whether Frisbie was a purchaser from Vallejo or his assigns; whether, at the time of the rejection of the claim of Vallejo, Frisbie filled the requirements of the Act, so as to be entitled to present his claim and have it passed upon by the Register and Receiver, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office; or, generally, whether those officers correctly confirmed his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">It is contended that the premises were not subject to private entry, because they were within the limits of the City of Vallejo. The third section of the Act provides that \u201cMuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cipal claims within the limits of the said \u2018Suscol Ranch\u2019 may be entered under the terms, limitations and conditions of the Town Site Act of the 23d of May, 1844;\u201d but it does not appear that the city has presented her claim according to the Act, or has entered the land; nor does the Act prohibit a purchaser of land, within the city, from presenting his claim for, and entering such land.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is also contended, that the premises in controversy are included within the tracts of land which were reserved from the operations of the Act. The proviso to the fifth section is as follows : \u201c <em>Provided, </em>that no entry shall be made of lands reserved and occupied for military, naval, or other public uses, or which may be designated for such purposes by the President * *.\u201dThis point may be disposed of without considering the position of the plaintiff, that the action of the officers of the Government, is a conclusive determination, that the premises in suit are not included among the lands mentioned in the proviso. The lands mentioned in the proviso are of two classes: First\u2014Lands, <em>reserved and occupied </em>for public uses\u2014that is, lands which had been reserved, and were then occupied for public purposes; and, Second\u2014 Lands which might thereafter be reserved for such purposes. Had the intention been to exclude from the operation of the Act all lands theretofore reserved for public use, it would be immaterial whether they were occupied or not, and no mention would have been made of that circumstance. If the intention was to retain the right to make further reservations, in addition to such as were then occupied for public purposes, the language is appropriate to express that idea, and, in our opinion, there is no room for doubt that the lands referred to by the language, \u201cor which may be designated for such purposes by the President,\u201d were lands that might <em>thereafter </em>be designated for public purposes by the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
