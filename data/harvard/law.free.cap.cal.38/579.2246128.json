This fence law of March 30, 1850, is, by necessary implication, directly in conflict with and repugnant to the above rule of the common law of England. So, also, is the Act of April 13, 1850, \u201cconcerning marks and brands,\u201d passed one day before the Act adopting the common law as a rule of action. (Statutes 1850, p. 214.) The same is true with reference to the Act \u201cto regulate rodeos,\u201d and the Act \u201cconcerning Judges of the Plains, \u201d passed at the second session of the Legislature, in 1851, and many, subsequent special Acts on the subject of lawful fences, including the Act of April 28,1859, \u201cconcerning lawful fences in the Counties of San Bernardino, Colusa, Shasta, Tehama and Placer,\u201d which is still in force. <em>(Waters </em>v. <em>Moss, Trustee, etc. </em>12 Cal. 535; <em>Comerford </em>v. <em>Dupuy, </em>17 Cal. 308; <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Sac. Val. R. R. Co. </em>18 Cal. 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The Act of 1861, now under consideration, neither in terms nor by implication repeals the above Act of April 18j 1859, nor does it prohibit the free, voluntary ranging at large 'of sheep over and upon unenclosed public or private land. The plain letter, manifest intent and object of the Act is to prohibit persons owning or having the charge of sheep, from driving them to, and collecting them upon, the unenclosed lands of another person. The acts prohibited are personal, and such as the party guilty thereof w'ould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>have been held responsible to the party injured thereby, in simple- damages to the extent of such injury, independent of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">If the Legislature had designed to interdict the ranging at large of sheep, or to compel the owners of sheep to securely confine them within their own close, such purpose would have been announced in the title of the Act, and expressed in the body thereof, in terms very different from those employed in the title and body of this Act. In such an Act, neither of the terms <em>herding, to herd </em>or <em>to be herded, </em>would likely have found a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The complaint in this case directly charges the defendants with the commission of the acts interdicted by the statute. The allegations being that the defendants \u201cwrongfully and wilfully permitted said sheep to be herded, and did herd the same upon the lands of which the plaintiff then was, ever since has been, and still is the owner,\u201d and in a subsequent paragraph it is alleged that \u201cdefendants herded and permitted said sheep to be herded in and upon the above described barley field.\u201d These allegations constitute the gist of the plaintiff\u2019s action, but his evidence entirely failed to establish, or tend to establish, these allegations, or that the defendants, or either of them, had been guilty of the acts charged against them, or of the acts prohibited by the statute <em>; </em>the evidence simply shows that defendants\u2019 sheep, without their agency, knowledge or consent, while ranging at large, at night strayed into plaintiff\u2019s barley field, which was not protected or enclosed by a lawful fence, or any sufficient fence to obstruct the free ingress or egress of sheep and hogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We are therefore of opinion that the Court erred in denying defendants\u2019 motion for nonsuit, and in its judgment upon the facts as found, also in its order denying their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Rhodes, J., expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
