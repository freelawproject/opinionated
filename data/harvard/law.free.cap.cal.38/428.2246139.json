Houghton, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">First\u2014;The judgment in <em>Quivey </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>was valid, although erroneous, and was properly admitted in evidence. The judgment of a Court of general jurisdiction, whether justified or not by the pleadings or evidence, is binding on the parti\u00e9s and in every other Court: <em>(Elliott </em>v. <em>Piersol, </em>1 Pet. 340; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Tolmie, </em>2 Pet. 169 ; <em>Ex parte Tobias Watkins, </em>3 Pet. 207; <em>V\u00f3orhees </em>v. <em>The Bank of the United States, </em>10 Pet. <em>478; Reynolds </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>14 Cal. 667; <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>34 Cal. 391.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-8\">Second\u2014The testimony of Yontz had no tendency to contradict his return upon the execution in <em>Quivey </em>v. <em>Murphy.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">The return shows that Moore, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in <em>Quivey </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>who is the same person who is plaintiff in this action, bid off the property at the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">It was competent to show by the Sheriff who made the sale that he executed a deed pursuant to the sale, and to whom he made it, such evidence having no tendency to contradict the fact stated in the return, that Moore bid off the property at the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">The return of a. Sheriff upon an execution, or a failure to make any return, cannot affect the rights of a purchaser at a sale under execution. <em>(Cloud </em>v. <em>El Dorado County, </em>12 Cal. 148 ; <em>Clarke </em>v <em>Lockwood, </em>21 Cal. 220.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-12\">Third\u2014The deed from Yontz to Quivey was not void, because it was made before the time for redemption had expired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-13\">The judgment in the case of <em>Quivey </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>was entered on the 13th day of June, 1851. The execution or order <em>of </em>sale issued upon that judgment was levied on the premises in question on the 25th day of the same months, and the statute allowing the judgment debtor or other redemptio'ner to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>redeem within six months after the sale, did not take effect until the first day of July next thereafter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">The Statute of 1851, giving the right of redemption, was prospective in its operation, and could not affect the rights of judgment creditors existing at the time the Act went into effect, so as to limit their rights to subject the property of the judgment creditor to the satisfaction of the judgment to the same extent that they could under the law regulating their respective rights at the time the judgment was entered; the judgment and the existing law making the contract by which the rights of the parties were determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">A judgment is a contract of the highest character known to the law. It is a contract of record. Under the judgment in question, Quivey had the right to have the property directed thereby to be sold to be subjected to the satisfaction of his judgment absolutely and unqualifiedly, and any attempt on the part of the Legislature to qualify or limit that right, would be such an infringement of his rights as would render such legislative action unconstitutional and void, as it would impair the obligation of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\">By giving to the judgment debtor a right of redemption, the property would not produce as much at a public sale as it would produce were the sale absolute; nor would the obligation imposed upon the judgment debtor to pay eighteen per cent, for the privilege of redeeming in six months, compensate the judgment creditor for the delay, when money was worth from eight to ten per cent, per month.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">This case is stronger than that of <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>The City of San Francisco, et als. </em>(4 Cal. 131, 142); the judgments in question in that case having been entered on the 6th and 18th days of September, 1851, after the Act allowing redemptions took effect, although the contracts upon which the judgments were based were made before the Act took effect. And in that case it was held by this Court that the Act did not apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-10\">It is true that Judge Heydenfeldt dissented in that case from a majority of the Court; but in the subsequent case of <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(5 Cal. 402), that Judge held the same doctrine that was established by <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>San Francisco.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The cases of <em>The Tuolumne Redemption Company </em>v. <em>Sedgwick </em>(15 Cal. 515), <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Fowler </em>(21 Cal. 392), and <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Gleim </em>(33 Cal. 668), are cited by counsel for appellant as overruling <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>San Francisco </em>and <em>Seale </em>v. <em>Mitchell.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">The question presented in the two cases last mentioned,\" and in this case, was not involved in either of the cases cited by appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">In <em>The Tuolumne Redemption Company </em>v. <em>Sedgwick, </em>the question was between redemptioners, and the point decided was, that where a right of redemption existed in favor of certain parties, the Legislature had power to regulate the mode of redemption, by changing the terms upon which it might be made as between redemptioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">In <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>it was held that a Sheriff\u2019s deed, made before the time for redemption expired, was void, and not voidable; but no question was made, or could have been made, in that case as to the right of redeeming from the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">In <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Gleim, </em>both judgments were rendered after July 1st, 1851, and the right to redeem was not questioned.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-10\">Sanderson, J., delivered the opinion of theCourt:</author>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Neither the papers nor the proceedings in the case of <em>Peter Quivey </em>v. <em>John M. Murphy </em>were prepared or conducted according to the most approved forms, it must be admitted; but we are of the opinion, nevertheless, that the judgment is at least valid as against a collateral attack. And this is so, whether the <em>record, </em>which is to be consulted for the purpose of determining that question (under the Code of 1850, which was then in force,) be held to consist only of the judgment, or to include, also, the other papers,which, under the statute now in force, make a part of the judgment roll. If the - Court had jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and the subject-matter, the judgment is good against a collateral attack, however erroneous it may be. How stands the case, then, if we take the judgment alone as\" constituting the record ? The Court had jurisdiction of the'defendant, for the judgment recites:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cNow comes the plaintiff by his attorney, and the defendant in proper person,\u201d etc. <em>(Hahn </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>34 Cal. 391.) It had jurisdiction of the subject-matter, for it was a money demand for the sum of $300, principal, and $216, interest, due on a judgment of a Justice of the Peace, in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant; and the judgment was for that sum. According to the decisions of this Court, made since this judgment was rendered, the judgment of the Justice was void, for excess of jurisdiction; and that of the District Court was, for that reason, erroneous, but not void, and therefore valid as against a collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">If the other papers be taken as a part of the record, there was an express waiver in writing of process, and a voluntary appearance on the part of the defendant. The cause of action upon which the Justice\u2019s judgment was rendered Avas referred to in the complaint, and stated to have been a promissory note, which was, also, with the judgment of the Justice of the Peace, exhibited to the Court as a part of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. In view of these facts, it is doubtful if the judgment of the District Court would be vulnerable, even as against a direct attack. But, as already suggested, it is immaterial whether these papers be considered as a part of the record under the Code of 1850 or not, and we therefore leave the question open.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The judgment being valid\u2014that is to say, not void\u2014and never having been reversed or set aside, the sale of Murphy\u2019s interest in the property was also valid, and the deed from the Sheriff to Quivey, of the 19th of August, 1851, vested the title in the latter, if the deed was not void by reason of its having been made in less than six months after the sale, and if the Court did not err in allowing the Sheriff to prove the execution and delivery of the deed by parol.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The only ground upon which it is plausibly contended that the Court erred in, permitting the defendant to prove the execution and delivery of the deed by the parol testimony of the Sheriff is that thereby the Sheriff was allowed to contradict his own return endorsed upon the execution, in which he certified that <em>\u201cJohn Moore, plaintiff's attorney, </em>was the purchaser at $180, and has paid the costs.\u201d If this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>return be read, as claimed by counsel for plaintiff, as showing that Moore purchased <em>in his own right, </em>and not in his capacity of attorney for Quivey, the latter\u2019s title, if his deed was valid, was unaffected by it; for the purchaser\u2019s title in no respect depends upon the return, but upon the judgment, sale and deed. <em>(Cloud </em>v. <em>El Dorado County, </em>12 Cal. 128; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Lockwood, 21 </em>Cal. 220.) But we think the return, upon its face, shows that the sale was made to Moore in his capacity as attorney for Quivey. Had the return merely said that \u201cJohn Moore, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, was the purchaser at $180,\u201d it might be, as contended by counsel for plaintiff, that the words \u201cplaintiff\u2019s attorney\u201d would be held to be <em>descriptio persones </em>merely. But the statement that he' paid, not his bid of $180, but the <em>costs, </em>is very significant. Had he purchased in his own name, and had the Sheriff so understood it, he would have been required to pay not the <em>costs, </em>but the <em>hid, </em>which he did not pay, but receipted for on the back of the execution. It would be a very strange proceeding for the purchaser, who is not the judgment creditor, to receipt on the back of the execution for the amount of his bid, instead of paying it to the Sheriff. By such a proceeding, the judgment creditor would hardly come into the proceeds of the sale. But where the property is bid off by the plaintiff in the execution, or by his attorney for him, the universal practice is to receipt for the amount of the bid, less the costs, upon the back of the execution, and pay the Sheriff his costs only. To pay money to the Sheriff merely to have it returned would be an idle ceremony. This return on the execution must be read by the light of this practice, and when so read, we think its meaning is not doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The deed to Quivey from the Sheriff, however, was void, because it was made before the expiration of six months after the sale, for which reason the Sheriff had no power to make it. <em>(Gross </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>21 Cal. 392; <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Gleim, </em>33 Cal. 668.) The force of these cases, however, the plaintiff seeks to <em>overcome, </em>by attacking the ^Redemption Law of 1851 as unconstitutional, so far as this and other like titles are concerned. The grounds upon which this attack is made are, that the judgment in <em>Quivey </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>was rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>before and was an existing contract at the time the Redemption Law of 1851 took effect, and that Quivey was entitled to have it enforced according to the Practice Act of 1850, by which sales were absolute; and that his right could not be taken from him without impairing the obligation of his judgment. The levy of the execution was made before, but the sale was made after the Redemption Law of 1851 took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We do not consider it necessary to discuss this constitutional question. We are saved that labor by the very able dissenting opinion of Justice Heydenfeldt, delivered in the case of <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>The City of San Francisco </em>(4 Cal. 154.) We agree with him that the Legislature had power to provide that all judicial sales of real estate thereafter to be made, whether upon judgments then existing or upon judgments thereafter to be obtained upon contracts then existing, should be made subject to redemption, without violating either the Federal or State Constitution. Besides, we regard the case of <em>Tuolumne Redemption Company </em>(15 Cal. 515) as overruling the case of <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>The City of San Francisco </em>(4 Cal. 127.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
