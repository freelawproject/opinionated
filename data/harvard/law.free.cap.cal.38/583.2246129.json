We understand that it is the <em>privilege </em>of the plaintiff to claim the delivery of the property at any time before the filing of the answer, but that it is not compulsory upon him to do so. The mere circumstance that he is required to claim the immediate delivery <em>before </em>the answer is filed, or not at all, seems conclusive that, whether he avails himself of that remedy or not, does not affect the question of ultimate relief. But if the question, notwithstanding the foregoing consideration, be doubtful, it is certainly put to rest by the further circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>stance that the defendant may retain the property, if he elects to do so; and, also, by the character of the verdict. In declaring what the verdict shall be, the statute, in terms, provides for a case where the plaintiff has not claimed a <em>delivery before </em>the filing of the answer. (Pr. Act, Sec. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Second\u2014The point that in an action against the Sheriff for property tortiously taken by him under an attachment or execution against some other person, the plaintiff must allego and prove a demand for its delivery prior to the commencement of the action, is not well taken. It was so declared in <em>Ledley </em>v. <em>Hays </em>(1 Cal. 160), and all the cases since then to the contrary, if any, have been overruled in <em>Boulware </em>v. <em>Craddock </em>(30 Cal. 190.) See, also, <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Sturm </em>(23 Cal. 359), which is a case on all fours with this. If a Sheriff takes property which does not belong to the defendant in the execution, he takes it tortiously, although it be in the possession of the defendant in the execution at the time he takes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Hr. Justice Sprague expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
