There are certain other facts in the case, among which are, that McKee executed a subsequent mortgage to the defendant; that he leased the premises to the plaintiffs; that, at the time of the execution of the deed of McKee to the defendant, the defendant\u2019s mortgage was released and plaintiff\u2019s lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>was cancelled, and the defendant paid a portion of plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and promised to pay the balance, which was to remain a lien upon the premises, etc.; hut they have no material bearing upon the only point we deem it necessary to consider. Judgment was rendered for the plaintffs in the usual form, ordering the premises to be sold for the satisfaction of the amount due the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The point upon which the appeal is taken is, that the Court erred in ordering all the title of the defendant in the premises to be sold, without reserving the title that he acquired from tho United States. There can be no question that whatever title passed to the defendant by means of McKee\u2019s deed, is subject to sale in satisfaction of the mortgage debt. The defendant does not controvert this position. That title is the only title that appears to be involved in the action. A declaratory statement, or a Register\u2019s certificate of the filing of such declaratory statement, is not title. It is merely an application\u2014an offer to purchase, after the requisite proof of residence, qualifications, etc., shall be made. When this is done, and payment is made, and the certificate of purchase is issued, then the purchaser acquires what is recognized by the laws of this State as title derived from the United States. The defendant states in his answer that he made the requisite proof of his pre-emption claim, paid the purchase money and received a certificate of purchase; but it is not so found by the Court, nor does the record contain any evidence of his proceedings in that behalf, beyond the issuing of the certificate of the filing of the declaratory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
