The answer denies all the allegations of the complaint, and alleges that the work, labor and materials were furnished under a written contract, which is annexed to the answer, and in part performance thereof. The trial was by the Court without a jury. Final judgment passed for the defendant. \u2018 The plaintiff moved for a new trial upon a statement of the evidence and rulings of the Court. The new trial was moved upon two grounds: First\u2014 Errors of law; and Second\u2014Insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The only ruling of the Court to which exception was taken by the plaintiff related to the admissibility of certain testimony which was offered by him, as he argued, in rebuttal of the defense made by the defendant. The Court excluded the testimony. The question arose in the following manner: Instead of proving the amount and value of his work and labor, without any reference to the contract, and resting, the plaintiff went into the defendant\u2019s case also, and proved that the Avork was done, as alleged by the defendant, in part performance of the written contract which was annexed to the answer, and also the facts upon which he relied as constituting a legal excuse for the non-performance of the entire work called for by the contract, and therefore entitling him to count upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>The defendant then introduced his testimony, showing the facts upon which he relied to establish the contrary, and rested. The plaintiff then proposed to prove by two other witnesses the same facts which he had already proved, for the purpose of excusing himself from the performance of the entire con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tract. To this the defendant objected, and the Court sustained the objection. This was not error. Having elected to anticipate the defendant\u2019s case at the opening, and to rebut it in advance, the plaintiff should have introduced all his evidence upon that head <em>then. </em>Having adopted that course, further evidence of the same character could not be considered as rebutting, but merely as cumulative, and in its discretion the Court might well decline to receive it at the time it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
