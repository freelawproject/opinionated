His remedy is by bill in equity, and for an account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">Wheeler, being the owner of certain patents, desired to sell the same, or to give the others the use thereof. Farmer agreed to enter into a business transaction for that purpose, and agreed to go to Australia on the mission of vending the said patents. He was authorized by the power of attorney to use the name of Wheeler. The patents were sold in Wheeler\u2019s name, and the parties were to share alike in the profits ; and Farmer was to collect all the moneys, and account for and pay over to Wheeler one half of the money received on account of the sale and use of the patent right. Farmer was also to render quarter-yearly accounts of his transactions and receipts, under the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">Farmer was not an agent, for he was paid as a partner, and he was to contract independently of Wheeler.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-10\">Again, Wheeler reserved the right to revoke the authority, and put an end to the business relations. The plaintiff elects to sue Farmer for one half of the profits of the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-11\">Here we find the parties forming a familiar kind of partnership, where one party furnishes the stock in trade, and authorizes another to sell the same, and paying him, <em>not a salary, </em>but one half of the <em>profits </em>of the enterprise, while the other party furnishes labor and bears other burdens of the enterprise upon his part. This is a familiar principle in the law of partnerships. (Parsons on Part. pp. 54, 55 and 56, and cases thereunder cited; <em>Trench </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>6 Madd. 145.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-12\">We would refer also to the case of <em>Stocker </em>v. <em>Brocklebank </em>(3 Mac. and G-. 250, 5 Eng. L. and Eq. 67), which is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>unlike this case, except as to the payment of a \u201c <em>salary, \u201d </em>and had it not been for this stipulation, the Court would have been compelled to find that a partnership existed. It frequently happens that parties enter into a partnership without knowing it. (Parsons on Part. p. 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">There may be a partnership both in the property and in the profits\u2014even though it be bought with the funds of one; and it is well settled that there may be a partnership in the profits, when there is none in the property. (Parsons on Part. 47 and 48; Story on Part. 88; Parsons on Contracts, 141; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>5 Fount. <em>74; Mumford </em>v. <em>Nichol, </em>20 John. 611.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">In the case at bar, Wheeler owned the patents; never-parted with the property, but agreed that Farmer should procure the patents in his (Wheeler\u2019s) name, and then to <em>malee; use </em>and vend the same; and the parties were to divide the profits. Farmer was not a mere paid agent, for he was to act <em>independently </em>of Wheeler, making quarter - yearly returns and accounts of his transactions. The idea of a <em>salary </em>does not enter into the transaction, but Farmer was to receive one half of the profits, and Wheeler the other-half.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">It frequently happens that parties are involved in a business transaction with others, and receive their pay in so much of the <em>gross profits. </em>The text books seem to settle upon this distinction, viz: that where a party receives <em>a pro rata </em>of the profits, as a <em>salary, </em>he is not a partner; but when he receives it as <em>profits, </em>he is a partner, both as to third parties and <em>inter se.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">We submit that the agreement in the case at bar fixes the relation of the parties in this respect. (See Parsons on Part. p. 88, note <em>q; </em>Story, p. 88; <em>Cheap, et al. </em>v. <em>Cramond, </em>4 B. Aid. 663; <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>1 Hill, 527; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>18 Wen. 175; Parsons on Contracts, 134-5.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">Whether a man is a partner or not depends upon the nature of his interest in the profits. The profits of a trade are included within the gross proceeds, and if a man is interested as owner, in the latter of these funds, he must be so also in the former; for there is nothing in the mere deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>tion in the expenses of the business from its proceeds which affects, in any way, the kind of interest of those concerned therein. Hence the question still must be, not whether a man share in gross or in net receipts, but what is the nature of his interest in either of these funds ? If his interest is that of owner, then he is a partner\u2014otherwise not. (Note to Parsons on Part. p. 91; Parsons on Contracts, 132, note <em>q; Bradlung </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>21 Me. 117; <em>Reid, </em>v. <em>Hollinshead, </em>4 B. and C. 867; <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Pittard, </em>3 M. and N. 357; <em>Musier </em>v. <em>Trumpour, </em>5 Wen. 274.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">Where one person furnishes funds for carrying on a trade, and another gives his personal services, for which he is to receive a <em>portion </em>of the profits, they are partners. <em>(Dob </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>16 Johns. 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">So, also, the question of profits has been settled in numerous cases. When a party receives a certain share of the profits of an adventure with another, <em>as profits, </em>whether it is the result of capital or labor, he is a partner in the enterprise. <em>(Ogden </em>v. <em>Astor, </em>4 Sandf. 311; <em>Pattison </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>1 Seld. 186; 6 Barb. 537; <em>Heimstreet </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>5 Den. 68; <em>Brockway </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>16 Barb. 309.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">It has been held by text writers, as also by eminent judges, that a person is liable, as partner, when he has such an interest in profits as will give him a right to demand an accounting. (3 Kent. Comm. p. 25, note <em>b; </em>Cary on Part. 11, note <em>i; </em>Collyer on Part. Sec. 44\u2014note; <em>Heimstreet </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>5 Denio, 68; <em>Penny </em>v. <em>Gabbott, </em>6 Met. 92; <em>Garr </em>v. <em>Redman, </em>6 Cal. 576.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">In the case at bar there is no pretense that any balance has been struck, or that there has been an accounting, so an action at law cannot be maintained. The attachment must, therefore, be dissolved. <em>(Murray </em>v. <em>Bogert, </em>14 Johns. 118; <em>Pattison </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>6 Barb. 537; also, <em>Attwater </em>v. <em>Fowler, 1 </em>Hall, 180.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-10\">Defendant respectfully submits, that the pleadings show a partnership, and that the attachment was improperly issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>Ferdinand J. McCann </em>and <em>Albert Heath, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">\u201cThe two leading principles of a partnership,\u201d says Kent (3d Com. 24), \u201c are a common interest in the stock of the company and a personal responsibility for the partnership engagements.\u201d In 12 Conn. 69, and in 18 Wend. 175, we find it laid down that a specific interest in the profits \u201cas profits\u201d is the test. Lord Eldon is the author of this test. (17 Vesey, 404.) Judge Story says that \u201cas profits\u201d mean \u201cnet profits,\u201d (Story on Part. 51.) In <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Felt, </em>the Court said : \u201cI take it this distinction runs through all the cases\u2014if a person derives a certain emolument from the trade, then he is not a partner; if his emolument depends upon the profit and loss, then he is considered as a partner. \u201d (1 McCord Ch. 219.) Other authors say that parties are partners when they are \u201cmutual agents\u201d or \u201cprincipal traders,\u201d or when \u201ceach one is entitled to an account.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-8\">Each and all of these tests have been criticised, but not destroyed. (See Perkins\u2019 note to Collyer on Part. 3d ed. p. 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-9\">Later than these criticisms, Chief Justice Tindal (in 3 Man. G. <em>&amp; </em>Scott\u2019s R. 32, 39) considers that there must be a participation in the <em>profit and loss. </em>No authority has rejected these tests, because no one ventured to put out the lights we had to guide us through those cases of obscurity, without erecting others of equal power and brilliancy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-10\">From the views taken by the counsel for appellant of the criticisms of Judge Parsons, found in his text and notes from page 88 to 92, in the work before cited, they make him an exception. They seem to consider that this learned author has condemned those tests. And it is certain that he has furnished no substitute for them. But it is not necessary to adopt this view, for in these pages the author speaks of the partnership relation only <em>as to third persons, </em>and argues that the absence or presence of these tests should neither shield partners from, nor inflict upon them, responsibility. And again, the uselessness of destroying these tests is so obvious, that we cannot acquiesce in this view. Without them, the difficulty of determining in doubtful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cases is increased, if, indeed, the difficult problem would not often arise to determine the character of a partnership without this relation being expressed, and without the means from which this relation could be implied. Such propositions are not impossible, though they may be impossible of solution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">We may then try this instrument by any or by all of these tests and we must find the elements of a partnership wanting in the contract. The plaintiff does not stipulate for any interest in the stock of Farmer\u2019s Australian business, but he does stipulate that he is not to be responsible for any engagement in carrying it on, for, \u201cit is mutually covenanted and agreed that the said party of the second part (Farmer) shall make all contracts in carrying out this agreement on his own responsibility, and that said party of the first part shall in no manner be bound therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-7\">We find that Wheeler takes no interest \u201cin the profits\u201d or \u201cnet profits,\u201d for Farmer \u201cshall account for and pay over to the said party of the first part, one half of the <em>money received </em>on account of the use and sale of said patent right.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-8\">Here, too, we see that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cemolument is certain, and does not depend upon \u201c profit and loss. \u201d The plaintiff instead of being \u201ca principal trader \u201d in this event, expressly declares that he will have nothing to do with the business. We can find no pretense to give him \u201ca specific lien \u201d for this money over and above the other creditors of Farmer, other than that given by the attachment law. And he is entitled to no other \u201c accounting\u201d from Farmer, except the accounting which is the fruit of his judgment in a suit at law. If it can be said that under the English system the plaintiff could discover how much a defendant owed him on a contract, by a suit in chancery, and therefore this test is indefinite, it is not liable to this criticism under our system, where bills of discovery are taken away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-9\">The defendant, on the other hand, had no interest in the one half of the receipts coming to plaintiff; he could not pay his creditors with it, nor increase his business thereby. To do so was simply a violation of - the contract, for \u201cthe said party of the second part shall render to the said party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of tlie first part quarter-yearly accounts of Ms transactions and receipts under this agreement, and shall make, at the same time, remittances to the said party of the first part of all moneys which shall be due and coming to him under the provisions of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-6\">Sprague, J., delivered the opinion of the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">This appeal is from an order denying appellant\u2019s motion to discharge an attachment. Suit was commenced by plaintiff, and attachment issued on the 14th of May, 1868. Summons was personally served on the defendant on the 14th of May, 1868, and the attachment was duly levied on certain real estate and personal property on the 15th of May, 1868. On the same day (15th of May), defendant served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice, that, on the 20th of May, or as soon thereafter as counsel could be heard, he would apply to the Judge of the Court in which the action was pending, and move to have the writ of attachment discharged, upon the grounds : First\u2014That the same was improperly issued before the issuance of the summons in the cause, and that no undertaking in attachment had been filed; Second\u2014That no affidavit in attachment had been made or filed as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In pursuance of the notice, the motion was heard before the Judge, and on the 21st of May was denied; from which order defendant appeals, and in his statement on appeal specifies, as particular errors and grounds upon which he intends to rely on the appeal, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">\u201cFirst\u2014That the Court or Judge erred in refusing to discharge said writ of attachment, upon the grounds that the complaint shows that a partnership exists between the parties plaintiff and defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">\u201cSecond\u2014The Judge erred in holding that an attachment could issue in this case, and denying defendant\u2019s motion to discharge the same, on the ground that this was not a case in which an attachment could issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Third\u2014In refusing to discharge the said writ upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ground that no affidavit was made in said action as required by law, and that said affidavit is insufficient. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The statement on appeal refers to and makes a part thereof, the complaint, the notice of the time and place of hearing said motion to discharge, the .writ of attachment, the affidavit for attachment and the order of the Judge denying such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The motion to discharge the attachment was made before the time for answer had expired, under the one hundred and thirty-eighth section of the Practice Act. The notice specifies the grounds of the motion, but does not state, the documents or papers which the moving party proposes to use, or upon which the motion is predicated; but from the statement upon appeal and specification of errors upon which appellant states he will rely on appeal, the papers used on such motion were evidently the papers referred to and made part of such statement, to wit: The complaint, affidavit for and writ of attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The undertaking on attachment is not referred to or made part of the statement on appeal, and the errors assigned, upon which appellant states he will rely on appeal, have no reference to the undertaking on attachment; hence, we cannot regard it as forming a legitimate portion of the record on appeal, or notice the point made thereon in the argument of counsel, as it is apparent no such point was made or argued on the hearing of the motion in Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">The first and second specifications of error involve but the simple question, whether the power of attorney and written agreement between plaintiff and defendant, set out in the complaint, constitute the plaintiff and defendant partners in the business to which the agreement relates as between themselves. If, by this agreement, they were partners <em>inter se, </em>then this action cannot be maintained; the attachment was improperly issued and should have been discharged on defendant\u2019s motion. The complaint sets out <em>in haec verba </em>the contract upon which the defendant\u2019s alleged indebtedness accrued, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\"><em>\u201cKnow all men by these presents, </em>That I, Zenas Wheeler, of the City of San Francisco, and the State of California, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>have made, constituted and appointed, and by these presents do make, constitute and appoint T. Seelye Farmer my true and lawful attorney for me, and in my name, to obtain and procure anywhere in the Kingdom of Great Britain, letters patent, to be issued in my name, for the following machines or devices, for which letters patent have been duly granted to me by the Government of the United States of America, viz:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cFirst\u2014An improved amalgamator, letters patent for which were granted to me, as aforesaid, on the 29th day of \u00a1November, 1864.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201cSecond\u2014An improved machine for collecting and separating amalgam and mercury from ore pulp, for which letters patent, as aforesaid, were issued to me on the 10th day of May, 1864.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201c Third\u2014A stamping mill for quartz, for which letters patent were granted to me, together with G.

It is from this contract alone, as the case is presented, that we are to determine whether the relation of partners <em>inter se </em>existed between the parties thereto, in respect to the particular enterprise contemplated or provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Actual intention is necessary to constitute a partnership <em>inter se. </em>There must be a joint undertaking to share in the profit and loss.

(1 Seld. 191, <em>supra; </em>Story on Part. Sec. 34, and cases cited in note 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">From the terms of the entire contract it is very evident that the parties thereto did not intend to create a parnership, either as between themselves or as between themselves and third persons, and as between the parties, no partnership was thereby created. The essential elements of a partnership <em>inter se </em>are wanting. There is no community of interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>capital, stock, profit or loss. The defendant is constituted the attorney in fact, or agent of plaintiff, to procure, in the name and to the use of plaintiff, from the proper authorities of the Kingdom of Great Britain, letters patent for certain machines and devices, for which letters patent had been previously granted to plaintiff by the Government of the United States; and, upon obtaining such letters patent from the proper authorities of the Kingdom of Great Britain, defendant was authorized to make, vend and use said patents for the best prices he could procure therefor; and it was further agreed by and between the parties, that the defendant should collect and receive all moneys which should become due and owing on the sale and use of said patents, by reason of his transactions under the agreement, and account for and pay over to the plaintiff one half of the moneys received by him on account of the sale and use of said patent right quarter - yearly. That the defendant should make all contracts in carrying out the agreement on his own credit and responsibility, and that the plaintiff should, in no manner be bound therefor. That the defendant should use all diligence in procuring letters patent, as authorized, and in making sales of the patent rights; and, upon his failure or neglect to use such diligence, or upon his failure to carry out and perform, on his part, any of the terms and stipulations of the agreement, the plaintiff reserved the right to revoke the power of attorney, and cancel the agreement. In brief, the plaintiff, being a patentee of certain machines and devices under the Government of the United States, and the owner and holder of the franchise thus secured, entered into an arrangement with the defendant, by which the defendant, in consideration of one half the proceeds of the sales of such machines and franchises within the dominions of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the authority thereto by the plaintiff conferred, undertook to procure from the proper authorities of the Kingdom of Great Britain, in the name of the plaintiff, letters patent for the same inventions and devices of plaintiff, and to make, vend and use such devices, and sell to others the right to make, vend and use the same anywhere within the Kingdom of Great Britain, at his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>individual expense, and on his individual account and responsibility, and to account to plaintiff, and pay over to him, quarterly, one half of all his gross receipts for the use and sales of such patented devices, and sales of rights to others to manufacture or use the same. In the conduct and management of this business within the Kingdom of Great Britain, plaintiff had no voice or right of control, and, as between the parties, incurred no liability for expenses of such business, or losses sustained in its conduct. He simply reserved the right to revoke the power conferred upon defendant, and cancel the agreement with him, on his neglect or failure to comply with its terms. And on defendant\u2019s failure or refusal to pay to plaintiff money which, by the terms of this agreement, he had obligated himself to pay, the plaintiff clearly has his action to recover; and whatever amount of money defendant may have received on sales of machines, or patent rights therefor, during any three months, at the end of such three months one half of such amount, by the terms of the contract, was due the plaintiff as a specific, definite debt, to secure which an attachment might issue. <em>(Hathaway </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>33 Cal. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The only remaining specification of error is based upon the alleged insufficiency of the affidavit for attachment. The objection that the affidavit was made before the commencement of the suit, is manifestly untenable. Although, under our code, a writ of attachment cannot properly issue until after the commencement of the suit, to which it is only auxiliary, still there seems to be no valid objection to a complete preparation of all the papers requisite to the writ of attachment before or at the same time the complaint is prepared, so that the affidavit and undertaking in attachment be not filed in advance of the original complaint, and the writ not issued in advance of the summons and certified copy of the complaint, to which it is incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The objection that the affidavit does not state the probative facts necessary to establish the ultimate facts required by statute to be shown as the basis of the writ, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Under our statute, it is the duty of the Clerk of the Court in which the suit is commenced to issue the writ upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>filing by the plaintiff of an affidavit stating the ultimate facts in the language of the statute, together with an undertaking, in amount and form as defined by statute. Upon such compliance with the statute, the plaintiff demands, as a right, the issuance of the writ, and, in issuing the writ, the Clerk has no discretionary power. He but performs a ministerial duty in obedience to a plain statutory mandate. The authorities cited from Hew York Reports, to which our attention is called by appellant, are all applicable to cases arising under the revised statutes and codes of procedure of that State, each of which, in essential particulars, is different from our statute. There the issuance of the writ, both under the revised statutes and code, is only upon the order of a judicial officer to whom application for the writ is made, who, in a judicial capacity, acts upon the application, and either grants or denies the writ. And under the revised statutes, such writ, when granted, is the original process in a special proceeding. The state of facts authorizing the writ, under both the revised statutes and code, must be established to the satisfaction of the judicial officer to whom the application is made. <em>(Foreman </em>v. <em>Waller, </em>13 How.
