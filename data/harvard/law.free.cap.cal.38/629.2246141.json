It is evident the plaintiff has no title to the lot, except subject to the trust. His claim of title is founded on a judgment, execution sale, and Sheriff\u2019s deed, long subsequent to the creation of the trust, and the title thus acquired cannot impair or interfere with the power of the Trustees over the Trust Fund, of which this lot is a portion. By Section 12 of the Act creating the trust, the Commissioners are authorized, 1 c at such time and place as in their discretion the interest of the city may require, to expose at public sale, or to lease the property to be conveyed, as provided in this section, and they shall apply the proceeds of such sale or lease to the liquidation of the floating debt of said city.\u2019\u2019 (Statutes 1851, page 390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The Commissioners are the exclusive judges of the necessity for such sale or lease until the trust is finally closed, and their action in this respect cannot be impugned, nor their discretion controlled by the city or its grantee, except on the ground of fraud or a gross abuse of discretion by the Trustees. The assets in\" the hands of the Trustees for the payment of the trust debt consist largely of stocks, bonds and other securities of fluctuating value, and until the time shall arrive for closing the trust, it will be impossible to ascertain whether or not they are sufficient to extinguish the trust debt. In the meantime the Commissioners have the power, and it is their duty, to provide against contingencies by raising a fund by the sale of property, if necessary, which shall be certainly and reasonably sufficient to pay the debt and accruing expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The other points made by the appellant are not tenable, and require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
