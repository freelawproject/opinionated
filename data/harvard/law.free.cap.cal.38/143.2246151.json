It is immaterial, however, for the purposes of the action, whether it is a promissory note or a contract of a different character.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The only question of importance in the case\u2014and this does not appear to us to present any serious difficulty\u2014 arises upon the construction of the clause of the instrument which recites the considerations of the defendant\u2019s promise. The clause reads as follows: \u201cFor services rendered in assisting in the sale of said mine, by report or otherwise; \u201d and the question is whether the reference is to past or future services. If the parties contemplated future services to be rendered by the plaintiff, the words were certainly very inapt to express that idea. Had they used the words \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>services to be rendered, \u201d the meaning would have been clear; but the words \u201cservices rendered,\u201d without any qualifying words, necessarily import that the services had been performed. There is no agreement on the part of the plaintiff to perform services in respect to the sale of the mine; and had such been the intention of the parties, it is unaccountable that, while the plaintiff was exacting an agreement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>writing for the payment of his compensation, the defendant should not have taken from the plaintiff an agreement for the performance of the services on his part, specifying both the nature and extent of the services. If future services were intended, the plaintiff would be entitled, as the contract now stands, to the full amount of the stipulated compensation, upon the performance of the slightest service in assisting to effect a sale of the mine, if sold within a year. We agree with the District Judge, in holding that the consideration mentioned in the contract consisted of past services.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
