The plaintiff failed to file a replication, or answer, to any of the matters set up in the defendant\u2019s answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-7\">The other facts in the case are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-8\">There was a verdict and judgment for plaintiff, and the Court refusing a new trial, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-9\"><em>Byers </em>&amp; <em>Elliott, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-10\"><em>Evan S.

This precise point, in a case strictly analogous) was decided in <em>Herold </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(34 Cal. 122), and we see no reason to disturb the ruling in that case. There was, therefore, no error in refusing to enter a default against the plaintiff for want of an answer; and no .injury resulted to the defendant from afterward permitting the plaintiff to reply to the answer, inasmuch as the replication consisted only of denials, which the law would have implied, if there had been no replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Nor can we disturb the judgment on the ground that the Court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The evidence alleged to have been newly discovered was not only cumulative in its character, but there was no showing of sufficient or of any diligence to discover it before, or to produce it at the trial. The paper marked \u201cExhibit A,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>which was admitted, in evidence, was not signed by the defendant, and was in no legal sense a promissory note; but was properly admitted as evidence of an account stated, and needed no stamp under the United States Internal Revenue Law. Nor was there any error in admitting, secondary evidence of the contents of the bill of sale from Richard Jones to the defendant. The plaintiff was not entitled to its custody, and as it was a paper made to the defendant, it was properly presumed to he in his possession. When notified to produce it, he disclaimed all knowledge of it. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled to prove its contents by secondary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On the whole, we find no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
