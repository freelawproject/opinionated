In describing the offense the word \u201cfemale\u201d is as properly used as \u201c <em>woman,\" </em>since, in their ordinary use and in the definition of the offense, they mean the same thing, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 16301)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-10\">A charge that the defendant unlawfully assaulted L.

He moved for a new trial, but there is no statement of facts. He also moved in arrest of judgment, upon grounds set forth in the opinion. The language of the indictment was in the usual form, describing dates, &amp;c., and proceeded: \u201cIn and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>one Leonora Bussell, a female, in the peace of God and the state then and there being, did unlawfully make an assault, and her the said Leonora Bussell then and there did beat, wound, and ill-treat, with intent her the said Leonora Bussell violently and against her will, and without her consent, then and there feloniously to ravish and carnally know,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-5\"><em>Stewart Sayers, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARW\">\u2014I.

The special errors assigned are: 1st. That the court erred in overruling the motion in arrest of the judgment. 2d. That the indictment did not charge that the attempt was made upon a woman. And 3d. That the indictment charges no felonious intent. All the errors assigned are predicated upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the idea of the insufficiency of the indictment; which, if true, would be equally available in a motion to quash or in arrest of judgment. The latter course was adopted, and we are now simply called upon to test the sufficiency of the indictment by the law. The indictment charges, in due form, we think, that the appellant made an \u201c assault upon a female, with intent feloniously to ravish and carnally know her, against her will and consent.\u201d These facts, thus stated, make up the very definition of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">This is a statement of the facts, which is the essence of all pleading, and from which all legal deductions are made. But it is objected to the indictment that the word female is used in the indictment, while the statute uses the word woman in denouncing attempts to commit the offense of rape. The Criminal Code, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1630, p. 398,) directs that all words are to be construed in the sense in which they are understood in common language, taking into consideration the context and subject-matter relative to which they are employed. In common parlance there can be no misunderstanding of the term female, for it is rarely, if ever, used, except by very prudish persons, in reference to the sex of any other portion of the animal creation than the human species. The English language is sufficiently copious and fertile to furnish distinctive designations of the sexes of the rest of animated nature without recourse to this generic distinction. In common language they are usually characterized as a mare, a cow, a ewe, a sow, &amp;c., and no one is apt to infer, when the term female is used, that anything else is referred to than a woman. Besides, in article 2184 of the Criminal Code, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., p. 446,) the word .female is the term used in the definition of rape. Hence, it is obvious in legal contemplation, under our criminal system, that the terms woman and female are convertible. So, as well in common language as in law, there could be no misunderstanding of the term \u201cfemale\u201d in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The last assignment of error is equally untenable. The charge is, that the accused did unlawfully assault the female with intent feloniously to ravish her. The mere unlawful assault would not have been a felony; but coupled with the intent charged it thereby became felonious. We see no valid reason for interfering with the judgment and sentence of the court below. It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
