F. Petty v. Fleishel &amp; Smith.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aj\">A note which omits the word dollars, but inserts the numbers, means dollars. Where a note is payable in currency, and the defendant makes default, it is proper to take judgment for the face of the note in dollars, without a writ of inquiry to find the value of the currency.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">Error from Smith. The case was tried before Hon. Reuben A. Reeves, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">The contract is sufficiently set out in the opinion of the court. The defendant having made default, judgment was rendered against the defendant for $461 56. The defendant prosecuted error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-9\"><em>Tignal W.

By the 1st day of April I promise to pay Fleishel &amp; Smith, or bearer, four hundred and nine T6^-, in currency, for value received. L. F.
