The charge that the playing was at \u201c a public house,\u201d is too indefinite.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Appeal from Walker.

A demurrer to the indictment was sustained, because of the vagueness and generality in describing the house where it was alleged the playing took place.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-6\"><em>JE.

Martin Barns, 25 Tex., 654, this case must be affirmed. The charge in the indictment is, that the defendant played cards at a \u201c public house.\u201d The charge is too vague and indefinite, and does not sufficiently put the defendant upon notice to enable him to prepare for his defense. This is a principle of administrative justice which should not be departed from. A warning should always be given before the blow is stricken. It may be readily imagined that a gentleman may have played cards at a number of private places which come not within the denunciation of the statute; and yet, when simply indicted for playing cards at a \u201cpublic place,\u201d he could not know from the charge which particular place he had to defend himself against, by showing that it was not a \u201c public place.\u201d He might fortify himself against one by his proofs, and still the state might array its testimony to show the offense was committed at another.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
