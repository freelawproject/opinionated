But an order to pay into the county treasury was error. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 5156.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b293-6\">As the statute provides that the suit may be brought before any court of competent jurisdiction, and the general jurisdiction of the district court extends to all cases of escheats and forfeiture, it had jurisdiction of an amount under $100. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Const., Art. IV, p. 57, sec. 10, Note 182.) '</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b293-7\">If a billiard table be kept for \"occupation,\u201d the occupation was subject to the license tax imposed by the statute; because those \u201c pursuing any occupation, trade, or profession \u201d are by the constitution subject to a license tax.

VII, sec. 27.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b293-8\">Trade or profession imports a profitable pursuit, and, if the billiard table was kept for amusement and not for profit, it was not subject to taxation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b293-9\">The use for which \u00e1 billiard table was kept ought to have been left to the jury.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b293-10\">Appeal from Medina. The case was tried before Hon. E. F. Buckner, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-12\">Benseman presented his petition to the district court, alleging that Tarde was keeping a billiard table, and had refused to pay the tax of fifty dollars, the license required by law. Wherefore he sues him for $100. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction because of the amount; he also demurred, and pleaded the general issue, and that the billiard table was kept for another person, and in a private room, and not for profit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-15\">The motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was overruled. The plaintiff also demurred to the special pleading of the defendant, \u201c for that he admits he keeps a billiard table, and only denies that he keeps the same for profit to himself, whereas the law gives the penalty for the mere keeping of the billiard table, without reference to its being kept for profit.\u201d This demurrer was sustained and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>special plea stricken out. The case was submitted to the jury without any proof whatever, and the court gave judgment for $100; $50 \u201cto be paid to the county treasury.\u201d [See the briefs for further facts.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-6\"><em>Geo. W. Paschal, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajv\">I. The questions are\u2014 1. As to jurisdiction; 2. As to overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer; 3. As to sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer; 4. As to rendering judgment without proofs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">The act of 1858 (O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 1938) requires \u201ca license tax of $50 of each and every person or firm keeping a billiard table, for each and every table so kept.\u201d And the next section imposes a penalty of double the license tax, recoverable before any justice of the peace or court of competent jurisdiction, \u201c one-half to be paid to the assessor and collector, which shall be accounted for by him and paid into the state treasury, as other license tax is required t\u00f3 be paid, and the other half to be paid to the informer.\u201d Probably the distriot court had jurisdiction concurrent with the justice of the peace. But we think it equally clear that the suit should have been brought in the name of the state, as well for the use of the state as the informer. Such is the universal rule as to <em>qui tam </em>actions. They are not rights which belong to the informer, but to the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">II. The sustaining the demurrer to \u00a1\u00a1the special plea was certainly erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-9\">The amended petition averred \u201c That Tarde pursued the occupation of keeping a billiard table, and that on divers days, before the 28th June, 1859, he did pursue the occupation of keeping a billiard table without first having obtained a license therefor, and that he demanded and received from various persons certain sums of money for the use of his said billiard table.\u201d \u201cWherefore a cause of action has accrued to plaintiff, and he prays judgment as in original petition.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The special answer to this was, \u201cThat the defendant keeps for another person a private billiard table, in his private room, for his own amusement and for the amusement of his boarders;\u201d and, further, defendant says \u201cthat neither he nor the owner makes any charge whatever for the use of said table, neither do they derive any profit from the same, directly nor indirectly.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">We have given the demurrer to this. It was certainly erroneously sustained. The mere ownership of a billiard table, or the storing of one in a private room, or the keeping there for amusement, and receiving no profit from it, cannot be what the statute intends. The keeping is classed with the \u201coccupations,\u201d and, like all other intentions, it must be proved that the thing was kept as an occupation; that is, for the uses ordinarily understood, and which must have entered into the legislative mind.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">III. The record and statement of facts show the extraordinary case of the demurrer to the special plea being sustained, and the case submitted on the plea of not guilty; and yet the court, without any other evidence than the special plea, found the defendant guilty, and mulcted him in the fine of $100. The court must have gone upon the notion that the demurrer to the petition admitted the facts, and therefore the proof of <em>gravamen </em>was unnecessary. But the demurrer did not admit the facts for the purposes of the trial, but only for the purpose of testing whether, admitting the case made by the petition to be true, the plaintiff had a good case in law.

This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the correct and proper practice. (2 Bouv. Law Dic., 415; Bradley v. Baldwin, 5 Conn., 288; Hickman v. Littlepage, 2 Dana, 344; Burly v. Burly, 6 N. H, 200; 10 Wend., 97.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-5\">Plea to the jurisdiction, the penalty being $100. The district court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-6\">The cause was submitted to the judge, jury waived, and it appears from the record that the facts proved consisted in offering in evidence to the court the admissions contained in the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-7\">II. By the constitution of 1845, article VH, section 27, the legislature is authorized to tax all persons pursuing any occupation, trade, or profession. Under this power the legislature acted. Defendant was assessed as a keeper of a billiard table, or rather was prosecuted for pursuing such occupation without license. I wish to suggest that if this species of keeping, viz, for pleasure, comes within the meaning and spirit of taxing the occupation, then this recovery is proper. If, on the other hand, the legislature is to be understood as taxing those occupations, trades, or professions which yield (or are supposed to yield) income, and constitute the business or occupation, in whole or in part, of a man, from which he intends and expects profits, in that case this tax may be questionable. I make this suggestion, although the same more properly belongs to the defense, and as I am advised that some considerable litigation is growing out of the question, and I am desirous that the question be definitely settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\">The view taken by the judge who tried the case being that, the keeping being established, the defendant was liable if he could not produce his license. Although the keeping of the table was for pleasure and not for profit, if this view be correct, then I am of opinion that the judgment should be reformed, so that the one-half go to the state and the other half to the plaintiff\".</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b296-9\">Lindsay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUf\">\u2014 This was a suit brought by the appellee, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>relator, against the appellant, upon a penal statute prohibiting the keeping of a billiard table without having first obtained a license therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The suit was brought by the assessor and collector in the character of an informer, as a <em>qui tarn </em>action, as is averred in the petition itself, in which he states he sues as well for the State of Texas as for hirhself. Certainly the assessor and collector might become the informer as well as another, and be entitled to one-half the penalty prescribed by the statute; and, being the real actor in this suit, he was entitled to receive the whole judgment, one-half of which would have to \u201c be accounted for by him and paid into the state treasury,\u201d as directed by the express language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">There was no necessity for the judgment to direct the assessor\" and collector to pay himself, nor to pay into the state treasury. The collection of the judgment would have created, <em>ipso </em>facto, his liability to the state treasury, which could not be enhanced by the judgment of the court in this case. But the judgment of the court directed payment to the county treasurer, which was certainly an error, of which the appellee might have complained, but not the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Of the jurisdiction of the district court in a case of this kind, concurrently with that of a justice of the peace, we entertain no doubt,, as the statute itself provides that the suit may also be brought before \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d The general jurisdiction of the district courts extended to all cases of penalties, forfeitures, and escheats, and they possessed full authority by the constitution to take cognizance of all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The real and important question in this case was raised by the demurrer to the special defense set up in avoidance of the action, to wit, the keeping of a billiard table for amusement and not for profit. If in this case the keeping of the billiard table was an \u201c occupation,\u201d the occupation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>was subject to the license tax imposed by the statute, because the constitution expressly warrants such legislation. The special defense set up made the issue directly, whether the keeping of the billard table in this case was an \u201c occupation,\u201d as contemplated by the constitution and the statute. If the facts stated in the special plea be true, that is, if the billiard table was simply kept for amusement, and not with a view to profit, was the owner, or the person who gave some attention to it while others were amusing themselves by playing on it, engaged in an occupation which was subject to taxation under the statute? What is an occupation in contemplation of the constitution and the law? The connection in which the word \u201coccupation\u201d stands in the constitution -would seem to give some indication 'of what was intended by it. It says: \u201cPursuing any occupation, trade, or profession.\u201d Certainly the two latter, \u201ctrade or profession,\u201d import profitable pursuits. Why not the former? All lexicographers, in defining this word in the sense of business, give the word that complexion. It is the. usual and customary acceptation of the term. If this be so, (and we think it is quite obvious,) and the Milliard table was simply kept for amusement, and not for profit, then it was not a proper subject of taxation in this way. The same section of the constitution which empowers the legislature to tax \u201coccupations\u201d declares: \u201cTaxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the state. All property in this state shall be taxed in proportion to its value,\u201d &amp;e. . This mode of taxation of a billiard table, merely as property, would conflict with the constitution. We think, therefore, that the demurrer to the special plea of the defendant in the district court ought to have been overruled, and the proof let in to show the character of keeping of the billiard table. For these reasons the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
