But articles 293, 294, and 295 are confined to adultery alone; and fornication is nowhere defined in the code.

Elisha Basse, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-12\">On the 31st of March, 1868, the appellee was indicted in the district court of Cameron county for fornication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-13\">On the 4th of April the defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment, upon the ground that it did not charge the defendant with an offense known to the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b594-14\">The court sustained the motion and quashed the indictment, and the state appealed; and the single question determined was, did the court err in quashing the bill?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-15\"><em>B.

Article 2023 provides that persons guilty of adultery or fornication shall be punished, &amp;c. But for articles 1603 and 1605 there would be no doubt, but I do not feel it my duty to urge the reversal of the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-16\"><em>Israel B.

The code prescribes that every offense must be defined before it is punishable under the penal laws of the state. A mixed offense of adultery and fornication is defined by the statute, for which each of the parties may be held amenable to the law, and receive the infliction of its penalties. But the definition of this mixed offense is, that the parties must live together in a state of cohabitation. The several provisions of the statute show clearly that the living together in such a state was the specific offense designed to be punished. This is the offense defined as adultery by the statute. The moral offense of fornication is not defined by the code. And it is declared by the code, in Paschal\u2019s Digest, article 1605, \u201cno person shall be punished for any act or omission, as a penal offense, unless the same is expressly defined,\u201d &amp;c. Therefore the indictment, which was for simple fornication, was properly quashed by the court, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
