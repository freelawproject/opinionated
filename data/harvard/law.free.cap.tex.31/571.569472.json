The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b587-5\">Article 765 of the Penal Code reads as follows: \u201cIf any person shall steal any horse, gelding, mare, colt, ass, or mule, he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than five nor more-than fifteen years.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2409, Note 686.) A gelding is not a horse, but a eunuch; and an indictment for stealing a horse is not sustained by proof that the accused stole a gelding.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-8\">Appeal from Colorado. The case was tried before Hon. I. B. McFarland, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQs\">The defendant was indicted for stealing \u201c a certain sorrel horse,\u201d &amp;e. The judge charged the jury to determine from the evidence whether the animal stolen was a horse or not. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and sentenced the defendant to five years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary. The witnesses all swore that the animal was a horse, but that he had been gelded. It was assigned for error, that the court refused an instruction asked by the defendant; but no such instruction was in the record. There was a motion for a new trial overruled, and that was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-14\"><em>W. J.

The ease is submitted upon the transcript.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b588-6\">Lindsay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac_d\">\u2014The appellant in this case was indicted for stealing a horse. The proof showed that the property taken was a gelding, an animal- which may be, like all eunuchs, of no sex. The Criminal Code provides that where words in the masculine gender are used in the penal statutes of the State, they shall include the feminine also. This case does not come within the category of that general, provision, for a gelding is neither the one nor the other. The term is used in the statute upon which this indictment was founded distinctively from the word horse, and a conviction for the theft of a horse, upon the proof of taking feloniously a gelding, would be as incongruous as that of stealing a mule or an ass upon a similar indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">If the theft of a specific domestic animal was committed, it should have been correctly charged in the indictment. For the error of the court in refusing a new trial the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
