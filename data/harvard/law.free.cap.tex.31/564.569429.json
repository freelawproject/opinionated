The condition of the bond, which was in the penalty of $12,000, read as follows: \u201c The condition of the above obligation is such, that whereas the-above bound William Miller has surrendered himself into the custody of the sheriff of Goliad, in said state, and is now deprived of his liberty by said officer: How, therefore, if the said William Miller shall he and personally appear before the honorable district court, to be holden within and for the county of Goliad, on the third Monday after the first Monday in August next, then and there to personally remain and be, nor depart therefrom without leave of the court, and remain from term to term and from day to day until legally discharged, to answer any indictment that may be found or preferred by the grand jury of said county upon a charge of the murder of Carlos de la Garza, on the 4th day of March, 1867, in the county of Goliad, then, there, and in that case, this obligation will he null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>At the next term of the court an indictment for the murder of de la Garza was preferred against William Miller, and he failing to appear, a regular judgment <em>nisi </em>was rendered against Miller and his sureties. But, upon the return of the <em>scire facias, </em>the defendants moved to set aside the judgment and quash the hond, because it was not taken by any officer authorized to take it, recited no offense, and was not conditioned, as the law directs.

The pretended bond does not name the offense with which the defendant is accused. It is not \u201c named in the bond.\u201d Again: the sheriff has no authority to exact a hail bond of one whom he has arrested or who voluntarily surrenders himself. It is his duty to take the accused before some magistrate, that the offense may be inquired into. The judgment of the court below in setting aside the judgment <em>nisi </em>is</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
