The vendor of real estate has an equitable lien thereon for the payment of the purchase-money, and it exists not only against the vendee, but all subsequent purchasers with notice, either actual or constructive.

The lien may be waived by the vendor of land, and the taking of independent security is presumptive evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of such waiver, but it is not conclusive; it is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an intent, and the question of such intent is a fact for the jury. (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 1226; McAckreth v. Symmons, 15 Ves., 342; Nairn v. Prumse, 6 Ves., 759; Garson v. Green, 1 Johns.

If the security is taken for the money the burden of proof has been adjudged to lie on the vendee, to show that the vendors agreed to rest on that security, and to discharge the land. (Hughes v. Kearney, 1 S. &amp; L., 135; Saunders v. Leslie, 2 B. &amp; B., 514.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-7\">IY. But in this case all idea of the waiver of the lien or presumptions of intent are dispelled by the fact, that the taking of the security on notes by the administrator was done in compliance with law and order of court.

And if the executor or administrator shall neglect to take such note, security, and mortgage, he and the securities on his bond shall be liable at the suit of any person interested in the estate, for the use of the estate, for the amount of such sales.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1333.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-10\">The case of Parker County v. Sewell, 24 Tex., 238, is precisely in point, and is decisive of this case. \u201c That taking * * the responsibility of a third person is evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>that the seller did not repose upon the lien, hut upon independent security, and it discharges the lien.\u201d (Brown v. Gilman, 4 Wheat., 201.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-6\">\u201c The lien is waived where a note or bond is taken of the vendee for the purchase-money, in which a third person joins as security.\u201d (Fish v. Howland, 1 Paige, 20; Johnson v. Sugg, 13 S. &amp; M., 346; Francis v. Hazeling\u2019s Ex\u2019s, Hardin, 48; (citing 2 Wash., 144;) McClure v. Harris, 12 B. Monr., 265; Marshall v. Christmas, 3 Humph., 617; Vail v. Foster, 4 Comst., 312.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b643-7\">Caldwell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXq\">\u2014It is recognized as a correct principle of law, that a vendor of real estate has an equitable lien thereon, to secure the payment of the purchase-money, and this lien exists against the vendor and all subsequent purchasers with notice, actual or constructive. (1 Tex., 329; 4 Tex., 13; 12 Tex., 13; Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a71216-1226.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">This is the doctrine of courts of equity. Its origin dates back beyond the system of registration, now so universal in this country, and it may be safely said, that the reasons which gave rise to it no longer exist. Hence it is that some of our most eminent jurists, while greatly deploring the existence of such a doctrine, admit that it is now too firmly engrafted on our system of jurisprudence to be disturbed otherwise than by legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">It seems to us, therefore, that a rule which gives rise to vague and conflicting equities, to uncertainty and confusion in titles, ought not to be extended, so as to embrace a class of cases specially provided tor by direct and positive statutory provisions. Neither natural justice nor necessity requires it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">It follows, then, in our view, that the doctrine of \u201c vendor\u2019s lien \u201d does not apply in this state to sales of real estate by an administrator under the orders of the probate court. The administrator is required to \u201ctake a mortgage upon the property sold, to secure the payment of the purchase-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>money,\u201d and should the administrator neglect to take such \u201cmortgage,\u201d he and his securities are liable on their bond to \u201c any person interested in the estate.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1333.) To hold otherwise would be to charge an innocent subsequent purchaser with the delinquency of an administrator, and in effect be a judicial repeal of a statute coming within the legitimate scope of legislative power. It is insisted on, however, that the recital in the deed was sufficient to put a prudent man on inquiry. Having excluded administrator\u2019s sales from the general rule, to this it is sufficient to reply, that the record of deeds disclosed no mortgage retained as the law required, and the subsequent purchaser of the administrator\u2019s vendee had a right to presume that none existed. He stands upon the law, and is entitled to its protection. The judgment of the court below is in all things</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
