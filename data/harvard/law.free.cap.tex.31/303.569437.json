The case was tried before Hon. John Ireland, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">The appellant was indicted in two counts, one for playing cards in a public place, the other for playing in a gaming-room attached to a liquor-shop. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Arts. 2044, 2045, Hotes 640, 641.) The defendant moved to quash, on the ground of this improper joinder, which motion was overruled. The jury found the defendant guilty generally, and assessed his fine at $10, upon which there was judgment, and from this he appealed. The charge of the court took no notice of there being two counts. \u201e</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-8\">Ho brief for appellant has been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-9\"><em>E.

If two offenses be charged in the indictment, of the same class, but of different degrees, the party accused may make his election upon which he will be tried. Failing to do so, the jury may assess the penalty for either offense, if the evidence in the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>warrant the conviction upon either. This may be regarded as one of the improvements of the code of criminal procedure upon the common-law methods of trial for penal offenses. There is no error in the judgment which needs correction, and it is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
