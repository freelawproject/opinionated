Petitioner\u2019s discontinuance was not illegal or in any way improper, and the Chancellor\u2019s exercise of his discretion to reinstate petitioner to his probationary service does not entitle him to an award of back pay or to any other emoluments for the period of his discontinuance. <em>(Matter of Venes v Community School Bd., </em>43 NY2d 520; <em>James v Board of Educ., </em>37 NY2d 891; <em>Matter of Kaufman v Anker, </em>42 NY2d 835; <em>Matter of Velger v Williams, </em>118 AD2d 1037; <em>Matter of Macklin v Powell, </em>107 AD2d 964; <em>Matter of McAulay v Board of Educ., </em>61 AD2d 1048, 48 NY2d 659; <em>Haron v Board of Educ., </em>411 F Supp 68; <em>Austin v Board of Higher Educ., </em>5 NY2d 430; <em>Matter of Sinicropi v Bennett, </em>92 AD2d 309, 60 NY2d 918; <em>Piro v Bowen, </em>76 AD2d 392, 52 NY2d 702.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b808-13\"><em>Richard A.

Subsequently \u2014 after a review, as afforded by the collective bargaining agreement, under the procedures established in the Board bylaws \u2014 the Chancellor reversed his earlier determination and reinstated petitioner to probationary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The issue in this appeal by respondent Board of Education is whether the Chancellor\u2019s original action terminated petitioner\u2019s rights as a probationary appointee under Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a) as of September 4, 1984, or whether, as petitioner claims in his CPLR article 78 proceeding, that action was nonfinal and ineffective until completion of the review procedure. The Appellate Division, affirming Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in favor of petitioner, held that the Chancellor\u2019s original determination was not final and that, therefore, from September 4, 1984 until March 25, 1985, when the review was complete, petitioner was illegally deprived of his position. Accordingly, it directed that petitioner\u2019s reinstatement be retroactive with back pay and full benefits from September 4, 1984. We granted leave to appeal and, for reasons which follow, now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Unquestionably, a Board of Education, under Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a), has the right to terminate the employment of a probationary teacher at any time and for any reason, unless the teacher establishes that the termination was for a constitutionally impermissible purpose, violative of a statute, or done in bad faith <em>(see, Matter of Venes v Community School Bd., </em>43 NY2d 520, 525; <em>James v Board of Educ., </em>37 NY2d 891, 892). In the City of New York, the Chancellor, as the Board\u2019s designee, may properly make the determination to discontinue a probationer <em>(see, Matter of Brown v Board of Educ., </em>42 AD2d 702 <em>Iv denied </em>34 NY2d 519). A teacher who has been discontinued, however, may ask the Chancellor to review his decision and, in effect, reverse himself pursuant to section 5.3.4 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the Board of Education bylaws.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Under this procedure, a hearing is held before a committee appointed by the Chancellor and selected in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. After the hearing, the committee submits its advisory findings and recommendations to the Chancellor who makes the ultimate decision <em>(see, Matter of Kaufman v Anker, </em>42 NY2d 835, 837).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">It is a basic policy underlying Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a) that the responsibility for selecting probationary teachers and evaluating them for appointment on tenure should lie with the Board of Education upon appropriate recommendation of its professional administrators <em>(see, Honeoye Falls-Lima Cent. School Dist. v Honeoye Falls-Lima Educ. Assn., </em>49 NY2d 732, 734; <em>Matter of Cohoes City School Dist. v Cohoes Teachers Assn., </em>40 NY2d 774, 777, 778), and that the Board should have broad discretion in making such decisions <em>(see, Matter of Venes v Community School Bd., supra; Bergstein v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 318, 323). From the language of Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a), it is evident that a decision not to grant tenure to a probationary teacher, once made, is intended to be final. The statute contains no provision for reconsideration or review or for reinstatement of a discontinued probationary appointee. Except for the requirement that a person who is not being recommended for tenure be notified in writing no later than 60 days before the expiration of the probationary term, the authority of the Board to discontinue the services of a probationer is without temporal limitation. Indeed, the Board is specifically authorized to exercise its power to discontinue <em>\"at any time </em>during such probationary period\u201d (Education Law \u00a7 2573 [1] [a] [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The question remains, however, whether anything in the review procedure established in the bylaws <em>(see, </em>Education <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Law \u00a7 2590-d [1]; <em>Matter of Lehman v Board of Educ., </em>82 AD2d 832, 833; <em>Matter of Jacobs v Board of Educ., </em>73 AD2d 623, 624) makes the Chancellor\u2019s original decision on discontinuance nonfinal. We think not. Section 5.3.4 of the bylaws in no way pertains to the finality of the Chancellor\u2019s decision. The section is procedural only, contains no provision concerning reinstatement or back pay, and does not purport to affect the teacher\u2019s substantive rights under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Probationary teachers have no constitutional or statutory right to a review of the Chancellor\u2019s decisions to discontinue their services and to deny tenure <em>(see, Matter of Aherns v Board of Educ., </em>57 AD2d 925; <em>Matter of Clausen v Board of Educ., </em>39 AD2d 708). Their right to a review stems solely from the collective bargaining agreement. Section 5.3.4 does no more than establish an optional procedure under which a teacher may ask the Chancellor to reconsider and reverse his initial decision, a decision which is final and which, when made, in all respects terminates the employment of a probationer under Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a). To adopt petitioner\u2019s position that a section 5.3.4 review postpones the effective date of the Chancellor\u2019s action until completion of the review procedure would have anomalous consequences. A probationary teacher could, although validly removed from the teaching rolls by action of the Chancellor under Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a) and performing no services for the school system, become entitled to full salary during the review process, regardless of its eventual outcome. To obtain such entitlement, a discontinued teacher would have only to institute review under section 5.3.4. We need not consider the constitutional implications of such a construction, for it was clearly never intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In this case, petitioner had a probationary appointment as a teacher of English as a second language at the Adlai Stevenson High School. The Chancellor, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of the Bronx High Schools, advised petitioner by letter on June 28, 1984 that his service as a teacher was \"terminated as of the close of business on September 4, 1984\u201d and that pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement petitioner was \"entitled to the review procedures under Section 5.3.4 of the Bylaws\u201d. In a letter to petitioner dated March 25, 1985, the Chancellor stated: \"After careful consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>eration of your case, I have determined to reverse the recommendation to discontinue your probationary service as a Teacher of English as a Second Language which was <em>effective at the close of business September 4, 1984\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Petitioner does not contend that the Chancellor\u2019s initial action in discontinuing his services was unlawful in the sense that the Chancellor lacked authority or that it was in violation of petitioner\u2019s constitutional or statutory rights. <em>Matter of Golornb v Board of Educ. </em>(92 AD2d 256), relied on by petitioner and the Appellate Division, is, therefore, not on point. In that case, the probationary status of a teacher in the New York City system was improperly terminated by her high school principal rather than, as required, by the Chancellor. Thus, unlike the case at bar, the ouster in <em>Golornb </em>was patently unlawful <em>(id., </em>at 258). Nor does petitioner contend z that his discontinuance was procedurally defective <em>(cf., Matter of Pascal v Board of Educ., </em>100 AD2d 622 [probationary teacher not given 60 days\u2019 prior notice of discontinuance required by Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a)]). There is no question that the Chancellor\u2019s June 28, 1984 letter was within the probationary period, that it gave petitioner more than the required 60 days\u2019 notice of the effective date of the termination, and that the action was taken on recommendation of the Superintendent (Education Law \u00a7 2573 (1) (a); <em>see, Matter of Brown v Board of Educ., </em>42 AD2d, <em>supra, </em>at 703). Petitioner argues only that the Chancellor\u2019s original action, as recited in the June 28, 1984 letter, was incomplete and, for that reason, ineffective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">There is nothing tentative or conditional about the letter. The message is simple and direct: that petitioner\u2019s \"probationary service as a teacher of ESL <em>is terminated </em>as of the close of business on September 4, 1984\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Chancellor\u2019s June 28, 1984 letter met all the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Accordingly, the order should be reversed, with costs, and the proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\"> Section 5.3.4C pertaining to review of decisions on continuance of services is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-8\">\"Review Committee in Recommendation for Discontinuance of Service\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-9\">\"Any person in the employ of the board of education who is summoned to appear before the chancellor, or a committee designated by the chancellor, in respect of the discontinuance of service during the probationary term, or at the expiration thereof, shall have a review of the matter before a committee which shall be designated in accordance with contractual agreements covering employees or by regulations of the chancellor, as appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-10\">\"After the review, the committee shall forward its advisory recommendation to the community school board or to the chancellor in accordance with contractual agreements.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
