The record establishes that a special relationship existed between appellants and respondent, sufficient to impose liability in this action. <em>(Cuffy v City of New York, </em>69 NY2d 255; <em>Schrempf v State of New York, </em>66 NY2d 289; <em>Sorichetti v City of New York, </em>65 NY2d 461; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>Kenavan v City of New York, </em>120 AD2d 24; <em>Stilo v County of Nassau, </em>122 AD2d 41; <em>Cunetta v Board of Educ., </em>121 AD2d 677.) II. The record herein demonstrates that appellants did not assume the risk of injury. <em>(Arbegast v Board of Educ., </em>65 NY2d 161; <em>Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432.) III. There are no public policy considerations which mandate a denial of liability in this action. <em>(Tarter v State of New York, </em>68 NY2d 511; <em>Satiro v City of New Rochelle, </em>102 AD2d 821.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-12\"><em>Robert Abrams, Attorney-General (Vernon Stuart, O.

The court below correctly decided that a policeman is prohibited by public policy from recovering for injuries sustained as a result of a negligent act which created the occasion for his presence at the place of the occurrence. <em>(McGee v Adams Paper &amp; Twine Co., </em>26 AD2d 186, 20 NY2d 921; <em>Arbegast v Board of Educ., </em>65 NY2d 161; <em>Turcotte v Fell, </em>68 NY2d 432; <em>Akins v Glens Falls City School Dist., </em>75 AD2d 239, 53 NY2d 325.)

Claimants failed to prove that any alleged negligence of the State was the proximate cause of claimants\u2019 injuries. <em>(Huntley v State of New York, </em>62 NY2d 134; <em>Friedman v State of New York, </em>67 NY2d 271; <em>Dunn v State of New York, </em>29 NY2d 313; <em>Murray v State of New York, </em>38 NY2d 782; <em>Stuart-Bullock v State of New York, </em>38 AD2d 626, 33 NY2d 418; <em>Lyle v State of New York, </em>44 AD2d 239; <em>Sheehan v City of New York, </em>40 NY2d 496.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b439-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b439-6\">Kaye, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Police officers injured while attempting to subdue an escaped mental patient cannot, in general, recover damages against the State for negligence in connection with the patient\u2019s escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Claimants \u2014 Suffolk County Police Officers Joseph Santangelo and Fred Kirschenheiter \u2014 were injured on July 15, 1979 when they attempted to apprehend Brian Bordes, an escaped mental patient, and return him to Kings Park Psychiatric Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Bordes had a history of confinement and escape from Kings Park. Several times Bordes was delivered there by Suffolk County police officers, most recently on May 9, 1979 when he was involuntarily committed after having fired a rifle into a cabinet at his grandparents\u2019 home. Police directed the hospital staff to inform them if he was discharged because there were warrants outstanding for his arrest. But the hospital\u2019s supervision failed yet again, and on May 17 Bordes \u2014 considered potentially dangerous to himself and others \u2014 escaped once more. The hospital notified the family and the police of the escape, but when Bordes remained at large for 30 days, the hospital simply marked him \"discharged\u201d, meaning that its records no longer reflected that he had escaped. Suffolk County police were notified of the \"discharge\u201d and canceled the alarm on Bordes. Thus, on July 15 there was no notification in police records of his escape or his potential dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">On the morning of July 15, 1979, Bordes\u2019 uncle called Suffolk County police headquarters and advised Santangelo that Bordes was an escapee from Kings Park and was at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>grandparents\u2019 home, that he feared for their welfare, and that Bordes previously had fled at the sight of uniformed police officers. Santangelo determined from the office teletype file that there were no outstanding alarms for Bordes, and with Kirschenheiter went to apprehend him. They found Bordes seated on the living room couch. When they identified themselves as police, Bordes produced a knife from his pocket and threatened them with it. In their ensuing efforts to subdue Bordes, including spraying chemical mace and shooting at him, both officers were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Claimants thereafter instituted personal injury suits against the State, asserting two theories: that the State was negligent in permitting this dangerous patient to escape and remain at large, and that the State violated Department of Mental Hygiene regulations regarding escapees in marking Bordes \"discharged\u201d and in failing to give them the required particular notice of his escape and dangerousness. The Court of Claims found both that the State was negligent and that it had violated regulations by marking Bordes \"discharged\u201d after his escape. However, the court denied claimants any recovery because public policy precluded it, because claimants were not within the class intended to be protected by the regulations and because, even if they were, the requisite notification had in effect been made. The Appellate Division affirmed (127 AD2d 647). We granted leave and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">It is a long-standing common-law rule that firefighters injured while extinguishing fires generally cannot recover against the property owners or occupants whose negligence in maintaining the premises occasioned the fires <em>(see, Kenavan v City of New York, </em>70 NY2d 558; <em>McGee v Adams Paper &amp; Twine Co., </em>20 NY2d 921, <em>affg on opn below </em>26 AD2d 186). The rule has been recognized in the statutory law of this State by the adoption of General Municipal Law \u00a7 205-a, creating a cause of action where none would otherwise exist, for firefighters sustaining \"injuries while engaged in extinguishing a fire on premises wherein the owner or other person in control negligently failed to comply with the requirements of some statute, ordinance, or rule respecting the maintenance and safety of such premises.\u201d <em>(Kenavan v City of New York, </em>70 NY2d 558, 567, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The initial rationale for the common-law rule \u2014 known as the \"fireman\u2019s rule\u201d \u2014 was that firefighters entering upon premises were no more than licensees, and therefore took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>property as they found it <em>(see, Flowers v Rock Creek Terrace, </em>308 Md 432, 520 A2d 361; Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 61, at 429; Annotation, <em>Liability of Owner or Occupant of Premises to Fireman Coming Thereon in Discharge of his Duty, </em>11 ALR4th 597). Later cases have rejected the premises-based rationale and instead cast the general denial of liability in terms of assumption of risk: persons who choose to become firefighters assume the risks of fire-related injuries, including the risk of negligence of property owners and occupants in maintaining their premises <em>(see, e.g., McGee v Adams Paper &amp; Twine Co., </em>26 AD2d, at 190, <em>supra; see also, Pottebaum v Hinds, </em>347 NW2d 642 [Iowa]; <em>Calvert v Garvey Elevators, </em>236 Kan 570, 694 P2d 433; <em>Armstrong v Mailand, </em>284 NW2d 343 [Minn]; <em>Krauth v Geller, </em>31 NJ 270, 157 A2d 129). The \"fireman\u2019s rule\u201d has also been grounded on public policy: municipalities employ firefighters precisely because special skills and expertise are required to confront certain hazards \u2014 usually of an emergency nature \u2014 that expose the public to danger, these hazards often arise from negligence, and as a matter of public policy firefighters trained and compensated to confront such dangers must be precluded from recovering damages for the very situations that create a need for their services <em>(see, e.g., Krauth v Geller, </em>31 NJ 270, 157 A2d 129, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">These policy considerations \u2014 which in our view most aptly support the rule \u2014 are relevant as well to police officers injured in the line of duty <em>(see, e.g., Walters v Sloan, </em>20 Cal 3d 199, 202, 571 P2d 609, 610-611; <em>Flowers v Rock Creek Terrace, </em>308 Md 432, 442, n 4, 520 A2d 361, 366, n 4, <em>supra </em>[citing other jurisdictions so holding]; <em>but see, Christensen v Murphy, </em>296 Ore 610, 678 P2d 1210 [abolishing the rule], and <em>Kreski v Modern Wholesale Elec. Supply Co., </em>151 Mich App 376, 390 NW2d 244 [rejecting the rule]; Note, <em>Oregon Abolishes the Fireman\u2019s Rule </em>\u2014 Christensen <em>v Murphy, </em>19 Suffolk UL Rev 957 [1985]). Like firefighters, police are the experts engaged, trained and compensated by the public to deal on its behalf with emergencies and hazards often created by negligence, and like firefighters they generally cannot recover damages for negligence in the very situations that create the occasion for their services. Apprehending an escaped mental patient\u2014 who may well have escaped owing to negligent supervision, and may well be dangerous \u2014 is a function particularly within the scope of duty of police officers <em>(see, e.g., </em>Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 29.19). Nor are police officers left unprotected by such a rule. They receive both training that enables them to mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>mize the dangers their occupation requires them to face, and compensation and special benefits to help assure that the public will bear the costs of injuries suffered by its protectors in the line of duty. <em>(See, e.g., </em>General Municipal Law art 10 [\"Firemen and Policemen\u201d]; Retirement and Social Security Law art 8 [\"New York State Policemen\u2019s and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Both the Court of Claims and the Appellate Division, in denying recovery, relied on the doctrine of assumption of risk and particularly on <em>Arbegast v Board of Educ. </em>(65 NY2d 161), holding that express rather than implied assumption of risk applied here. Claimants now urge that the risk they confronted exceeded any they assumed and that the \"special relationship\u201d they had with Kings Park, both by virtue of Mental Hygiene Law \u00a7 29.19 and by virtue of the special facts, entitles them to recovery. While we affirm the result reached by both courts, we make clear that our decision is not predicated upon principles of comparative fault but rather upon sound considerations of public policy resting on the nature of the occupation \u2014 which often requires police to confront negligently created emergencies on behalf of the public. Here the anomaly of permitting recovery by police officers would be particularly evident: allowing recovery against the State for injuries incurred while apprehending an escaped mental patient would result in the payment of damages by the public for injuries sustained by the experts it employs to deal with such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The trial court additionally rejected claims based on violation of particular statutes and regulations, finding them without basis in fact or law, and the Appellate Division affirmed. In their argument to this court, however, claimants do not press those contentions, and we need not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs. .</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur; Judge Titone taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
