We conclude that neither the Dram Shop Act nor the common law encompasses such liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>D\u2019Amico v Christie</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">After leaving work at Schlegel Corporation on Friday, June 13, 1980, defendant Kenneth Christie attended a picnic at Powder Mill Park near Rochester, some distance from Schlegel\u2019s plant. The event was organized by the Schlegel Social and Athletic Association (the Association), a voluntary society formed by Schlegel employees. The sole purpose of the Association was to organize two annual members-only social functions, a Christmas party and a summer picnic. Association members themselves set up the picnic, cooked, and cleaned up the site. Food and beverages were purchased out of a fund made up of members\u2019 monthly dues of $1 and the proceeds of $5 ticket sales. At the picnic, cans of beer were kept on ice, freely available, in plastic-lined trash cans. Christie spent about four hours ct the picnic and may have consumed as many as 6 or 8 12-ounce cans of beer. He left at approximately 10:30 p.m. and drove to Michael\u2019s Tavern, where he had arranged to meet friends. He continued drinking beer there, and left some time between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. Shortly after 2:30 that morning, as he was driving home, Christie entered Interstate 490 on an exit ramp and drove west in the eastbound lane until he collided head-on with a car driven by plaintiff Theodore D\u2019Amico, injuring him seriously. Christie later pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor, in the Town of Brighton Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">D\u2019Amico then brought this action against Christie, Michael\u2019s Tavern, Berla Galliger (as president of the Association) and Schlegel, claiming that Christie was liable in common-law negligence, that Michael\u2019s Tavern was liable under New York\u2019s Dram Shop Act (General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101), that the Association was legally responsible for his injuries because it sold or served the alcohol that caused Christie\u2019s intoxication, allowing him to become so drunk that he could not safely drive an automobile, and that Schlegel was responsible for the acts of its employees. At trial, a toxicologist testifying as plaintiff\u2019s expert opined that, based on blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>samples taken later during the morning of June 14, 1980, Christie had become legally intoxicated before leaving the picnic.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The trial court dismissed the complaint against Schlegel at the close of plaintiffs case and dismissed the complaint against the Association at the close of all the evidence. The jury found Christie liable in negligence and Michael\u2019s Tavern liable for a violation of the Dram Shop Act, held D\u2019Amico free of contributory negligence, and awarded damages against those defendants. The Appellate Division reversed as to Michael\u2019s Tavern on grounds not relevant here and upheld the dismissal of the complaints against the Association and Schlegel, noting that the Association had not been engaged in the commercial sale of alcohol. We agree that D\u2019Amico\u2019s claims against the Association and Schlegel were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Henry v Vann</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Plaintiffs, executrices of the estates of Arthur and Evelyn Stockdale, allege that the Stockdales died as a result of injuries they suffered in an automobile accident on December 10, 1984 in Monroe, New York, when their car collided head-on with one negligently driven by defendant Jessie Vann, Jr. Vann, who was intoxicated, had been employed by defendant Monroe Tube Co. as a machine operator until shortly before the accident. Vann worked the second shift at Monroe\u2019s plant, starting at 2:30 p.m. He took a break at about 6:30 or 7:00 p.m. After his break, at about 8:30, Vann\u2019s foreman smelled alcohol on his breath and noticed his eyes \"did not look right.\u201d The foreman told Vann he was too intoxicated to perform his duties safely, fired him, and told him to leave the premises. The foreman saw Vann walk out of the plant. Vann got into his car and on his way home, at a point about half a mile from the Monroe plant, he drove his car into the opposite lane of oncoming traffic and collided with the Stockdales\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Plaintiffs sued Vann and Monroe, alleging that Monroe was vicariously liable for Vann\u2019s acts. Plaintiffs also contended that Monroe\u2019s independent act of directing or allowing Vann to drive while too intoxicated to work was negligent and a direct cause of the foreseeable accident that resulted in the Stockdales\u2019 deaths. Supreme Court denied Monroe\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the cause of action alleging its independent negligence. The Appellate Division reversed, concluding that Monroe \"violated no legally cognizable duty owing to the decedents.\u201d (124 AD2d 783, 784.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Dram Shop Act Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We first consider D\u2019Amico\u2019s claim against the Association under the Dram Shop Act (General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">At common law, one who provided intoxicating liquor was not liable for injuries caused by the drinker, who was held solely responsible. Excessive alcohol consumption was deemed to be the proximate cause of injuries produced by the inebriate; selling or furnishing alcohol to an adult who elected to become intoxicated was not viewed as the root of the resulting harm <em>(see, e.g., Reid v Terwilliger, </em>116 NY 530, 533; <em>Mead v Stratton, </em>87 NY 493, 496; <em>Bertholf v O'Reilly, </em>74 NY 509, 524; <em>Allen v County of Westchester, </em>109 AD2d 475, <em>appeal dismissed </em>66 NY2d 915; <em>Edgar v Kajet, </em>84 Misc 2d 100, <em>affd </em>55 AD2d 597, <em>Iv dismissed </em>41 NY2d 802; Note, <em>Special Project: Social Host Liability for the Negligent Acts of Intoxicated Guests, </em>70 Cornell L Rev 1058, 1063 [1985]).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">By the Dram Shop Act, the Legislature created an exception to the common-law rule <em>(see, </em>Note, <em>Liability Under the New York Dram Shop Act, 8 </em>Syracuse L Rev 252 [Spring 1957]). The statute provides: \"Any person who shall be injured in person, property, means of support, or otherwise by any intoxicated person, or by reason of the intoxication of any person, whether resulting in his death or not, shall have a right of action against any person who shall, by unlawfully selling to or unlawfully assisting in procuring liquor for such intoxicated person, have caused or contributed to such intoxication; and in any such action such person shall have a right to recover actual and exemplary damages.\u201d As an exception to the common law, the statute must of course be construed narrowly <em>(see, e.g., Valicenti v V\u00e1leme, </em>68 NY2d 826, 829).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">While not literally restricted to actual \"dram shops\u201d or commercial taverns <em>(see, e.g., Bartkowiak v St. Adalbert\u2019s R. C. Church Socy., </em>40 AD2d 306), the Dram Shop Act has consistently been read by lower courts as applicable only to sales of alcohol for profit \u2014 that is, commercial sales <em>(see, Edgar v Kajet, </em>84 Misc 2d 100, <em>affd </em>55 AD2d 597, <em>supra; Conigliaro v Franco, </em>122 AD2d 15, 16; <em>Greer v Ferrizz, </em>118 AD2d 536; <em>Wright v Sunset Recreation, </em>91 AD2d 701; <em>Gabrielle v Craft, </em>75 AD2d 939; <em>Kohler v Wray, </em>114 Misc 2d 856). Plaintiff urges this court, first, to reject that reading of the statute and, second, even if a commercial sale is necessary, to hold that the facts here satisfy the statutory requirement. We cannot accept either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>We find no basis for departing from the consistent interpretation of lower courts that the Dram Shop Act requires a commercial sale of alcohol. That the statute is properly limited to sellers of intoxicating liquors is made plain even by its title: \"Compensation for injury caused by the illegal sale of intoxicating liquor.\u201d The body of the statute also speaks of <em>\"unlawfully selling\u201d </em>alcohol. When the Legislature intended to reach the broader category of alcohol providers \u2014 as it did in 1983 in adding General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-100, applicable to minors \u2014 it said exactly that. General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-100, in contrast to the Dram Shop Act, imposes liability for injuries caused by intoxicated individuals who have not reached the legal drinking age upon persons <em>\"unlawfully furnishing\u201d </em>alcoholic beverages to them. Nor does anything in the long history of the Dram Shop Act support the broader reading plaintiff now urges upon us. The act appears to have uniformly required an alcohol sale as the predicate for liability <em>(see, </em>L 1963, ch 516, \u00a7 11-101).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the end, plaintiff\u2019s plea is that the statute should include all alcohol providers because of the indisputable threat to society posed by drunk drivers. We are, however, constrained in applying a statute by the unequivocal intent expressed by the Legislature in enacting it; if there is to be a change in what the Legislature has clearly written it should come from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Based on the affirmed findings supported by the record, we agree with the conclusion reached by both courts below that the Association was not engaged in the commercial sale of alcohol as contemplated by the Dram Shop Act. The Association made no direct sales of alcohol, and had no recognizable expectation of pecuniary gain from its social affairs. The availability of beer to coemployees who had chipped in to buy their own food and beverages for the picnic cannot be considered a commercial sale of alcohol within the Dram Shop Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">There having been no commercial sale of alcohol, no claim is stated against the Association under the Dram Shop Act, and this claim against Schlegel obviously fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">D\u2019Amico\u2019s Common-Law Negligence Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Plaintiff next urges that liability should be imposed on the Association and Schlegel under the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">As noted, historically it was the drinking of the alcohol, not the furnishing of it, that was regarded as the proximate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>of alcohol-induced injury. There was therefore no basis for imposing liability on persons who merely furnished alcohol, for injuries caused by an intoxicated person <em>(see, Edgar v Kajet, </em>84 Misc 2d 100, 101, <em>affd </em>55 AD2d 597, <em>supra; </em>Note, <em>Kelly v Gwinnell and Social Host Liability for the Provision of Alcohol to an Adult Guest: The Party\u2019s Over, </em>49 Alb L Rev 711, 712 [1985]). Plaintiff argues that this historical view of the respective responsibilities of the provider and drinker of alcohol is antiquated, that lower courts have recognized that control and supervision of inebriates is required even in certain noncommercial settings, and that this court should emulate the example of New Jersey <em>(Kelly v Gwinnell, </em>96 NJ 538, 476 A2d 1219) by imposing liability upon social hosts for highway injuries caused by intoxicated guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We find no basis in these arguments on the facts of this case for imposing liability on the Association. The Association owed no legal duty to D\u2019Amico in connection with Christie\u2019s acts <em>(see, Waters v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>69 NY2d 225).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Landowners in general have a duty to act in a reasonable manner to prevent harm to those on their property <em>(Basso v Miller, </em>40 NY2d 233, 241). In particular, they have a duty to control the conduct of third persons on their premises when they have the opportunity to control such persons and are reasonably aware of the need for such control <em>(see, De Ryss v New York Cent. R. R. Co., </em>275 NY 85). Applying this rationale, lower courts have recognized that a landowner may have responsibility for injuries caused by an intoxicated guest <em>(see, e.g., Joly v Northway Motor Car Corp., </em>132 AD2d 790; <em>Comeau v Lucas, </em>90 AD2d 674; <em>Huyler v Rose, </em>88 AD2d 755, <em>appeal dismissed </em>57 NY2d 777). Significantly, however, these decisions have uniformly acknowledged that liability may be imposed only for injuries that occurred on defendant\u2019s property, or in an area under defendant\u2019s control, where defendant had the opportunity to supervise the intoxicated guest <em>(see, e.g., Delamater v Kimmerle, </em>104 AD2d 242, 244; <em>Comeau v Lucas, supra; Wright v Sunset Recreation, </em>91 AD2d 701, <em>supra; Huyler v Rose, supra; Schirmer v Yost, </em>60 AD2d 789; <em>Paul v Hogan, </em>56 AD2d 723; <em>Vale v Yawarski, </em>78 Misc 2d 522 [Hancock, Jr., J.]). That duty emanated not from the provision of alcohol but from the obligation of a landowner to keep its premises free of known dangerous conditions, which may include intoxicated guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">But that situation is materially different from the one at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>hand. First, unlike the cited examples, the Association was not engaged in serving alcoholic beverages: the picnic was a cooperative venture. Association members \u2014 all coemployees who gathered voluntarily for the social benefit of a summer picnic \u2014 in effect had purchased their own food and alcoholic beverages, and set up the party and served themselves; coemployees neither dispensed nor monitored the consumption of alcohol. The Association was not in the position of a bartender or even a host dispensing alcohol, who may deny the request of a patron or guest for another drink. Second, the injuries complained of did not take place on the picnic premises, or Association property; the accident occurred on a public highway several miles distant. The Association lacked the opportunity to supervise and control that defendants in the cited cases had. Thus, it is clear that the common law of this State relating to landowners who provide alcohol to their guests does not support recovery by plaintiff against the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">While recognizing the moral desirability that drinking be controlled and supervised, we cannot create a new legal duty that would require the Association to respond in damages, as an insurer, for plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Such a result would require this court to go even beyond the standard adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Kelly v Gwinnell (supra). </em>In <em>Kelly, </em>defendant host during a social visit to his home served his guest the equivalent of 13 drinks within an hour or two, continued serving him liquor after his guest was visibly intoxicated \u2014 actions that were \"relatively easily corrected\u201d (96 NJ, at 549-550, 476 A2d, at 1225, <em>supra) </em>\u2014 accompanied the guest to his automobile, saw him drive off, and was himself sufficiently concerned about the guest\u2019s capacity that he called to see if the guest had arrived home safely. There is simply no parallel here.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Significant also is the fact that New Jersey had no Dram Shop Act. The court in <em>Kelly </em>emphasized this as a basis for its decision: \"the very existence of a Dram Shop Act constitutes a substantial argument against expansion of the legislatively-mandated liability. Very simply, when the Legislature has spoken so specifically on the subject and has chosen to make only licensees liable, arguably the Legislature did not intend to impose the same liability on hosts.\u201d (96 NJ 538, 554, 476 A2d 1219, 1227, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In this State the Legislature has spoken. We have a statute prohibiting the unlawful <em>sale </em>of alcohol generally, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>a statute prohibiting the unlawful <em>provision </em>of alcohol to minors. The Legislature adopted the statute relating to minors in 1983, and amended it in 1985 \u2014 at neither time making similar amendments to the Dram Shop Act. The Legislature, thus far, has chosen not to impose liability generally on alcohol providers. While common-law doctrine relating to landowners\u2019 liability for dangerous conditions on their land may also protect third persons injured by intoxicated guests, that doctrine is wholly inapposite on the facts of this case. What plaintiff is in effect asking of this court is not an expansion of any relevant common-law doctrine but an amendment of General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-101, to parallel General Obligations Law \u00a7 11-100. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Again, the conclusion that no liability lies against the Association compels the further conclusion that the claims were properly dismissed against Schlegel.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Henry\u2019s Common-Law Negligence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Unlike <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>in this case there is no claim that the defendant employer provided alcohol to its employee or in any way contributed to his intoxicated condition. The case does not involve any alleged violation of either the Dram Shop Act or the landowners\u2019 responsibility to keep their premises free of known dangerous conditions. Rather, the issue here is whether an employer who fires an inebriated employee and orders him off the work site owes a duty to users of the public highways who may later be injured by him. In a sense, what plaintiffs seek here is the recognition of a third tier of responsibility \u2014 neither that of the person who himself consumed the alcohol and operated the vehicle, nor that of the person who provided him with the alcohol, but that of an employer, for failing to control or supervise him after terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Like <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>in order for plaintiffs to prevail on this claim of common-law negligence, there must first be a legal duty owed by defendant to them. Foreseeability of harm is alone not enough <em>(Waters v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>69 NY2d 225, <em>supra; Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 785, <em>rearg denied </em>41 NY2d 901). No prior cases of this State have recognized the duty plaintiffs now espouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Relying principally on <em>Otis Eng\u2019g Corp v Clark </em>(668 SW2d 307 [Tex]; <em>see generally, </em>Morrison and Woods, <em>An Examination of the Duty Concept: Has It Evolved in Otis Engineer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>ing v Clark?, </em>36 Baylor L Rev 375 [1984]), plaintiffs urge that defendant\u2019s legal obligation to restrain or prohibit Vann from driving off the work site may be found, first, in the employer-employee relationship and, second, in the fact that the employer assumed a duty of control when it directed Vann to take certain action. In our view, neither rationale supports recovery here.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">A defendant generally has no duty to control the conduct of third persons so as to prevent them from harming others, even where as a practical matter defendant can exercise such control <em>(see, Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 783, <em>supra; </em>Harper and Kime, <em>The Duty to Control the Conduct of Another, </em>43 Yale LJ 886 [1934]). Certain relationships, however, may give rise to this duty. Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for example, an employer may be liable for acts of its employees in the course and scope of employment <em>(Riviello v Waldron, </em>47 NY2d 297; <em>Johnson v Daily News, </em>34 NY2d 33); an employee ordinarily is not acting in the course and scope of employment when traveling to and from work, so as to impose liability on the employer for negligent driving during these trips <em>(see, Lundberg v State of New York, </em>25 NY2d 467, 471, <em>rearg denied </em>26 NY2d 883). Here, there can be no question that Vann was acting outside the employment relationship at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Alternatively, plaintiffs urge that the employment relationship may additionally give rise to a duty on the part of an employer to control the conduct of its employee even outside the scope of employment, pointing to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 317. That duty, however, as formulated in the Restatement, is limited to torts committed by employees on the employer\u2019s premises or with the employer\u2019s chattels, and similarly would be unavailing to plaintiffs because the accident occurred off the employer\u2019s premises and did not involve the employer\u2019s property. Thus, plaintiffs have shown no basis in the mere existence of the employer-employee relationship for the legal duty they would have us adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Going beyond the employer-employee relationship itself, plaintiffs assert that the employer assumed a duty of supervision or control when it directed Vann to leave the premises. As set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \"[o]ne who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>person to prevent him from doing such harm.\u201d (Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 319.) Plaintiffs urge that the employer here took charge of Vann, that it knew or should have known that Vann was likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled, and that it failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent him from doing such harm <em>(see, Otis Eng\u2019g Corp. v Clark, </em>668 SW2d 307, 311 [Tex], <em>supra). </em>The Restatement illustrations themselves \u2014 relating to hospitals caring for contagious or violent patients \u2014 suggest a relationship more closely akin to custody, as that section has in fact been applied by lower courts <em>(see, e.g., Cowin v Huntington Hosp., </em>130 Misc 2d 267; <em>Rausch v McVeigh, </em>105 Misc 2d 163, 166).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Whatever else may be required, however, at the minimum such a duty requires an existing relationship between the defendant and the third person over whom \"charge\u201d is asserted (Prosser and Keeton, Torts \u00a7 56, at 383-385 [5th ed]). But the very basis for plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that defendant failed and neglected to take charge of Vann, when it simply fired him. In this respect the rule plaintiffs seek is broader than <em>Otis (supra), </em>where the employer sent its apparently intoxicated employee \u2014 still an employee subject to the employer\u2019s control \u2014 home for the afternoon. Here, defendant did not take charge of Vann; it discharged Vann.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">By the same token, such a duty of necessity must be limited to conduct that defendant may reasonably control <em>(see, Pulka v Edelman, </em>40 NY2d 781, 783-784, <em>supra). </em>Even in <em>Otis (supra), </em>which as yet has no parallel in New York law, the employer virtually placed its employee behind the wheel when it accompanied him to the parking lot and sought his assurance that he could make it home. Plaintiffs have not shown any conduct of Vann\u2019s that, in the circumstances, defendant here might reasonably have controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Thus, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate any legal duty in the existing law of this State that defendant can be said to have breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Nor, on these facts, should the common law be enlarged to permit plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. It is plain that to do so would have broad ramifications, a factor we appropriately take into account in fixing the orbit of duty that will necessarily control other cases as well as this one <em>(see, Waters v New York City Hous. Auth., </em>69 NY2d 225, 230, <em>supra; see also, </em>Morrison and Woods, <em>An Examination of the Duty Concept: Has It Evolved in Otis Engineering v Clark?, </em>36 Baylor L Rev 375, 419-425). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Where is the line to be drawn on the legal responsibility of an employer terminating an employee in these circumstances? What is the responsibility to third persons; what is the responsibility to such an employee who then goes out onto crime-ridden streets? What action would be required of employers to satisfy this legal duty; what action do they have a legal right to take? Such vexing questions, for which no reasonable solutions are suggested or indeed discernible, persuade us that it would be unwise, on the facts presented here, to enlarge an employer\u2019s existing common-law duties as plaintiffs suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Accordingly, in <em>D\u2019Amico v Christie </em>the Appellate Division order should be affirmed, with costs, and in <em>Henry v Vann </em>the judgment appealed from and Appellate Division order brought up for review should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In <em>D\u2019Amico v Christie: </em>Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In <em>Henry v Vann: </em>Judgment appealed from and order of the Appellate Division brought up for review affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
