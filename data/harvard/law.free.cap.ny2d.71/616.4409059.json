The department\u2019s own audit summary establishes that there were no expenditures for improvements during the year that they were \"required\u201d. VII.

The <em>lSYz-year </em>lease was the product of extensive negotiations on petitioner\u2019s rights and obligations in renovating the premises. The lease incorporates petitioner\u2019s agreement to spend approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>$1,000,000 to improve the premises in a provision which reads as follows: \"This Lease is made with the understanding and agreement that Tenant will spend approximately $1,000,000 to improve, furnish, equip and/or alter the premises being let hereunder in accordance with plans and specifications to be approved by Landlord, as required under the within lease. It is a substantial consideration of the Landlord in renting the space to Tenant at the rental referred to herein that Tenant expend such minimum sum, and failure to so improve the premises shall be deemed a substantial default on the part of Tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Pursuant to this provision, petitioner expended $1,446,166 in major capital improvements during the tax years June 1, 1980 through May 31, 1983. In January 1984, respondent, Department of Finance of the City of New York, assessed a deficiency against petitioner of $98,503, including back taxes and interest, for failure to pay commercial rent tax on the sums thus expended. At a subsequent hearing to reconsider the determination, petitioner argued that any payments made by a tenant pursuant to a lease for capital improvements to the premises it occupies do not constitute \"rent\u201d within the meaning of the commercial rent tax law (Administrative Code of City of New York \u00a7 11-701 [6]). Under that local statute, rent is defined as: \"The consideration paid or required to be paid by a tenant for the use or occupancy of premises, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all credits and property or services of any kind and including any payment required to be made by a tenant on behalf of his or her landlord for real estate taxes, water rents or charges, sewer rents or any other expenses (including insurance) normally payable by a landlord who owns the realty <em>other than expenses for the improvement, </em>repair or maintenance <em>of the tenant's premises\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (Administrative Code \u00a7 11-701 [6], formerly \u00a7 L46-1.0 [6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Respondent, relying on a prior department interpretation of \"improvement\u201d expenses, contended that the statutory exclusion refers only to \"voluntary expenditures\u201d for \"minor, nonstructural improvements\u201d which are not intended to \"save the landlord the expense of doing the work itself\u2019 (Department of Finance, opn letter, June 7, 1984, 4 NY Tax Rep [CCH] ]j 400-155). The Hearing Officer, adopting respondent\u2019s interpretation of \"improvement\u201d expenses, upheld the deficiency assessment. Finding that petitioner\u2019s commitment to make improvements was \"part of the bargained-for consideration\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>lease and that the improvements entailed reconstruction and major rehabilitation of the building for the primary benefit of the landlord, the Hearing Officer concluded that petitioner\u2019s expenditures did not fall within the statutory exclusion. A final determination adopting the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings and conclusions was issued by respondent\u2019s Commissioner. Thereafter, petitioner commenced this article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Upon transfer of the proceeding to the Appellate Division, that court annulled respondent\u2019s determination, partially on the ground that the \"clear language of the statute\u201d (126 AD2d, at 344) contravenes respondent\u2019s narrow reading of the statutory exclusion. We agree. As the Appellate Division aptly explained, where the language used in a taxing statute is neither special nor technical, but consists of common words of clear import, there is little reason to defer to a contrary interpretation given by the administrative agency. In such cases, the clear meaning of a statutory provision cannot be altered by invocation of special administrative competence or expertise <em>(see, Matter of Alamo Assocs. v Commissioner of Fin. of City of N. Y., </em>71 NY2d 340, 346; <em>Kurcsics v Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>49 NY2d 451, 459; <em>American Locker Co. v City of New York, </em>308 NY 264, 269; McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 232).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Here, the statutory language is unambiguous and nontechnical. Whatever else \"rent\u201d may include as defined in the local law, it clearly excludes, without express or implied qualification, \"expenses for the <em>improvement, </em>repair or maintenance of the tenant\u2019s premises\u201d (emphasis added). Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention, this plain language admits no distinction between minor and major improvements, between those primarily made for the benefit of the landlord and those for the tenant, or between those bargained for as consideration under the lease and those initiated at will by the tenant. The term \"improvement\u201d commonly refers to a valuable addition or amelioration of real estate, \"amounting to <em>more than mere repairs or replacement </em>* * * and intended <em>to enhance its value, beauty or utility\u201d, </em>including \"any permanent structure or other development\u201d or \"expenditure to extend the useful life of an asset[, which is] capitalized as part of the asset\u2019s costs\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 682 [5th ed] [emphasis added]). This term, without condition or modification in the statute, should be given its ordinary meaning and significance, not the quite different meaning \u2014 indeed, the virtually opposite meaning-urged by respondent on the basis of a prior administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ruling <em>(see, McGoldrick v Family Fin. Corp., </em>287 NY 535, 539; <em>Matter of Penney Co. v Lewisohn, </em>40 AD2d 67, 69, <em>affd </em>33 NY2d 528). Accordingly, the statutory exclusion for \"improvement\u201d expenses was properly read by the Appellate Division to include all the expenditures made by petitioner during the tax years in question, whether or not a part of its bargain with the landlord, for the alterations and renovations of the leased premises. Consequently, the determination for tax deficiency was properly nullified.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Our decision in <em>Matter of Mobil Oil Corp. v Finance Adm\u2019r of City of N. Y. </em>(58 NY2d 95) does not support a contrary result. In that case, we held that \"maintenance\u201d expenses under the same statutory provision did not extend to sums paid by the tenant for cleaning and janitorial services. We explained that the term \"maintenance\u201d did not include work necessary to keep the premises clean, but \"only work done to prevent and cure depreciation \u2014 i.e., such things as painting, replacing window sashes, etc.\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 100). Only \"in the broadest sense\u201d of the term might \"maintenance\u201d be thought to embrace mere cleaning <em>(id., </em>at 99). Hence, we upheld the Finance Director\u2019s more conventional, albeit narrower, interpretation <em>(see, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 859 [5th ed]).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Here, by contrast, the renovation undertaken by petitioner clearly falls within the general sense of the term \"improvement\u201d. The interpretation urged by respondent \u2014 which would exclude the capital alterations and additions made by petitioner \u2014 is not merely a narrow reading of the term; it is a peculiarly cramped one. It denudes the term \"improvement\u201d of that which is an integral part of its ordinary meaning \u2014 i.e., the substantial enhancement of property value or utility. The statutory provision in question contains no words of limitation or modification justifying such a construction, and there is nothing in the statute to suggest that the term \"improvement\u201d should not be given its full significance <em>(see, Price v Price, </em>69 NY2d 8, 15-16; <em>People v Shakun, </em>251 NY 107, 114; McKinney\u2019s Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 114, 232). Moreover, to accept respondent\u2019s contention \u2014 that \"improvement\u201d is limited to minor nonstructural work which does not significantly enhance the value of the property \u2014 would render that term superfluous and redundant in the statute; \"improvement\u201d would then add nothing to the words \"repair\u201d and \"maintenance\u201d. Such a construction, which would deprive the term of its own separate meaning, should be avoided for that reason as well <em>(see, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Feinstein v Bergner, </em>48 NY2d 234, 239; <em>New York State Bridge Auth. v Moore, </em>299 NY 410, 416; McKinney\u2019s Statutes \u00a7 231).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Finally, inasmuch as we ground our decision on the plain meaning of the statutory language, we have no need to address the propriety of the Hearing Officer\u2019s refusal to consider parol evidence of the meaning and purpose of the \"mandatory improvement\u201d provision in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Kaye, Alexander, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacos a concur in Per Curiam opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
