Hendon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, the Cincinnati City School District Board of Education (\u201cthe District\u201d), filed suit against defendants-appellees, the State Board of Education of Ohio and the Ohio Department of Education (\u201cthe State Board\u201d). The District sought to challenge the State Board\u2019s method of providing funding to public school districts. The District was successful in its lawsuit. The trial court granted it summary judgment, and this court recently upheld the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 2} Subsequent to the entry of summary judgment, the District filed a motion pursuant to R.C. 2335.39 seeking compensation for the attorney fees that it had incurred. The trial court denied the motion for attorney fees on the ground that the District was not an eligible party entitled to such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">{\u00b6 3} The District has appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorney fees, arguing in its sole assignment of error that the trial court\u2019s ruling was in error. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">\n<em>R.C. 2335.39 and the Trial Court\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2335.39 provides that a prevailing eligible party in a civil suit against the state may seek compensation for attorney fees. R.C. 2335.39(A)(2) defines who is an eligible party. It specifically states that an eligible party is \u201ca party to an action or appeal involving the state, other than the following: (a) The state; (b) An individual whose net worth exceeded one million dollars at the time the action or appeal was filed; (c) A sole owner of an unincorporated business that had, or a partnership, corporation, association, or organization that had, a net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>worth exceeding five million dollars at the time the action or appeal was filed * * *; (d) A sole owner of an unincorporated business that employed, or a partnership, corporation, association, or organization that employed, more than five hundred persons at the time the action or appeal was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court determined that under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d), the District was an organization that employed more than 500 persons at the time that the underlying action had been filed. R.C. 2335.39 does not define \u201corganization.\u201d Because the legislature chose not to define the term, the trial court relied on the dictionary definition of \u201corganization\u201d to determine whether the District fell within this category. The trial court specifically relied on the Fifth Edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, which states that \u201c[organization includes a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court additionally cited the <em>dictionary.com </em>definition of organization as \u201ca group of people organized for some end or work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 6} Concluding that the District was an organization employing more than 500 people, the trial court denied its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 7} We must first determine what standard is applicable to our review of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 8} The District argues that the central issue on appeal is a question of law concerning whether the trial court correctly construed R.C. 2335.39(A) to determine that the District was an organization. Consequently, the District asserts that this court must review de novo the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 9} But the State Board argues that this court must review the trial court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion, as that is the applicable standard of review for fee decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 10} The State Board correctly notes that R.C. 2335.39(B)(2)(b) provides that \u201c[t]he order of the court may be modified by the appellate court only if it finds that the grant or the failure to grant an award, or the calculation of the amount of an award, involved an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 11} But it is also well settled that the interpretation of statutory authority is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>court declined to grant a fee award after interpreting the term \u201corganization\u201d in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) to include a school district. The failure to grant a fee award directly correlated with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201corganization.\u201d Accordingly, we determine that as the central issue in this appeal is a question of law, our review of the trial court\u2019s decision is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">\n<em>Eligible Party</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 12} We must now determine whether the District is an eligible party under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2). The term \u201celigible party\u201d is defined in terms of exclusions. In other words, all parties to an action or appeal involving the state other than those described in subdivisions (A)(2)(a) through (A)(2)(d) are eligible parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a), (b), and (c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a) provides that \u201cthe state\u201d is not an eligible party. The statute further indicates that the term \u201cstate\u201d should be accorded \u201cthe same meaning as in section 2743.01 of the Revised Code.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 2743.01(A) defines state as \u201cthe state of Ohio, including, but not limited to, the general assembly, the supreme court, the offices of all elected state officers, and all departments, boards, offices, commissions, agencies, institutions, and other instrumentalities of the state. \u2018State\u2019 does not include political subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2743.01(B) further defines the term \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d as \u201cmunicipal corporations, townships, counties, school districts, and all other bodies corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities only in geographic areas smaller than that of the state to which the sovereign immunity of the state attaches.\u201d This statute clearly indicates that a school district is a political subdivision. And political subdivisions are not included in the definition of \u201cstate.\u201d Consequently, the District is not \u201cthe state\u201d and is not excluded as an eligible party under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 15} No assertion has been made that the District should be excluded as an eligible party under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(b) or (c). And it is clear from the definition of these subdivisions that they are not applicable to the District. Consequently, they need not be further addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">\n<em>R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">{\u00b6 16} As we have stated, R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) excludes as an eligible party \u201c[a] sole owner of an unincorporated business that employed, or a partnership, corporation, association, or organization that employed, more than five hundred persons at the time the action or appeal was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>{\u00b6 17} The statute does not define the terms contained in the subdivision, and the District does not openly and obviously fall within any of the enumerated categories. Because the statute itself does not define \u201corganization,\u201d the trial court relied on the dictionary definition of the term to conclude that the District was an organization. We cannot agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 18} When interpreting this statute, we must keep in mind an important principle of statutory construction, that of ejusdem generis. \u201cUnder the rule of ejusdem generis, where in a statute terms are first used which are confined to a particular class of objects having well-known and definite features and characteristics, and then afterwards a term having perhaps a broader signification is conjoined, such latter term is, as indicative of legislative intent, to be considered as embracing only things of a similar character as those comprehended by the preceding limited and confined terms.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 19} R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) lists the following terms: unincorporated business, partnership, corporation, association, and organization. After applying the principle of ejusdem generis, we determine that city school districts do not share similar characteristics with the other entities listed in this statute and that they should not be considered organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 20} Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a school district as a \u201cpolitical subdivision of a state, created by the legislature and invested with local powers of self-government, to build, maintain, fund, and support the public schools within its territory and to otherwise assist the state in administering its educational responsibilities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A school district is clearly an entity responsible for governmental activities for the purpose of ensuring a functioning public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 21} But the definition of the other entities listed in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) indicates that they do not share a similar purpose. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cpartnership\u201d as a \u201cvoluntary association of two or more persons who own and carry on a business for profit.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cCorporation\u201d is defined as an \u201centity having authority under law to act as a single person distinct from the shareholders who own it and having rights to issue stock and exist indefinitely.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And an \u201cassociation\u201d is both an \u201cunincorporated organization that is not a legal entity separate from the persons who compose it\u201d and a \u201cgathering of people for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>common purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Last, while Black\u2019s Law Dictionary does not specifically define \u201cunincorporated business,\u201d it does define the term \u201cbusiness\u201d as a \u201ccommercial enterprise carried on for profit.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">{\u00b6 22} The definitions of partnerships, corporations, associations, and unincorporated businesses indicate that such entities do not possess governmental powers, but rather are usually private bodies. The purpose of these entities is generally to make a profit for their members, not to assist the state or to regulate a not-for-profit entity such as a public school. Further, the governing bodies of these entities are not elected by popular vote in the manner pertaining to a school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 23} All the foregoing observations lead us to conclude that the term \u201corganization\u201d in R.C. 2335.39(A)(2)(d) was not intended to encompass entities such as a school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 24} And although a determination still must be made as to the merits of the District\u2019s fee claim and the amount the District is entitled to recover in attorney fees, we note that our conclusion comports with the basic purpose of R.C. 2335.39. The District was forced to bring this action because the State Board had failed to follow the method for calculating school funding mandated by the Ohio Revised Code. The State Board\u2019s action led to this lawsuit, and as the District prevailed in its lawsuit, the trial court should consider the merits of its claim for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 25} Because a school district is not an organization, the trial court erred in determining that the District was not an eligible party under R.C. 2335.39(A)(2). The District\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">{\u00b6 26} Having sustained the District\u2019s sole assignment of error, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for the trial court to reconsider the District\u2019s motion for attorney fees based on the determination that the District is an eligible party.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-11\">Sundermann, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-13\">.
