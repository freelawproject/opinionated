The magistrate examined the evidence and issued a decision (attached as an appendix), including findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therein, the magistrate concluded that the commission interpreted the report of Dr. Murphy in a manner that creates equivocation. Therefore, the magistrate recommended that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order awarding PTD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>compensation and, in a manner consistent with the magistrate\u2019s decision, enter a new order either granting or denying the PTD application.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent makes no stated objections but generally argues that the magistrate read equivocation into the report of Dr. Murphy. Respondent also contends that the magistrate erroneously concluded that the commission improperly used Dr. Gaines\u2019s medical report as the start date of PTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 4} Upon review, and for the reasons set forth in the magistrate\u2019s decision, we do not find respondent\u2019s position to be well taken. Following an independent review of the matter, we find that the magistrate has properly determined the facts and applied the appropriate law. Therefore, respondent\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision are overruled, and we adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision as our own, including the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. In accordance with the magistrate\u2019s decision, we issue a limited writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order awarding PTD compensation and, in a manner consistent with the magistrate\u2019s decision, enter a new order either granting or denying the PTD application.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Objections overruled and writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-8\">Petree and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<author id=\"b580-10\">Macke, Magistrate.</author>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">{\u00b6 5} In this original action, relator, Showa Aluminum Corporation of America, requests a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio to vacate its order awarding permanent total disability (\u201cPTD\u201d) compensation to respondent Grover Annon (\u201cclaimant\u201d), and to enter an order denying that compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">Findings of Fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">{\u00b6 6} 1. Claimant sustained two industrial injuries while employed as a \u201cjig operator\u201d for relator, a self-insured employer under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">{\u00b6 7} 2. Claimant\u2019s April 28, 2003 injury is allowed for \u201cright shoulder sprain, right trapezius strain\u201d and is assigned claim number 03-843544.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">{\u00b6 8} 3. Claimant\u2019s July 28, 2000 injury is allowed for \u201ctendonitis left hand, neuropathy left ulnar nerve; left cubital tunnel syndrome; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; right cubital tunnel syndrome/right ulnar neuropathy; major depressive disorder\u201d and is assigned claim number 00-498294.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 9} 4. On August 15, 2006, claimant filed an application for PTD compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 10} 5. In support of his application, claimant submitted a report dated June 9, 2006, from attending physician Steven T. Gaines, M.D.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">I do feel as of May 01, 2006, Mr. Grover Annon has reached maximum medical improvement. I do feel that he is permanently and totally disabled from all gainful employment as a result of the injuries to his arms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">He continues to have some pain with the elbows that presents itself predominantly in the forearms, volarly and ulnarily. He still gets some numbness in the fingers. He still has some weakness in his hands and arms. I think at his age it is highly unlikely that he would be able to perform any activity or work that requires use of his arms on any repetitive basis. I certainly do not feel that he is capable of any heavy physical labor which he has performed throughout most of his adult life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">Please note that his problems have required surgery, which ultimately was performed on the right elbow on May 10, 2005 and on the left elbow on October 04, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 11} 6. Under the \u201ceducation\u201d section of the PTD application, claimant indicated that he had graduated from high school in 1961. The application form also posed three questions: (1) \u201cCan you read?\u201d (2) \u201cCan you write?\u201d and (3) \u201cCan you do basic math?\u201d Given a choice of \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnot well,\u201d claimant selected the \u201cnot well\u201d response for the first and second queries and the \u201cyes\u201d response for the third query.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 12} The PTD application form asks the claimant to provide information regarding his work history. Claimant indicated that he was employed as a jig operator with relator from August 1997 to April 28, 2003. He described the basic duties of his job as jig operator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">My job was to jig air conditioners for cars [and] trucks. I lifted the air conditioner off the conveyor system [and] place in a special jig for each model of air conditioner. [Straighten and] make cores flat by bending and patting sides using my hands \u2014 straighten brackets [and] inlet and outlet tubes \u2014 make sure they fit perfectly into the jig [and] then put back onto conveyor system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 13} 7. On December 11, 2006, at relator\u2019s request, claimant was examined by neurologist Gerald S. Steiman, M.D. In his report dated December 15, 2006, Dr. Steiman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">Mr. Annon\u2019s history, medical record review, physical exam and pain assessment provides strong credible objective evidence that he is not incapable of returning to sustained remunerative employment as a result of the physical conditions within claims 00-498294 and 03-843544.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Mr. Annon\u2019s history, medical record review, physical exam and pain assessment fails to provide credible objective evidence which would preclude his ability to return to his prior job activity. Mr. Annon does have evidence of a medical impairment but that medical impairment does not appear work prohibitive when considering the specifics of his job performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 14} 8. Also on December 11, 2006, at relator\u2019s request, claimant was examined by psychiatrist Richard H. Clary, M.D. In his report dated December 12, 2006, Dr. Clary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">In my medical opinion, he has reached maximum medical improvement. Mr. Annon reports that there are many activities and things that he would like to do and indicated that his only limitation is the result of his pain. He has not lost interest in his usual activities which would be the case with a more severe depression. In my medical opinion, his depression is not work prohibitive and does not cause permanent total disability. He enjoys boating and fishing and is able to mow his yard, but again, he has to limit his activities and take frequent rest periods because of his pain. In my medical opinion, the allowed psychiatric condition results in a permanent partial impairment of 10 percent of the whole person based on the AMA Guides Fifth Edition. In my medical opinion, it would be appropriate for Mr. Annon to continue taking antidepressant medication. In my medical opinion, additional treatment with a psychologist is not appropriate and is not indicated for the allowed condition in this claim. In my medical opinion, review of medical records indicate that Mr. Annon has a tendency to exaggerate his symptoms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 15} 9. In further support of his PTD application, claimant submitted a report dated February 6, 2007, from psychologist Donald Jay Weinstein, Ph.D. In his report, Dr. Weinstein indicated that he had reviewed Dr. Clary\u2019s December 12, 2006 report. Dr. Weinstein concluded: \u201cI do not believe that Mr. Annon is exaggerating. Furthermore, I do not believe that Mr. Annon has had ample time in consistent psychotherapy to declare him MMI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 16} 10. On February 27, 2007, at the commission\u2019s request, claimant was examined by orthopedist William Reynolds, M.D. In his narrative report dated March 1, 2007, Dr. Reynolds opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">It is my opinion that the injured worker has reached a level of MMI regarding each specific allowed condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">Using the AMA Guides, 5th Edition, his impairment of function as relates to the right shoulder strain, right trapezius strain is 9%. Impairment of function as relates to the tendonitis left hand and the bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, the impairment of function of the man as a whole is 6%. As relates to the left ulnar nerve neuropathy, left cubital tunnel syndrome, right cubital tunnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>syndrome, and right ulnar neuropathy, impairment of function of the man as a whole is 8%. This translates to a combined effects permanent partial impairment of function of the man as a whole of 22%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 17} 11. On February 27, 2007, Dr. Reynolds completed a physical-strength rating form. On the form, Dr. Reynolds indicated by checkmark that claimant is capable of \u201csedentary work.\u201d Where the form invites the physician to note further limitations, Dr. Reynolds wrote: \u201cNo repetitive arm work activity or working overhead [with right] upper extremity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 18} 12. On February 27, 2007, at the commission\u2019s request, claimant was examined by psychologist Michael A. Murphy, Ph.D. In his report dated March 6, 2007, Dr. Murphy states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Chief Complaints: The Injured Worker\u2019s chief complaints revolve around upper extremity pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">History of Present Illness: The Injured Worker was employed by Showa Aluminum Corporation of America as a jig operator at the time of the 4/28/03 injury. He states, \u201cThe table was too tall and when I reached over the table it moved on wheels so I had to hold the table and the job at the same time.\u201d He was also injured on 7/28/00. He states, \u201cI injured my left hand and arm pulling and lifting and twisting pipes all day on bad parts.\u201d He was off work for ten months following the 2003 injury. The company did not offer light duty employment. He last worked 4/28/03.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">Educational History: Educationally, the Injured Worker completed high school. He attended produce seminars and had an insurance license (now expired). He describes himself as an average student. There were no grade failures. He denies any behavioral problems in school. He was involved in football in high school. He sustained a head injury playing football at age 16. He states, \u201cI was knocked off my cleats. I hit my head. The scar was clamped and I had a skull cast for six weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">Mental Status Examination: Cognitively, the Injured Worker appears to be a man of average intelligence. He is alert, oriented in all spheres, with adequate reality contact. Concentration and attention are unimpaired. He is not distracted by pain. He reports that medications do not interfere with concentration. Comprehension of simple commands is unimpaired. Comprehension of complex commands is unimpaired. Stream of thought and flow of ideas are normal and coherent. Educational deficits are absent. There is no evidence of neurological impairment. There is no evidence of cognitive dysfunction due to psychoses, head injury, or organicity. He shows no obsessions, phobias, ideas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of reference, or delusions. He denies delusions, obsessive ruminations, or hallucinations. His thoughts are clear, understandable, relevant, and goal-directed. Paranoid ideations are absent. There is no tangentiality, circumstantiality, disturbances of logic, or distractibility. His associations are reasonably well organized. The Injured Worker answers questions appropriately. Memory functions are generally intact in all time frames. However, mild and intermittent deficits short-term memory are reported. He states, \u201cI\u2019m forgetful.\u201d Long-term memory is intact. The Injured Worker is able to recall time frames. He gives a reasonable account of his life events in chronological order. He is a good historian. He reports that medications do not interfere with memory functions. Abstract reasoning, concept formation, and fund of knowledge are estimated to be within normal limits. He has a functional understanding of everyday objects. His judgement is not impaired. Executive functions (i.e., decision-making, flexibility, social perceptions) are intact and estimated to be within normal limits. The Injured Worker has had a history of dysfunctional marriages. Insight is limited. The Injured Worker is psychologically minded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">Mood and Affect (injury-specific): Affectively, the Injured Worker reports a chronic depressed mood. He states, \u201cI planned on a nice retirement. Then I got hurt.\u201d He reports depression daily. Depressive cognition is present, including feelings of helplessness. He reports feeling good periodically. He states, \u201cFor two or three hours.\u201d He reports having little or no desire, a loss of pleasure, and feeling irritable, guilty, and downhearted. He states, \u201cI\u2019m frustrated.\u201d He reports depression for the past three years, since his 2002 hand surgery. He denies previous episodes of depression. He reports periodic crying spells, and was tearful when discussing ulnar nerve surgeries. He denies any suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. He denies symptoms of anxiety. Psychomotor retardation and agitation are absent. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress, acute stress, phobic tendencies, and manic episodes are absent. He denies having mood swings. He does not exhibit an inflated self-esteem. The Injured Worker denies symptoms of impulse control behavior and antisocial behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Adaptation (ability to respond appropriately to changes in the work place): The Injured Worker\u2019s work history is good. He is able to maintain attendance, perform the normal duties of his former job or another job within restrictions, use public transportation, use his own transportation, be aware of normal hazards, follow safety procedures, deal with super-visors, deal with coworkers, and work under specific instructions. The Injured Worker is aware of safety issues. He is able to follow normal directions. He does require supervision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>He would function best under low-moderate stress conditions with simple work tasks. The Injured Worker\u2019s presentation of psychological symptoms is consistent with his allowed psychological condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Impairment: <em>Mild</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">Concentration, Persistence, and Pace: The Injured Worker is able to sustain focus or attention long enough to permit completion of tasks in a suitable work environment. He is able to complete a normal workday and work week and maintain regular attendance from a psychological standpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Impairment: <em>Mild</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">Discussion: The Injured Worker has been prescribed Effexor since 2002. More recently, he has begun psychotherapy. At one point he removed himself from Effexor, but became agitated and was restarted. The Injured Worker\u2019s presentation of his marriage was somewhat confused and he is now in his fourth marriage. His present wife is now retired due to her own back surgery. The Injured Worker reports multiple unrelated health issues (i.e., hypertension; colon resection, 2001; prostate treatment, 2003; recent colonoscopy for cancer follow-up, 2006; and bilateral hearing loss). His residual impairment from a psychological stand-point is mild. He fishes and uses a lawn mower. His social capacities are not altered by the injury and his cognitive capacities are mildly impaired. Psychological testing indicates his depression does not interfere with his daily responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">Opinion: The following opinion is based on a reasonable degree of psychological certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">Question 1: Has the Injured Worker reached a maximum medical improvement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">The Injured Worker is at maximum medical improvement. His depression is mild. He has been prescribed Effexor for almost five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-13\">Question 3: What is the Injured Worker\u2019s occupational activity capacity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-14\">The Injured Worker\u2019s depression is mild and not work prohibitive. From a psychological perspective he is able to function in his former capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">{\u00b6 19} 13. On March 7, 2007, Dr. Murphy completed an occupational-activity assessment form. The form asks the examining psychologist to select among three preprinted responses describing the claimant\u2019s ability or inability to work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Based solely on the impairment resulting from the allowed mental and behavioral condition(s) in this claim within my specialty, and with no consideration of the injured worker\u2019s age, education, or work training:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">V) This injured worker has no work limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">) This injured worker is incapable of work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">) This injured worker is capable of work with the limitations(s)/modification(s) noted below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 20} Dr. Murphy selected the first preprinted response, stating, \u201cThis injured worker has no work limitations.\u201d Where the form invites the examining psychologist to state remarks, Dr. Murphy wrote: \u201c(See Report).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">{\u00b6 21} 14. In further support of his PTD application, claimant submitted a report dated April 30, 2007, from psychologist Beal D. Lowe, Ph.D., who is also a vocational expert. The four-page report is captioned \u201cEmployability Assessment.\u201d The report states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">TEST RESULTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">The Logical Memory Subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale was administered to assess practical memory. This assessment has an individual listen to a paragraph which is read to him and then indicate details which are remembered. Mr. Annon remembered only 9 details while the average for persons of his age is 26. Mr. Annon\u2019s performance indicates very poor working memory, despite good effort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">A Short Form of the WAIS-R was administered to screen for basic intelligence. Mr. Annon\u2019s score on this instrument indicates a full-scale IQ of approximately 80, placing him in the Low Average/Borderline range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">The Digit Span Subtest of the WAIS-R was administered. Mr. Annon performed at a very deficient level. He was able to remember only 3 numbers forwards and 2 backwards. This performance places him at approximately the 5th percentile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-16\">This assessment finds Mr. Annon to be permanently and totally disabled as a result of his physical functional restriction to limited Sedentary employment and with consideration given to his tested deficiencies in memory and his Low Average/Borderline level of intelligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-17\">Dr. Reynolds has found Mr. Annon to possess physical capacity only for Sedentary employment which would not involve \u201crepetitive motor activity or working overhead with the right upper extremity.\u201d This physical assessment indicates that Mr. Annon lacks capacity to perform any Sedentary industrial production work, and many other types of Sedentary employment, which would require repetitive movement with his injured right, dominant, hand and arm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Psychological and psychiatric evaluations by Drs. Murphy and Clary have indicated no functional limitations arising from Mr. Annon\u2019s allowed psychological condition. Both exams found only mild memory problems. Neither clinical examination included memory testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">Testing conducted as part of the present examination finds Mr. Annon to have very deficient practical and immediate memory, with scores placing him at the 5th percentile. Screening for basic intelligence indicates a full-scale IQ of approximately 80, placing him in the Low Average/Borderline range. Mr. Annon was observed to put good effort into this testing. These tested deficiencies indicate that Mr. Annon lacks capacity at this time to learn to perform any Sedentary retail or clerical occupation. While, approximately 15 years ago, Mr. Annon had the academic and intellectual capacity to pass the Ohio licensing exam to sell life insurance, current test results indicate that he no longer possesses capacity to perform at that level. Academic and intellectual testing at this time, when Mr. Annon is 64 years old, find that his current memory deficits make it impossible for him to learn to perform, or to consistently perform, any Sedentary retail or clerical occupation. The causes for this apparent intellectual decline are unknown, and may reflect aging and the effects of his allowed depressive condition. Mr. Annon was observed to put good effort into testing and to be embarrassed by his poor results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">In summary, this assessment finds Mr. Annon, at age 64, to be permanently and totally disabled as a result of his physical functional restriction to Sedentary employment which would not require repetitive use of his dominant hand and as a result of memory and intellectual deficits found in objective testing which would make him unable to learn new clerical or retail tasks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 22} 15. Following a June 8, 2007 hearing, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) issued an order awarding PTD compensation beginning June 9, 2006. The SHO\u2019s order explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">This order is based on the reports of Drs. Murphy, Reynolds, and Mr. Lowe. The injured worker has incurred two industrial injuries. The first injury was a 07/08/2000 injury involving injured worker\u2019s hands and elbows. This was a repetitive trauma injury that was allowed for BILATERAL CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME, TENDONITIS LEFT HAND, NEUROPATHY LEFT ULNAR NERVE, LEFT CUBITAL TUNNEL SYNDROME AND RIGHT CUBITAL TUNNEL SYNDROME/RIGHT ULNAR NEUROPATHY. The claim was later amended to add MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. The injured worker had four surgeries because of this claim. The second injury was a 2003 right shoulder-trapezius injury. All treatment for this claim was conservative with no surgeries being reported. The injured worker has not worked since this injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Based on the reports of Drs. Murphy and Reynolds it is concluded that injured worker has the residual ability to perform sedentary work that is non arm repetitive and injured worker is further barred from working overhead with his right upper arm. Further, based on Dr. Murphy\u2019s report the injured worker is restricted to simple work tasks involving low to moderate stress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">Because the injured worker does have residual working abilities, his disability factors are next reviewed to determine what impact those factors have on injured worker\u2019s overall ability to perform sustained remunerative employment. In that light the record reveals the following disability factors: the injured worker is 64 year[s] old, he is a high school graduate, and he has worked as a jig operator, insurance agent, delivery driver, and grocery produce manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">The injured worker\u2019s age is found to be a negative factor. At age 64 the injured worker would be considered an elderly worker with very little potential time left in the work force. For these reasons his age would clearly be a disadvantage to him being reemployed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">The injured worker\u2019s education, high school, is determined to be a neutral factor. The injured worker does possess basic literacy skills, however, he has no technical skills or college degrees. Further, per Mr. Lowe\u2019s 2007 employment assessment, the injured worker\u2019s has an IQ of 80. An IQ this low would make it difficult for injured worker to learn new job skills. Therefore, his education-intellect would only lead itself to injured worker qualifying for simple entry level sedentary jobs at best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">The injured worker\u2019s job history is also found to be a neutral factor. The injured worker\u2019s prior job as an insurance agent would have given him some sedentary job skills. However, it should be noted that injured worker has not worked as an insurance agent for ten years, therefore, his sedentary work skills are remote in nature and said skills would not consequently readily transfer due to this time gap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">In summary, it is initially noted that due to injured worker\u2019s restrictions his potential list of employment possibilities would be very limited. When injured worker\u2019s severely limited potential employment possibilities are combined with his relatively advanced age, limited education, and time remote sedentary job skills, it is reasonable to conclude that injured worker is prevented from ever engaging in sustained remunerative employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">For purposes of completeness the following issues raised by employer\u2019s counsel are ruled on as follows. Dr. Gaines\u2019 06/09/2006 report, which was the report used to support the IC-2 application was objected to as invalid because Dr. Gaines in this report references injured worker\u2019s age in a discussion of injured worker\u2019s ability to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>While it is true that in the second paragraph of this report Dr. Gaines\u2019 does state that at injured worker\u2019s age it would be unlikely injured worker\u2019s could perform repetitive work, it is also noted that in the first paragraph of this report Dr. Gaines stated that injured worker was permanently and totally disabled from all gainful employment as a result of his arm injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">Therefore, it is clear that Dr. Gaines does opine that injured worker is permanently totally disabled solely due to injured worker\u2019s allowed arm injuries without reference or consideration of injured worker\u2019s age or other disability factors. For that reason his report is accepted as valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">Employer\u2019s counsel also objected to consideration of Mr. Lowe\u2019s 05/03/2007 employability assessment report. Employer\u2019s counsel argued that the report was a medical report and therefore not timely submitted pursuant to OAC 4121-3-34. This objection is denied because in the body of this report Mr. Lowe reviews injured worker\u2019s education, work history, and intelligence levels and after taking all of these vocational factors into account concludes that injured worker is permanently totally disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">Therefore, based on a close reading of this report, it is evident that said report is only a vocational-employability report as no <em>medical </em>opinions are contained in said report. Consequently, Dr. Lowe\u2019s report was considered herein as it is a vocational, not medical report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">This award is to be paid as follows: 75% of the benefits are to be paid in claim 00-498294 and 25% of the benefits are to be paid in claim 03-843544.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">This allocation is based on Dr. Reynolds report wherein he attributes the majority of injured worker\u2019s disability to claim 00-498294. Further, claim 00-498294 also includes the psychological allowance making it the primary reason why injured worker is disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">The start date of 06/09/2006 is based on Dr. Gaines\u2019 report of such date. This report is the earliest medical evidence of permanent total disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">{\u00b6 23} 16. On August 23, 2007, the commission mailed an order denying relator\u2019s request for reconsideration of the SHO\u2019s order of June 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">{\u00b6 24} 17. On September 10, 2007, relator, Showa Aluminum Corporation of America, filed this mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">{\u00b6 25} It is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus, as more fully explained below.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">{\u00b626} Equivocal medical opinions are not evidence. <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 657, 640 N.E.2d 815. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Equivocation occurs when a doctor repudiates an earlier opinion, renders contradictory or uncertain opinions, or fails to clarify an ambiguous statement. Id. Ambiguous statements, however, are equivocal only while they are unclarified. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 27} Only the doctor who rendered ambiguous statements can clarify his ambiguous statements. <em>State ex rel. Petronio v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 427, 704 N.E.2d 1225 (the <em>Eberhardt </em>rule required the commission to accept Dr. Muehrcke\u2019s explanation of his conflicting reports notwithstanding the commission\u2019s authority to determine credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 28} It follows from the <em>Eberhardt </em>rule that the commission cannot interpret a medical report in a manner that creates equivocation as to the relied-upon portion of the report. See <em>State ex rel. Sears Roebuck Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-1135, 2007-Ohio-838, 2007 WL 611976, at \u00b641 (the commission was not required to read Dr. Rutherford\u2019s report in a manner that creates equivocation).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 29} Here, the commission, through its SHO, interpreted Dr. Murphy\u2019s report in a manner that creates equivocation as to the relied-upon portion of Dr. Murphy\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 30} The commission interpreted the following statement from Dr. Murphy\u2019s report as a medical restriction on work activity: \u201cHe would function best under low-moderate stress conditions with simple work tasks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">{\u00b6 31} The above-quoted statement was viewed by the commission as a work restriction even though Dr. Murphy concludes in the last paragraph of his narrative report that the depression is not work prohibitive and that claimant is able to function in his former capacity. The above-quoted statement was viewed as a work restriction even though. Dr. Murphy indicated on the occupational activity assessment form that claimant \u201chas no work limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">{\u00b6 32} When the commission viewed the above-quoted statement from Dr. Murphy as a work restriction, it created an equivocation because the commission\u2019s interpretation conflicts with Dr. Murphy\u2019s conclusions, which are set forth in the final paragraph of his narrative report and his occupational-activity assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">{\u00b6 33} In the magistrate\u2019s view, the above-quoted portion of Dr. Murphy\u2019s report need not be interpreted in a manner that creates a conflict with Dr. Murphy\u2019s conclusion that claimant \u201chas no work limitations\u201d or his conclusion that claimant is able to function in his former capacity. Dr. Murphy\u2019s report is not, on its face, equivocal and should remain available for further evidentiary consideration by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>{\u00b6 34} Given that the commission cannot rely upon the interpretation that it gave to Dr. Murphy\u2019s report, the commission abused its discretion in its determination of claimant\u2019s residual medical capacity. Because the commission abused its discretion in determining claimant\u2019s residual medical capacity, it would be premature for this court to review the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis or the report upon which it relied for that analysis. <em>State ex rel. Corona v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 587, 692 N.E.2d 1017. Thus, the issues relating to Dr. Lowe\u2019s report are not before this court in this action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 35} The magistrate shall briefly address an issue that the parties do not raise. The SHO\u2019s order states that the PTD start date of June 9, 2006, is based upon Dr. Gaines\u2019s report, even though the order previously states that it \u201cis based on the reports of Drs. Murphy, Reynolds, and Mr. Lowe.\u201d Neither the commission nor the claimant argue here that the commission\u2019s PTD award can be saved solely by reliance upon Dr. Gaines\u2019s report. While it is conceivable that the commission could articulate an alternative basis for the PTD award, it has not successfully done so by starting PTD compensation as of the date of Dr. Gaines\u2019s report. See <em>State ex rel. Speelman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 73 Ohio App.3d 757, 761, 598 N.E.2d 192 (it is not improper to state alternative grounds for supporting the order, but those grounds should not be merged together and should be explained separately so that a reviewing court can understand what has been done).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 36} The SHO\u2019s statement that the order \u201cis based on the reports of Dr[s]. Murphy, Reynolds, and Mr. Lowe\u201d is contradicted by the selection of a PTD-compensation start date based upon Dr. Gaines\u2019s report. The commission cannot start PTD as of June 9, 2006, unless Dr. Gaines\u2019s report alone supports PTD as of June 9, 2006, because both Drs. Murphy and Reynolds examined after that date. See <em>State ex rel. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-913, 2006-Ohio-3912, 2006 WL 2130720.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 37} In the magistrate\u2019s view, the question of whether Dr. Gaines\u2019s report alone provides the some evidence to sustain the award is not before this court given the confusion created in the order when Dr. Gaines\u2019s report is not among the listing of those reports that the order says it is based upon. See <em>State ex rel. Fultz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 327, 631 N.E.2d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, for all the above reasons, it is the magistrate\u2019s decision that this court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order awarding PTD compensation and, in a manner consistent with this magistrate\u2019s decision, enter a new order either granting or denying the PTD application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
