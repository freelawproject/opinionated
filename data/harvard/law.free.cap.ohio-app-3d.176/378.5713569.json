Bell was arraigned on December 28, 2006, stood mute, and the trial court entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In count one of the indictment, the state alleged that Bell had sexually molested his minor granddaughter, M.O. Prior to trial, however, the state dismissed count one after the trial court determined that M.O. was not competent to testify. Thus, counts two, three, four, and five in the indictment were renumbered counts one, two, three, and four. Counts one, two, and three alleged that Bell had sexually molested and attempted to molest his biological daughter, T.O., on several occasions. Counts two through four were originally listed in the indictment as occurring between the dates of January 1, 2001, and January 31, 2004. On March 6, 2007, however, the state moved to amend the time frame in which those offenses occurred to between August 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s motion during a hearing held on March 9, 2007. Count five in the indictment pertains to an instance when Bell was alleged to have sexually molested his stepson, R.O., between the dates of January 1,1995, and December 31,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">{\u00b6 4} Following a jury trial that began on March 19, 2007, and concluded on March 22, 2007, Bell was found guilty of counts two through five in the indictment. On April 24, 2007, the trial court sentenced Bell to four years imprisonment for each sexual-battery charge. Bell received one year in prison for the attempted-sexual-battery charge, as well as one year for the gross-sexual-imposition charge. The trial court ordered that the prison terms be served consecutively to one another for an aggregate sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Additionally, the trial court classified Bell as a sexually oriented offender. Bell filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on April 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">{\u00b6 5} Bell\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred when it excluded important defense evidence offered not only to impeach the alleged victim\u2019s credibility, but also to negate her testimony regarding the allegations. This evidentiary error deprived Bell of his right to present a defense and his right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment, Bell contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded relevant testimonial evidence that he argues would have impeached T.O.\u2019s credibility, as well as contradicted her testimony regarding the reason she ran away from home in the spring of 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony from T.O. that the real reason she ran away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>from home was because she had been caught stealing Xanax<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from her father. T.O. had previously testified that the reason she had run away the first time was that Bell had allegedly been molesting her. When defense counsel attempted to cross-examine T.O. regarding the allegations of her drug use, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMr. Lachman: Now, let\u2019s talk about the time that you ran away. The fact is, [T.O.], there were actually two times in 2003 that you ran away; isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cT.O.: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cMr. Lachman: The first time happened sometime in the Spring of 2003 when you were actually still in school; isn\u2019t that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cT.O.: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cMr. Lachman: And that day \u2014 time, you were not gone overnight; correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cT.O.: The first time?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cMr. Lachman: The first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cT.O.: No, I was not gone over night.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cMr. Lachman: Okay. You had been skipping school?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cT.O.: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cMr. Lachman: You had \u2014 had you, in fact, stolen\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe State: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe Court: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cMr. Lachman: Did you take any Xanax?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe State: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cMr. Lachman: Your Honor' \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cT.O.: Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-22\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe Court: Sustained. The jury will disregard the question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-23\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cMr. Lachman: May we approach, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-24\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe Court: You may.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-25\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>{\u00b6 29} \u201cMr. Lachman: Your Honor, we\u2019ve established that there\u2019s two \u2014 I mean, she was talking about \u2014 it didn\u2019t come out on cross \u2014 -I mean, direct, but there were two different times that she ran away. The allegation is that it\u2019s a result of him. She can answer no if it\u2019s not true. But to not let me ask it is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThe Court: What you\u2019re trying to ask is one, you are trying to ask whether or not she stole anything and two, whether or not she took any Xanax, neither of which are relevant whatsoever to whether or not she ran away or whether she came back. But to infer that she was taking Xanax at that time, to infer that she had stolen something is improper and I stand by the ruling that I made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 31} Prior to the calling of T.O.\u2019s mother, Sheila Bell, as a defense witness, the issue regarding T.O.\u2019s alleged theft of her father\u2019s Xanax was again discussed in the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe State: You Honor, before we do come back this afternoon, there\u2019s just one issue I want to address. I have no idea who the defense is calling in this case. But should they call Sheila Bell, who\u2019s the mom in this case, the State has reason to believe that she may try and talk about potential drug activity involving one or both of the victims in this case. And I want to make clear that Pm going to object to that going into that particular area.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe Court: Mr. Lachman?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cMr. Lachman: Your Honor, I can tell you that it is my understanding the testimony where drug use would come up is in relating the issues surrounding one of the times that [T.O.] ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIt is not to be offered to somehow go to the credibility, but to the circumstances surrounding her running away. And any objection to that, I would point out the State is the one that had her running away because if what she alleges her father was doing to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cI\u2019m not saying she ran away because of drugs. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what the testimony is going to show. But we have the right to get into why she ran away. And it\u2019s not even drug abuse. I don\u2019t think \u2014 I mean, the fact is I\u2019m [sic] not that drugs isn\u2019t going to play \u2014 or prescription drugs aren\u2019t going to play into it, but it\u2019s not being offered to somehow discredit her credibility in all of this because of drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Court: Well, you can ask that question of that witness if it has something to do with that, whether her running away had anything to do with alleged sexual abuse without getting into a drug issue. Because if I allow you to get into or you get into a drug issue, then I\u2019m going to [sic] that seems to me to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>open the door for the allegations in the reports that I know that I have released that there is cocaine use by the Defendant in the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cSo, we\u2019re not going to get into drug issues about who\u2019s using drugs, who\u2019s not using drugs. If you want to get into the issue about the running away, whether that was related to any sexual abuse, you may ask the question that way as a leading question. And if the witness says, no, it was not related to that, then we\u2019re going to leave it as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 40} The admission or exclusion of evidence rests soundly within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. The trial court\u2019s decision concerning the admission or exclusion of evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. Id. at 182, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343. An abuse of discretion \u201cconnotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 41} In the instant case, the decision by the trial court to exclude any testimonial evidence that demonstrated that T.O.\u2019s reason for running away the first time was that she had been caught stealing Xanax from Bell, and not because he allegedly molested her, was error. Since the state seemed to be suggesting she ran away due to molestation, an alternative motive, theft of drugs was relevant. This was admissible evidence, and the court should have permitted a limited inquiry on this subject without opening up the issue of purported drug abuse within the household. However, the cumulative record before us contains clear evidence from which a trier of fact could find Bell guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the numerous sexual assaults he perpetrated on T.O. Thus, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence is harmless error, and we conclude that the admission of such evidence would not have led to a contrary outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 42} Bell\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">{\u00b6 43} Bell\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe trial court erred when it admitted expert evidence regarding behaviors of sexual abuse victims. The erroneous admission of this expert evidence deprived Bell of his right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>{\u00b6 45} In his second assignment, Bell argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed the state to present the testimony of Dr. Joyce Miceli. Dr. Miceli was retained by the state to testify regarding the wide range of behaviors that sexually abused children may exhibit, including internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and sexualized behaviors. It is undisputed that Dr. Miceli did not ultimately opine as to whether T.O. or R.O. had suffered any sexual abuse at the hands of Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 46} Bell asserts that it was improper for the trial court to admit the testimony of Dr. Miceli because her expert testimony was unreliable insofar as children who are victims of sexual abuse exhibit so varied a range of emotions and behaviors that presently no proven and accepted standard exists by which to judge their actions. Additionally, Bell contends that Dr. Miceli\u2019s expert testimony should not have been admitted, because it was unhelpful and confusing to the trier of fact since she testified that sexually abused children may exhibit certain behaviors or have no symptoms at all. In support of his argument, Bell cites Justice Resnick\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>State v. Stowers </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe determination of the admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court. Evid. R. 104(A). Such decisions will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion. * * * \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 suggests unreasonableness, arbitrariness, or unconscionability. Without those elements, it is not the role of this court to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>Valentine v. Conrad, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-3561, 850 N.E.2d 683, \u00b6 9. Thus, we review the instant appeal under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 48} Evid.R. 702 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cA witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is based is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts, or principles;</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>{\u00b6 54} \u201c(2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably implements the theory;</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>Stowers, </em>the majority held that \u201c[a]n expert witness\u2019s testimony that the behavior of an alleged child victim of sexual abuse is consistent with behavior observed in sexually abused children is admissible under the Ohio Rules of Evidence.\u201d Id. 81 Ohio St.3d at 261, 690 N.E.2d at 881. The majority found that through the expert\u2019s psychological training and professional experience, she possessed specialized knowledge of the kind recognized under Evid.R. 702 that the average person lacks about behavioral characteristics of minor victims of sexual abuse. \u201c \u2018Most jurors would not be aware, in their everyday experiences, of how sexually abused children might respond to abuse. Incest is prohibited in all or almost all cultures and the common experience of a juror may represent a less-than-adequate foundation for assessing whether a child has been sexually abused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stowers, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 262, 690 N.E.2d 881, quoting <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 128, 545 N.E.2d 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">(\u00b6 57} Dr. Miceli simply offered her opinions regarding the wide range of behavioral characteristics displayed by minor victims of sexual abuse. The law clearly permits this kind of expert testimony, and Dr. Miceli did not go beyond permissible boundaries and opine whether these children were in fact abused by Bell. A thorough review of Dr. Miceli\u2019s expert testimony establishes that she possessed specialized knowledge that could aid a trier of fact in assessing whether the children actually suffered sexual abuse. Further, Bell incorrectly cites the dissent in <em>Stowers </em>in support of his assertion that Dr. Miceli should not have been allowed to testify. Following the majority holding in <em>Stowers, </em>we find that the sole effect of Dr. Miceli\u2019s testimony was to aid the jury in understanding the behavioral characteristics of minor victims of sexual abuse without opining as to the veracity of R.O. and T.O. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled Bell\u2019s motion in limine and admitted the testimony of Dr. Miceli.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 58} Bell\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 59} Bell\u2019s third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cBell was deprived of his right to due process by the state\u2019s failure to narrow the time frame alleged in one of the counts contained in the indictment, and by the state\u2019s use of identically worded counts in two counts of the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>A. Specificity Regarding Time Frame in Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 61} In his third assignment, Bell contends that he was denied his right to due process when the state failed to narrow the time frame in the second count of the indictment, which alleges that Bell sexually battered T.O. when she was in the seventh grade, on a day when she had a tooth pulled. Bell argues that the state\u2019s failure to specifically identify the date on which this crime allegedly occurred was a violation of his right to adequate notice of the charges against him, and it prejudiced his ability to mount a viable defense. Bell asserts that if he had been provided with specific information regarding the particular date the sexual battery allegedly occurred, he could have corroborated his denial of the charge with other credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 62} As previously noted, counts two through four pertaining to T.O. were originally listed in the indictment as occurring between the dates of January 1, 2001, and January 31, 2004. On March 6, 2007, however, the state moved to amend the time in which those offenses occurred between August 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s motion on March 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 63} Bell provided the following testimony during direct examination with respect to the alleged sexual battery of T.O.:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cMr. Lachman: Do you recall a time when you took [T.O.] to the dentist?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cBell: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cMr. Lachman: Do you recall when that was?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cBell: No, I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cMr. Lachman: If she testified that she was in seventh grade\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cThe State: Objection. He said he didn\u2019t know.'</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe Court: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cMr. Lachman: Was that the only time you took her to the dentist?</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cBell: No. [T.O.] had been to the dentist many times, but this time\u2014 that time \u2014 in other words, the other times she had been to the dentist, me and my wife had taken her.

Mundy </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 275, 650 N.E.2d 502, we affirmed the decision of the trial court to allow the state to amend the indictment and bill of particulars to conform to evidence at the conclusion of the case-in-chief, in a prosecution for gross sexual imposition, by expanding the specified time frames during which the offense was alleged to have occurred. We held that the action taken by the trial court did not constitute an abuse of discretion nor a failure of justice. We also found that the defendant in <em>Mundy </em>failed to demonstrate how the preparation of his defense was hampered or how he was prejudiced by amendment of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-23\">{\u00b6 95} We find the following language from <em>Mundy </em>instructive in the instant case:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 96} \u201cMundy was charged with fourteen separate violations of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). The precise date and time of the offense are not essential elements of that crime. * * *. Thus, a certain degree of inexactitude in averring the date of the offense is not <em>per se </em>impermissible or fatal to the prosecution. * * *. Nevertheless, where an accused requests a bill of particulars, the state must supply specific dates and times for the alleged offense if it possesses that information. * * *. Furthermore, even if the state is unable to supply more specific dates for the offenses because it does not possess such information, the absence of specific dates may yet be fatal to the prosecution if it results in material detriment to the accused\u2019s ability to fairly defend himself, as where the accused asserts an alibi or claims that he was indisputably elsewhere during part, but not all, of the time interval specified. * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cIn many cases involving child sexual abuse, the victims are children of tender years who are simply unable to remember exact dates and times, particularly where the crimes involve a repeated course of conduct over an extended period of time. * * *. Such is the case here. There is no evidence whatsoever that the state knew of any more specific dates for the offenses than those set out in the indictment. The state was simply unable to supply specific dates when these offenses occurred because it did not have that information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 98} The only question remaining is whether the state\u2019s inability to provide more specific dates and times resulted in material detriment to Bell\u2019s ability to defend himself. Bell argues in a conclusory fashion that this is the case, but he fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by the lack <em>of </em>a specific date. Bell testified at trial that he did, in fact, take T.O. to the dentist on the day in question, as well as take her home after the appointment concluded. Bell also testified that he did not go to work that day, but rather remained home -with T.O. while she slept. In short, Bell did not present an alibi defense with respect to the sexual-battery count, but merely denied that any improper sexual conduct occurred on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 99} \u201c \u2018 \u201cA defendant is not prejudiced by the failure of the indictment to specify the dates and times upon which the charged offenses allegedly-occurred if such failure does not impose a material detriment to the preparation of his defense. Where the defendant does not present an alibi defense, where he concedes being alone with the victims of the alleged sex offenses at various times throughout the relevant time frame, and where his defense is that the alleged touchings never happened, the inexactitude of dates or times in the indictment is not prejudicial error.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Owens </em>(Feb. 25, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17394, 2000 WL 217219, quoting <em>State v. Boehm </em>(Dec. 31, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16335, 1997 WL 856285, quoting <em>State v. Barnecut </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 149, 542 N.E.2d 353; paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 100} Bell has not demonstrated that his ability to defend himself was prejudiced by the lack of more specific dates and times when the offense outlined in count one of sexual battery was allegedly committed against T.O. Thus, the lack of a more specific date did not deprive Bell of a fair trial or due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">B. Identically Worded Counts in the Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 101} In the second section of Bell\u2019s third assignment, he contends that the indictment\u2019s containing two identically worded counts of sexual battery violated his right to due process and constituted plain error. Specifically, Bell argues the state\u2019s indictment and conviction of Bell based on identically worded counts of sexual battery failed to accord him adequate notice of the charged offenses and failed to protect him against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 102} The Double Jeopardy Clause is in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cNo person shall * * * be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * *</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 104} It is well established that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense. <em>United States v. Dixon </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556; <em>Ashe v. Swenson </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 436, 445-446, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469. Once a competent tribunal has decided an issue of ultimate fact in a defendant\u2019s favor, the double-jeopardy doctrine also precludes a second jury from ever considering the same or identical issue in a later trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">{\u00b6 105} Bell relies upon <em>Valentine v. Konteh </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 395 F.3d 626, to support his argument that his constitutional due process rights were violated when he was convicted of counts one and two for sexual battery. In <em>Valentine, </em>the defendant was convicted of 20 counts of rape of a child, each of which was identically worded, and of 20 counts of felonious sexual penetration, each of which was also identically worded. The state did not distinguish the factual bases for these charges in the indictment, in the bill of particulars, or at trial. At trial, the victim testified that she was forced to perform fellatio on \u201cabout twenty\u201d occasions, that she was digitally penetrated on \u201cabout fifteen\u201d occasions, and that she was anally penetrated on \u201cabout ten\u201d occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 106} Addressing Valentine\u2019s habeas petition, the Sixth Circuit held that the indictment was constitutionally defective, because the undifferentiated charges failed to give the defendant adequate notice of the charges and did not protect him against double jeopardy. The Sixth Circuit commented that the \u201cproblem in this case is not the fact that the prosecution did not provide the defendant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>exact times and places. If there had been singular counts of each offense, the lack of particularity would not have presented the same problem. Instead, the problem is that within each set of 20 counts, there are absolutely no distinctions made. Valentine was prosecuted for two distinct criminal acts that occurred twenty times each, rather than for forty separate criminal acts. In its charges and in its evidence before the jury, the prosecution did not attempt to lay out the factual bases of forty separate incidents that took place. Instead, the 8-year-old victim described \u2018typical\u2019 abusive behavior by Valentine and then testified that the \u2018typical\u2019 abuse occurred twenty or fifteen times. Outside of the victim\u2019s estimate, no evidence as to the number of incidents was presented.\u201d Id. at 632-633. The court noted that \u201c[t]he due process problems in the indictment might have been cured had the trial court insisted that the prosecution delineate the factual bases for the forty separate incidents either before or during the trial.\u201d Id. at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 107} In the instant case, the record indicates that the state adequately differentiated between the two identically worded counts of sexual battery that involved T.O. such that Bell\u2019s due process rights were not violated nor was he subject to double jeopardy. Bell filed a request for a bill of particulars on January 2, 2007. On January 30, 2007, the state filed a bill of particulars in which it set out a detailed basis for each of the five counts in the indictment. With respect to the two sexual battery counts<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (counts two and three in the original indictment), the bill of particulars stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cCounts 2 and 3</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cThe State will prove that between the dates of January 1, 2001, and January 31, 2004, and in Montgomery County, Ohio, the defendant did engage in sexual conduct with another, who was not his spouse, and the defendant was the parent (step-father) of the victim. This is in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(5), Sexual Battery (Parent), felonies of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cThe victim in Counts 2 and 3 is [T.O.], the step-daughter of the defendant. <em>The sexual conduct includes, but is not limited to, vaginal intercourse and digital penetration of the victim by the defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 111} In its bill of particulars filed prior to trial, the state adequately differentiated between the two sexual battery counts involving T.O., thereby providing Bell with notice of the details of each separate charge. Further, T.O. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>testified during trial that one occasion after she had a tooth pulled at the dentist, Bell got into bed with her and placed his penis inside her vagina. T.O. testified that on other occasions Bell would get into bed with her and digitally penetrate her. Lastly, the record indicates that the state differentiated between the two sexual-battery counts in its closing argument insofar as it asserted that count one was proven by testimony regarding Bell\u2019s penile penetration of T.O., and count two was proven by the testimony regarding Bell\u2019s digital penetration of T.O. Thus, Bell\u2019s constitutional right to due process was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 112} Bell\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 113} Bell\u2019s fourth assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cBell\u2019s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 115} In his fourth assignment, Bell contends that the guilty verdict reached by the jury was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Bell attacks the victims\u2019 credibility and argues that the testimony of T.O. and R.O. contained various inconsistencies and was, therefore, not believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">{\u00b6 116} When a conviction is challenged on appeal as being against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court \u201cmust review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact \u2018clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Adrian, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 300, 2006-Ohio-4143, 859 N.E.2d 1007, at \u00b6 6, quoting <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. Essentially, a reviewing court \u201csits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and makes its own independent review of the evidence and inferences derived therefrom, and assesses and weighs the credibility of each witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d Hagel, Ohio\u2019s Criminal Practice and Procedure (2006-2007) 796, Section 41.207. However, \u201c[b]ecause the factfinder * * * has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, the cautious exercise of the discretionary power of a court of appeals to find that a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence requires that substantial deference be extended to the factfinder\u2019s determinations of credibility. The decision whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses is within the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who has seen and heard the witness. Contrastingly, the decision as to which of several competing inferences, suggested by the evidence in the record, should be preferred, is a matter in which an appellate judge is at least equally qualified, by reason and experience, to venture an opinion.\u201d <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288, 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>WL 476684, at *4. Only in exceptional circumstances should a judgment be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Parker, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18926, 2002-Ohio-3920, 2002 WL 1770497, at \u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 117} In support of his contention that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, Bell argues that neither T.O. nor R.O. offered credible testimony that clearly established that Bell molested either of them. With respect to T.O., Bell asserts that her testimony against him was not worthy of belief because she did not report the abuse for many years, even though she had several opportunities to do so. Further, Bell points out that even after she allegedly had been sexually abused by him for years, T.O. still chose to bring her own child into the home he shared with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 118} Bell argues that R.O.\u2019s testimony against him was equally incredible because R.O. still maintained a relatively close personal relationship with him. R.O. testified that he believed Bell was sexually abusing T.O. because he kept her home from school on various occasions while he sent R.O. and another brother to school. Bell points out that when the abuse of T.O. allegedly occurred between August 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003, R.O. had already dropped out of school and could not have observed the abuse of T.O. that he testified to at trial. Thus, Bell argues that R.O. was unable to corroborate the testimony of T.O. regarding her claims of sexual abuse against Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 119} Finally, Bell, who states that he has no prior criminal record, contends that both he and his wife, Sheila, denied the allegations of sexual abuse of both T.O. and R.O. He also argues that no physical evidence was presented, thus the victims\u2019 claims of sexual abuse were uncorroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 120} This court addressed the issue of witness credibility under similar circumstances in <em>State v. Gardner, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21027, 2006-Ohio-1130, 2006 WL 574305, \u00b6 24-26:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony is a matter for the trier of facts to resolve. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230 [39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212], In <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288 [1997 WL 476684], we observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">{\u00b6 122} \u201c \u2018Because the factfinder * * * has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, the cautious exercise of the discretionary power of a court of appeals to find that a judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence requires that substantial deference be extended to the factfinder\u2019s determinations of credibility.

Bradley </em>(Oct. 24, 1997), Champaign App. No. 97-CA-03 [1997 WL 691510].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 124} In the instant case, the record indicates that the jury did not lose its way in arriving at a guilty verdict on all of the remaining counts in the indictment. The jury chose to believe T.O. and R.O.\u2019s claims of sexual abuse against Bell, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury empaneled in order to determine Bell\u2019s guilt or innocence. Thus, Bell\u2019s convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 125} Bell\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 126} Bell\u2019s fifth and sixth assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s imposition of nonminimum and consecutive prison terms on an offender who had never before served a prison term violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cArthur Russell Bell was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel, in contravention of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">A. Constitutional Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">{\u00b6 129} In his fifth assignment, Bell contends that the trial court erred when it sentenced him to nonminimum, consecutive prison terms in violation of rights as guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution, as well as the United States Constitution. Specifically, Bell argues that the sentence imposed by the trial court pursuant to <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, is unconstitutional because it violates the following rights: (1) his rights under the Due Process or Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States Constitution and (2) his right to a jury trial as protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cHowever, this court recently determined in <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>Champaign App. No. 2006-CA-18, 2007-Ohio-3436, 2007 WL 1934357, that a claim that a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio is unconstitutional is not cognizable in this court. In so holding, we stated: \u2018The appellate jurisdiction of this court permits us to review \u201cjudgments or final orders of court[s] of record inferior to the courts of appeals within the district\u201d as well as \u201corders or actions of administrative officers or agencies.\u201d Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Manifestly, decisions of [t]he Supreme Court of Ohio are outside those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>classifications.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>Clark App. No. 2006-CA-53, 2007-Ohio-3590, 2007 WL 2019671. Thus, we must defer to the authority of the Ohio Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of <em>Foster. </em>Bell\u2019s arguments in this regard are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">B. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 131} In his final assignment, Bell contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to object at the sentencing hearing to any sentence beyond concurrent, minimum sentences on ex post facto and due process grounds. Bell argues that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s omission when the trial court sentenced him to nonminimum, consecutive sentences for an aggregate sentence of ten years. \u201c \u2018When considering an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, a two-step process is usually employed. First, there must be a determination as to whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel\u2019s essential duties to his client. Next, and analytically separate from the question of whether the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated, there must be a determination as to whether the defense was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, citing <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 396-397, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 132} The above standard contains essentially the same requirements as the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. \u201cWhen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. Thus, counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 133} For a defendant to demonstrate that he has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that absent counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 134} Under the <em>Foster </em>mandate, the trial court was not required to make any findings or discuss on the record the reasoning behind the sentence it chose to impose.
