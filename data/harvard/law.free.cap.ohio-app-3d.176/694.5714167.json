Scherer Sr. (\u201cRonald\u201d), defendant-appellant, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, in which the court found him in contempt of court. James M. Wiles, appellant, appeals from a judgment of the same court finding him in direct criminal contempt. This court consolidated the appeals for purposes of briefing and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-17\">{\u00b6 2} According to the complaint filed by Bank One Trust Company, N.A., plaintiff-appellee, since 1979, Bank One was the trustee for a trust agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>formed by Roger L. Scherer (\u201cRoger\u201d). Roger died in 1982. Pursuant to the trust agreement, Bank One was to form three trusts: one for Roger\u2019s son, Ronald; one for Roger\u2019s daughter, Linda Scherer Talbott; and one for Roger\u2019s surviving spouse, Betty J. Scherer. The trusts were granted cash, real estate, and/or interests in Roger\u2019s magazine distribution businesses. After Roger\u2019s death, the companies in the trust continued operating into the mid to late 1990s, when many of the trust companies ceased operations or consolidated. One of these businesses was a publication distributor, United Magazine Company (\u201cUni-mag\u201d). Ronald eventually commenced a lawsuit in New York on behalf of Unimag against another distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">{\u00b6 3} On September 14, 2004, Bank One filed an action for declaratory judgment and final accounting in the Franklin County Probate Court against Ronald, Linda, Betty, and several other defendants (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d), all of whom had interests in the various trusts. On October 4, 2004, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On December 10, 2004, Bank One filed a motion for production of documents. On February 10, 2005, the court denied the motion to dismiss. On April 21, 2005, Bank One filed a motion to compel. On September 30, 2005, the trial court stayed discovery. On December 15, 2005, Bank One filed a motion to compel discovery. On December 20, 2005, the court granted the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 4} On December 22, 2005, the probate court, with regard to the motion to compel, ordered that the failure of defendants to comply with the order by January 13, 2006, would result in a finding of civil contempt of court, and defendants would be charged $250 per day until there was compliance with the discovery requests or the court ordered otherwise. Wiles became counsel for Ronald on December 22, 2005, and subsequently the original trial judge recused himself from the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 5} On April 12, 2006, the trial court ordered Ronald to produce numerous documents. On July 25, 2006, Bank One filed a motion to compel, which the trial court granted on August 30, 2006. On October 2, 2006, the court held a hearing, at which the court ordered a show-cause hearing for October 5, 2006. On January 4, 2007, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, finding that Ronald had willfully disobeyed the court\u2019s discovery orders. In its February 1, 2007 judgment entry, the trial court reduced to judgment the $250 per day for discovery noncompliance, beginning January 13, 2006, and ordered Ronald to pay $74,750 to Bank One as well as $250 per day for each day the judgment remained unpaid. Ronald appeals this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 6} As we discuss in detail below, the court held a hearing on April 12, 2007. At this hearing, an argumentative discourse took place between the trial court and Wiles. The trial court found Wiles in direct criminal contempt of court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>sentenced him to ten days\u2019 incarceration. The trial court journalized the finding in an order issued on April 17, 2007. Wiles appeals this judgment. Wiles also has filed a motion to strike Bank One\u2019s brief, arguing that Bank One has no standing to enforce a summary finding of criminal contempt. In the alternative, Wiles asks us to strike a footnote in Bank One\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">{\u00b6 7} Ronald asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">1. The Trial Court erred in holding Ronald Scherer, Sr. guilty of indirect criminal contempt in the absence of a written charge entered on the journal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">2. The Trial Court erred in finding no reasonable doubt that Ronald Scherer Sr. willfully disobeyed a court order and in finding him guilty of criminal contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 8} Wiles asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">1. The Trial Court abused its discretion in summarily convicting James M. Wiles of direct criminal contempt of court on April 12, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">2. The Trial Court abused its discretion in summarily imposing an excessive and inappropriate jail sentence for the direct criminal contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">{\u00b6 9} Ronald argues in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred when it found him guilty of indirect criminal contempt in the absence of a written charge entered on the journal. Although a trial court\u2019s decision to impose discovery sanctions will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion, <em>Toney v. Berkemer </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 455, 6 OBR 496, 453 N.E.2d 700, Ronald\u2019s first assignment of error involves questions of law, which we review de novo. <em>Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of Real Estate v. DePugh </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 255, 261, 717 N.E.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">{\u00b6 10} Ronald contends that R.C. 2705.03 requires a charge of contempt to be entered on the journal. R.C. 2705.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">In cases under section 2705.02 of the Revised Code, a charge in writing shall be filed with the clerk of the court, an entry thereof made upon the journal, and an opportunity given to the accused to be heard, by himself or counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzO\">R.C. 2705.02(A) provides that a person guilty of disobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful order of a court may be punished as for a contempt. However, we find that the requirements of R.C. 2705.03 do not apply to the circumstances involving Ronald, based on Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d) and our decision in <em>Williams v. Cordle </em>(Feb. 8, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APF08-978, 1996 WL 52894.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">{\u00b6 11} Civ.R. 37(B)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">If any party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under Rule 30(B)(5) or Rule 31(A) to testify on behalf of a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>under subdivision (A) of this rule and Rule 35, the court in which the action is pending may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">(d) In lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Williams, </em>we discussed the relationship between R.C. 2705.03 and Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d). In that case, the mother in a child-support-modification proceeding filed a motion to compel discovery regarding interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The trial court ordered the father to comply with the discovery requests. The mother then filed a motion for contempt based on the father\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order. A magistrate held a hearing on the motion, after which the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the father be found in contempt, pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2), for failing to obey the court\u2019s previous discovery orders and that the father be sentenced to 30 days\u2019 incarceration, with the sentence suspended if the father purged himself of the contempt by providing the mother with the requested discovery by a certain date and paying her attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 13} On appeal, the father in <em>Williams </em>argued that the trial court erred by finding him in contempt pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d) and imposing penalties on him. The father contended that before a trial court could treat noncompliance with a discovery order as a contempt of court pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d), it had to first comply with the procedural safeguards listed in R.C. 2705.03 for contempt proceedings brought under R.C. 2705.02. However, this court rejected the father\u2019s contention, concluding that \u201c[njothing in the language of Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d) indicates a court must comply with the procedural requirements of R.C. 2705.03 before it treats a party\u2019s noncompliance with a discovery order as a contempt of court.\u201d Therefore, we held that the trial court did not err when it found the father in contempt of court without complying with the mandates of R.C. 2705.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">{\u00b6 14} The current case presents the same basic facts. Here, as in <em>Williams, </em>Ronald failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s order to produce requested discovery, and the trial court found Ronald in contempt under its powers to invoke discovery sanctions under Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d), not under R.C. 2705.03. Specifically, the trial court in this case found, \u201cDefendant Ronald E. Scherer, Sr. is hereby held in contempt of court pursuant to Civil Rule 37(B)(2)(d) for his repeated and willful disobedience of the Court\u2019s prior discovery orders.\u201d Based on our prior analysis in <em>Williams, </em>there is no requirement that contempt as a discovery sanction, pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d), comply with the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>of R.C. 2705.03. Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d) makes no mention of R.C. 2705.03, and we can find no authority to support Ronald\u2019s contention that a trial court must comply with R.C. 2705.03 when it is ordering discovery sanctions under the powers granted in Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">{\u00b6 15} Ronald makes several counterarguments. Ronald first contends that the language in R.C. 2705.03 makes its requirements mandatory, pointing to the word \u201cshall.\u201d However, R.C. 2705.03 also indicates that the requirements apply only \u201c[i]n cases under section 2705.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d Here, the trial court did not proceed under the contempt powers granted in R.C. 2705.02 but proceeded under the discovery-sanctioning powers delineated in Civ.R. 37(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 16} Ronald also counters that <em>Williams </em>is factually distinguishable from the present circumstances for two reasons: (1) <em>Williams </em>involved a sanction for civil contempt that could be purged, while this case involves an unconditional fine and (2) the party held in contempt in <em>Williams </em>admitted violating the court order, while Ronald always maintained that he had complied with all discovery orders. Neither of these distinguishing facts has any impact on the crux of our holding in <em>Williams </em>that Civ.R. 37(B)(2) simply fails to give any indication that R.C. 2705.03 must be followed when ordering a discovery sanction specifically pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2) rather than R.C. 2705.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 17} We also note that as part of his argument under his first assignment of error, Ronald asserts that because this case involved a criminal contempt, he was entitled to heightened procedural due process protections, including the type of notice provided by R.C. 2705.03 and timely notice. However, the type of contempt has no bearing on our analysis in <em>Williams </em>and our conclusion that Civ.R. 37(B)(2) does not require compliance with R.C. 2705.03. Ronald\u2019s assignment of error also does not specifically assert that he was not given adequate and timely notice but only asserts that he was entitled to a written charge entered on the journal. For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding Ronald in contempt in the absence of a written charge pursuant to R.C. 2705.03. Accordingly, we overrule Ronald\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 18} Ronald argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred when it found beyond reasonable doubt that he willfully disobeyed a court order and found him guilty of criminal contempt. Contempt may be characterized as either direct or indirect. <em>Sansom v. Sansom, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-645, 2006-Ohio-3909, 2006 WL 2130717, \u00b623, citing <em>Byron v. Byron, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-819, 2004-Ohio-2143, 2004 WL 894600, \u00b6 12. Direct contempt occurs in the presence of the court and obstructs the administration of justice. R.C. 2705.01. Indirect contempt involves behavior that occurs outside the presence of the court and demonstrates a lack of respect for the court or its lawful orders. <em>Byron, </em>citing <em>State v. Drake </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 640, 643, 598 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>N.E.2d 115. Thus, in determining whether the contempt is direct or indirect, we focus on the action of the contemnor. Here, Ronald failed to produce discovery as required by the trial court\u2019s prior order. Ronald\u2019s act occurred outside the presence of the court and therefore must be characterized as indirect contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 19} Courts may further characterize contempt as criminal or civil, depending upon the nature of the contempt sanctions. Criminal contempt imposes sanctions that are punitive in nature and are designed to punish the party for past failures to comply with the court\u2019s order. <em>State ex rel. Corn v. Russo </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 551, 555, 740 N.E.2d 265. Criminal contempt usually involves mandatory incarceration, and the party found to be in contempt usually has no opportunity to avoid the incarceration. <em>Brown v. Executive 200, Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 250, 253, 18 O.O.3d 446, 416 N.E.2d 610. Civil contempt is remedial or coercive in nature and will be imposed to benefit the complainant. <em>Delawder v. Dodson, </em>Lawrence App. No. 02CA27, 2003-Ohio-2092, 2003 WL 1950371, \u00b6 11. Any sanction imposed by the court for civil contempt must provide the contemnor with an opportunity to purge himself or herself of the contempt. Id. at \u00b6 10. Thus, in determining whether the contempt is civil or criminal, we focus on the purpose of the sanction, i.e., whether the purpose is punitive or remedial.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 20} Here, the trial court indicated in its findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">The $250 daily fine set forth in Judge Belskis\u2019 December 22, 2005 Entry for Defendants\u2019 discovery noncompliance is hereby reduced to Judgment in favor of the Trustee and against Defendant Ronald E. Scherer, Sr. in the amount of $74,750 plus an additional $250 for each day the Judgment remains unpaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 21} Ronald characterizes the contempt as criminal because it was an unconditional punishment for past misconduct; it had no remedial or coercive purposes, given that it was not conditioned on the production of any documents; the trial court gave him no opportunity to purge; and the court used the standards of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cwillfulness,\u201d which are necessary only for criminal-contempt findings. However, Bank One characterizes the contempt as civil because the court\u2019s judgment simply reduced to judgment the prior $250 per day civil-contempt fine that had been previously imposed on December 22, 2005, for Ronald\u2019s discovery noncompliance; the punishment was remedial and coercive; the punishment was for Bank One\u2019s benefit; the contempt judgment indicated that it was entered pursuant to Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d), which is a civil, not criminal, rule; Ronald\u2019s repeated discovery violations harmed Bank One; and the court entered the fine \u201cin favor of\u2019 Bank One as compensation for its resulting losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Both parties raise credible arguments. However, the trial court\u2019s order clearly incorporates the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cwillfulness\u201d standards, which are only applicable to criminal contempts. Further, the trial court did not give Ronald any opportunity to purge the lump-sum portion of the contempt penalty, an opportunity required when imposing a civil-contempt sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 23} Nevertheless, it is not necessary for this court to determine conclusively whether the contempt was civil or criminal. While Civ.R. 37 is a civil rule, the sanctions under Civ.R. 37(B), in general, appear to be punitive. Civ.R. 37(B)(2)(d) does not speak to either civil or criminal sanctions. While most direct contempts will be punished with a criminal sanction and most indirect contempts with a civil sanction, this is not always true. As we stated previously, in the civil/criminal distinction, the focus is on whether the purpose of the sanction is punitive or remedial. In the situation before us, while the trial court\u2019s judgment is not entirely clear, the purpose appears to be punitive. Again, when used in the context of Civ.R. 37, where the sanctions under Civ.R. 37(B) are generally punitive, such a sanction for contempt would not be an abuse of discretion. As indicated above, a trial court\u2019s decision to impose discovery sanctions will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Toney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 24} Ronald\u2019s main argument is that Bank One\u2019s original discovery request was enormously vast, encompassing over 40 different categories of documents, records from the past 20 years, and records from 12 different corporations. Ronald argues that he testified on October 5, 2006, that he spent \u201ca lot\u201d of time looking for the documents, defendants produced 8,507 documents, and Ken Dean, an accountant for some of the interested companies, averred that there were extraordinary attempts to locate documents, all of which demonstrate Ronald\u2019s attempt to comply with the court orders. Ronald also claims that the information sought by Bank One was included in the documents already provided, but Bank One refused to examine those documents. Specifically, Ronald asserts that an accountant could have examined the general ledgers to provide information as to assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 25} We find Ronald\u2019s contentions unavailing. In its decision, the trial court explained in great detail Ronald\u2019s discovery failings, which Ronald does not contest in any specific manner. Specifically, the trial court set forth the following findings to support its judgment. On December 10, 2004, Bank One served Ronald with a request for production of documents. Bank One filed motions to compel discovery in April and December 2005. On December 20, 2005, the trial court found that Ronald had failed to comply with the discovery requests and ordered him to comply immediately with the requests. On December 22, 2005, the trial court set a deadline of January 13, 2006, for Ronald\u2019s compliance with Bank One\u2019s discovery requests; failure to comply would result in a $250 per day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>fine. On March 17, 2006, the court admonished Ronald at a status conference for his continued failure to comply with the prior two discovery orders and ordered Bank One to prepare an entry setting forth the specific categories of documents that Ronald had failed to produce. On April 4, 2006, Ronald filed objections to the proposed Bank One entry, asserting that he would not produce documents from the Unimag lawsuit because Bank One could get these public records online. The court found that Ronald misrepresented that the documents were publicly available, as some of the most critical documents were placed in sealed envelopes and designated as confidential. In April 2006, the court found Ronald had still faded to comply with all of Bank One\u2019s discovery requests, but it gave him yet another chance to produce the documents by April 27, 2006. The trial court explicitly identified the categories of documents Ronald was required to produce. On April 25, 2006, Bank One filed a second request for production of documents and first set of interrogatories. When Ronald failed to provide Bank One with the requested discovery, Bank One had to file another motion to compel, which the trial court granted on August 31, 2006. In its entry, the trial court found that Ronald was \u201cblatantly flouting\u201d the discovery process and was acting in bad faith by failing to make a good-faith effort to answer any of the 46 interrogatories propounded upon him. The court found that Ronald\u2019s responses were thinly veiled efforts to avoid providing any information and were designed to frustrate the discovery process. The court ordered Ronald to comply with Bank One\u2019s discovery requests by September 21, 2006, and scheduled a hearing for October 2, 2006. The court found that despite the prior four orders, Ronald failed to provide the following three categories of documents that had been requested since December 2004: (1) documents relating to transfers of over $3 million of assets from trust-owned companies, (2) documents relating to missing rents for trust-owned real estate, and (3) documents from the Unimag lawsuit. The court then endeavored to explicitly list the types of documents from each of these categories and cited Ronald\u2019s testimony from the show-cause hearing to support its finding that these documents either should have still been in existence or were improperly destroyed by Ronald in contemplation of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 26} Ronald\u2019s arguments under his second assignment of error are general and broad. He initially contends that the fact that he produced over 8,500 documents demonstrates his good-faith efforts to comply with the court\u2019s orders. Although it is not disputed that defendants produced thousands of documents, Ronald\u2019s production of those documents has no impact on his failure to satisfy other outstanding requests. The trial court cited specific types of documents that Ronald repeatedly refused to provide, and these documents may well have contained damaging evidence while the produced documents were harmless, rendering meaningless any good-faith claim by Ronald based upon his partial compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Further, although Ronald complains that the requests for documents covered 12 different corporations from 1996 to 2004, the trial court noted that the underlying documents for the vast majority of the transactions at issue would have necessarily been created in the few years prior to Bank One\u2019s declaratory-judgment action and should still be in existence. Ronald also does not address the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he wrongfully destroyed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">{\u00b6 28} In addition, the trial court predicated its contempt finding in part on Ronald\u2019s misrepresentation that all of the pleadings from the Unimag lawsuit were public record and available online, when many documents were actually sealed and deemed confidential. Ronald admitted at the show-cause hearing that he failed to produce perhaps \u201cthousands\u201d of documents from the Unimag lawsuit that were readily available in Ronald\u2019s office building.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 29} Also, Ronald\u2019s argument that the information sought by Bank One was available by examining documents already produced does not in any way relieve him of his responsibility to comply with Bank One\u2019s requests. Ronald cites no authority for the proposition that a party need not produce documents pursuant to a valid request when the party believes the information sought in the request is contained in other documents already produced. In short, Bank One properly requested certain documents, and Ronald was legally bound to provide them regardless of his own opinion that Bank One could locate the same information by compiling the information gleaned from other documents. Therefore, while the sanction is harsh, we find that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Ronald willfully disobeyed the court\u2019s four discovery orders and its imposition of a punitive sanction. Accordingly, we overrule Ronald\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 30} Turning to Wiles\u2019s appeal, as an initial matter, we consider Wiles\u2019s motion to strike Bank One\u2019s brief. In support, Wiles argues that Bank One lacks standing to participate in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 31} The issues on appeal relate to the trial court\u2019s finding of direct criminal contempt against Wiles. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201ccontempt is essentially a matter between the court and the person who disobeys a court order or interferes with court processes.\u201d <em>Denovchek v. Bd. of Trumbull Cty. Commrs. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 14, 17, 520 N.E.2d 1362. As such, as Wiles asserts, \u201cthere is no right of appeal from the dismissal of a contempt motion when the party making the motion is not prejudiced by the dismissal.\u201d Id. at 14, 520 N.E.2d 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 32} The issue before us is different, however. Here, Bank One does not seek to invoke the jurisdiction of this court in order to review the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt. Rather, it seeks only to file a brief in support of that finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>and to participate in the appeal. Whether we consider Bank One as a party in the contempt appeal or just a party in the underlying matter, we find their participation helpful. Nevertheless, we agree with Wiles that footnote 1 on page 9 of Bank One\u2019s brief attempts to present matters not part of the trial court record. Therefore, we deny Wiles\u2019s motion to strike Bank One\u2019s brief but grant Wiles\u2019s alternative request to strike footnote 1 from that brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 33} In his first assignment of error, Wiles argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it summarily convicted him of direct criminal contempt of court. The April 12, 2007 hearing was a show-cause hearing on Bank One\u2019s motions for contempt against two of Ronald\u2019s witnesses. Before the court could hear argument on the motions, Wiles interrupted. He asked if all future depositions could occur before a magistrate. He also questioned the purpose of the hearing because the two witnesses were present at the hearing and available for deposition. The following dialogue then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">THE COURT: Mr. Wiles, please sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">MR. WILES: Mr. Dean and Mr. Thompson are in the courtroom today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">THE COURT: Mr. Wiles, please sit down. You just demonstrated why we are here today, because we can\u2019t accomplish anything in this case without your interruptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">Now there is a motion. The motion was set today. I called the motion. And it is inappropriate for you to stand up and tell me what to do before I hear the motion. But what you just did demonstrates why we are here, and that is relatively simple. We cannot accomplish anything in this case without your inappropriate interruption, interference, and attempt to control everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">Now I am going to conduct this hearing. You are not. Is that clear, Mr. Wiles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">MR. WILES: Whatever you say, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">{\u00b6 34} At that point, Bank One\u2019s counsel described at length his difficulty in conducting discovery. The motions before the court included motions for contempt and writs of attachment against two witnesses for their failure to honor subpoenas. Bank One\u2019s counsel described extensive efforts to depose the witnesses, including the court\u2019s prior involvement and instructions for the witnesses to appear. Counsel also described \u201cthe constant improper objections and interruptions and personal attacks on me and my partner that have happened this week.\u201d Counsel read portions of deposition transcripts, which recorded Wiles\u2019s frequent interruptions and instructions to the witnesses not to answer questions. Bank One\u2019s counsel presented three alternative remedies to address the discovery difficulties. He ultimately recommended that the court find the witnesses in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>contempt but asked the court to hold any final remedy in abeyance until after the court had ruled on other discovery-related matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court then gave Wiles an opportunity to respond but interrupted when Wiles suggested that they had been trying to work out the discovery-related issues. The court stated that it was \u201cnot willing to sit here and listen to how you have bent over backwards to cooperate with everybody in the last three years.\u201d Wiles pointed out the scheduling difficulties for the two witnesses and their lack of availability. Bank One\u2019s counsel responded briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 36} The transcript then reflects 11 full pages of uninterrupted comments from the trial court. These comments consist primarily of harsh criticism of Wiles\u2019s behavior over the course of the entire case. The court\u2019s criticism included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">In 32 years as a lawyer and 20 years as a judge, I have never seen less cooperation. It is just absolutely absurd. Mr. Wiles\u2019 conduct throughout has been reprehensible, inexcusable and contemptible. He has demonstrated clearly no regard for the law, no regard for the Court, and very little for his own clients. That is a sad, sad scenario.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">In my view, Mr. Wiles has conducted himself in no way like an officer of this court. And frankly, he has demonstrated himself to be worthy of no veracity, deserves no belief from this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">* =i= <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">Again, in 32 years of practicing law, I have never seen depositions so abused, their purposes frustrated as in Mr. Wiles\u2019 case. And I can only conclude because of his continuing, flagrant efforts that it is intentional. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">{\u00b6 37} The court characterized Wiles\u2019s behavior as \u201ca disgrace,\u201d \u201cunprofessional,\u201d and \u201crude.\u201d The court did not hold the two witnesses in contempt because the court believed that they were acting \u201cat the direction of either Mr. [Ronald] Scherer or Mr. Wiles or both.\u201d However, the court excluded their testimony on certain issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">{\u00b6 38} The court then raised the issue of Linda Scherer\u2019s testimony. The court restated its concern that Linda and Ronald have competing interests and that Wiles should not be representing both of them. At this point, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-14\">THE COURT: And she is sitting at that deposition represented by Ron Scherer\u2019s attorney. Is it your concept, Mr. Wiles, that that is appropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa8\">MR. WILES: Yes, it is, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-15\">THE COURT: Why is it? Will you explain that to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>MR. WILES: I am not in a position to explain anything to you at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmW\">THE COURT: What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">MR. WILES: Just what I said. I did everything that was appropriate. I don\u2019t think that I have any obligation to go any further, especially after the way I have just been berated. And I apologize, Your Honor, but that is all you are going to hear from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">THE COURT: So you\u2019re saying to me you are not going to respond; is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANl\">MR. WILES: I think that is what I just said to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">THE COURT: Mr. Scherer \u2014 or Mr. Wiles, will you stand up, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">MR. WILES: I am standing up, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">THE COURT: How long have you been a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">MR. WILES: Considerably longer than you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">THE COURT: Is that right? Well, you know, Mr. Wiles, I have tried to be good to you, and it didn\u2019t work. And throughout this case you continue to say inappropriate things to me, like you just did, \u201cand considerably longer than I.\u201d And I don\u2019t think so. I think you got out of Ohio Northern about 1970 and I got out in \u201974. And to that extent I will agree with you; but I think I know what is a conflict of interest and not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">But you have demonstrated a total contempt for this Court, contempt for the law, and disregard for your clients. You have continued to say things like you have just said to me. I find you in criminal contempt of this Court, and I want a deputy in here. I will remand you to the custody of the Franklin County jail. I have had enough snotty remarks out of you, and I am not going to be hearing any more. Deputy, take him into custody. I find him in direct contempt and I sentence him to ten days in the Franklin County jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">{\u00b6 39} As we explained previously, direct contempt occurs in the presence of the court and obstructs the administration of justice. R.C. 2705.01. Further, criminal contempt imposes sanctions that are punitive in nature. <em>Corn, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 555, 740 N.E.2d 265. R.C. 2705.01 provides that a court may summarily punish a contemnor for direct contempt, and due process does not require that the court grant the contemnor a hearing. <em>In re Purola </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 306, 312, 596 N.E.2d 1140. The determination of the character of conduct that constitutes direct contempt of court is within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion; thus, absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s contempt determination. <em>Vanguard Transp. Sys., Inc. v. Edwards Transfer &amp; Storage Co., Gen. Commodities Div. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 786, 790, 673 N.E.2d 182. Because the purpose of contempt proceedings is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts, great deference is given to the judgment of the trial judge. <em>Denovchek, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 15, 520 N.E.2d 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>{\u00b6 40} While a finding of contempt is within the discretion of the court, to sustain a conviction of criminal contempt the elements of the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Broum. </em>The elements include intent to defy the court and conduct that poses an imminent threat to the administration of justice. <em>Catholic Social Serv. of Cuyahoga Cty. v. Howard </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 615, 666 N.E.2d 658. To justify a finding of summary contempt and imposition of summary sanction, the contumacious act must pose a threat that requires immediate sanction to preserve the dignity and very functioning of the court. <em>Cincinnati v. Cincinnati Dist. Council 51 </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 197, 64 O.O.2d 129, 299 N.E.2d 686 (Brown, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 41} Applying these principles here, while Wiles focuses on the dialogue that occurred immediately prior to the court\u2019s finding of contempt, consideration of the entire April 12, 2007 transcript is instructive. The full transcript shows that Wiles interrupted and attempted to sidetrack the hearing from the beginning, a tactic that drew words of caution from the court. It also shows that the court\u2019s frustration with Wiles preceded the hearing. While Wiles\u2019s conduct at the hearing itself undoubtedly made matters worse, in the context of direct criminal contempt, where punishment is imposed summarily, we must ensure that the trial court\u2019s direct-contempt finding relates to conduct that required immediate response. <em>In re Wingrove, </em>Washington App. No. 02CA4, 2003-Ohio-549, 2003 WL 246079, citing <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 257, 275, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 42} To be fair to Wiles, the court\u2019s prolonged criticism was very direct and extremely harsh. It would have left any lawyer reluctant to speak. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s diatribe justified Wiles\u2019s refusal to answer questions concerning his representation of Ronald and Linda Scherer or his disrespectful comments to the court. As the Supreme Court of Ohio stated in <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 312, 314-315, 59 O.O.2d 379, 285 N.E.2d 38:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">The integrity of the judicial process demands total deference to the court, particularly on the part of its officers. Respect for the law and obedience to the orders and judgments of the tribunals by which it is enforced lies at the very foundation of our society. No amount of provocation on the part of the judge can be permitted to excuse counsel from the obligation of his oath of office (\u201cI will maintain the respect due to courts of justice and judicial officers\u201d); to excuse him from his duties imposed by the Code of Professional Responsibility; or to condone the acts of counsel if in fact they are in themselves contemptuous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 43} Here, Wiles showed no deference to the trial court. From the beginning of the hearing, he sought to obstruct the proceeding. While undoubtedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>offended by the court\u2019s criticisms, Wiles still had a duty to answer the court\u2019s questions, particularly given the importance of the issues raised. And his \u201c[considerably longer than you\u201d remark was simply inappropriate. For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding Wiles in direct criminal contempt. Accordingly, we overrule Wiles\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 44} In his second assignment of error, Wiles asserts that the court erred by imposing punishment summarily and that the ten-day jail sentence was excessive. On the former issue, we conclude that the court did not err by imposing punishment summarily. Ohio courts have held that a finding of direct criminal contempt does not necessarily justify the imposition of punishment summarily. Instead, a court must use its power of summary contempt cautiously and should restrict that power \u201cto activity that threatens the integrity or the very functioning of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Cincinnati, </em>35 Ohio St.2d at 213, 64 O.O.2d 129, 299 N.E.2d 686 (Brown, J., dissenting). In other words, there must exist an immediate threat that requires immediate correction. See <em>In re LoDico, </em>Stark App. No. 2003-CA-00446, 2005-Ohio-172, 2005 WL 100953, \u00b6 41-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 45} Here, Wiles argues that there was no need for summary punishment. In his view, his \u201cinnocuous statements\u201d did not obstruct the hearing because the hearing had already concluded, he provided a partial response to the court\u2019s questions, and the remarks were not \u201cmade in a disrespectful or obstreperous manner.\u201d We disagree with Wiles\u2019s characterization of the remarks and the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 46} Wiles\u2019s interruptions began at the beginning of the proceedings, so they were not limited to the end of the hearing. In any event, while the trial court had made its contempt finding concerning the two witnesses at issue by the time Wiles refused to answer and made his disrespectful remarks, the court had not concluded the hearing, nor had the parties resolved the issues before it. There was lengthy discussion of the other discovery-related difficulties still at issue, including Wiles\u2019s representation of both Ronald and Linda Scherer. It was appropriate for the court to engage Wiles in a discussion about that representation at that time, and Wiles\u2019s refusal to discuss the matter completely obstructed the court\u2019s ability to understand and resolve it. Therefore, we conclude that the court did not err by imposing punishment summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 47} However, we agree with Wiles that the ten-day jail sentence was excessive. While R.C. Chapter 2705 does not limit a court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence for direct contempt, Ohio courts have found that \u201cthe punishment issued must be reasonable and in proportion to contemptuous act.\u201d <em>Warren v. Satterlee, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2005-T-0010, 2006-Ohio-1460, 2006 WL 763125, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. King, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80958, 2002-Ohio-7228, 2002 WL 31875966, \u00b6 12, and <em>State v. Sindell </em>(Apr. 4, 1979), Lorain App. No. 2745, 1979 WL 207604. An appellate court will not reverse the punishment imposed by the trial court in a direct contempt absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Kilbane </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 201, 207, 15 O.O.3d 221, 400 N.E.2d 386; <em>Satterlee </em>at \u00b6 21, citing <em>King </em>at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>Wilson, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed an appellate court\u2019s holding that affirmed the trial court\u2019s imposition of direct criminal contempt and reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of a three-day sentence. In <em>Satterlee, </em>the Eleventh District Court of Appeals affirmed a finding of direct criminal contempt but reversed the three-day sentence imposed. In <em>In re Gilbert </em>(Dec. 16, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 64299, 1993 WL 526788, the Eighth District reduced a punishment of five days and $1,000 to $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 49} Under the facts at issue here, we conclude that the ten-day sentence is unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. While we have concluded that Wiles\u2019s conduct was contemptuous, ten days in jail is not in proportion to that conduct or its effect on the proceedings. Therefore, we sustain Wiles\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 50} In conclusion, in case No. 07AP-186, we overrule Ronald\u2019s first and second assignments of error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 51} In case No. 07AP-350, we deny Wiles\u2019s motion to strike Bank One\u2019s brief, except that we strike footnote 1 on page 9 from that brief, we overrule Wiles\u2019s first assignment of error, and we sustain his second assignment of error. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division. Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a ten-day jail sentence was an abuse of discretion, we remand this matter to the court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">Judgment affirmed in case No. 07AP-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Motion to strike brief denied and motion to strike footnote granted in case No. 07AP-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded in case No. 07AP-350.</p>\n<judges id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Deshler, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b751-5\">Brown, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b751-6\">Deshler, J., retired, of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b751-7\">Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aop\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 52} Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of Wiles\u2019s first assignment of error, I must respectfully dissent on that issue only. Wiles argues in his first assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion when it summarily found him in direct criminal contempt of court on April 12, 2007. As explained above, direct contempt occurs in the presence of the court and obstructs the administration of justice. R.C. 2705.01. Further, criminal contempt imposes sanctions that are punitive in nature. <em>State ex rel. Corn v. Russo </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 551, 555, 740 N.E.2d 265. R.C. 2705.01 provides that a court may summarily punish a contemnor for direct contempt, and due process does not require that the court grant the contemnor a hearing. <em>In re Purola </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 306, 312, 596 N.E.2d 1140. The determination of the character of conduct that constitutes direct contempt of court is within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion; thus, absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s contempt determination. <em>Vanguard Transp. Sys., Inc. v. Edwards Transfer &amp; Storage Co., Gen. Commodities Div. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 786, 790, 673 N.E.2d 182. Because the purpose of contempt proceedings is to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts, great deference is given to the judgment of the trial judge. <em>Denovchek v. Bd. of Trumbull Cty. Commrs. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 14, 15, 520 N.E.2d 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 53} While a finding of contempt is within the discretion of the court, to sustain a conviction of criminal contempt the elements of the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brown v. Executive 200, Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 250,18 O.O.3d 446, 416 N.E.2d 610. The elements include an intent to defy the court and conduct that poses an imminent threat to the administration of justice. <em>Catholic Social Serv. of Cuyahoga Cty. v. Howard </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 615, 666 N.E.2d 658. To justify a finding of summary contempt and imposition of summary sanction, the contumacious act must pose a threat that requires immediate sanction to preserve the dignity and very functioning of the court. <em>Cincinnati v. Cincinnati Dist. Council 51 </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 197, 64 O.O.2d 129, 299 N.E.2d 686 (Brown, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">{\u00b6 54} After reviewing the transcript of the proceedings in question, and after considering the other surrounding circumstances, I must depart from the majority\u2019s analysis and conclude that the actions in the case at bar do not rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>level necessary for a criminal-contempt finding. There was no serious threat to orderly proceedings when the trial court found Wiles in contempt. It is true that Wiles refused to explain to the court why he believed his representation of Linda and Ronald was not a conflict of interest; however, Wiles\u2019s obstinacy did not pose an imminent threat to the administration of justice. Because the purpose of the hearing was not related to the conflict of interest, and the hearing on the scheduled matters had already concluded, the progress of the hearing was not in jeopardy. See <em>State v. Conliff </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 185, 189,15 O.O.3d 309, 401 N. E.2d 469 (insulting remarks during a trial may well give rise to a summary conviction of direct contempt, but remarks occurring at the end of the proceedings are less likely to immediately imperil the further progress of the proceedings). There was little threat to the overall administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 55} Further, Wiles\u2019s comments, while disrespectful, did not pose such a threat that immediate sanction was required to preserve the dignity and functioning of the court. A court must be careful to guard against confusing actions or words that are contemptuous to the judge\u2019s personal feelings or sensibilities and actions or words that constitute punishable, criminal contempt of a summary nature because of posing an actual or imminent threat to the administration of justice. Id. at 189, 15 O.O.3d 309, 401 N.E.2d 469. The context, as can be best gleaned from the transcript here, does not suggest that Wiles made the statements in a loud or boisterous manner. Wiles\u2019s responses were also not outbursts that disrupted the proceedings but, rather, occurred in the course of conversation. To be sure, I do not condone Wiles\u2019s actions, and I can sympathize with the trial court\u2019s frustration when viewing Wiles\u2019s comments in conjunction with what the trial court viewed as Wiles\u2019s history of \u201csnotty\u201d remarks, stonewalling, and delay tactics. Indeed, as noted by the majority, the circumstances surrounding the offensive statements before a court are relevant in determining whether conduct was of such a nature as to amount to criminal contempt. Id. at 190, 15 O. 0.3d 309, 401 N.E.2d 469. However, even when considering the surrounding circumstances, I cannot conclude that Wiles\u2019s remarks at the hearing impeded, embarrassed, or obstructed the court in the performance of its present functions. See <em>In re Green </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 269, 15 O.O.2d 449, 175 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus (insolent and personally insulting remarks to the judge were not of a nature that tended to impede, embarrass, or obstruct the court in the performance of its functions).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 56} In addition, this court has before suggested that despite no requirement that a trial judge issue a warning that a contempt finding is imminent, such notice may be effective to cause an obstreperous attorney to either temper his remarks or acquiesce to the court\u2019s directive. See <em>Camburn v. Camburn, </em>Franklin App. No. 05AP-152, 2005-Ohio-6502, 2005 WL 3317349, at \u00b6 19. As we made clear in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Camburn, </em>I do not mean to question the trial court\u2019s concern for placing a high premium on the importance of maintaining civility and good order in the courtroom. Indeed, I concur that Wiles\u2019s comments were discourteous; however, the standard for criminal contempt focuses less on the level of offensiveness of the acts or words and more on the effect of those acts or words on the administration of justice. Finding that Wiles\u2019s remarks did not have the deleterious effect on the administration of justice required of a criminal contempt finding, I believe the court\u2019s contempt finding was in error. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, I would sustain Wiles\u2019s first assignment of error and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in this respect. Given my resolution of Wiles\u2019s first assignment of error, Wiles\u2019s second assignment of error would be moot. Therefore, I respectfully dissent, in part, from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
