Celebrezze Jr., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">(\u00b6 1} Appellant, Patrick J. Scott, brings this administrative appeal, which challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling to uphold the decision of the Civil Service Commission that terminated him from his position with appellee, city of Cleveland, Division of Water (\u201cthe city\u201d). After a thorough review of the record and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 2} On May 18, 2005, Scott was terminated by the city from his position as a Water Plant Operator I. At a predisciplinary hearing held on May 16, 2005, the city determined that Scott was insubordinate for refusing to appear for a random drug test, as required by his \u201clast chance agreement\u201d with the city. Following the predisciplinary hearing, the city sent Scott a letter notifying him of the grounds for his termination. The letter specifically stated that Scott was being terminated for \u201cbeing in violation of the Rules of Civil Service 9.10 and the City of Cleveland\u2019s Drug-free Workplace Policy.\u201d The letter provided the underlying facts in support of the violations, including the following: Scott did not appear on May 11 for drug testing, he did not appear for testing on two other occasions available to him before May 13, and he refused to appear for testing on his scheduled day off. Finally, the letter noted that because Scott was subject to a last-chance agreement, any refusal to take a random drug test would result in his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 3} On September 28, 2005, an administrative referee\u2019s hearing was held by the city\u2019s civil service commission. Both Scott and the city had an opportunity to present witnesses, cross-examine opposing witnesses, present documentary evidence, and submit posthearing briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">{\u00b6 4} The referee upheld Scott\u2019s termination, finding, \u201cIt was undisputed that [Scott] refused to appear for a drug test that he was instructed to take on May 13, 2005 [which] violated] the terms of the Last Chance Agreement and, by the terms of that agreement, [constituted] just cause for termination of employment\u201d and \u201c[Termination should be sustained.\u201d The referee did not find that Scott had violated the city\u2019s drug-free workplace policy or that he had violated the order to appear on May 11 for testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to Rule 9.60 of the Civil Service Commission, City of Cleveland, Scott exercised his right to appeal the referee\u2019s decision to the full commission. On May 24, 2006, the commission held a hearing at which both parties called witnesses, presented documents, and made arguments. The commission took the appeal under advisement and decided to uphold the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">{\u00b6 6} On April 11, 2006, Scott filed an appeal of the commission\u2019s decision in the common pleas court. On March 15, 2007, the trial court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision. In its journal entry, the trial court issued the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cHaving reviewed the entire certified record, the court affirms the decision of City of Cleveland\u2019s Civil Service Commission. The court holds that the decision of the Commission [was] not unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. Moreover, the court finds that there was no due process violation, as appellant was given sufficient notice of the charges and evidence against him. In addition, appellant had opportunities to prepare a defense in his behalf. See e.g., <em>Robinson v. Springfield Local Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 38, 759 N.E.2d 444. This makes the case distinguishable from that of <em>Clipps v. City of Cleveland, </em>[Cuyahoga App. No. 86887,] 2006-Ohio-3154 [2006 WL 1705130], wherein the appellant was unaware that other incidents were being considered as grounds for demotion. Again, the court notes that appellant had the opportunity to present his side of the story. For the foregoing reasons, the commission\u2019s decision is affirmed and appellant\u2019s appeal is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">{\u00b6 8} On April 12, 2007, Scott appealed the trial court\u2019s decision, which is the matter before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 9} Scott was employed by the city\u2019s Division of Water for 16 years. After testing positive for marijuana use in July 2004, Scott and the city executed a last-chance agreement on November 5, 2004, that required Scott to submit to random drug testing. Specifically, the agreement states that Scott \u201cagrees to submit to periodic, random drug, alcohol, or drug and alcohol tests, conducted by the employer at any time within the next twenty-four (24) months following this agreement.\u201d It further states that Scott \u201cacknowledges and understands that he shall be immediately discharged for refusing to submit to a drug, alcohol or drug and alcohol test.\u201d The agreement allows that in the event of a violation of one of these conditions, Scott will be immediately scheduled for a predisciplinary hearing to determine whether the violation occurred and, if so determined, Scott will be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Prior to the incident leading to his termination in May 2005, Scott had reported for six random drug tests, all of which tested negative for drug use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">{\u00b6 11} On May 10, 2005, Tim Mullen, the assistant plant manager for the city\u2019s Division of Water, informed Scott that he was ordered to report for a predisciplinary hearing on an unrelated matter and for a random drug test the following day before his work shift began. Specifically, Mullen told Scott to report at 3:30 p.m. on May 11, knowing that Scott\u2019s shift on that day began at 5:30 p.m. Due to an apparent miscommunication between the two men, Scott believed the hearing had been canceled; therefore, he believed the drug test had also been canceled. According to Mullen, Scott arrived at work at 5:20 p.m., which made it impossible for the hearing to go forward; thus, Scott failed to report for the ordered drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 12} Consequently, Mullen called Scott at his home on Thursday, May 12, and told him he was required to report for drug testing the following day, May 13. Scott advised Mullen that he was not scheduled to work that day; therefore, he would not report for the drug test. Scott maintains that under the last-chance agreement, when he was called to report for a random drug test, he was only required to report on his next scheduled work day and never on his day off. He refers specifically to an e-mail communication dated May 9, 2005, from Marquita James that referred to last-chance-agreement drug testing, for which he was scheduled the week of May 9 through May 13. The communication reads: \u201cIf the employee is not on duty, the employee should report to Lutheran on his/her next scheduled workday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 13} A predisciplinary conference was held on May 16; the hearing was attended by Scott, Local 18S Steward Damon Schultz, plant manager Richard Papp, assistant plant manager Tim Stephens, and civil service representative Kevin Prendergast.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 14} By letter dated May 18, 2005,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Scott was terminated from his position with the Division of Water. The letter stated that he was being discharged \u201cfor being in violation of the Rules of Civil Service 9.10 and the City of Cleveland\u2019s Drug-free Workplace Policy, as well as for failing to meet the requirements of [his] last chance agreement.\u201d The letter also provided the details that supported the city\u2019s determination that Scott had violated city policy, including his failure to report early for his shift on May 11 in order to be drug tested and his failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>appear on two other occasions to complete drug testing. Finally, the letter stated that if Scott \u201cwished to appeal this decision, [he] may do so by contacting Local 18S, so that [his] appeal can be processed through the grievance procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">{\u00b6 15} Scott exercised his right to appeal the city\u2019s decision under R.C. 4117.03(A)(5),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he was granted a referee\u2019s hearing on September 28, 2005. The referee issued his findings of facts and conclusions of law on or before November 7, 2005. In his factual findings, the referee found that the city had failed \u201cto establish by a preponderance of the evidence that [Scott] refused to report for a random drug test on May 11, 2005,\u201d and that instead his \u201cfailure to appear for a drug test on May 11 was the result of a failure of communication.\u201d The referee further found that \u201c[i]t was not disputed that [Scott] expressly refused to report for a drug test on May 13, 2005,\u201d his scheduled day off. He found that \u201c[Scott] failed to report for the drug test on May 13, 2005, as instructed.\u201d Finally, the referee found that although at the time he was instructed to report on May 13, Scott had worked only 24 hours that week, and had he reported for the drug test early on May 11 or on his day off, May 13, the city would have paid him overtime according to city practice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 16} In his conclusions of law, the referee acknowledged that the charter requirements regarding overtime were not identical to the provisions in the collective-bargaining agreement. The referee held that on May 13, Scott was lawfully required to report for drug testing under the terms of his last-chance agreement and that Scott\u2019s argument regarding overtime hours did not have merit. Thus, the referee sustained Scott\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 17} The city then sent a letter to Scott dated November 10, 2005, which set forth the referee\u2019s decision and also stated that \u201c[a]ccording to Civil Service Rule 9.60, you may appeal your termination to the Civil Service Commission within ten days from the date of this letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 18} On March 24, 2006, a hearing was held before the commission on Scott\u2019s appeal. The commission heard witnesses, reviewed documents, and listened to arguments by counsel for the city and Scott, after which it denied Scott\u2019s appeal of his termination from the Division of Water.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Scott filed a timely appeal of the commission\u2019s decision in the common pleas court. The city filed a motion to dismiss, asserting lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. This motion was denied by the trial court\u2019s journal entry dated June 9, 2006. On March 15, 2007, the trial court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision to sustain Scott\u2019s termination. Scott filed an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 20} Before reaching the merits of this case, the city argues that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear Scott\u2019s appeal. The trial court determined this issue when it denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The crux of the city\u2019s argument is that Scott\u2019s sole remedy was to appeal his termination through the collective-bargaining grievance procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 21} Scott is a member of the Civil Service Employees\u2019 Association, as well as the International Brotherhood of Operating Engineers, Local 18S. Scott was terminated for being in violation of Civil Service Rule 9.10. The city\u2019s civil service commission provides for an appeal to the commission for civil service employees seeking to challenge a discharge for violation of one of its rules. Further, the collective-bargaining agreement provides that \u201c[a]ll matters concerning disciplinary action within the jurisdiction of the Civil Service shall be processed exclusively in accordance with the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 22} The correspondence received by Scott at each level of this process clearly set forth the succeeding steps he was required to take in order to preserve his appeal. In his discharge letter, Scott was advised that he should refer to Local 18S and its grievance procedure. Article 38 of the collective-bargaining agreement sets forth the steps taken by a collective-bargaining unit when a grievance is brought. Instead of filing a grievance with his unit, Scott chose to request a hearing by an administrative referee of the civil service commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 23} We find that the holding in <em>Johnson v. Metro Health Med. Ctr. </em>(Dec. 20, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79403, 2001 WL 1685585, applies here. The <em>Johnson </em>court held that R.C. 4117.03(A)(5) gives a public employee the right to file a grievance without the intervention of the bargaining representative, but it must be done before union representation is invoked. Scott never sought his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>union\u2019s representation but instead appealed his termination directly to the referee. We find that Scott appealed his case through the proper channels, which now brings it to this court. The trial court properly denied the city\u2019s motion to dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">{\u00b6 24} Scott raises two assignments of error before this court, one substantive and the other procedural. We address the assertion of procedural error first.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Due Process Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cII. Plaintiff-appellant\u2019s termination of employment was in violation of his rights to procedural due process as guaranteed classified civil service employees of the City of Cleveland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 26} In his second assignment of error, Scott argues that he was denied due process because he was terminated for conduct that was not identified by the city in his predisciplinary letter. Specifically, he argues that the letter stated that he was being terminated for insubordination for failing to report for random drug testing on May 11, when, in fact, he was terminated for insubordination for failing to appear for drug testing on May 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 27} Scott correctly cites <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Loudermill </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494, the \u201ccontrolling case that speaks to the issue of what process is due an employee in a pretermination hearing.\u201d In <em>Loudermill, </em>the court held generally that \u201cthe pretermination \u2018hearing,\u2019 though necessary, need not be elaborate\u201d and that \u201c \u2018something less\u2019 than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.\u201d Id. at 545, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494. More specifically, the <em>Loudermill </em>court set forth the basic requirements as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe essential requirements of due process, and all that respondents seek or the Court of Appeals required, are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement. * * * The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. * * * To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government\u2019s interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.\u201d Id. at 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">{\u00b6 29} The city held a full evidentiary hearing, at which time Scott presented evidence in defense of his failure to report for random drug testing. The city terminated him on the basis that this failure to report was insubordination. The fact that the administrative referee concluded that Scott had violated only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>order to report for drug testing on May 13 does not change the fact that Scott had both notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges against him at the predisciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">{\u00b6 30} We find that Scott was afforded his due process rights at the predisciplinary hearing; therefore, we overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Termination Not Supported by Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cI. The trial court erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the decision of the Cleveland Civil Service Commission, in terminating the employment of the appellant, was supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probabitive [sic] evidence and that the decision was not illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 32} In his first assignment of error, Scott argues that the trial court erred in upholding the decision to terminate his employment. He claims that the evidence the trial court relied on did not support a finding that he had violated a direct order to report for random drug testing on his scheduled day off.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 33} It is well established that administrative appeals brought pursuant to R.C. 124.34 and 119.12 are subject to trial de novo. <em>Wolf v. Cleveland, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82135, 2003-Ohio-3261, 2003 WL 21434779. The common pleas court may substitute its own judgment on the facts for that of the civil service commission, based upon the court\u2019s independent examination and determination of conflicting issues of fact. Id., citing <em>Newsome v. Mun. Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 327, 20 OBR 430, 486 N.E.2d 174. A trial court must not simply determine if the ruling of the civil service commission was arbitrary or capricious, the standard for appeals brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506, but must evaluate the evidence anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 34} On the other hand, \u201c[a]n appeal to the court of appeals, pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, is more limited in scope.\u201d <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848, 852. \u201cThis statute grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u2018questions of law,\u2019 which does not include the same extensive power to weigh \u2018the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u2019 as is granted to the common pleas court.\u201d Id. at fn. 4. \u201cIt is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals, or this court, might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u201d <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>{\u00b6 35} The trial court found that the evidence supported Scott\u2019s termination from the city. Scott knew that he was subject to the conditions of his last-chance agreement, which required him to report for random drug testing at any time his employer chose. He knew that the consequence for not reporting was immediate discharge from employment. Scott had already missed a reporting opportunity on May 11. Although Scott was not scheduled to work on May 13, had he reported for testing on that day, he would have been paid for his time. As of May 13, Scott had worked only 24 hours that week. Had Scott reported for the test and then worked enough hours the remainder of the week to be eligible for overtime pay, the city would have paid him for the overtime hours, per the collective-bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">{\u00b6 36} Scott provided evidence that he did not have a car accessible to him on May 13 because he had planned to lend his car to his daughter. Further, he stated that traveling to the water plant by public transportation would require several transfers. We are not convinced that these circumstances warrant reversing the trial court for having abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court reviewed the law and facts in this case before making its determination. We find that the trial court\u2019s decision to uphold Scott\u2019s termination was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence; therefore, we overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b185-8\">Cooney, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b185-9\">Sweeney, A.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. There is no dispute that the testing requirement was random. Scott's attorney makes clear, and the city agrees, that Scott was not being required to submit to \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d drug testing, which occurs when an employee is believed to be impaired by drugs or alcohol during a work shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">.

Scott argues that he was already scheduled to work a 48-hour week and that by coming in on his day off, he would have been, in essence, forced to work overtime.

The city is not contesting whether Scott had the right to appeal a civil service commission decision to the common pleas court. R.C. 2506.01.

Scott\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement, Article 38, provides that a grievance is defined as a dispute or difference between the city and an employee concerning compliance with any provision of that contract, including any and all disciplinary actions. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at step three as outlined in the CBA, the union/employee may, within 30 calendar days in the case of a grievance appealing an employee discharge, submit the matter to final and binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>{\u00b6 40} This court upheld the applicability of the grievance process in an analogous case, <em>Brown v. Cleveland, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84708, 2005-Ohio-514, 2005 WL 315429, in which the city had mistakenly informed the employee of her right to pursue a civil service appeal. However, the case cited by the majority, <em>Johnson v. Metro Health Med. Ctr. </em>(Dec. 20, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79403, 2001 WL 1685585, is easily distinguished from the instant case. In <em>Johnson, </em>the employee chose to have her union represent her in filing a grievance. Therefore, she had no standing to pursue a further appeal because she was not a party in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">{\u00b6 41} Here, Scott had a right to pursue a grievance under the CBA, with or without union representation. He incorrectly pursued a civil service appeal. Therefore, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision upholding his termination.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-5\">Sweeney, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Av\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 42} I respectfully dissent. This case involves a contract concerning terms of Scott\u2019s employment. \u201c[PJarties to an employment contract, as with any other contract, are bound toward one another by standards of good faith and fair-dealing.\u201d <em>Bolling v. Clevepak Corp., </em>20 Ohio App.3d 113, 121, 20 OBR 146, 484 N.E.2d 1367. The law implies a condition that neither party will act so as to defeat the other party\u2019s legitimate expectations under the contract. Restatement of the Law 2d, Contracts (1981) 189, Section 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 43} According to the record, the city terminated Scott for \u201cbeing in violation of the Rules of Civil Service 9.10 and the City of Cleveland\u2019s Drug-Free Workplace Policy, as well as for failing to meet the requirements of [his] last chance agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 44} The city cited paragraph 8 of Civil Service Rule 9.10, which pertains to \u201cinsubordination,\u201d and also an excerpt from its drug-free workplace policy that provides: \u201cCivil Service Rule 9.10 states that any officer or employee in the classified service may be discharged, suspended or reduced in rank for intoxication or misuse or abuse of drugs in the course of his or her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 45} On May 10, 2005, the city requested that Scott report to work early for his shift the next day in order to attend a predisciplinary hearing and then submit to drug testing, which he agreed to do. However, the predisciplinary hearing was cancelled, leading Scott to believe that the subsequent drug testing had likewise been cancelled. While the city representative denies it, Scott maintains that he offered to submit to drug testing upon his arrival to work on May 11, 2005. Scott maintains that he was willing to submit to drug testing throughout the duration of his shift on May 11, 2005. Instead, his superior told him it would be rescheduled for \u201ca later date.\u201d Scott did not hear of it again until he returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>a call to work the evening of May 12, 2005. The city instructed him to come in for testing the following day at 3:30 p.m., which he said he could not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 46} Scott worked 12-hour shifts. The week in question, Scott was scheduled to work May 10 and 11 from 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Scott was not scheduled to work on May 12 or May 13. Then, he was scheduled to work the next three days. Nonetheless, when Scott would not or could not come in for testing on his day off (May 13) as demanded by the city at 6 p.m. the evening of May 12, the city terminated him by letter dated May 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 47} Scott stated that he could not make it into work on May 13, but he indicated that he was scheduled to work the following day and could take the test at that time. Scott did not have access to a car on May 13, 2005, and taking the bus would have required numerous transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 48} In the summer of 2004, the city required Scott to execute a last-chance agreement after he tested positive for drugs. Scott explained that he had \u201csmoked a part of [a joint of marijuana]\u201d while golfing on vacation, which he classified as a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d The last-chance agreement executed by Scott, his union, and the city on November 5, 2004, provided that he would submit to \u201cperiodic, random drug * * * tests conducted by the employer at any time within the next twenty-four (24) months following this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 49} There is nothing to suggest that Scott\u2019s termination resulted from a violation of the cited provisions of the city\u2019s drug-free workplace policy. Indeed, he had previously submitted to at least six random drug tests, which all resulted negative for drug use. According to Scott, all of those random tests were administered to him during working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">{\u00b6 50} The referee for the Cleveland Civil Service Commission found that the city failed to establish any violation by Scott of the drug-free workplace policy. The referee further concluded that the city failed to establish that Scott refused to submit to drug testing on May 11, 2005. However, the referee concluded that Scott violated the last-chance agreement when he did not appear for drug testing on May 13, 2005, his scheduled day off, and sustained his termination for that reason. The trial court upheld that decision, but I would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">{\u00b6 51} Scott legitimately and reasonably expected that the condition of random drug testing would apply only during times he was working. This understanding is buttressed by the custom and practice established by these parties whereby all the previous random tests were conducted on days Scott was scheduled to work. To provide otherwise would allow the city to demand testing at any hour of the day, seven days a week, which is simply unreasonable. When Scott did not submit to testing on his day off work, he was terminated notwithstanding the opportunity to conduct the test during working days. Summoning an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to appear on demand \u201cat any time\u201d or lose his job does not comport with the notions of good faith and fair dealing that applies to contracts such as this. The fact that the city would have paid Scott overtime for coming to work on his day off for drug testing does not dissuade me. It was essentially undisputed that getting to work on May 13, 2005, would have been a significant inconvenience to Scott, who did not have a car that day. The last-minute demand to change his plans and find a way to work or lose his job is very unreasonable. This is especially true when he was at work for 12-hour shifts on May 10 and 11, 2005, and was also scheduled to be there the three days following May 13, 2005. Therefore, I would sustain the first assignment of error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
