After it accepted Braden\u2019s admissions to the burglary and conveying-a-weapon charges, the juvenile court adjudicated him delinquent. After a trial, the court also found Braden delinquent for having committed gross sexual imposition. The juvenile court imposed a two-year commitment to the appellee, the Ohio Department of Youth Services (\u201cDYS\u201d). Braden now challenges those adjudications in these consolidated appeals. Because a key psychological report supporting a finding that Braden was competent to stand trial was never made a part of the record of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-16\">{\u00b6 2} In December 2004, Braden, then 14 years old, was charged with burglary in case number 04-19446z. In February 2005, he was charged with conveying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>weapon in a school safety zone in case number 05-2207x. The juvenile court referred Braden to the court clinic for an evaluation of his competency. Braden was examined by Dr. Paul A. Deardorff, a clinical psychologist. Dr. Deardorff concluded that Braden \u201cwas of mildly retarded to borderline intelligence, * * * does not appear to be capable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against him * * * [and] does not appear to be capable of presently assisting in his defense.\u201d In a second evaluation conducted three weeks later, psychologist Dr. Kathleen J. Hart found that Braden was \u201cof limited intellectual functioning\u201d and concluded that Braden \u201cis not competent to proceed on these charges, and he is not likely to derive sufficient benefit from additional educational interventions to reach competence within the next year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 3} The two reports were admitted into evidence. In March 2005, relying upon the contents of the two reports and the conclusions reached by the psychologists who prepared them, the juvenile court found Braden not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 4} Less than three weeks later, Braden was charged, in case number 05-4690z, with having committed sexually oriented offenses against younger relatives when he was 12 or 13 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 5} Six months later, after Braden had attended six sessions of the juvenile court\u2019s competency-attainment program, the program coordinator, James O\u2019Connell, prepared a report for the court in which he suggested that Braden was malingering or pretending incapacity. Though O\u2019Connell was not a psychologist, his report caused the court to order a third competency evaluation. Dr. Deardorff prepared a subsequent evaluation of Braden on September 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 6} Two days later, the juvenile court conducted a hearing on Braden\u2019s competency. The court acknowledged receiving Dr. Deardorffs report and inquired whether Braden was \u201cwilling to stipulate to the report.\u201d Through his counsel, Braden said, \u201cWe will submit on \u2014 on the record for this (inaudible) and stipulate to the admissibility of the content of the report (inaudible) for today.\u201d The state also stipulated to the \u201csubmi[ssion]\u201d of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 7} The juvenile court indicated that it had reviewed Dr. Deardorffs latest report, the two prior reports, and O\u2019Connell\u2019s report. The court also stated that it had reviewed the record of the earlier proceedings. Without additional elaboration, the court then concluded that \u201creading the report, the most recent reports here, from Dr. Deardorff there will be a finding that you are presently competent to stand trial.\u201d The court\u2019s journal entry stated that \u201c[b]ased upon the evidence presented, [Braden] is found capable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings and of assisting in the defense of the charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Braden subsequently offered admissions to the allegations of burglary and conveying a weapon in a school safety zone. The juvenile court personally addressed Braden to ensure that his admissions were entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. But the court failed to inform Braden that he was waiving his constitutionally guaranteed rights to remain silent and to introduce evidence at an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The juvenile court nonetheless accepted Braden\u2019s admissions and adjudicated him delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 9} Braden then proceeded to a trial on the gross-sexual-imposition charges. The juvenile court also adjudicated Braden delinquent on these charges and committed him to the custody of the DYS for a two-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 10} In his first assignment of error, Braden asserts that the juvenile court erred when it found him competent to stand trial after having previously found him to be incompetent. Braden contends that the juvenile court\u2019s reliance on Dr. Deardorff s second evaluation was misplaced, as Dr. Deardorff s conclusions about Braden\u2019s competency were equivocal at best. The state contends that the court\u2019s finding of competency \u201cwas supported by the most recent report by Dr. Deardorff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 11} Juvenile court proceedings \u201cmust measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The right not be tried or convicted while incompetent is \u201cas fundamental in juvenile proceedings as it is in criminal trials of adults.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the test for determining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial is whether the defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 12} This standard has been codified in R.C. 2945.37(G), which provides that a defendant is incompetent to stand trial if, after a hearing, the trial court finds that he is \u201cincapable of understanding the nature and objective of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>proceedings against [him] or of assisting in [his own] defense.\u201d The standard also \u201cgoverns the competency evaluations of juveniles, so long as it is applied in light of juvenile rather than adult norms.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once the juvenile court has determined that an offender is not competent to stand trial, however, a presumption of incompetence arises, which the state must rebut by coming forward with evidence of competency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 13} Juv.R. 32(A) provides that the court may order a mental examination when the issue of competency has been raised. The juvenile court must hold a hearing on whether the juvenile is competent and \u201cafter considering the evidence presented by the parties at that hearing make a finding as to [the child\u2019s] competency.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, while the juvenile court carefully attempted to ensure that Braden\u2019s right not to be tried while incompetent was respected, Dr. Deardorff s second report was never introduced or formally admitted into evidence. During the oral argument of these appeals, the state agreed that it had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut the presumption that Braden was incompetent. The juvenile court\u2019s comments about the second Deardorff report were alone insufficient to support its finding that Braden was competent to stand trial. The juvenile court\u2019s reliance on a report that was not part of the record was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 15} We note that this is not a case in which the appellant has failed to meet his burden to provide a complete record on appeal, requiring us to presume regularity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, the report was never made part of the record. Accordingly, we hold that the juvenile court erred in relying on evidence outside the record in finding Braden to be competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 16} Our resolution of the first assignment of error renders moot Braden\u2019s remaining four assignments of error, in which he asserts that the juvenile court failed to comply with Juv.R. 29 when accepting his admissions, that the court erred in adjudicating him delinquent for the gross-sexual-imposition allegations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judgments of the juvenile court adjudicating Braden a delinquent child are reversed. And these causes are remanded for further proceedings consistent with the law and with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Judgments reversed and causes remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-6\">Sundermann, P.J., and Hildebrandt and Cunningham, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\">.
