Doseck. American had sought a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend and indemnify Doseck against Edward Lipker\u2019s personal-injury claim. For the following reasons, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 2} On October 14, 2003, Edward Lipker was a passenger in a 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier that he owned. Ryan Doseck was the driver. While driving on Interstate 70 in Clark County, Doseck allegedly negligently failed to maintain control of the vehicle, causing a collision. Lipker suffered bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 3} Between May 16, 2003, and October 15, 2003, Lipker was the policyholder and named insured on an automobile insurance policy issued by American. The policy covered Lipker\u2019s 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier. Doseck did not have insurance at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 4} On September 22, 2005, Lipker brought suit against Doseck and American. On January 23, 2007, American filed an amended answer, which asserted a cross-claim against Doseck. American sought a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Doseck with regard to the automobile accident because the policy did not provide coverage for bodily injury to Lipker, the named insured. Although Doseck requested and received an extension to file an answer to the cross-claim, no responsive pleading was filed. On May 15, 2007, American moved for summary judgment on its cross-claim, to which Doseck responded. On August 3, 2007, the trial court overruled American\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the cross-claim. Pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), the trial court certified that there was no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 5} American appeals, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">{\u00b6 6} American\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAppellant is entitled to the declaratory relief it requested. Under the clear and ambiguous terms of the insurance contract issued by appellant to plaintiff Edward Lipker, appellee is not entitled to a defense nor indemnity. The trial court erred when it overruled appellant\u2019s summary judgment motion and found appellant has a duty to defend and indemnify appellee for claims brought against appellee by plaintiff Edward Lipker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, American claims that the trial court erred in finding that it was required under the policy to defend the claim against Doseck.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"> {\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018An insurance policy is a contract in which the insurer promises to indemnify the insured for losses incurred by the insured which arise out of the occurrence of a risk identified in the policy.\u2019 <em>GuideOne Mut. Ins. Co. v. Reno, </em>Greene App. No. 01-CA-68, 2002-Ohio-2057, 2002 WL 857682, affirmed sub nom. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Anders, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 156, 2003-Ohio-3048, 789 N.E.2d 1094. The insurer\u2019s promise to indemnify is separate and distinct from its obligation to defend an insured in an action, and the duties are triggered by different events. Id. \u2018The duty to indemnify is triggered by the insured\u2019s actual legal liability. The duty to defend is a prior duty that\u2019s triggered by the insured\u2019s demand that the insurer provide a defense to a claim of alleged liability.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c \u2018A liability insurer\u2019s obligation to its insured arises only if the claim falls within the scope of coverage.\u2019 <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 604, 605, 710 N.E.2d 677. An insurer has a duty to defend the insured \u2018[w]here the allegations state a claim that falls either potentially or arguably within the liability insurance coverage.\u2019 <em>Anders, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 156, 2003-Ohio-3048, 789 N.E.2d 1094, at \u00b6 18. Conversely, \u2018[t]he insurer need not provide a defense if there is no set of facts alleged in the complaint which, if proven true, would invoke coverage.\u2019 <em>Martin, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 605, 710 N.E.2d 677. Where the action alleged claims that fell within the insurance coverage yet the conduct that prompted the action \u2018is so indisputably outside coverage,\u2019 the insurer has no duty to defend, so long as the insurance policy only required the insurer to defend against claims to which the coverage applied. <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118. The duty to defend need not arise solely from the allegations in the complaint but may arise at a point subsequent to the filing of the complaint. <em>Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 177, 9 OBR 463, 459 N.E.2d 555.\u201d <em>Twin Maples Veterinary Hosp. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>159 Ohio App.3d 590, 2005-Ohio-430, 824 N.E.2d 1027, \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 11} The liability coverage portion of the automobile policy issued by American to Lipker was set forth in Part I of the policy. Part I provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cWe will pay compensatory damages an insured person is legally liable for because of bodily injury and property damage due to the use of a car or utility trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWe <em>will defend any suit </em>or settle any claim <em>for damages payable under this policy </em>as we think proper.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The policy defined an \u201cinsured person\u201d as (1) \u201cYou or a relative,\u201d and (2) \u201cAny person using your insured car.\u201d \u2018You\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d were defined as \u201cthe policyholder named in the declarations and spouse, if living in the same household.\u201d Lipker was the policyholder named on the declarations page.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 15} The policy also contained certain exclusions to liability coverage. The sixth exclusion stated that coverage did not apply to \u201c[djamage to property owned by, or in the charge of, an insured person.\u201d The tenth exclusion stated that coverage did not apply to bodily injury to the following persons:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201ca. Any person injured while operating your insured car;</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cb. You and any person related to you and residing in your household; or</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cc. Any person related to the operator and residing in the household of the operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 19} After reviewing the policy, the trial court rejected American\u2019s contention that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Doseck due to the exclusion portion of Part I. The trial court stated: \u201cNotably, this Court does not find it proper to bridge the gap that American Standard is asking; namely, that because Lipker\u2019s claims are for bodily injuries, and there is a bodily injury exclusion, that the exclusion somehow prevents Doseck from receiving a defense and indemnification from American Standard.\u201d The court thus concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWhen the contract is read in its entirety, especially Part \u2014 I [sic] Liability Coverage, this Court finds the bodily injury exclusion highlighted by American Standard unpersuasive in light of the introductory paragraph allowing for the defense and indemnification of an insured person under the terms of the contract. Furthermore, Doseck fits within the definition of insured person under the Insurance Policy because he was driving Lipker\u2019s car and did so with his permission. The terms of the Insurance Policy are clear and unambiguous that Doseck is entitled to a defense and indemnification from American Standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 21} Although we agree with the trial court that the policy clearly indicates that Doseck was an insured due to his driving Lipker\u2019s vehicle with permission, we disagree that American has a duty to defend the claim against him. The policy provided that American would defend any claim for damages \u201cpayable under this policy.\u201d Although the duty to indemnify is separate from the duty to defend, American was required to defend Lipker\u2019s suit against Doseck only if Lipker\u2019s claim either potentially or arguably fell within the liability-insurance coverage. American has no duty to defend against a claim that was clearly and unambiguously excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">{\u00b6 22} Under the clear and unambiguous terms of the policy, bodily injuries to the named insured \u2014 Lipker\u2014were excluded from coverage. Damage to Lipker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>property was also excluded from liability coverage. As noted by the trial court, Lipker\u2019s claim against Doseck was for bodily injuries and property damage. Because the policy clearly excluded from coverage bodily injury to Lipker and damage to Lipker\u2019s property, American had no duty to defend against Lipker\u2019s claim against Doseck. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it failed to grant summary judgment to American on its declaratory-judgment cross-claim against Doseck.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 23} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 24} In its second assignment of error, American claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant a default judgment against Doseck on its cross-claim. At the time that the court denied American\u2019s request for summary judgment, Doseck had yet to file a responsive pleading to American\u2019s January 2007 amended answer and cross-claim. We note, however, that Doseck filed a motion for leave to answer the cross-claim instanter on July 16, 2007, approximately two weeks before the court denied American\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 25} In light of our disposition of American\u2019s first assignment of error, we find American\u2019s second assignment of error to be moot. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 26} The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-12\">Brogan and Grajdy, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
