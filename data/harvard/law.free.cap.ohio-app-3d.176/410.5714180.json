McMonagle, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, the city of Cleveland (\u201cthe city\u201d) appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment of compensatory damages, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest against the city. Appellees and cross-appellants Donald Krieger and Clifton Oliver cross-appeal from the trial court\u2019s order vacating the punitive-damages award and its award of $50,000 in attorney fees. We affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">I. THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 2} The unrebutted testimony of appellees\u2019 witnesses at trial reflects the following.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 11, 2002, Krieger and Oliver were part of a group that attended a Cleveland Indians baseball game at Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field). Oliver\u2019s sister had won free tickets to the game; the seats were in the \u201cnosebleed\u201d section of right field, in the upper deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 3} The group, which included Krieger, Oliver, Oliver\u2019s sister, Andrew Mendez, and another woman, arrived at the game in the first inning. Krieger was dissatisfied with the seats, because they were so far away from the field. Shortly after arriving, Krieger saw some open seats in the lower deck, near third base, and left the group to sit there. Oliver, an active-duty Marine home on convalescence leave due to cervical fractures, joined Krieger several innings later, and the two remained there until the top of the ninth inning.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 4} With the Indians winning 5-0 in the top of the ninth inning, Krieger and Oliver left their seats, intending to reunite with their group in the upper deck. While they were near a lower-deck restroom, they heard an explosion and immediately headed toward the noise. By the time they arrived, the noise had drawn a large crowd, so they headed upstairs to find their friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 5} When they reached the group in the upper-deck area, security personnel were questioning Mendez, because it was thought that an explosive device had been dropped from the right-field upper-deck area.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 6} Cleveland police officers and Jacobs Field security personnel stopped, questioned, and searched Krieger, Oliver, and Mendez twice in the upper deck, and again as they walked down the ramp to leave, to determine whether they had any knowledge of the incident. Each time, Krieger and Oliver fully cooperated, answered the same questions, showed their tickets and identification, and consented to be searched. However, after the third such encounter, the men decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to lodge a complaint with the Indians customer-service department about the way they had been treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">{\u00b6 7} As they arrived at the customer-service area, they were confronted by seven or eight uniformed Cleveland police officers, who escorted the group to a room in the basement of Jacobs Field and immediately began berating the men. After handcuffing Krieger, the police put the men in holding cells. The police then questioned Oliver. Although he cooperated and answered every question, the police berated him, called him a \u201cpiece of s\u2014 Marine\u201d and accused him of being a terrorist. Before being handcuffed, Oliver, who was wearing a hard plastic cervical collar and had limited range of motion in his neck due to his injuries, asked if he could be handcuffed in front, rather than behind his back. The police ignored his request, handcuffed him behind his back, and then shoved him in the back seat of a police cruiser with Krieger and Mendez for transport to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 8} The police then confiscated Krieger\u2019s and Oliver\u2019s clothes and gave them paper jumpsuits to wear. They were then placed in separate jail cells and held for four days without being charged with a crime. The cells were filthy and infested with cockroaches, and each cell contained only a toilet. The men were not given a mattress, pillow, blanket, or even a chair. Krieger had to sleep on the ground and stuff toilet paper in his ears to keep out the insects. Oliver, who could not lie down because of his cervical neck collar, was forced to sit in the corner of the cell. Neither man was permitted to shower or brush his teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 9} During their four days of confinement, Krieger and Oliver were harassed by the guards, who referred to them as terrorists and the \u201cunibomber.\u201d Krieger feared for his life, because he been placed in a cell with a mentally unstable person who pounded the walls. He also suffered sleep deprivation, because the guards would wake him up repeatedly during the night. He sustained numerous insect bites and lost approximately 12 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 10} While they were incarcerated, Krieger and Oliver were separately interrogated by Cleveland Police Detective Ralph Peachman. Both Krieger and Oliver denied any knowledge of the source of the explosive device and explained, again, that they were in the lower-deck area of the stadium when the blast occurred. Detective Peachman told both Krieger and Oliver that he knew they did not have anything to do with setting off the explosive device, and he offered to release them from custody immediately if they would give him a statement implicating Mendez. Both Krieger and Oliver indicated that they could not implicate Mendez, because they knew nothing about the origin of the explosive device and were nowhere near Mendez when the explosion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>{\u00b6 11} On June 14, 2002, after being held for nearly four days, Krieger and Oliver were each charged with three counts of aggravated arson and felonious assault, charges that collectively carried potential jail time of 70 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">{\u00b6 12} Prior to the bond hearing on June 15, 2002, Krieger\u2019s lawyer, William McGinty, met with Detective Peachman. According to McGinty, Detective Peachman told him that he knew Krieger \u201chad nothing to do with this case,\u201d and, if Krieger would give a statement implicating Mendez, the city would drop the charges against him. Krieger told McGinty that he was innocent and could not implicate Mendez because he had no knowledge of his involvement. McGinty communicated Krieger\u2019s response to Detective Peachman, who told McGinty that he would then ask the judge to set a high bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 13} Detective Peachman likewise told Oliver\u2019s attorney and his father that he knew Oliver had nothing to do with the explosion, but he wanted him to testify against Mendez. Oliver refused to do so because he, too, knew nothing about Mendez\u2019s involvement and was not near Mendez when the explosion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 14} During the bond hearing, Detective Peachman testified that he considered Krieger and Oliver to be terrorists, and, with no evidence to support his assertion, testified that Oliver had procured a military explosive device from the Marine Corps. Detective Peachman requested that the judge set a bond of $1,000,000. Representatives from television and print media attended the hearing and subsequently reported that Krieger and Oliver were terrorists.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 15} After posting bond, Krieger and Oliver were released from jail. Several weeks later, after Detective Peachman testified to the grand jury, Krieger and Oliver were each indicted on four counts of aggravated arson and felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 16} Krieger and Oliver continued to maintain that the video surveillance tapes from the game would exonerate them. When the prosecutor finally released the surveillance tapes to their lawyers months later, the tapes confirmed that Krieger and Oliver were in the lower deck when the blast occurred. Additionally, the results of forensic analysis by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms indicated the absence of bomb residue on Krieger\u2019s and Oliver\u2019s clothing. Despite this evidence, Detective Peachman still refused to recommend that the charges be dismissed, unless Krieger and Oliver gave a statement against Mendez. Finally, on January 29, 2003, one week prior to trial, the prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the charges against Krieger and Oliver without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 17} By this time, the weight of the charges had taken a toll on both Krieger and Oliver. After being released from jail, Krieger, who was 27 years old, experienced nightmares about his incarceration and, for a time, had to sleep in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>his parents\u2019 bedroom. He received threatening phone calls and was harassed by the media and branded a terrorist. Oliver\u2019s parents were forced to borrow the money for their son\u2019s bond on a credit card. Cleveland police apparently called Oliver\u2019s commanding officer while he was incarcerated, and when Oliver, who had a flawless military career to this point, called his battalion gunnery sergeant to tell him what had happened, he was told that he was an \u201cembarrassment to the Marine Corps and a black eye to [his] battalion.\u201d His military career was ruined. Due to the extensive media coverage, Oliver was unable to obtain employment after the incident; he became depressed and had to take antidepressant medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">II. The Initial Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 18} On June 10, 2003, Krieger and Oliver subsequently filed two separate actions (which were later consolidated) against the Cleveland Police Department, the Cleveland Indians Baseball Organizations, Detective Peachman, and several other officers, alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, slander, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The docket reflects that a summons and complaint were sent by certified mail to the police department on June 16, 2003; service was returned on June 18, 2003, showing that the police department had refused service. Nevertheless, on July 31, 2003, the police department filed its answer, setting forth the affirmative defenses of insufficiency of process and that the police department is not a sui juris entity that can be sued. Appellees subsequently dismissed their claims without prejudice on June 30, 2004. On the same day, a special process server delivered a summons and complaint to the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">III. The Refiling</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 19} On June 29, 2005, Krieger and Oliver refiled their complaint, alleging the same claims against the same parties as before. The police department subsequently filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that it is not a sui juris entity and lacks the capacity to be sued. In response, appellees moved the court to amend their complaint to name the city of Cleveland as a defendant. The trial court subsequently granted appellees\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court also denied the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, made on the grounds that appellees\u2019 claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and its motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Appellees subsequently dismissed all parties except the city; trial proceeded against only the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, the jury found in favor of Krieger and Oliver on their claims of malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>distress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of $400,000 and $600,000 in punitive damages to each appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">{\u00b6 22} After the jury\u2019s award, the city filed motions for a directed verdict and a new trial, and appellees filed motions for prejudgment interest and attorney fees. After a hearing, the trial court entered judgment for each appellee in the amount of $400,000 in compensatory damages, $50,000 in attorney fees, and $144,102.08 in prejudgment interest. The trial court vacated the punitive-damages award. Both the city and appellees now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">IV. Immunity for the City</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 23} The city first argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude evidence of intentional torts, motion for directed verdict, and motion for a new trial, because, as a political subdivision, under R.C. Chapter 2744, Ohio\u2019s Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, it is immune from liability for intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 24} We need not decide whether the city is immune from liability for its intentional torts in this case, because, for the reasons stated below, we find that the city abandoned the statutory immunity defense when it filed its amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 25} Statutory immunity is an affirmative defense that must be timely raised or it is waived. <em>Turner v. Cent. Local School Dist. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 95, 97, 706 N.E.2d 1261, citing <em>State ex rel. Koren v. Grogan </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 590, 629 N.E.2d 446; Civ.R. 8(C); Civ.R. 12(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">{\u00b6 26} In this case, the record demonstrates that appellees filed their complaint on June 29, 2005. The Cleveland Police Department subsequently filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that it is not a sui juris entity that can be sued. In response, appellees filed a motion to amend their complaint to substitute the city for the police department as the proper defendant, which was granted on November 28, 2005. On December 29, 2005, the city filed an answer to appellees\u2019 amended complaint, in which it asserted that it was immune from liability. On March 17, 2006, Detective Peachman filed his answer, also asserting immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 27} In the meantime, on January 6, 2006, the city filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that appellees\u2019 complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. The motion did not raise the issue of statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 28} On April 28, 2006, the city and Peachman filed a motion for leave to amend their answers to appellees\u2019 amended complaint \u201cto assert two additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>affirmative defenses\u201d relating to Oliver\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding. After the motion was granted, the city and Peachman filed their amended answer on June 12, 2006. With respect to immunity, the city\u2019s and Peachman\u2019s amended answer states only that \u201cPeachman is immune from liability pursuant to, but not limited to, Revised Code Chapter 2744, 4765 and Ohio common law.\u201d The city\u2019s purported immunity is not pleaded anywhere in its amended answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 29} The law relevant to the city\u2019s amended answer was set forth in <em>Grimm v. Modest </em>(1939), 135 Ohio St. 275, 277, 14 O.O. 121, 20 N.E.2d 527:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018[It] is elementary law that when a party substitutes an amended petition for an earlier one, this constitutes an abandonment of the earlier pleading and a reliance upon the amended one. The earlier pleading becomes <em>functus officio.\u2019 \u201d </em>Id. at 277, 14 O.O. 121, 20 N.E.2d 527, quoting <em>State ex rel. Talaba v. Moreland </em>(1936), 132 Ohio St. 71, 75, 7 O.O. 195, 5 N.E.2d 159. See also <em>Wrinkle v. Trabert </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 233, 238, 22 O.O.2d 248, 188 N.E.2d 587 (effect of filing an amended petition omitting a party as defendant was to abandon the action as to that party).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 31} Here, the city was clearly aware of the immunity defense, because it asserted statutory immunity in its first answer to appellees\u2019 amended complaint. Nevertheless, it did not argue immunity in its motion for summary judgment. In fact, the city did not raise the issue of statutory immunity for intentional torts until October 26, 2006, in a motion in limine filed shortly before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 32} Likewise, the city\u2019s motion for leave to amend its answer to assert additional defenses indicates the city\u2019s awareness of affirmative defenses to appellees\u2019 amended complaint. But, although the city\u2019s original answer asserted immunity from liability, when the city filed its amended answer, it did not assert its own statutory immunity as an affirmative defense. It asserted immunity only for Detective Peachman.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 33} In light of the city\u2019s failure to raise statutory immunity in its motion for summary judgment and its failure to plead it as an affirmative defense, we hold that the city waived any statutory immunity defense it might have had. Cf. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 85 Ohio St.3d at 98, 706 N.E.2d 1261. (\u201cIt was perfectly reasonable for appellants to assume that in the absence of [appellee\u2019s] failure to assert this defense, and its failure to argue this issue in its first motion for summary judgment, it intended to waive the defense.\u201d) Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion in limine, motion for directed verdict, and motion for new trial, all of which were made <em>after </em>the city had abandoned its statutory immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>V. The Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">{\u00b6 35} In its second assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment, motion for reconsideration, motion for directed verdict, and motion for a new trial, because appellees\u2019 suit is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Specifically, the city contends that appellees\u2019 first suit was never commenced against the police department and, therefore, the city did not become a party to the suit until after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Additionally, the city argues that Civ.R. 15(C) is not applicable to allow appellees to amend their refiled complaint to substitute the city for the police department as the proper defendant, because appellees never commenced their first action against the police department. The city\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 36} Under Civ.R. 3(A), \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court, if service is obtained within one year from such filing * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 37} Appellees filed their first complaint on June 10, 2003, within the applicable statutes of limitations. Appellees then attempted to commence their action against all defendants, including the police department. On June 16, 2003, a summons and complaint was sent to the police department by certified mail,- but it was returned on June 18, 2003, marked \u201c[rjefused.\u201d On June 30, 2004, appellees voluntarily dismissed their complaint without prejudice. On June 29, 2005, less than one year later, they refiled their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 38} Ohio\u2019s savings statute, R.C. 2305.19(A), states that \u201c[i]n any action that is commenced <em>or attempted to be commenced, if in </em>due time a judgment for the plaintiff is reversed or if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff * * * may commence a new action within one year after * * * the plaintiffs failure otherwise than upon the merits or within the period of the original applicable statute of limitations, whichever occurs later.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 39} As a remedial statute, R.C. 2305.19(A) should be construed liberally so that cases may be decided upon their merit, rather than upon technicalities or procedure. <em>Cero Realty Corp. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 171 Ohio St. 82, 12 O.O.2d 92, 167 N.E.2d 774, syllabus; <em>Kavouras v. Hurt </em>(Apr. 30, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 60427, 1992 WL 90727.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 40} As this court has recognized, \u201c[tjhe applicability of R.C. 2305.19 is not limited only to circumstances where effective service of process has been obtained. By its express language, the savings statute also applies where there has been an attempt to commence an action.\u201d <em>Abel v. Safety First Industries, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80550, 2002-Ohio-6482, 2002 WL 31667308, at \u00b6 42. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>also <em>Stone v. Adamini, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83159, 2004-Ohio-4466, 2004 WL 1899413, at \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 41} In the instant case, appellees attempted to commence their initial lawsuit against the police department by filing their complaint and demanding service prior to the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, a voluntary dismissal is a dismissal \u201cotherwise than upon the merits.\u201d <em>Frysinger v. Leech </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 38, 512 N.E.2d 337, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Gardner v. Gleydura </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 277, 279, 648 N.E.2d 537. Thus, the city\u2019s argument that appellees\u2019 first action was never actually commenced against the police department is meaningless. In light of their attempt to commence their action and subsequent failure otherwise than upon the merits, appellees properly availed themselves of the savings statute when they refiled their complaint on June 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 42} Moreover, under Civ.R. 15(C), the trial court properly allowed appellees to amend their complaint to substitute the city for the police department as the proper defendant. Three conditions must be satisfied in order to prevail under Civ.R. 15(C). The party seeking to relate an amended pleading back to the date of an original pleading must demonstrate that (1) the claim asserted in the amended complaint arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the original complaint; (2) within the period provided by law for commencing the action against him, the party to be brought in by amendment received such notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits; and (3) within the period provided by law for commencing the action against him, the party to be brought in knew or should have known that but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 43} The three conditions are certainly satisfied here. The same claims were made in the first complaint as in the amended complaint, and the causes of action arose out of the same conduct by the city and its employees. Moreover, because both the first and second lawsuits were defended by the same lawyer from the city\u2019s law department, it is clear that the city received notice of the suit within the applicable statute of limitations and knew that but for appellees\u2019 mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the suit would have been brought against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 44} This court has previously held that a refiled complaint relates back to the original filing if the requirements of Civ.R. 15(C) are met. See, e.g., <em>Rios v. Grand Slam Grille </em>(Nov. 18, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 75150, 1999 WL 1044506; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>Husarcik v. Levy </em>(Nov. 10, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 75114, 1999 WL 1024185. Because those conditions are met here, and because appellees properly utilized the savings statute to refile their complaint, notwithstanding their failure to perfect service of the original complaint on the police department, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s various motions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">VI. Oliver\u2019s Bankruptcy Filing</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 46} Appellees\u2019 first lawsuit was filed on June 10, 2003; it was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on June 30, 2004. On April 12, 2005, prior to the refiling, Oliver filed a petition in bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Ohio. On June 29, 2005, the second lawsuit was filed. It is undisputed that the second suit did not include the trustee of Oliver\u2019s bankruptcy estate as a party and was initiated in Oliver\u2019s name only.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 47} The city argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict, motion for new trial, and motion in limine, because Oliver lacked standing after he filed for bankruptcy. Specifically, the city contends that due to his bankruptcy petition, Oliver was not the real party in interest with respect to his claims and, therefore, his claims should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 48} Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, all of a debtor\u2019s property becomes property of the estate. 11 U.S.C. 541. The code broadly interprets \u201cproperty\u201d to include all interests of a debtor, whether they are legal or equitable, tangible or intangible. Id. This definition necessarily includes any unliquidated legal claims that a debtor may have against other parties. <em>McLynas v. Karr, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1075, 2004-Ohio-3597, 2004 WL 1516849, at \u00b6 13. When causes of action are property of the bankruptcy estate, they \u201cconstitute property rights which are vested solely in the trustee in bankruptcy and subject to his or her sole control. Accordingly, only the trustee * * * has standing to bring the claims * * <em>Folz v. BancOhio Natl. Bank </em>(S.D.Ohio 1987), 88 Bankr.149, 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 49} Before an Ohio court can consider the merits of a claim, the person seeking relief must establish standing to sue. <em>Ohio Contrs. Assn. v. Bicking </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 318, 320, 643 N.E.2d 1088. If a party to an action is not the real party in interest, the party lacks standing to prosecute the action. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 77, 701 N.E.2d 1002. But, under Civ.R. 17, a case is not to be dismissed on the ground that it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification, joinder, or substitution of the real party in interest. \u201cSuch ratification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of the real party in interest.\u201d Civ.R. 17. See also <em>Dallas v. Childs </em>(June 23, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 65150, 1994 WL 284991; <em>Marathon Farms v.

The trustee then asked the bankruptcy court for permission to employ appellees\u2019 counsel as counsel for the trustee in the action, and, in an entry authorizing employment of counsel, that permission was granted by the bankruptcy court. Accordingly, the trustee ratified the commencement of Oliver\u2019s causes of action, Oliver had the requisite standing to prosecute his claims, and the trial court therefore properly denied the city\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 51} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">VII. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 52} In its fourth assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury with respect to appellees\u2019 claim of malicious prosecution that a grand jury indictment results in a rebuttable presumption of probable cause. The record reflects that although the city objected to the lack of instruction on the alleged rebuttable presumption, the city never submitted a proposed jury instruction to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 53} We review the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State v. Wolons </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 68, 541 N.E.2d 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 54} To establish the tort of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must prove: (1) malice in instituting or continuing the prosecution, (2) lack of probable cause, and (3) termination of the prior proceedings in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Criss v. Springfield Twp. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 82, 84, 564 N.E.2d 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b655} The record reflects that the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of malicious prosecution as set forth above and as contained in Section 330.03 of the Ohio Jury Instructions regarding malicious prosecution. A review of Ohio Jury Instructions Section 330.03 reveals that the instruction does not contain any language concerning the alleged rebuttable presumption that the city argues for in this case. Instead, the comment to Section 330.03 provides that \u201c[ijndictment is evidence of probable cause and plaintiff must bring forth evidence to rebut.\u201d Neither the instruction nor the comment directs the court to advise the jury that a grand jury indictment creates a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of probable cause. This court has previously held that a trial court does not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>its discretion in giving the standard charge in the Ohio Jury Instructions. <em>Youssef v. Parr, Inc. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 679, 692, 591 N.E.2d 762. The city has cited no case law to support its proposition that a trial court abuses its discretion in failing to create its own jury instruction with respect to the alleged \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d created by a grand jury indictment in a malicious-prosecution case when that language is not contained in the standard Ohio Jury Instructions charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 56} Moreover, appellees presented substantial evidence to overcome any presumption of probable cause flowing from the grand jury indictment. Specifically, appellees produced evidence in this case to demonstrate that the indictment resulted from the testimony of Detective Peachman. Former Cuyahoga County prosecutor Edward Fitzgerald, the only witness called by the city in this case, testified that Detective Peachman was likely the sole witness who presented the case to the grand jury hearing. Prior to that hearing, Detective Peachman had admitted to Krieger, Oliver, their respective attorneys, and Oliver\u2019s father that he knew that Krieger and Oliver had nothing to do with the incident at Jacobs Field. There is no evidence that the grand jury heard any testimony other than that of Detective Peachman, and it indicted both Krieger and Oliver for felonious assault and aggravated arson. A reasonable inference from the indictment and Detective Peachman\u2019s acknowledgement prior to the grand jury proceedings that he knew that Krieger and Oliver had nothing to do with this crime is that Detective Peachman misled the grand jury in order to obtain an indictment against appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cIf one party relies on a presumption and his adversary introduces evidence of a substantial nature which counter-balances the presumption, it disappears.\u201d <em>Adamson v. May Co. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 266, 270, 8 OBR 358, 456 N.E.2d 1212. In light of the unrebutted evidence produced at trial by appellees, there was no presumption in favor of the city arising from the grand jury indictment and, thus, no prejudice to the city from the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on any alleged rebuttable presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 58} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">VIII. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 59} The jury awarded punitive damages against the city in the amount of $600,000 to each appellee. The city subsequently filed a motion for directed verdict and a motion for new trial on the basis that it is not liable for punitive damages and the jury should not have been instructed on punitive damages. After a hearing, the trial court vacated the punitive-damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>{\u00b6 60} The city argues in its fifth assignment of error that the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding punitive damages. This assignment of error is moot, because there is no judgment against the city for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 61} In their first assignment of error on cross-appeal, appellees assert that the trial court erred in vacating the punitive-damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 62} Appellees concede that it is well established that municipalities are not liable for punitive damages. R.C. 2744.05(A); <em>Spires v. Lancaster </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 76, 28 OBR 173, 502 N.E.2d 614. But, under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b), employees of political subdivisions can be individually liable, and thus subject to punitive damages, upon a showing of malice, bad faith, or wanton or reckless behavior. <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 452, 639 N.E.2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 63} Prior to trial, the city and appellees stipulated that Detective Peachman was acting in the course and scope of his employment as it related to this matter. In exchange for this stipulation, appellees dismissed Detective Peachman from the lawsuit. Appellees contend that \u201c[t]he City\u2019s agreement to enter into the stipulation in exchange for [their] dismissing Detective Peachman from the lawsuit was tantamount to a contractual assumption of Detective Peachman\u2019s liability.\u201d Appellees argue that if Detective Peachman had remained as a defendant in the lawsuit and been found individually liable, the city, under its contract with the Cleveland Police Union, would have been contractually obligated to pay any damages (up to $1,000,000) awarded against Detective Peachman. Therefore, they contend, by virtue of the stipulation, the city contractually agreed to assume Detective Peachman\u2019s tort liability and, by implication, any liability for punitive damages. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 64} The stipulation, set forth in a letter dated May 23, 2006 from the city\u2019s attorney to appellees\u2019 lawyers, said nothing about assuming Detective Peach-man\u2019s liability; it merely stated that the city stipulated that Detective Peachman, at all times relevant to the matter in dispute, was acting within the course and scope of his employment. There is nothing in the stipulation regarding an agreement to assume Detective Peachman\u2019s tort liability, and we decline to read such an implicit term into a very explicit stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 65} Because municipalities are not subject to punitive damages, the trial court did not err in vacating the punitive damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">{\u00b6 66} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled as moot; appellees and cross-appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>IX. Statutory Cap on Compensatory Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">{\u00b6 67} R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) limits the amount of noneconomic damages that can be awarded against a political subdivision to $250,000. The jury returned an award of compensatory damages of $400,000 for each appellee. Upon the return of the jury\u2019s verdict, the city moved the trial court to impose the statutory limit as provided in R.C. 2744.05(C)(1). The trial court denied the city\u2019s motion. In its sixth assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 68} In <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland RTA </em>(Mar. 10, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 64029, 1994 WL 78468, this court held that R.C. 2744.05(C)(1) violates the constitutional right to a jury trial, because it impairs the function of the jury to determine the amount of damages. This court further held that the statute violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection, because it creates arbitrary and irrational differing classifications between nonwrongful-death tort claimants and wrongful-death tort claimants. Accord <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Cty. Commrs. </em>(Dec. 4,1996), Tuscarawas App. No. 95-AP-110114, 1996 WL 753188.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>Gladon v. Greater Cleveland RTA </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 312, 662 N.E.2d 287, the Ohio Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s holding in <em>Gladon </em>without reaching the issue of the constitutionality of the statute. We find no Supreme Court cases that otherwise address the constitutionality of R.C. 2744.05(C), and accordingly, we follow our holding in <em>Gladon </em>finding the statute unconstitutional. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion to reduce the compensatory damages awards to $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 70} Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">X. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 71} After the jury returned a verdict in their favor, appellees moved the trial court to award them attorney fees. The city opposed appellees\u2019 motion. The trial court subsequently granted appellees\u2019 motion and awarded each party $50,000 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 72} In its seventh assignment of error, the city argues that because there is no statutory authorization under R.C. Chapter 2744 authorizing attorney fees against a municipality, the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to appellees. In their second cross-assignment of error, appellees contend that the trial court erred in reducing the amount of attorney fees requested by appellees. Ohio follows the general \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d under which the prevailing party cannot recover attorney fees in the absence of express statutory authorization. <em>Sorin v. Bd. of Edn. of Warrensville Hts. School Dist. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 179, 75 O.O.2d 224, 347 N.E.2d 527. There is no provision under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Chapter 2744 that allows for recovery of attorney fees against a municipality. In the absence of such a provision, attorney fees may not be awarded against a municipality. <em>Banks v. Oakwood </em>(Oct. 11, 1990), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 57225 and 58020, 1990 WL 151662; <em>Franklin v. Columbus </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 53, 719 N.E.2d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">{\u00b6 73} Appellees concede that attorney fees are not generally recoverable against a municipality, but argue that this case is different because Detective Peachman would have been individually liable for attorney fees if he had remained a defendant in the case, the city assumed Detective Peachman\u2019s liability by virtue of the stipulation discussed earlier and, therefore, the city is liable for attorney fees. Appellees\u2019 argument fails, because, as discussed earlier, the stipulation was not a contractual assumption of Detective Peachman\u2019s liability by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 74} Appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is sustained, and the award of attorney fees is vacated. Appellees\u2019 second cross-assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">XI. Prejudgment Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 75} In its eighth assignment of error, the city contends that the trial court erred in awarding appellees prejudgment interest from the date their cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 76} Under R.C. 1343.03(C)(1), interest on a judgment shall be ordered in a civil tort action that has not settled if the court determines at a hearing \u201cthat the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case and that the party to whom the money is to be paid did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cA party has not failed to make a good faith effort to settle under R.C. 1343.03(C) if he has 1) fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, 2) rationally evaluated his risks and potential liability, 3) not attempted to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings, and 4) made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer from the other party. If a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d <em>Kalain v. Smith </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 157, 25 OBR 201, 495 N.E.2d 572, syllabus. R.C. 1343.03(C) was enacted to \u201cpromote settlement efforts, to prevent parties who have engaged in tortious conduct from frivolously delaying the ultimate resolution of cases, and to encourage good faith efforts to settle controversies outside a trial setting.\u201d <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 635 N.E.2d 331, citing <em>Kalain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>{\u00b6 78} Under R.C. 1343.03(C), the phrase \u201cfailed to make a good faith effort to settle\u201d is not equivalent to \u201cbad faith.\u201d Id. A party may have failed to make a good-faith effort to settle even though he or she did not act in bad faith. Id. Whether a good-faith effort to settle a case has been made depends on whether the amount of the settlement offer was based on an objectively reasonable belief about the party\u2019s liability and a rational evaluation of the risk of exposure. <em>Andre v. Case Design, Inc., </em>154 Ohio App.3d 323, 2003-Ohio-4960, 797 N.E.2d 132, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 79} Whether a party\u2019s settlement efforts were made in good faith is a decision committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, <em>Moskovitz, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 659, 635 N.E.2d 331, and absent an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s decision to award prejudgment interest should not be reversed on appeal. <em>Kalain, </em>25 Ohio St.3d, at 159, 25 OBR 201, 495 N.E.2d 572. An abuse of discretion involves more than a difference in opinion. <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 222, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. The term \u201cdiscretion\u201d itself involves the idea of a determination made between competing considerations. Id. \u201cIn order to have an \u2018abuse\u2019 in reaching such determination, the result must be so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof, not the exercise of reason but rather of passion or bias.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">{\u00b6 80} Under this standard, we hold that the trial court properly awarded prejudgment interest to appellees. We begin by noting that the city made no settlement offer whatsoever, even though it is undisputed that Oliver and Krieger would have settled the case for $20,000 each. The city argues that it had no duty to make any offer to settle the case, because it had an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief\u2019 that \u201cthe City is immune from intentional torts, appellees\u2019 claims were outside the statute of limitations, appellee Oliver lacked standing, and the rebuttable presumption of probable cause created by a grand jury indictment was never overcome.\u201d None of these arguments have merit. As discussed above, the city is not immune, appellees\u2019 claims were within the applicable statutes of limitations, and Oliver had proper standing to sue. Additionally, appellees\u2019 evidence indeed overcame any presumption of probable cause created by the grand jury indictment (see our discussion infra regarding manifest weight of the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 81} Moreover, the record reflects that the city repeatedly raised its immunity and statute-of-limitations defenses by way of numerous pretrial motions (motion to dismiss, motion for summary judgment, motion for reconsideration, and motion in limine). Each time, the trial court denied the city\u2019s motions. Clearly, by the time the case proceeded to trial, the city was on notice that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>was a potential for liability in this case. Thus, the city\u2019s belief that it had no potential exposure in this case cannot be called \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 82} Moreover, the city did not attempt to reasonably assess its liability, even after the trial court had denied its motions. William McGinty, the key witness in this case, offered very damning testimony during his deposition, i.e., that Detective Peachman admitted to him, prior to the grand jury indictment, that he knew that neither Krieger nor Oliver had anything to do with the incident that gave rise to this case. However, no representative of the city bothered to attend McGinty\u2019s deposition to evaluate his testimony and the city\u2019s potential liability based upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 83} A party\u2019s belief in its own immunity is not objectively reasonable when the party relies on faulty defenses. <em>Loder v. Burger </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 669, 675, 681 N.E.2d 1357, citing <em>Woodhams v. Moore </em>(S.D.Ohio 1994), 840 F.Supp. 517, 520. \u201cA party holding an objectively unreasonable belief in non-liability is not excused from the obligation to enter into settlement negotiations, and cannot insulate himself from liability for prejudgment interest by relying on his own naivete.\u201d <em>Loder, </em>113 Ohio App.3d at 675, 681 N.E.2d 1357. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 84} The city also argues that even if prejudgment interest is appropriate, the court erred in assessing prejudgment interest from the date the cause of action accrued (June 11, 2002), instead of when the second complaint was filed (June 29, 2005). The city\u2019s argument fails, because the jury found the city liable for malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 85} Under R.C. 1343.03(C)(1)(b), interest on a judgment \u201c[i]n an action in which the party required to pay the money engaged in the conduct resulting in liability with the deliberate purpose of causing harm to the party to whom the money is to be paid\u201d is to be calculated \u201cfrom the date the cause of action accrued to the date on which the order, judgment, or decree was rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">{\u00b6 86} The jury found that the city had deliberately attempted to cause harm to Krieger and Oliver. Accordingly, prejudgment interest was properly calculated by the trial court from the date their cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 87} Appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">XII. The Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 88} In its ninth assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of appellees on the jury\u2019s verdict and in failing to grant its motion for a new trial, because the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 89} Civ.R. 59(A)(6) provides that a new trial may be granted when the judgment is not sustained by the weight of the evidence. When considering a Civ.R. 59(A)(6) motion for a new trial, a trial court must weigh the evidence and pass on the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Edwards v. Haase </em>(Aug. 1, 2001), 9th Dist. No. 3121-M, 2001 WL 866284. An appellate court reviews the court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Antal v. Olde Worlde Prods. </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 144, 145, 9 OBR 392, 459 N.E.2d 223. Absent some indication that the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, the judgment of the trial court will not be disturbed. <em>Schlundt v. Wank </em>(Apr. 17, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70978, 1997 WL 186830</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 90} The reviewing court should be guided by a presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings were correct. <em>Sanders v. Stover, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 89241, 2007-Ohio-6202, 2007 WL 4126788, at \u00b6 31, citing <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. When a verdict is supported by competent, substantial, and apparently credible evidence, a motion for new trial will be denied. <em>Schlundt, </em>supra. Additionally, in reaching its verdict, the jury is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness. <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 29, 33, 619 N.E.2d 1135. A trial judge should \u201cabstain from [encroaching upon the jury\u2019s fact finding function,] unless it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result.\u201d <em>Bland v. Graves </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 644, 651, 620 N.E.2d 920. Under this standard, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 91} The city again argues that it cannot be liable, because it is statutorily immune from liability for intentional torts and appellees failed to commence their suit within the applicable statute of limitations. As discussed above, these arguments have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 92} With respect to the judgment against the city on appellees\u2019 malicious-prosecution claim and false-imprisonment claims, the city argues that appellees failed to rebut the evidence of probable cause flowing from the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 93} Probable cause does not depend on whether the claimant was guilty of the crime charged. <em>Waller v. Foxx </em>(Oct. 6, 1982), Hamilton App. No. 810568, 1982 WL 4753. Rather, the question is whether the accuser had probable cause to believe that the claimant was guilty. Id. \u201cThe person instituting the criminal proceeding is not bound to have evidence sufficient to insure a conviction but is required only to have evidence sufficient to justify an <em>honest belief </em>of the guilt of the accused.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>DiNucci v. Lis, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88751, 2007-Ohio-4056, 2007 WL 2269740, at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>{\u00b6 94} \u201cThe return of an indictment by the grand jury is evidence of probable cause; when an indictment has been returned by the grand jury, the plaintiff has the burden of producing substantial evidence to establish lack of probable cause. Plaintiff must produce evidence to the effect that the return of the indictment resulted from perjured testimony or that the grand jury proceedings were otherwise significantly irregular.\u201d <em>Deoma v. Shaker Hts. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 72, 77, 587 N.E.2d 425. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 95} Appellees produced evidence in this case to demonstrate that the indictment resulted from the perjured testimony of Detective Peachman. Former Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Edward Fitzgerald, the only witness called by the city in this case, testified that in all likelihood, Detective Peachman was the sole witness who presented the case to the grand jury hearing. The city presented no evidence that anyone other than Detective Peachman testified before the grand jury. Prior to that hearing, Detective Peachman had admitted to Krieger, Oliver, their attorneys, and Oliver\u2019s father that he knew that Krieger and Oliver had nothing to do with the incident at Jacobs Field. Nevertheless, the grand jury indicted both Krieger and Oliver for felonious assault and aggravated arson. A reasonable inference from the indictment and Detective Peachman\u2019s acknowledgement prior to the grand jury proceedings that he knew that Krieger and Oliver had nothing to do with this crime is that Detective Peachman perjured himself at the grand jury hearing to obtain an indictment. In light of this evidence, the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 96} Appellant\u2019s ninth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">XIII. Krieger\u2019s Oath</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 97} At the time of trial, Krieger was on active duty in the United States Air Force, stationed in Anchorage, Alaska. Krieger testified at trial by means of a live video feed and was questioned in real time.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 98} Under Evid.R. 603, \u201c[b]efore testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that [he] will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken [his] conscience and impress [his] mind with the duty to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 99} The city objects that no one <em>in Alaska </em>administered the oath to Krieger and, therefore, his testimony was unsworn. This argument is without merit. The record reflects that the trial judge administered the oath to Krieger via video feed before he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 100} Appellant\u2019s tenth assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>XIV. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">{\u00b6 101} Finally, the city argues that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of the trial court\u2019s errors denied the city due process. Because we found merit to only one of the city\u2019s assignments of error, we reject this argument as well. The trial court admittedly erred in awarding attorney fees; that award is vacated. As discussed above, the city\u2019s other assignments of error regarding the trial court\u2019s judgment are without merit; accordingly, there is no \u201ccumulative error effect\u201d applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 102} Appellant\u2019s eleventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-7\">Blackmon and Celebrezze, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-11\">. The city called only one witness, former Cuyahoga County prosecutor Edward Fitzgerald, to testify at trial.
