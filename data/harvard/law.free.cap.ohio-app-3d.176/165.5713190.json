On appeal, Wolf contends that his aggravated-arson conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was not supported by sufficient evidence, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that the trial court erred in imposing consecutive, nonminimum sentences. Based upon the following, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 2} In June 2006, Wolf was indicted for one count of aggravated arson in violation of R.C. 2909.02(A)(1), a felony of the first degree; one count of arson in violation of R.C. 2909.03(A)(2), a felony of the fourth degree; one count of attempted grand theft in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2913.02(A)(3), a felony of the fifth degree; one count of possessing criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24(A),(C), a felony of the fifth degree; and one count of insurance fraud in violation of R.C. 2913.47(A)(1), a felony of the fourth degree. The indictment arose from an incident whereby Wolf poured gasoline throughout his mobile home, set fire to it, was injured by an explosion prior to the arrival of any firefighters, and then attempted to collect insurance proceeds from State Farm Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2006, Wolf entered a plea of not guilty as to all counts in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">{\u00b6 4} In October 2006, the case proceeded to jury trial, during which the following testimony was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">{\u00b6 5} Raymond Estep testified that on October 9, 2005, he resided in a mobile home in the Marysville Estates near Wolfs mobile home; that around 10:45 p.m., he was watching television when he heard a \u201crumble\u201d and a \u201cwhoosh\u201d noise; that he walked outside to see what the noise was; that he saw a glow coming out of Wolfs garage, saw the shadows of flames, and noticed that the garage door was deformed and pushed out at a 45-degree angle; that he told his wife to call 9-1-1, which she did; that he walked up Wolfs driveway and saw burning paper in the garage; that Wolf then came around the side of the garage and \u201cwas flailing at trying to get his jacket off\u2019; and that smoke was coming off of Wolf and he said \u201cI\u2019m burnt up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Nathan Weirich testified that he has been a firefighter for the Marysville Fire Department for 14 years; that he had attended a \u201c200 hour school\u201d as firefighter training, which taught him \u201cthe basics of all aspects of the fire service\u201d; that on October 9, 2005, he was dispatched to a fire at 277 Magnolia Drive in Marysville; that two fire engines and seven firefighters responded to the fire; that he observed that the mobile home\u2019s attached garage door was bent outward; that after gaining entrance to the mobile home, the firefighters extinguished a fire in the kitchen; that no one besides the firefighters was present inside the mobile home; that he observed \u201cpour patterns\u201d located on the floor throughout the mobile home; that pour patterns are burnt marks that look like puddles that result from ignitable liquids, such as gasoline, being poured out of containers; that he located a gas can inside the mobile home; and that when gasoline is poured throughout a structure, it creates a hazard for firefighters because the vapors can permeate their clothing and ignite when exposed to heat or fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 7} On cross-examination, Weirich testified that the fire was not a particularly difficult fire to extinguish; that although there was smoke in the mobile home, \u201cthere was very little fire\u201d; that the firefighters extinguished the fire within one minute; that none of the firefighters suffered any injuries as a result of the fire; and that the fire was not accompanied by unusually high temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 8} Lieutenant Keith Watson, fire prevention lieutenant for the Marysville Fire Department, testified that \u201cthe first thing that you notice when you went inside the residence was the overwhelming smell of what appeared to be gasoline\u201d; that the garage door was blown outward due to an explosion inside the mobile home; that when gasoline concentration in the air becomes too high, the air will not support combustion and, accordingly, the fire will then go out; and that gasoline fires present a hazard to firefighters because the gasoline makes the fire very unpredictable.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 9} Steve Southard, fire and explosion investigator for the State Fire Marshall\u2019s Office, testified that he investigated the fire at 277 Magnolia Drive; that a very pungent odor of gasoline was prevalent throughout the mobile home; that he observed \u201cignitable liquid pour patterns on the floor along the couch, on the east wall, and in front of the entertainment system on the west wall\u201d; that the ignitable-liquid pour patterns and lack of accidental ignition source indicate that the fire was intentionally set; and that the fire \u201cwas obviously easy to put out.\u201d Further, Southard testified that fires may be accompanied by high-order explosions, which cause devastation, or low-order explosions, which cause a shockwave. Southard surmised that a shockwave explosion had occurred in Wolfs mobile home, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe vapors of gasoline inside were very, very high. In our scientific data, gasoline will ignite with 1.4 percent vapors up to 7.6 percent vapors or percentages of vapor in a room. With the amount of gasoline and the liquid surface area, the vapors inside the structure were much greater than 7.6 percent, so the higher explosive limits of gasoline would not ignite with the small fire that was inside. There is no oxygen.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe vapors displace the oxygen inside the room. The vapors are very, very high, very present. When that garage door was opened, it allowed a column of fresh oxygen into the room at the ignition source or origin of the fire, and the rapid development of fire, which we call a deflagration, created a big plume or shockwave, and it traveled in the direction the oxygen was being received.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cSo when the door opened, the fire blew out that garage door. The fire then \u2014 the pressure in the fire traveled out the garage door, and then the pressure inside the mobile home became so great that it slammed the door shut, and then that increased additional pressure out in the garage, which the direction of the shockwave was right toward the garage door. That\u2019s what caused the garage door to blow out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 13} Additionally, when questioned what the result of a high-pressure explosion, as opposed to a low-pressure explosion, would have been, Southard testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cWell, to give you an example of what maybe happened in this situation, if the door from the garage door was open fully and remained open, that large column of oxygen would have mixed within [sic] all that gasoline through the entire structure. We may have had a deflagration or explosion that would have leveled the entire structure because of the vapors inside. That didn\u2019t occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Peter Hoy of Memorial Hospital in Marysville testified that he treated Wolf on October 9, 2005; that Wolfs beard and eyelashes were \u201csomewhat singed\u201d; that he had a second degree burn on his leg and on his wrist; that he had a first degree burn on his face; and that Wolf had no other injuries. Additionally, Dr. Hoy authenticated an emergency room report concerning Wolfs treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">{\u00b6 16} James Smith, a firefighter paramedic of the Allen Township Fire Department in Marysville, testified that on October 9, 2005, he observed that Wolf had a second degree burn on his wrist, a first and second degree burn on his leg, and singed hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">{\u00b6 17} At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, Wolf moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29 on the possessing-criminal-tools count and the aggravated-arson count. The trial court sustained the motion as to the criminal-tools count, but overruled the motion as to the aggravated-arson count.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Thereafter, the jury convicted Wolf of aggravated arson, arson, attempted grand theft, and insurance fraud. The trial court sentenced Wolf to a six-year prison term on the aggravated-arson conviction and 12-month prison term on the arson conviction, to be served consecutively. Additionally, the trial court sentenced Wolf to a six-month prison term on the attempted-grand-theft conviction and a six-month prison term on the insurance-fraud conviction, to be served concurrently to each other and to the aggravated-arson and arson sentences. Further, the trial court ordered Wolf to pay $3,333.11 in restitution to the Marysville Fire Department, $284.36 in restitution to the Allen Township Fire Department, and $17,278.94 in restitution to State Farm Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">{\u00b6 19} It is from this judgment that Wolf appeals, presenting the following assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">\u201cThe conviction for aggravated arson is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">\u201cThe conviction for aggravated arson was not supported by sufficient evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. Ill</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">\u201cThe appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution and Article One, Section Ten of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it sentenced the appellant to consecutive sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. V</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it imposed more than the minimum sentence in this matter for the offense of aggravated arson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">{\u00b6 20} Due to the nature of Wolfs assignments of error, we elect to address them out of order and to address his fourth and fifth assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">{\u00b6 21} In his second assignment of error, Wolf argues that his aggravated-arson conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. Specifically, Wolf argues that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly created a substantial risk of serious physical harm to anyone other than himself. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 22} When an appellate court reviews a record for sufficiency, the relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, citing <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy, <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, and the question of whether evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict is one of law. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 486, 55 O.O. 388, 124 N.E.2d 148, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in <em>Smith, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 23} Wolf was convicted of aggravated arson under R.C. 2909.02, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201c(A) No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201c(1) Create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person other than the offender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">{\u00b6 24} In interpreting R.C. 2909.02, a \u201cperson acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B). Additionally, a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d is defined as \u201ca strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(8). The Ohio Jury Instructions emphasize the distinction between a \u201cstrong possibility,\u201d \u201cremote possibility,\u201d and \u201csignificant possibility\u201d by suggesting the option of adding the words \u201ceven a\u201d in front of the phrase \u201csignificant possibility.\u201d See 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2003), Section 509.02(3). \u201c \u2018[T]he language chosen by the General Assembly contemplates three degrees of \u2018possibility\u2019: the highest is \u2018strong,\u2019 the middle is \u2018significant,\u2019 and the lowest is \u2018remote.\u2019 For this reason, the Committee added \u2018(even a)\u2019 to the statutory definition.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Eggeman, </em>3d Dist. No. 15-04-07, 2004-Ohio-6495, 2004 WL 2785951, \u00b6 40 (Rogers, J., concurring in part and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>dissenting in part), quoting 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2003), Section 509.02(3), at comment. Accordingly, the statutory definition of substantial risk recommended by the Ohio Jury Instructions reads: \u201c \u2018a strong possibility as contrasted with a remote or even a significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">{\u00b625} R.C. 2901.01(A)(5) explains that \u201cserious physical harm to persons\u201d includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201c(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity; \u201c(d)Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201c(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, in examining aggravated arson, this court has found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201cThe \u2018knowingly\u2019 element in an aggravated arson case refers to a defendant\u2019s state of mind when he set a fire \u2014 i.e. the defendant is aware that the fire or explosion he set will probably create a substantial risk of serious physical harm. The requisite proof is not dependant upon the actual result of the fire but is based upon the risk of harm created by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Eggeman, </em>2004-Ohio-6495, 2004 WL 2785951, at \u00b6 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">{\u00b6 27} Here, we find that there was insufficient evidence that Wolf knowingly created a substantial risk of serious physical harm to anyone other than himself. Testimony was presented that gasoline vapors can permeate firefighters\u2019 clothing and ignite when exposed to heat or fire causing serious physical harm; however, no testimony was presented that there was a strong possibility of this occurring during this particular fire. In fact, no testimony was presented that there was even a significant possibility of this occurring, and testimony was heard that the fire was small, was extinguished within one minute, and was not accompanied by unusually high temperatures. Additionally, although extensive testimony was heard regarding the cause of the first explosion, which injured Wolf, no testimony was heard that there was a strong possibility of a second explosion or what serious physical harm the firefighters may have suffered as a result of another explosion. Further, although testimony was heard regarding the conditions required for an explosion, we cannot discern from the testimony whether these conditions were still present when firefighters were likely to have entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>mobile home. Accordingly, reviewing the evidence presented in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we cannot conclude that any rational trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Wolf knowingly created a substantial risk of serious physical harm to anyone other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, we sustain Wolfs second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 29} In his third assignment of error, Wolf argues that his constitutional rights were violated because he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, Wolf contends that trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel filed a motion, not ex parte, requesting that an expert witness be provided due to indigence, which he contends informed the state that its own expert would be unchallenged; because trial counsel did not hire and call an arson expert; because trial counsel did not object to firefighters being permitted to testify as experts without the proper foundation being laid; and because trial counsel did not object to Dr. Hoy\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 30} An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim requires proof that trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below objective standards of reasonable representation and that the defendant was prejudiced as a result. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. To show that he has been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must prove that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome at trial would have been different. Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201cReasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 433, 588 N.E.2d 819, superseded by constitutional amendment on other grounds as recognized by <em>State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 103, 684 N.E.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">{\u00b6 31} Furthermore, the defendant must overcome the presumption that counsel provided competent representation and must show that counsel\u2019s actions were not trial strategies prompted by reasonable professional judgment. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Richardson, </em>3d Dist. No. 13-06-21, 2007-Ohio-115, 2007 WL 92367, citing <em>State v. Hoffman </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 403, 407, 717 N.E.2d 1149. Tactical or strategic decisions, even if unsuccessful, generally do not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 558, 651 N.E.2d 965. Additionally, the court must look to the totality of the circumstances and not isolated instances of an allegedly deficient performance. <em>State v. Fritz, </em>3d Dist. No. 13-06-39, 2007-Ohio-3138, \u00b6 35, citing <em>State v. Malone </em>(Dec. 13, 1989), 2d Dist. No. 10564, 1989 WL 150798.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Wolfs first and second arguments contend that trial counsel was ineffective for filing a motion not ex parte, requesting an expert witness and for failing to hire or call an arson expert. However, nothing in the record indicates that any arson experts would have presented testimony materially different from that presented by the state\u2019s arson expert. Additionally, trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined the state\u2019s arson expert. Therefore, Wolf has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel filing the motion or failing to hire an arson expert, the outcome of his trial would have been different. See <em>State v. Young </em>(Feb. 1, 2002), 3d Dist. No. 4-01-18, 2002 WL 129824; <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 33} Wolfs third argument is that he was denied effective assistance because trial counsel did not object to firefighters being permitted to testify as experts without a proper foundation being laid. Specifically, Wolf complains that Weirich testified without objection as to the hazards of gasoline being poured into a home and that other firefighters testified without objection as to the meaning of burn patterns. However, Weirich testified extensively as to his experience and the training he received to be a firefighter. We find that Weirich\u2019s testimony laid the necessary foundation for the admissibility of the evidence. See Evid.R. 702. Moreover, regarding Weirich\u2019s testimony on burn patterns, Southard, the fire and explosion investigator, also testified about burn patterns. Thus, even if a necessary foundation was not laid, Weirich\u2019s testimony was cumulative. See <em>State v. Trouten, </em>7th Dist. No. 04-JE-18, 2005-Ohio-6592, 2005 WL 3370590, \u00b6 190-191. Accordingly, Wolf failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel\u2019s failure to object, the outcome of his trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 34} Wolfs fourth argument is that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Dr. Hoy\u2019s testimony about Wolfs injuries and authentication of hospital reports introduced by the state, which enabled the state to corroborate Southard\u2019s testimony that an explosion had occurred in Wolfs mobile home. However, Smith, the paramedic, also testified about the location and extent of Wolfs injuries, making Dr. Hoy\u2019s testimony cumulative. See <em>Trouten, </em>supra. Consequently, Wolf failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Dr. Hoy\u2019s testimony, the outcome of his trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, we overrule Wolfs third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 36} In his first assignment of error, Wolf contends that his conviction for aggravated arson is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Our disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of Wolfs second assignment of error renders his first assignment of error moot, and we decline to address it. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>Assignments of Error Nos. TV &amp; V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 37} In his fourth and fifth assignments of error, Wolf contends that the trial court erred in sentencing him to consecutive prison terms and to a nonminimum prison term on the aggravated-arson conviction. Due to our reversal of Wolfs aggravated-arson conviction in his second assignment of error, Wolf no longer has consecutive prison terms because his remaining prison terms were all concurrent. Additionally, Wolf has only disputed the nonminimum prison term imposed on his aggravated arson conviction. Accordingly, our disposition of Wolfs second assignment of error renders his fourth and fifth assignments of error moot, and we decline to address them. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, while not raised by Wolf as an assignment of error, we note that the trial court ordered Wolf to pay $3,333.11 in restitution to the Marysville Fire Department and $284.36 in restitution to the Allen Township Fire Department. Generally, an appellant waives an error by failing to object or bring the error to the court\u2019s attention. Crim.R. 52(B). A reviewing court will not examine such an error unless it constitutes plain error. Id. Under plain-error analysis, the court determines whether there is an error, whether it is plain error, and whether the defendant was prejudiced by the error. <em>United States v.

Consequently, \u201c[w]ith the exceptions of certain circumstances inapplicable to this case, government entities do not constitute \u2018victims\u2019 entitled to restitution for their expenditure of public funds in the pursuit of fighting crime.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v.

Therefore, although we reverse Wolfs aggravated-arson conviction, we must address the issue of restitution because his arson conviction remains. As this court made clear in <em>Toler, </em>a trial court may only order a defendant to pay restitution for economic losses suffered by the victim that may have stemmed directly from the offense. The fire departments were not victims of the arson. Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred in ordering Wolf to pay the fire departments restitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 42} Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued in his second assignment of error, and in the matter of restitution, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-8\">Willamowski, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b214-9\">Preston, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">. We note that the trial court also ordered Wolf to pay restitution to State Farm Mutual Insurance Company restitution.

However, since I would find that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find Wolf guilty of aggravated arson pursuant to R.C. 2909.02(A)(1), I must respectfully dissent in part from the majority opinion. Moreover, since I would find that there was sufficient evidence to convict Wolf of aggravated arson, I would find that the first, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are not moot and would address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">{\u00b6 44} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">{\u00b6 45} Wolf was convicted of aggravated arson under R.C. 2909.02, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201c(A) No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201c(1) Create a <em>substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person other than the </em>offender.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Pursuant to R.C. 2901.22(B), \u201c[a] person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d The Revised Code also defines a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d as \u201ca strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">{\u00b6 46} This court has previously examined R.C. 2909.02, the aggravated-arson statute, and has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">\u201cIn order to prove an aggravated arson case, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, by means of fire or explosion, <em>knowingly </em>created a <em>substantial risk of serious physical harm. </em>R.C. 2909.02(A)(1). The \u2018knowingly\u2019 element in an aggravated arson case refers to a defendant\u2019s state of mind when he set a fire \u2014 i.e. the defendant is aware that the fire or explosion he set will probably create a substantial risk of serious physical harm. The requisite proof is not dependent upon the actual result of the fire but is based upon the risk of harm created by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>State v. Eggeman, </em>3d Dist. No. 15-04-07, 2004-Ohio-6495, 2004 WL 2785951, \u00b6 14 (Rogers, J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>dissented in part and concurred in part arguing that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of aggravated arson).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b6 47} During the trial, the prosecution presented the testimony of Nathan Weirich, Lieutenant Keith Watson, and Steve Southard. Weirich testified that two fire engines and a total of seven firefighters responded to the fire; that there was a gas can located in the residence that still had fuel within it; and that there were pour patterns located in the residence, which indicated that an accelerant was used. Further, Weirich testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cQ. And can you tell the jury please, when you go to a typical house fire, would you expect to find a large quantity of gasoline inside that structure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cQ. Sir, in your experience and based upon your training, does the presence of that gasoline poured throughout the structure create a hazard to you and your firefighters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201cA. Most definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">\u201cQ. Can you tell the jury please what the hazard is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">\u201cA. The vapors off of \u2014 if it\u2019s \u2014 all depending on what the ignitable liquid is. Whether it\u2019s gasoline, kerosene, whatnot, the vapors itself can actually get into your clothing. And therefore, whenever the induction of oxygen or a heat source, fire, it can actually ignite that and your clothes can actually catch on fire also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">\u201cQ. Sir, would that presence be an unusual risk as far as responding to a fire such as this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">\u201cQ. Create a risk \u2014 if that flame were to get into your clothing and ignite, would that create a risk of harm to you? Would that cause you harm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">\u201cA. Most definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\">\u201cQ. Sir, could it go so far as to cause, based again, based on your training and experience, cause you or another firefighter to suffer the peril of death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-18\">{\u00b6 48} Lieutenant Watson testified that he arrived at Wolfs residence and that \u201cthe first thing that you notice[d] when you went inside the residence was the overwhelming smell of what appeared to be gasoline.\u201d According to Lieutenant Watson, gasoline presents a hazard to firefighters \u201cbecause it makes the fire very unpredictable.\u201d In regards to gasoline vapors, Lieutenant Watson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-19\">\u201cQ. What happens, sir, when there\u2019s too much gasoline where the concentration is too high?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cA. The gasoline vapors become too rich. They dispose the oxygen. It will not support combustion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">\u201cQ. What do we need for combustion then? We need?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cA. Approximately 1.5 to 7.6 percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cQ. Of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cA. Of gasoline vapors in the air is the flammable range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201cQ. Sir, is it a fair analogy when your \u2014 like when your car is flooded, there\u2019s too much goes [sic], not enough oxygen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">\u201cQ. At that point then, what happens with the fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">\u201cA. It will go out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">{\u00b6 49} Steve Southard, a fire and explosion investigator employed at the State Fire Marshall\u2019s Office, testified that in fighting and determining a fire there are three elements you look for: fuel load, ambient oxygen in the air, and a heat source or ignition source. Southard testified that he saw \u201cignitible liquid pour patterns on the floor along the couch, on the east wall, and in front of the entertainment system on the west wall.\u201d Further, Southard testified that there was \u201cignitable liquid poured throughout the structure to cause serious damage to the structure.\u201d Southard testified to the meaning of the burn patterns, that there was a prevalent smell of gasoline, and that the fire was intentionally set.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">{\u00b6 50} Southard examined the structure and found that the \u201cgarage door had evidence of what appeared to be like a shockwave damage from inside to outside.* * * It blew out away from the structure. The whole left side of the door was ajar, so I knew at that point that there was an explosion involved in this.\u201d Southard examined the structure and determined that there were two points of origin and that the origin of the explosion was at the garage door inside the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">{\u00b6 51} In regards to the gasoline vapors, Southard testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-16\">\u201cA. The vapors of gasoline inside were very, very high. In our scientific data, gasoline will ignite with 1.4 percent vapors up to 7.6 percent vapors or percentages of vapor in a room. With the amount of gasoline and the liquid surface area, the vapors inside the structure were much greater than 7.6 percent, so the higher explosive limits of gasoline would not ignite with the small fire that was inside. There is no oxygen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-17\">\u201cThe vapors displace the oxygen inside the room. The vapors are very, very high, very present. When that garage door was opened, it allowed a column of fresh oxygen into the room at the ignition source or origin of the fire, and the rapid development of fire, which we call a deflagration, created a big plume or shockwave, and it traveled in the direction the oxygen was being received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cSo when the door opened, the fire blew out that garage door. The fire then \u2014 the pressure in the fire traveled out the garage door, and then the pressure inside the mobile home became so great that it slammed the door shut, and then that increased additional pressure out in the garage, which the direction of the shockwave was right toward the garage door. That\u2019s what caused the garage door to blow out.\u201d Southard testified that \u201c[w]hen the vapor and oxygen mix with an ignition source, there was an explosion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 52} Southard testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u201cQ. Sir, you talked about the idea of a low pressure explosion and a high pressure explosion. Mr. Heckman asked you about the degree of force. A high pressure explosion, what\u2019s the result of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201cA. Well, to give you an example of what maybe happened in this situation, if the door from the garage door was open fully and remained open, that large column of oxygen would have mixed within all that gasoline through the entire structure. We may have had a deflagration or explosion that would have leveled that entire structure because of the vapors inside. That didn\u2019t occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On cross-examination, Southard stated that the fire was \u201cobviously easy to put out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 53} Although Southard testified that the fire was \u201cobviously easy to put out,\u201d whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm does not depend upon the actual results of the fire. <em>Eggeman, </em>2004-Ohio-6495, 2004 WL 2785951, at \u00b6 14. Instead, the issue is whether Wolf was \u201caware that the fire or explosion he set will probably create a substantial risk of serious physical harm.\u201d The evidence clearly indicates that Wolf saturated his trailer with gasoline throughout the trailer and set it on fire. The trailer was located in a mobile-home park, which contained several other mobile homes. Given that the fire was set in a trailer located in a mobile home park with other mobile homes nearby, the fire in the trailer was likely to be reported and firefighters dispatched to the scene quickly. A reasonable jury could infer that when Wolf poured gasoline throughout his trailer and set it on fire, he knowingly created a strong possibility of a risk of serious physical harm to others, including firefighters responding to the fire and individuals living in the mobile-home park.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">{\u00b6 54} Therefore, after reviewing the record, in a light most favorable to the prosecution, I would find that there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find Wolf guilty of aggravated arson under R.C. 2909.02. Moreover, since I would overrule Wolfs second assignment of error, I would have found that the first, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are not moot. Consequently, I must dissent in part from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
