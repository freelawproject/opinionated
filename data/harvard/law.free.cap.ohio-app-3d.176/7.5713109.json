For the reason that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">{\u00b6 2} On January 12, 2001, Anthony Mericle and Jennifer Nahorny leased an apartment at Riverview Apartments in Rossford, Ohio. Riverview is owned by appellant Oak Hill Investment Company. Christine Besozzi was cosigner for the tenants, guaranteeing the terms of the lease. One of these terms was an obligation to \u201creturn said premises to lessor, or agent, in the same condition of repair as when received,* * * reasonable wear and tear excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">{\u00b6 3} On April 26, 2001, there was a fire at Mericle and Nahorny\u2019s apartment. The cause of the fire was determined to be the tenants\u2019 negligence. Damages were later set at $87,645.38, all but $1,000 of which was paid to appellant Oak Hill by appellant Erie Insurance Group under Oak Hill\u2019s casualty policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">{\u00b6 4} On April 5, 2005, appellants sued Nahorny and Besozzi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to recover damages: Nahorny for negligence and breach of contract and Besozzi on her guarantee of Nahorny\u2019s liability. When Nahorny failed to answer, appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>obtained a default judgment against her. Besozzi sought, but was denied, defense and indemnification against appellants\u2019 claim from the issuer of her own homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, appellee Grange Mutual Casualty. Besozzi, nevertheless, provided her own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">{\u00b6 5} Eventually Besozzi negotiated an agreement with appellants. Besozzi agreed to consent to a judgment against her in the full amount sought. Appellants would then directly pursue a claim against appellee pursuant to R.C. 3929.06(A)(2). If the claim was unsuccessful, appellants agreed to cap Besozzi\u2019s liability at $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">{\u00b6 6} Following the agreed judgment entry, appellants filed a supplemental complaint against appellee, seeking compensation under Besozzi\u2019s policy. Appellee denied liability, asserting that the damages for which Besozzi was legally responsible were for breach of contract which was not a covered \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">{\u00b6 7} The matter was submitted to the court on cross-motions for summary judgment. On August 6, 2006, without explanation, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion and granted appellee\u2019s. From this judgment, appellants now bring this appeal, setting forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cAssignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, because the Grange Insurance Contract provides coverage for appellants\u2019 judgment against Grange\u2019s insured, Besozzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cAssignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in sustaining Grange\u2019s motion for summary judgment, because appellants\u2019 claims constituted an \u2018occurrence\u2019 under the Grange insurance contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">{\u00b6 12} We shall discuss appellants\u2019 assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">{\u00b6 13} Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted only if (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can reach but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, and (3) the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267. In this matter, there is no factual dispute, only an issue as to the proper legal construction of the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by appellee to Besozzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">{\u00b6 14} Ordinarily, the construction of an insurance policy, like any written contract, is a matter of law, <em>Long Beach Assn., Inc. v. Jones </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 574, 576, 697 N.E.2d 208, citing <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Browning-Ferris Industries </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271, subject to certain well-established rules. <em>Gomolka v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 166, 167, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. Words and phrases are to be given their ordinary meaning unless something in the contract indicates a contrary intention. <em>Olmstead v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 212, 216, 51 O.O.2d 285, 259 N.E.2d 123. Where the terms of an insurance policy are clear and unambiguous, they must be applied as written and not enlarged. <em>Gomolka </em>at 168, 24 O.O.3d 274, 436 N.E.2d 1347. However, \u201c[w]here provisions of a contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">{\u00b6 15} At the time relevant to this appeal, Christine Besozzi was a named insured in a homeowner\u2019s policy that included $300,000 of personal-liability protection per occurrence. The coverage portion of this part of the policy provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cWe will pay all sums, up to our limits of liability, arising out of any one loss which an <em>insured person </em>becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of <em>bodily injury or property damage, </em>caused by an <em>occurrence </em>covered by this policy * *</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">{\u00b6 17} In the definitions portion of the policy, an <em>\u201coccurrence\u201d </em>is defined as,</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c * * * an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results in <em>bodily injury or property damage </em>during the policy period[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c <em>\u2018Property </em>damage\u2019 means physical injury to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">{\u00b6 20} The policy contains numerous exclusions, the only one of which is arguably applicable in this matter, excludes coverage for <em>\u201c[bjodily injury or property damage </em>arising out of any premises owned, rented or controlled by an <em>insured person </em>which is not an insured premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">{\u00b6 21} Appellee argues that appellants are not entitled to coverage under the policy because the claim against Besozzi was not an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the contemplation of the insurance agreement. Citing <em>Personal Serv. Ins. Co. v. Ferrell </em>(Mar. 9, 1979), 6th Dist. No. L-78-103, 1979 WL 207029, appellee insists that the sole determinant as to whether a claim is for accident coverage, as would comprise an \u201coccurrence,\u201d or some other cause is that which is pleaded in the complaint. The only claims pleaded in appellants\u2019 complaint against Besozzi, appellee points out, are allegations that she breached her contract as a cosigner to be responsible for liability incurred by Nahorny and Mericle under the lease. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Since these claims sound in contract rather than negligence, they do not constitute an insurable \u201coccurrence\u201d under the terms of the policy, according to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">{\u00b6 22} Alternatively, appellee argues, should we conclude that the claims against Besozzi qualify for coverage, she is still excluded by the exemption that denies coverage for premises \u201crented or controlled\u201d by an insured that are not insured premises. Appellee directs our attention to the lease on which Besozzi\u2019s name may be found on lines denominated \u201cleasee.\u201d Appellee maintains that if Besozzi was a leasee, coverage is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">{\u00b6 23} We reject appellee\u2019s argument with respect to the exclusion clause. Although Besozzi\u2019s name appears on the \u201cleasee\u201d line, it is clearly modified by a parenthetic \u201cCO,\u201d referencing her status as a cosigner, a status that is clearly stated in a separate document defining her obligations as a cosigner.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">{\u00b6 24} We also reject appellee\u2019s assertion that to characterize the gravamen of the action we need look no farther than the claims pleaded in the complaint against Besozzi. Pleading need not be perfect. Courts should look to the reasonable intent of the pleadings as a whole, not to any discrete part. <em>Personal Servs. Ins. Co. v. Ferrell, </em>supra, citing <em>Boutwell v. Emps.</em>\u2019 <em>Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>(C.A.5, 1949), 175 F.2d 597. Consequently, we have examined all of the facts pleaded in appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">{\u00b6 25} There is no question that the fire at the Riverview Apartments was an accident. Thus, it would meet the definition of an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy at issue \u2014 if Nahorny or Mericle were insureds under the policy. But Nahorny and Mericle were not insureds under the policy. The only connection between this insurance policy and the damages resulting from this \u201coccurrence\u201d is the contract entered into by Besozzi as cosigner and guarantor of Nahorny\u2019s and Mericle\u2019s liability under the lease. Thus the claims advanced here are contractual and not within the scope of the coverage granted in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, neither of appellants\u2019 assignments of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">{\u00b6 27} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellants are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Wood County.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-11\">Pietrykowski, P.J., and Handwork, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-16\">.
