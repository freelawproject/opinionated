For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 2} Moorer was convicted of several crimes below. He currently challenges only his conviction for improperly discharging a firearm at or into a habitation, in violation of R.C. 2923.161(A)(1), with two accompanying firearm specifications. In his first assignment of error, Moorer contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of this crime. Moorer is correct. We note that the state concedes this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 3} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, we must examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 2923.161(A)(1) provides, \u201cNo person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly do any of the following: (1) Discharge a firearm at or into an occupied structure that is a permanent or temporary habitation of any individual.\u201d At trial, the state presented evidence that Moorer had fired a gun while inside Ramona Hill\u2019s apartment. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we cannot say that the state proved the essential elements of R.C. 2923.161(A)(1) beyond a reasonable doubt. The plain language of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>indicates that the proscribed conduct of \u201cdischarging a firearm\u201d must occur from outside the dwelling that is fired \u201cat or into.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 5} Reading R.C. 2923.161(A)(1) in context with the statute as a whole further supports this conclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> R.C. 2923.161 is entitled \u201cImproperly discharging firearm at or into habitation; school-related offenses.\u201d Subsection (A)(1) prohibits firing \u201cat or into\u201d a habitation. In contrast, R.C. 2923.161(A)(2) prohibits discharging a firearm \u201cat, <em>in, </em>or into a school safety zone.\u201d We agree with the Fifth Appellate District that \u201c[h]ad the drafters of R.C. 2923.161 intended to prohibit discharging a firearm <em>in </em>a habitation, they could have, and presumably would have included the same language in subsection (A)(1) as in (A)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 6} Since Moorer was convicted of discharging a firearm \u201cat or into\u201d a habitation based upon the state\u2019s evidence that he had fired a gun \u201cin\u201d a habitation, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for a violation of R.C. 2923.161(A)(1) and the accompanying firearm specifications. We sustain Moorer\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 7} Moorer\u2019s second assignment of error, challenging the weight of the evidence, and his third assignment of error, challenging the trial court\u2019s sentence on the specifications to the R.C. 2923.161 charge are moot. We therefore decline to address them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 8} In sum, Moorer\u2019s conviction for violating R.C. 2923.161(A)(1) is reversed, and on this count and the accompanying specifications, he is discharged from further prosecution. His remaining convictions of record, which include two counts of having a weapon under a disability with one accompanying specification, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-10\">Painter, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\">. <em>State v.
