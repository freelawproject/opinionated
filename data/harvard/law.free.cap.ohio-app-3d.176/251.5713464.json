Roberts, appellant, petitioned for a civil protection order against appellee, Keith Skaggs. The court granted an ex parte order, and the case proceeded to a full hearing before a magistrate. The magistrate recommended a dismissal of the petition for lack of evidence in a decision filed on April 4, 2007. The magistrate instructed the clerk to serve both parties and their attorneys on the form accompanying his decision. The record indicates that Roberts, Skaggs, and Skaggs\u2019s attorney were served but that Roberts\u2019s attorney was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 2} Neither party requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, and neither filed objections. Thereafter, on April 30, 2007, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision and dismissed the petition. On that same date, Roberts filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 3} Before addressing Roberts\u2019s assigned errors, we address Skaggs\u2019s argument that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Roberts\u2019s appeal. According to Skaggs, this court lacks jurisdiction because Roberts indicated in the notice of appeal that she was appealing from the order entered on \u201cApril 4, 2007,\u201d and because that order \u2014 the magistrate\u2019s decision \u2014 is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 4} A magistrate\u2019s decision that has not been adopted or modified by the trial court is not a final order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe decision remains interlocutory until the trial court reviews the decision, adopts or modifies the decision, and enters a judgment that determines all the claims for relief in the action or determines that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 5} In this case, the magistrate\u2019s decision was interlocutory until the trial court adopted it in a judgment entry that was journalized on April 30, 2007. On that date, the magistrate\u2019s decision became a part of a final judgment. Roberts filed her notice of appeal on the same date. Thus, the record demonstrates that Roberts has appealed from a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Notice of Appeal Defect</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">{\u00b6 6} We must now decide whether this court can entertain Roberts\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s decision even though she referred only to the magistrate\u2019s decision in her notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>{\u00b6 7} App.R. 3(D) provides that the notice of appeal shall \u201cdesignate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from.\u201d In this case, Roberts did not provide the date of the trial court\u2019s judgment in her notice of appeal, but she did timely file her notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 8} One purpose of a notice of appeal is to apprise an opposing party of the taking of an appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court has discretion to overlook a defect in a timely filed notice of appeal if there is no prejudice in the attainment of this purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While we recognize that Roberts\u2019s notice of appeal did not strictly comply with App.R. 3(D), we cannot discern any prejudice resulting from this deficiency. Roberts\u2019s notice of appeal contained the correct trial court number, and Roberts\u2019s petition was the only matter disposed of under that number. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion and overlook the deficiency in Roberts\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 9} We now address Roberts\u2019s first assignment of error. Roberts argues that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision because her attorney was not served with the magistrate\u2019s decision as required by the civil rules. She alleges that as a result, her attorney was unaware of the magistrate\u2019s decision in time to properly object. Roberts requests that this court reverse the trial court\u2019s decision, remand the case, and allow her to proceed as if her attorney had just been served with the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Service of a Magistrate\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 10} Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(iii) requires that the magistrate\u2019s decision be in writing and timely served on all parties or their attorneys: \u201c[a] magistrate\u2019s decision shall be in writing, identified as a magistrate\u2019s decision in the caption, signed by the magistrate, filed with the clerk, and served by the clerk on all parties or their attorneys no later than three days after the decision is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> {\u00b6 11} Where a party is represented by an attorney of record, Civ.R. 5(B) requires service upon that attorney in most circumstances: \u201c[wjhenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party who is represented by an attorney of record in the proceedings, the service shall be made upon the attorney unless service upon the party is ordered by the court.\u201d The last part of this rule is applicable only when the court \u201cexpressly orders\u201d that service be made upon the party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Logically, the court\u2019s express order should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>indicate to the clerk that the party is to be served to the exclusion of the attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, absent an express order by the court indicating otherwise, if a party is represented by an attorney of record, service, when required, should be made upon that attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 12} In discussing the rationale for this rule and in determining its applicability to decisions from administrative agencies, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca party represented by counsel usually speaks through his counsel,\u201d and \u201c[c]ounsel is in a better position to understand the legal import of any documents required to be served on his or her client and the nature of the action to be taken.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 13} In holding that the provisions of Civ.R. 5(B) apply to magistrates\u2019 decisions, the Ninth Appellate District has stated that \u201cthe failure to provide notice to the attorney of record frustrates the process of review of a magistrate\u2019s decision and is contrary to the mandates of the civil rules.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the rationale of the Ninth Appellate District and hold that the clerk in this case was required under Civ.R. 5(B) to serve Roberts\u2019s attorney of record with the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 14} Importantly, Civ.R. 53 provides a party with the right to request from the magistrate findings of fact and conclusions of law<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and to file objections<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the magistrate\u2019s decision. But these actions must be completed in a timely manner, and the failure to do so severely limits the party\u2019s ability to challenge the decision upon subsequent review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u25a0 {\u00b6 15} Moreover, the right to request findings of fact and conclusions of law and to file objections has little value unless the party desiring to pursue them has proper notice of the magistrate\u2019s decision. Therefore, we hold that proper notice includes service of the magistrate\u2019s decision upon a party\u2019s attorney of record in accordance with Civ.R. 5(B), unless the court expressly orders otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Proper notice is an integral component of due process. Based upon due process concerns, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that the failure to serve a party\u2019s attorney with notice of an appealable judgment actually tolls the time for filing an appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Service of a magistrate\u2019s decision upon the attorney is arguably more critical to providing due process than serving notice of an appealable judgment, because the time limits in Civ.R. 53 are triggered by the filing of the magistrate\u2019s decision, not sendee of the decision upon the parties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And these time limits are less than the 30 days provided for filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 17} This case illustrates the dangers involved by not serving the attorney of record. The magistrate filed his written decision with the clerk on April 4, 2007, triggering the seven-day limit on requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law and the 14-day limit for filing objections. Roberts was served with the magistrate\u2019s written decision, but she did not notify her attorney. This conduct was reasonable because the magistrate\u2019s decision indicated that her attorney would also be served. Roberts\u2019s attorney did not learn of the decision until later and filed a notice of appeal followed by \u201cuntimely\u201d objections. Of course, the filing of the notice of appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction to revisit its decision and to consider Roberts\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Civ.R. 53(E) Extension of Time</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 18} Despite the clerk\u2019s failure to serve Roberts\u2019s attorney, Skaggs argues that Roberts should not prevail on appeal because she failed to bring the service defect to the attention of the trial court before filing her notice of appeal. Skaggs relies upon Civ.R. 53(D)(5), which provides: \u201cFor good cause shown, the court shall allow a reasonable extension of time for a party to file a motion to set aside a magistrate\u2019s order or file objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision. \u2018Good cause\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, a failure by the clerk to timely serve the party seeking the extension with the magistrate\u2019s order or decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 19} According to Skaggs, once Roberts\u2019s attorney had learned that the magistrate had issued his written decision and that she had missed the deadline to file objections, she was required to request an extension of time from the trial court. Because she failed to ask for an extension, she should be precluded from arguing on appeal that she was denied the opportunity to resolve the matter in a hearing on objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The extension-of-time provision in Civ.R. 58(D)(5) was added when the rule was amended in 2006. The Tenth Appellate District, in <em>Watley v. Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr.,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>suggested that the new provision provides an adequate remedy to correct a defect in the clerk\u2019s service of the magistrate\u2019s decision and that a party\u2019s failure to move for an extension of time to file objections after learning of the magistrate\u2019s decision always precludes a party from alleging defective service on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 21} We are reluctant to read Civ.R. 53(D)(5) so broadly. There may be some service issues, such as the \u201cuntimely\u201d service mentioned in the rule, that arguably should be required to be brought to the attention of the trial court to preserve a due process issue for appeal. For instance, service of a magistrate\u2019s decision may be \u201cuntimely\u201d under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(iii) if it is made later than three days after the decision is filed, but service on the fourth day, while \u201cuntimely,\u201d would be within the time to request findings of fact and conclusions of law and to file objections. As a result, the party would retain the opportunity to timely object.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 22} But in this case, the clerk never served Roberts\u2019s attorney as required under Civ.R. 5(B), and her attorney did not learn that the magistrate had filed a written decision until after the important time limits had expired. Thus, this lack of notice fully impaired Roberts\u2019s rights to challenge the magistrate\u2019s decision under Civ.R. 53, and this impairment denied her due process of law. Thus, we hold that Roberts\u2019s failure to use the extension-of-time provision to correct the error did not waive her due process argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 23} That said, the more efficient and preferable course of action for parties to follow is to provide the trial court with the opportunity to correct any due process deficiencies in the first instance. And Civ.R. 53(E) now specifically allows the trial court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we sustain Roberts\u2019s first assignment of error. The failure to serve Roberts\u2019s attorney with the magistrate\u2019s decision necessitates that this case be remanded to the trial court, where Roberts can be served in accordance with Civ.R. 5(B) and retain the opportunity to timely object to the magistrate\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 25} We reverse the judgment of the trial court without reaching the other assigned error and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-7\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-13\">.
