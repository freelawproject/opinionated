Dawson and Nancy L. Dawson, appeal the decision of the Knox County Court of Common Pleas to grant the motion to reconsider of defendants-appellees, Michael Compton and Ronald Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b62} Appellants commenced this matter by filing a complaint alleging a prescriptive easement on appellees\u2019 property. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order and then set the matter for a preliminary injunction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 3} The trial court denied appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The case was set for a bench trial on June 18, 2007. On July 9, 2007, the trial court issued its findings of facts and conclusions of law, finding in favor of appellants that a prescriptive easement did exist on appellees\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 4} Appellees filed a motion to reconsider on July 11, 2007. On July 27, 2007, appellants filed a notice of appeal of the trial court\u2019s July 9, 2007 decision. <em>(.Dawson v. Compton, </em>Knox County, Case No. 07CA000020).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to reconsider on August 10, 2007. Appellants dismissed their appeal on August 15, 2007, due to the trial court\u2019s decision on August 10, 2007. Appellants then filed the present appeal of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 motion to reconsider on August 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants raise two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cI. The trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cII. The trial court erred in holding there was a permissive use of the lane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants argue in their first assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion to reconsider. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court issued its judgment on July 9, 2007. Appellants filed their notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s original judgment on July 27, 2007. As stated above, this timely appeal was number 07CA000020.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">{\u00b6 11} On July 11, 2007, appellees filed a motion to reconsider. After the trial court sustained the motion on August 10, 2007, appellants dismissed their original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>appeal. On August 24, 2007, appellants filed the present appeal of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 12} As a first matter, the Civil Rules do not permit a motion to reconsider a final judgment from a court of original jurisdiction. <em>Poulton v. Am. Economy Ins. Co., </em>5th Dist. Nos. 2002CA00038 and 2002CA00061, 2002-Ohio-7214, at \u00b6 45, citing <em>Stein v. Wyandotte Cellars, Inc. </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 477, 624 N.E.2d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 13} We find that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment granting appellees\u2019 motion to reconsider on August 10, 2007. The July 9, 2007 judgment was not only final, but the notice of appeal of July 27, 2007, invoked this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Each of these facts deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we sustain appellants\u2019 first assignment of error, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment of August 10, 2007, finding that appellants do not have a prescriptive easement and hereby reinstate the trial courts original decision of July 9, 2007, pursuant to App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 15} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error was conditioned upon this court\u2019s determination of their first assignment of error. Having sustained appellants\u2019 first assigned error, we need not address appellants\u2019 second assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 16} The August 10, 2007 judgment of the Knox County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed, we reinstate the trial court\u2019s original decision of July 9, 2007, and we enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of appellants, pursuant to App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-12\">Hoffman, P.J. and Farmer, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-18\">. We find that a statement of the facts is not necessary for the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
