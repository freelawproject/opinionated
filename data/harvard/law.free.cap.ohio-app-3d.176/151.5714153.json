(\u201cRo-Mai\u201d), appeals from the judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, affirming the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission\u2019s decision to award unemployment benefits to its former employee. This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">{\u00b6 2} Claimant-appellee Paul Weinberg began working at Ro-Mai on October 24, 2005. Twelve days later, Weinberg telephoned Ro-Mai\u2019s owner, Robert Maier, to notify him that he was quitting. On November 7, 2005, Weinberg filed a claim for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 3} The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services initially determined that Weinberg had quit Ro-Mai without just cause and subsequently affirmed its decision upon redetermination. Weinberg appealed that decision to the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission (\u201cUCRC\u201d), which held a hearing on May 12, 2006. Maier was unable to attend the hearing, so Weinberg\u2019s testimony was unopposed. On May 16, 2006, the hearing officer issued his decision reversing the redetermination decision and finding that Weinberg had quit RoMai with just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 4} Upon Ro-Mai\u2019s request for review, UCRC remanded the matter for an additional hearing so that both Weinberg and Maier could present evidence. On October 2, 2006, the hearing officer affirmed his previous decision. Ro-Mai then appealed to UCRC again, but it declined to review the decision a second time. Consequently, Ro-Mai appealed UCRC\u2019s decision to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. That court reviewed the hearing officer\u2019s decision and affirmed. Ro-Mai has timely appealed the court\u2019s decision, raising one assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">The trial court failed to consider evidence in the record when which was unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence. [Sic.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">{\u00b6 5} Ro-Mai argues that the trial court erred in affirming UCRC\u2019s decision because it was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Ro-Mai argues that Weinberg quit his employment without just cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">{\u00b6 6} We begin with a discussion of the applicable standard of review. This court \u201cmay only reverse an unemployment compensation eligibility decision by [UCRC] if the decision is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Upton v. Rapid Mailing Servs., </em>9th Dist. No. 21714, 2004-Ohio-966, 2004 WL 384362, \u00b6 9. When an appellate court reviews the common pleas court\u2019s review, it applies the same standard. <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 696-697, 653 N.E.2d 1207. In such cases, this court is \u201crequired to focus on the decision of [UCRC], rather than that of the common pleas court.\u201d <em>Markovich v. Emps. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Unity, Inc., </em>9th Dist. No. 21826, 2004-Ohio-4193, 2004 WL 1778815, at \u00b6 10, citing <em>Barilla v.

Oberlin College </em>(Dec. 27, 2000), 9th Dist.

Cincinnati </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 12, 19, 526 N.E.2d 1350; see, also, <em>Long v. Hurles </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 228, 233, 680 N.E.2d 722 (stating that the appellate court is to begin with the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are correct). \u201c[I]f the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction, we must give it that interpretation which is consistent with the verdict and judgment, most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s verdict and judgment.\u201d <em>Karches, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 19, 526 N.E.2d 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 8} The resolution of factual questions is chiefly within the UCRC\u2019s scope of review. <em>Tzangas, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 696, 653 N.E.2d 1207; <em>Irvine v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. The courts\u2019 role is to determine whether the decision of the UCRC is supported by evidence in the certified record. <em>Durgan v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 545, 551, 674 N.E.2d 1208, citing <em>Tzangas, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 696, 653 N.E.2d 1207; <em>Irvine, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 18, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, citing <em>Kilgore v. Bd. of Rev. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio App.2d 69, 71, 31 O.O.2d 108, 206 N.E.2d 423. If the reviewing court finds that that support is found, then the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the UCRC. <em>Durgan, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 551, 674 N.E.2d 1208, citing <em>Wilson v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Rev. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 309, 310, 14 OBR 374, 471 N.E.2d 168. \u201cThe fact that reasonable minds might reach different conclusions is not a basis for the reversal of the [UCRC\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Irvine, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 18, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587; citing <em>Craig v. Bur. of Unemp.

R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a); <em>Upton v. Rapid Mailing Serv., </em>9th Dist. No. 21714, 2004-Ohio-966, 2004 WL 384362, at \u00b6 13. Traditionally, in the statutory sense, \u201cjust cause\u201d has been defined as \u201c \u2018that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irvine, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, quoting <em>Peyton v. Sun T.V. </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 12, 73 O.O.2d 8, 335 N.E.2d 751. The determination of whether an employer had just cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>terminate an employee is a factual question primarily within the province of UCRC, and one that reviewing courts are precluded from inquiring into during these administrative appeals. <em>Roberts v. Hayes, </em>9th Dist. No. 21550, 2003-Ohio-5903, 2003 WL 22491362, at \u00b6 20, citing <em>Durgan, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 551, 674 N.E.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 10} The hearing officer made the following findings of fact. Weinberg accepted a position at Ro-Mai after interviewing with Maier. Weinberg, who had extensive experience in sales, was told that his position at Ro-Mai would involve sales work and would require him to be at the office from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. After a few days of work, however, it became clear that Weinberg\u2019s actual duties differed from the job description that he received. He was not given any sales work, and he often worked well over the nine-hour shift that he was promised. Moreover, Weinberg discovered that Maier had a habit of yelling at the employees. Although Weinberg told Maier that he did not appreciate being treated in that manner, Maier continued to yell.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 11} On November 3, 2005, Weinberg informed Ro-Mai\u2019s head of human resources that he intended to quit. However, before Weinberg left the office, Maier sought him out, promised to stop yelling at him, and convinced him to stay. Weinberg returned to work the next day, and Maier resumed his habit of yelling at him. Accordingly, Weinberg quit the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 12} The hearing officer determined that a reasonable person in Weinberg\u2019s position would have quit his employment. He noted that Ro-Mai had misrepresented Weinberg\u2019s job duties and the number of hours that he would be expected to work as a salaried employee. Further, the hearing officer placed much emphasis on the fact that Maier \u201ccontinuously yelled at [Weinberg], despite [Weinberg\u2019s] attempts to stop such behavior * * * by talking to [Maier] and to human resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 13} Ro-Mai argues that Weinberg voluntarily quit because he did not want to work more than eight hours a day, as a salaried employee sometimes must do, and he did not enjoy the type of work that Ro-Mai assigned him. It further argues that Weinberg was overly sensitive to Maier\u2019s yelling, and that Maier\u2019s conduct had never caused any other employee to quit. Ro-Mai raised these arguments in front of the hearing officer, who had an opportunity to consider them. Maier admitted that he often yelled at his employees. During the hearing, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">When I hired [Weinberg], I told him I\u2019m probably the worst employer to ever work for * * *. I\u2019m difficult. I expect a lot. And I warned him in advance that I\u2019m very difficult. * * * [W]hen it comes to the business, * * * I can yell. I did yell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Weinberg testified that when he complained to human resources about Maier\u2019s yelling, he was told: \u201c[0]h, it[ ] gets worse. That\u2019s the way he is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 14} Maier\u2019s yelling was not a single, isolated incident. Compare <em>Shackelford v. St. Thomas Hosp. </em>(Sept. 4, 1985), 9th Dist. No. 12084, 1985 WL 10837, at 2 (holding that an employee did not have just cause to quit based on one incident in which a supervisor yelled at her for half an hour). It was a repetitive problem that Weinberg unsuccessfully tried to address with Ro-Mai\u2019s human resources department prior to quitting. Weinberg even agreed to resume work the first time that he intended to quit because Maier asked him to stay and promised to stop yelling. He did not abandon his employment without warning or leave with utter disregard for the good of the business. See <em>Markovich, </em>2004-Ohio-4193, 2004 WL 1778815, at \u00b6 8 (noting that a concern for an employer\u2019s best interests is a factor courts look to when determining fault and just cause). Based on the evidence, we cannot conclude that the decision was unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, Ro-Mai\u2019s sole assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 15} Ro-Mai\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-9\">Moore, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b194-10\">Slaby, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b194-11\">Slaby, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">{\u00b6 16} I respectfully dissent. No other Ro-Mai employee quit because of the yelling. This, therefore, obviates the hearing officer\u2019s determination that a reasonable person would quit in such a situation. While it may be uncomfortable for an employee to have an employer yell at him or her, if we were to take the reasoning of the hearing officer to its ultimate conclusion, there would be reasonable ground for quitting just because one employee simply raised his voice at another. I would find being yelled at, as a matter of law, is not just cause to qualify for unemployment benefits. I would reverse and remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-13\">Baird, J., retired, of the Ninth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
