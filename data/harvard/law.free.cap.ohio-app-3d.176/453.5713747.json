On appeal, appellant sets forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cAssignment of Error: The trial court erred in finding no genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintifPappellant Rogelio Gomez was exposed to asbestosis material during the course of his employment with defendant/appellee Sauder Woodworking Company and thereby granting defendant/appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">{\u00b6 3} This case arose when appellant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against two former employers, Sauder and ConAgra Grocery Product Company, LaChoy Division (\u201cConAgra\u201d), and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cbureau\u201d). Appellant alleged that he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because he was exposed to asbestos during his employment by both Sauder and ConAgra, which caused him to develop asbestos-related injuries. Appellant\u2019s claim was denied at all administrative levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On February 24, 2005, appellant appealed the denial of his claims by filing a complaint in the common pleas court against both of his former employers, and the Bureau (\u201ccase No. 05CV000026\u201d). Case No. 05CV000026 was later dismissed by appellant and refiled on December 4, 2006. On November 7, 2007, attorneys for appellant, ConAgra, and the bureau filed a joint stipulation dismissing appellant\u2019s claims against ConAgra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 5} On August 13, 2007, Sauder filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum in support, in which it asserted that appellant\u2019s injuries were not caused by asbestos exposure that occurred while appellant was working for Sauder. Attached to Sauder\u2019s memorandum was Sauder\u2019s request for an admission by appellant that he was not exposed to asbestos during his employment at Sauder, which appellant denied. Also attached was a \u201csupplemental interrogatory,\u201d in which Sauder asked appellant to respond to its earlier unanswered request for identification of all job duties and/or locations at Sauder where appellant was exposed to asbestos. In addition, Sauder referred to the deposition testimony of its employee, Richard Winzeler,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which Winzeler said he did not know whether appellant was exposed to asbestos while employed at Sauder.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">{\u00b6 6} On September 26, 2007, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, in which he asserted that contrary to Sauder\u2019s position, there was evidence to support that he was exposed to asbestos while working at Sauder. In support of his response, appellant attached a letter from Sauder\u2019s Director of Environmental Health and Safety, which stated the company\u2019s position that appellant could not have been exposed to \u201casbestos containing materials of any kind during his work experience at Sauder.\u201d To rebut the letter, appellant attached the affidavit of Naeem A. Lughmani, M.D., and appellant\u2019s response to Sauder\u2019s supplemental interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 7} In his affidavit, Dr. Lughmani stated that appellant suffered from an asbestos-related lung disease known as \u201cpleural thickening,\u201d which was confirmed by a CT scan performed on May 9, 2003. Lughmani further stated that he completed a questionnaire based on questions posed to appellant regarding his medical history, in which appellant stated that he was exposed to asbestos while working at Sauder. Lughmani concluded that appellant\u2019s condition, \u201can asbestos related problem shown on CT scan, was more likely than not caused from his asbestos exposure from pipe coverings at his work at Sauder Woodworking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In his reply to Sauder\u2019s supplemental interrogatory, appellant stated that while employed at Sauder as a glue coater and later as a utility man, he was in many different buildings \u201cand was exposed to asbestos many times while working in the buildings.\u201d Appellant specifically stated that he was exposed to and inhaled asbestos dust while working in Warehouse Number 1, which was demolished during appellant\u2019s term of employment. Appellant also stated that he worked in the Elm Street building and the Sauder Street plant, in which he helped to clean up asbestos after a fire. Included as part of appellant\u2019s response was a map of the Sauder compound. Portions of the map were highlighted to show which buildings appellant worked in while employed by Sauder.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant also referred to Winzeler\u2019s deposition testimony. In addition to the statements relied upon by Sauder, Winzeler stated in his deposition that he managed asbestos abatement projects in 1988 and 1996 at Sauder\u2019s Elm Street Plant and its Products Center. The abatement included removing asbestos insulation from steam heating pipes in those buildings. Winzeler testified that prior to removal of the asbestos, the buddings were heated by blowing air over heated coils near the ceiling. Winzeler did not know whether any asbestos was removed prior to 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant further relied on his own deposition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which appellant stated that he worked for Sauder from 1986 until 2000. The last seven years of his employment, he traveled from building to building, performing tasks as needed. Appellant stated that he also worked in the \u201cmill,\u201d which was dusty and had buckling insulation around the heating pipes. Appellant testified that when the heating pipes were replaced, he was told by unidentified \u201cmaintenance people\u201d that the insulation material being removed was asbestos. Appellant said that his job duties also included picking up oil-soaked insulation from leaking pipes and placing it in barrels for disposal and that the materials he disposed of were identical to the asbestos materials he handled at his previous job for ConAgra.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant stated that he was a smoker until 1974 and that he served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969. At the time of the deposition, in addition to asbestosis, appellant said that he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease, asthma, and sleep apnea. Appellant also said that he was fired from Sauder in 2000, after which he began seeing a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 12} On October 2, 2007, Sauder filed a reply, in which it stated that appellant\u2019s response to the supplemental interrogatory should be disregarded by the trial court because it contained self-serving hearsay, contradicted statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>made in appellant\u2019s deposition, and was submitted solely to create an issue of fact and avoid the granting of summary judgment to Sauder. Appellant filed a motion for leave to file a surreply; however, the motion was never granted by the trial court, and is therefore presumed to have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 13} On October 5, 2007, the trial court filed a judgment entry in which it found that appellant failed to present any evidence that he was exposed to asbestos while working for Sauder. The trial court further found that appellant\u2019s response affidavit consisted of his own self-serving statement and did not include names of anyone who could corroborate his claim of asbestos exposure or any other evidence that he was exposed to asbestos. The trial court also noted that appellant was a smoker for years and was exposed to asbestos while working for ConAgra. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that although appellant undoubtedly suffered from an asbestos-related disease, appellant was \u201cunable to support any of his allegations of exposure to asbestos while working at Sauder.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court granted summary judgment to Sauder and dismissed appellant\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. A timely notice of appeal was filed on November 2, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 14} In his sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Sauder. In support, appellant argues that he presented evidence through Winzeler\u2019s testimony that several of Sauder\u2019s buildings did, indeed, contain asbestos and that the asbestos was blown down from heating pipes near the ceiling. Appellant further argues that through his deposition, he presented unrebutted evidence that (1) he worked in buildings that contained asbestos-insulated pipes and (2) he disposed of oil-soaked asbestos insulation as part of his job. Accordingly, appellant argues that he presented evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether, while working at Sauder, he was exposed to asbestos that proximately caused his asbestos-related disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 15} We note at the outset that an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198; <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment will be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 16} Initially, the party seeking summary judgment bears the burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying portions of the record demonstrating an absence of genuine issues of material fact as to the essential elements of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The motion may be filed \u201cwith or without supporting affidavits.\u201d Civ.R. 56(A). Thereafter, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show why summary judgment is inappropriate. Civ.R. 56(E). \u201cIf the non-movant fails to respond, or fails to support its response with evidence of the kind required by Civ.R. 56(C), the court may enter summary judgment in favor of the moving party.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Ford Motor Co., </em>3d Dist. No. 1-05-41, 2005-Ohio-6415, 2005 WL 3274868, \u00b6 11; Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"> {\u00b6 17} Pursuant to R.C. 4123.512, decisions as to a party\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation system due to a specific injury are appealable to the court of common pleas of the jurisdiction in which the injury occurred. <em>Wean v. Mabe, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-T-0064, 2007-Ohio-1774, 2007 WL 1113256, \u00b6 20, fn. 5, citing <em>Schultz v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 310, 2002-Ohio-3622, 772 N.E.2d 1253, \u00b6 10-11. On appeal, the claimant has the burden of going forward, as well as the ultimate burden of proof. <em>Morehead v. Mayfield </em>(May 1, 1986), 5th Dist. No. CA-799, 1986 WL 5267. In order to establish a right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund, a claimant must show that he or she was exposed to asbestos, that that exposure took place at the employer\u2019s facility, and that it was the proximate cause of the claimant\u2019s injury. <em>Snyder, </em>supra, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 18} The term \u201cproximate cause,\u201d as used in workers\u2019 compensation cases, is \u201c \u2018a happening or event which as a natural and continuous sequence produces an injury without which the result would not have occurred.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Zavasnik v. Lyons Transp. Lines, Inc. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 374, 377, 685 N.E.2d 567. In other words, but for the exposure to asbestos, an asbestos-related illness would not have occurred. Id. In addition, in cases in which expert medical testimony is required to establish a causal connection between the exposure and a subsequent medical condition, \u201cthe proof must establish a probability and not a mere possibility of such causal connection.\u201d <em>Randall v. Mihm </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 402, 406, 616 N.E.2d 1171; <em>Snyder, </em>supra. \u201cProof by a reasonable degree of medical probability means that the condition more likely than not caused the injury.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 454, 461, 664 N.E.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 19} The record contains undisputed evidence that appellant worked for Sauder between 1986 and 2000. Appellant testified that during that time, he handled insulation material from the overhead heating pipes in several of Sauder\u2019s buildings, including Warehouse 1, the Elm Street plant, and the Sauder plant. Although appellant did not claim to have first-hand knowledge of the nature of the materials he removed from Sauder\u2019s buildings, appellant testified in his deposition that other workers told him the insulation material was asbestos. In addition, appellant testified that the materials he handled at Sauder were identical to the asbestos he was exposed to while working for ConAgra. Winzeler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>testified that in 1998, he supervised the removal of asbestos from heating pipes in the Elm Street plant and in 1996, asbestos was removed from the \u201cProducts Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 20} As to appellant\u2019s medical condition, Lughmani stated in his affidavit that appellant was suffering from \u201cpleural effusion,\u201d an asbestos-related condition. Lughmani concluded that it was \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d i.e., probable, that appellant was exposed to asbestos during his employment with Sauder.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 21} This court has considered the entire record that was before the trial court and, upon consideration thereof, finds that appellant\u2019s testimony and affidavit, Winzeler\u2019s testimony, and Lughmani\u2019s medical opinion, taken together, constitute evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether appellant was exposed to asbestos during his employment at Sauder, which resulted in appellant contracting an asbestos-related disease. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it found that appellant had presented no evidence to support his claim and granted summary judgment to Sauder on that basis. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is, therefore, well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 22} The judgment of the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision and judgment entry. Appellee, Sauder, is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Fulton County.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-9\">Pietrykowski, P.J., and Handwork, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">.
