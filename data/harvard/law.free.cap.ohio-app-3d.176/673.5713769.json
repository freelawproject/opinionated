Cardwell, appeals the sentence entered by the Franklin County Municipal Court following her convictions for failing to maintain an assured cleared distance ahead (\u201cACDA\u201d) and failing to stop after an accident (\u201chit-skip\u201d). Because R.C. 2929.28(A) prohibited the trial court from imposing restitution for a minor misdemeanor and because the victim\u2019s economic loss was not a direct and proximate result of appellant\u2019s hit-skip offense, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 2} On August 16, 2006, appellant was driving a car west on Livingston Avenue in Columbus, Ohio, when she struck the rear of another car driven by Deborah Fraime. Fraime\u2019s car was stopped in the left lane waiting to make a left turn onto Ninth Street. Immediately following the impact, appellant pulled around Fraime\u2019s car and turned left onto Ninth Street. Appellant stopped on Ninth Street and motioned for Fraime to pull behind her. Fraime immediately called the police. After getting permission from the police to move her car from the immediate scene of the accident, Fraime turned left onto Ninth Street and pulled up behind appellant\u2019s car. After Fraime stopped, appellant immediately drove away. However, Fraime got the license number of appellant\u2019s car. The accident caused some property damage to Fraime\u2019s car, but neither Fraime nor her passenger was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 3} Two weeks later Fraime saw appellant\u2019s car parked in front of a house. Fraime called the police. The police impounded the car. Although the car was registered in the name of a third party, appellant admitted that she was the person driving the car at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">{\u00b6 4} On October 3, 2006, the Columbus Police filed traffic tickets in the Franklin County Municipal Court charging appellant with ACDA in violation of Columbus City Code Section 2133.03(A), a minor misdemeanor, and hit-skip in violation of Columbus City Code Section 2135.12(A), a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant waived her right to a jury trial, and the case was tried to the court on May 1, 2007. The trial court found appellant guilty of both charges. The trial court imposed a fine of $125 and costs but suspended $50 of the f\u00edne for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>one day of jail credit. In addition, the trial court imposed a 90-day jail sentence but suspended 89 days of the sentence and placed appellant on probation for two years. As a condition of probation, the trial court ordered appellant to pay Fraime restitution in the amount of $771.94. Lastly, the trial court imposed a class-five driver\u2019s-rights suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant now appeals assigning the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">The trial court erred in ordering restitution on the charge of leaving the scene of an accident as the victim\u2019s loss was not a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense, as required by R.C. 2929.28(A)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2929.28(A) governs the trial court\u2019s authority to impose restitution as part of a criminal sanction for misdemeanor offenses and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to section 2947.23 of the Revised Code, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">(1) Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim against the offender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 8} Therefore, R.C. 2929.28(A) prohibits the trial court from imposing restitution as a sanction if the offense is a minor misdemeanor. Moreover, if the trial court imposes restitution for a misdemeanor offense, \u201crestitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.28(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 9} Here, the parties do not dispute that the trial court could not order restitution based upon appellant\u2019s conviction for ACDA because that offense is a minor misdemeanor. The issue before us is whether the trial court was authorized to impose restitution as a sanction based upon appellant\u2019s hit-skip conviction, a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant contends in her sole assignment of error that the trial court could not impose restitution as a condition of probation because the economic loss suffered by Fraime was not \u201ca direct and proximate result\u201d of the hit-skip offense. Appellant argues that the trial court was not authorized to order restitution because her hit-skip conviction, which was based on conduct that occurred after the accident, could not have caused the victim\u2019s property damage as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">{\u00b6 11} By enacting R.C. 2929.28(A), the state legislature limited a trial court\u2019s authority to impose restitution as part of a criminal sentence for misdemeanor convictions. The statute permits the trial court to order restitution for economic loss suffered by the victim for certain misdemeanor offenses, but the amount of restitution \u201cshall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.28(A)(1). In addition, \u201ceconomic loss\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cany economic detriment suffered by a victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.01(M). Here, Fraime suffered no economic loss as a direct and proximate result of appellant\u2019s hit-skip conviction because the property damage to Fraime\u2019s vehicle occurred before the hit-skip violation. Therefore, the trial court could not order restitution as part of a criminal sanction. See <em>Columbus v. Repine, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-250, 2007-Ohio-5015, 2007 WL 2773839 (victim\u2019s economic loss was a direct and proximate result of a defendant\u2019s conviction for driving without an operator\u2019s license where the victim\u2019s economic loss occurred after the unlawful conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Plaintiff-appellee, city of Columbus, argues that Fraime\u2019s economic loss was a direct and proximate result of the hit-skip conviction because an accident or collision is a prerequisite for a hit-skip offense. Columbus City Code Section 2135.12. According to the city, because Fraime\u2019s economic loss was \u201ca reasonably foreseeable indirect consequence\u201d of the hit-skip offense, the trial court had authority to order restitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 13} The city\u2019s argument is logically flawed. Just because there must be an accident or collision before a hit-skip violation can occur does not establish that the property damage resulted from the hit-skip violation. As appellant points out, the property damage from the collision existed regardless of whether the appellant subsequently left the scene of the accident. Therefore, the property damage could not have been a direct and proximate result of the hit-skip violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">{\u00b6 14} The legal authorities cited by the city in support of its argument are distinguishable. In <em>State v. Hunt, </em>Knox App. No. 04-CA-000005, 2004-Ohio-5519, 2004 WL 2335804, the defendant collided with a horse-drawn buggy and caused serious injuries to one of the buggy\u2019s occupants. The defendant then fled the scene of the accident. The defendant entered a guilty plea to one count of leaving the scene of an accident. The trial court placed the defendant on community control and ordered him to pay restitution to the injured victim. Although the <em>Hunt </em>court affirmed the order of restitution, it did not address how the victim\u2019s economic loss was a direct and proximate result of the defendant\u2019s flight from the accident scene. Presumably, because the victim suffered serious personal injuries, the <em>Hunt </em>court believed that the defendant\u2019s flight from the accident scene could have exacerbated those injuries. No such exacerbation can result when the victim\u2019s loss is limited to property damage and the unlawful conduct occurred after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 15} Similarly, the city\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Osborne, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88453, 2007-Ohio-3267, 2007 WL 1848946, is misplaced. <em>Osborne </em>did not involve a trial court\u2019s authority to order restitution pursuant to R.C. 2929.28(A). In <em>Osborne, </em>the trial court found the defendant guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. The defendant argued that the hit-skip charge could not be elevated to a felony pursuant to R.C. 4549.02(B) because the victim\u2019s death was not caused by the defendant\u2019s flight from the scene of the accident. The <em>Osborne </em>court disagreed noting that \u201coften, the other person involved in the accident is the first, if not the only person, on the scene who is available to render aid to the victim.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. Implicit in the <em>Osborne </em>court\u2019s reasoning is the likelihood that the defendant\u2019s conduct immediately following the accident contributed to the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Unlike <em>Osborne, </em>in the case at bar the appellant\u2019s flight from the accident scene could not have contributed to the victim\u2019s property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 17} Lastly, the city relies upon <em>State v. Foster, </em>Butler App. No. CA2005-09415, 2006-Ohio-4830, 2006 WL 2663940, and <em>Repine, </em>supra, in arguing that Fraime\u2019s property damage was a direct and proximate result of appellant\u2019s hit-skip conviction. We note, however, that both <em>Foster </em>and <em>Repine </em>involved situations in which the victims\u2019 economic loss occurred after the defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct. Neither case supports the city\u2019s argument that a trial court may order a defendant to pay restitution for economic loss that occurred before the unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">{\u00b6 18} We can certainly understand the equities underlying the trial court\u2019s imposition of restitution as a condition of appellant\u2019s community control. However, for the reasons we have articulated, the trial court lacked the authority to order restitution under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 19} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error. We reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court and remand the case to that court with instructions to remove the order of restitution as a condition of probation and to reenter judgment consistent with law in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-9\">Tyack and T. Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b716-10\">T. Bryant, J., retired, of the Third Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
