For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">Statement of the Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">{\u00b6 2} Otterbein Homes is a nonprofit corporation, which was formed in 1912, and is related to the United Methodist Church. Otterbein Homes currently operates a retirement and private living community on real property, which was formerly known as Camp St. Mary\u2019s and which was founded in 1946 by the United Brethren Church. After several mergers, the United Brethren Church became part of the United Methodist Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">{\u00b6 3} When the United Brethren Church purchased the land that became Camp St. Mary\u2019s, several private homes were located on the property. So that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the owners of the private homes would be able to remain in their homes, the church issued 99-year leases to the homeowners. Under these agreements, the church owned the land, but the structures on the land were considered the personal property of the lessees, who paid nominal rental payments to the church. Over the years, additional private residences were built on the property, and the church continued its practice of issuing 99-year leases to the people who built the new structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">{\u00b6 4} In 1978, the church sold Camp St. Mary\u2019s to the Camp St. Mary\u2019s Association. Approximately one year after its purchase, the association became interested in starting a retirement community on the property. This idea continued to be discussed until 1984, when the association approached Otterbein Homes to take over the property. On July 26, 1985, the association transferred the real property known as Camp St. Mary\u2019s to Otterbein Homes in fee simple absolute and also transferred $83,000 as part of the transaction. Otterbein Homes has developed an apparently successful retirement community on the property, and approximately 34 of the private structures are still subject to lease agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">{\u00b6 5} During the time the church and the association owned Camp St. Mary\u2019s, they allowed lessees to transfer privately owned homes to new purchasers. When a transfer of a private residence was made, the church or the association would issue a new 99-year lease to the new buyer/lessee. For example, if a lessee leased the property for 15 years of the 99-year lease and then opted to sell the home, the lessee could sell the structure to a new buyer. The new buyer would then enter into a new 99-year lease agreement with the then owner of the real property known as Camp St. Mary\u2019s, even though there were 84 years remaining on the first lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 6} Otterbein Homes continued the practice of offering new 99-year leases to new buyers until 2004. Then, Otterbein Homes put into effect a new lease policy. In part, the new policy stated that if a lessee wished to terminate a lease prior to the expiration of the 99-year term, he had two options: one option was to sell the structure to Otterbein Homes under one of two specified payment plans, and the second option was to sell the property to a third party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, if the lessee opted to sell to a third party, Otterbein Homes would no longer offer 99-year leases; instead, any new lease agreement would be available for only 25 years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>At the end of the 25-year lease, the structure would belong to Otterbein Homes, and the lessee would not be entitled to compensation for the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 7} Because of Otterbein Homes\u2019 change in policy, the association filed a complaint in the Auglaize County Common Pleas Court on November 18, 2005. The complaint stated one claim on each of the following causes of action: fraud, breach of contract, promissory estoppel, breach of constructive trust, a violation of the civil RICO statute, conspiracy to violate the civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\u201cRICO\u201d) statute, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, corporate mismanagement, unjust enrichment, and rescission. On December 28, 2005, Otterbein Homes filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the association was not a real party in interest and did not have standing to pursue the allegations set forth in its complaint. The association filed a memorandum in opposition, and on January 25, 2006, the trial court granted partial summary judgment to Otterbein Homes on the claims for promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, corporate mismanagement, and rescission.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 8} Otterbein Homes filed its answer on February 8, 2006, and on July 31, 2006, it filed a second motion for summary judgment. The association filed a memorandum in opposition, and on October 13, 2006, the trial court granted summary judgment on each of the remaining claims in favor of Otterbein Homes. The association, having appealed the trial court\u2019s judgments granting summary judgment, asserts two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>First Assignment of Error</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">The trial court erred in awarding partial summary judgment in its order dismissing promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation and rescission claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\n<em>Second Assignment of Error</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">The trial court erred in awarding summary judgment in its order dismissing fraudulent inducement, constructive fraud, contract, fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and constructive trust claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">{\u00b6 9} An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, independently and without deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Ohio Govt. Risk Mgt. Plan v. Harrison, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 241, 2007-Ohio-4948, 874 N.E.2d 1155, at \u00b6 5, citing <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>N.E.2d 712, at \u00b6 8. \u201cA grant of summary judgment will be affirmed only when the requirements of Civ.R. 56(C) are met.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Chief Supermarket, </em>3d Dist. No. 11-06-07, 2007-Ohio-772, 2007 WL 567441, at \u00b6 7. The party moving for summary judgment must establish (1) that there are no genuine issues of material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. Id., citing Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Horton v. Harwick Chem. Corp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 679, 653 N.E.2d 1196, paragraph three of the syllabus. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a court may not \u201cweigh evidence or choose among reasonable inferences * * *.\u201d <em>Adkins, </em>2007-Ohio-772, 2007 WL 567441, at \u00b6 8, citing <em>Jacobs v. Racevskis </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 663 N.E.2d 653. Rather, the court must consider the above standard while construing all evidence in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Jacobs </em>at 7, 663 N.E.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 10} The party moving for summary judgment must identify the basis of the motion to allow the nonmovant a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 116, 526 N.E.2d 798. In its motion, the moving party \u201cmust state specifically which areas of the opponent\u2019s claim raise no genuine issue of material fact\u201d and must support its assertion with affidavits or other evidence as allowed by Civ.R. 56(C). Id. at 115, 526 N.E.2d 798, citing <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46, citing <em>Hamlin v. McAlpin Co. </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 517, 519-520, 26 O.O.2d 206, 196 N.E.2d 781; <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If the moving party fails to meet its burden, summary judgment is inappropriate; however, if the moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party has a \u201creciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Issues Presented in the First Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 11} In its first motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes argued that the association was not a real party in interest because it suffered no injury in fact. Otterbein Homes stated that the real parties in interest would be the individual leaseholders who may have been negatively affected by its new policies. Otterbein Homes also argued that the deed transferring Camp St. Mary\u2019s to it did not contain any conditions and that the association had failed to preserve the right of re-entry because the deed did not contain any such provision. Attached to the motion was the affidavit of Marlen Yost.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>{\u00b6 12} In response, the association claimed it had suffered an injury in fact and therefore, it had standing to represent its members in bringing their claims against Otterbein Homes. Attached to the association\u2019s memorandum in opposition was the affidavit of Paul E. Stuckey, and attached to the affidavit were five exhibits \u2014 specifically, copies of three letters, a copy of the deed conveying Camp St. Mary\u2019s from the association to Otterbein Homes, and a copy of Otterbein Homes\u2019 \u201cLeasehold Transfer Policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>The Association\u2019s Standing as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 13} In any litigation, the plaintiff must have standing. \u201cThe requirement of standing ensures that the party challenging an order has a \u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ahrns v. SBA Communications Corp., </em>3d Dist. No. 2-01-13, 2001 WL 1167240, at *2, quoting <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986) 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 75, 495 N.E.2d 380. To have standing, the plaintiff must \u201cdemonstrate an <em>injury in fact, </em>which requires a showing that the party has suffered or will suffer a specific injury.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id., citing <em>In re Estate of York </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 234, 241, 727 N.E.2d 607, citing <em>Eng. Technicians Assn. v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 106, 110-111, 593 N.E.2d 472. \u201cFurthermore, the injury must be traceable to the challenged action, and the injury must likely be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d Id., citing <em>Eng. Technicians. </em>Therefore, we must examine each of the association\u2019s claims to determine whether it has standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 14} In count one of its complaint, the association brought a claim for actual fraud. To prove fraud, a plaintiff must show the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c(a) [A] representation or, where there is a duty to disclose, concealment of a fact, (b) which is material to the transaction at hand, (c) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity, or with such utter disregard and recklessness as to whether it is true or false that knowledge may be inferred, (d) with the intent of misleading another into relying upon it, (e) justifiable reliance upon the representation or concealment, and (f) a resulting injury proximately caused by the reliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\"><em>State ex rel. Illum. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 69, 2002-Ohio-5312, 776 N.E.2d 92, at \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Russ v. TRW, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 42, 49, 570 N.E.2d 1076; <em>Burr v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 69, 23 OBR 200, 491 N.E.2d 1101, paragraph two of the syllabus. The association\u2019s claim of fraud is based on Otterbein Homes\u2019 representations that it would continue the policies used by the church and the association at the time Camp St. Mary\u2019s and the $83,000 in cash were transferred. Should the association prove fraud, the concrete injury suffered will have been the loss of approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>mately 83 acres of land plus $83,000. Therefore, the association has standing to bring a claim for actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 15} In the second claim of its complaint, the association asserted breach of contract. However, from the face of the complaint, it is not clear whether the association is asserting the claim on its own behalf or on behalf of the individual leaseholders. In its memorandum in opposition to Otterbein Homes\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the association admitted that Camp St. Mary\u2019s and $83,000 were given to Otterbein Homes as a gift. Because the property and money were indisputably given as a gift, there is no contract on which to sue, and the association cannot show that it has sustained an injury in fact. <em>Varee v. Holzinger, </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-A-0072, 2007-Ohio-1924, 2007 WL 1175838, at \u00b6 22, citing <em>Carlisle v. T R Excavating </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 277, 283, 704 N.E.2d 39. Therefore, the association does not have standing to claim breach of contract on its own behalf, and Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment in that respect. However, if the association has brought the breach-of-contract claim on behalf of the individual leaseholders, claiming breach of the individual lease agreements, we must examine whether it has standing to do so. For ease of analysis, we elect to address this issue when we consider the associations standing to represent its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 16} The association\u2019s third claim was for promissory estoppel. To prove promissory estoppel, a plaintiff must show \u201c1) a clear and unambiguous promise; 2) reliance on the promise; 3) the reliance is reasonable and foreseeable; and 4) the party relying on the promise was injured by his or her reliance.\u201d <em>Dunn v. Bruzzese, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 320, 2007-Ohio-3500, 874 N.E.2d 1221, at \u00b6 21 citing <em>Patrick v. Painesville Commercial Properties, Inc. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 575, 583, 704 N.E.2d 1249. See also <em>Hortman v. Miamisburg, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 194, 2006-Ohio-4251, 852 N.E.2d 716, at \u00b6 23-24. As with the association\u2019s claim for fraud, this claim arises from the representations made by Otterbein Homes when the association made its gift or real estate and money. On the issue of promissory estoppel, the trial court held that the association had made \u201cno showing * * * to any manner in which it has standing to bring such actions against the defendant.\u201d However, the association did do so. It alleged that Otterbein Homes had promised to retain the policies that the church and the association had used for many years, and it produced letters, which it claimed supported its allegation. The association also alleged that it had relied on Otterbein Homes\u2019 representations, and as a result thereof, it made a gift of land and money. The association contends that its reliance is reasonable and foreseeable due to the religious affiliations of both parties. Therefore, if the association can prove its claim, it has suffered damages for the property and cash it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>transferred to Otterbein Homes. Therefore, the association has standing to bring this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">{\u00b6 17} The fourth claim in the association\u2019s complaint is for breach of constructive trust.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">A constructive trust is, in the main, an appropriate remedy against unjust enrichment. This type of trust is usually invoked when property has been acquired by fraud. However, a constructive trust may also be imposed where it is against the principles of equity that the property be retained by a certain person even though the property was acquired without fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>Patterson v. Patterson, </em>3d Dist. No. 17-04-07, 2005-Ohio-2254, 2005 WL 1074809, at \u00b6 38, quoting <em>Ferguson v. Owens </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 223, 226, 9 OBR 565, 459 N.E.2d 1293; see also <em>Lawrence v. Bailey </em>(Jan. 25, 2000), 3d Dist. No. 9-99-37, 2000 WL 51803. Based on this definition, a constructive trust is an equitable remedy that arises by operation of law after there has been a finding of fraud or unjust enrichment. See <em>Columbus Homes, Ltd. v. S.A.R. Constr. Co., </em>10th Dist. Nos. 06AP-759 and 06AP-760, 2007-Ohio-1702, 2007 WL 1083254, citing <em>Grozar-Vance v. Vance, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 510, 2005-Ohio-3815, 834 N.E.2d 15. Therefore, this remedy, designated herein as a claim, is wholly dependent on whether a finding of fraud or unjust enrichment is made. Having standing to bring a claim for actual fraud, the association has standing to seek this remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 18} The association did not appeal the trial court\u2019s rulings on its claims concerning the civil RICO statute. Likewise, the association did not raise on appeal the trial court\u2019s orders on its tenth claim, corporate mismanagement. Therefore, we will not consider the fifth, sixth, or tenth claims asserted in the association\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 19} In the seventh claim, the association alleged breach of fiduciary duty. \u201cThe elements for a breach of fiduciary duty claim are: \u2018(1) the existence of a duty arising from a fiduciary relationship; (2) a failure to observe the duty; and (3) an injury resulting proximately therefrom.\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Thomas v. Fletcher, </em>3d Dist. No. 17-05-31, 2006-Ohio-6685, 2006 WL 3702699, at \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Werthmann v. DONet, </em>2d Dist. No. 20814, 2005-Ohio-3185, 2005 WL 1490372, at \u00b6 42. See also <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 216, 527 N.E.2d 1235. \u201cA fiduciary has been defined as a person having a duty, created by his or her undertaking, to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with such undertaking.\u201d <em>All Star Land Title Agency, Inc. v. Surewin Invest., Inc., </em>8th Dist. No. 87569, 2006-Ohio-5729, 2006 WL 3095701, at \u00b6 36, citing <em>Strode </em>at 216, 527 N.E.2d 1235. \u201cA claim of breach of fiduciary duty is basically a claim for negligence that involves a higher standard of care.\u201d Id., citing <em>Strode. </em>\u201cIn order to recover, one must show the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>a duty on the part of the alleged wrongdoer not to subject such person to the injury complained of, a failure to observe such duty, and an injury proximately resulting therefrom.\u201d Id., citing <em>Strock. </em>Again, this cause of action arises based on the parties\u2019 actions when Otterbein Homes allegedly made its representations to the association and the land and money were transferred to Otterbein Homes. Should the association prove its claims, it will have suffered injury, and therefore, it has individual standing to bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 20} In the eighth claim, the association stated a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. To prove negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff must show that the defendant did the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cIn the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\"><em>Rockford Homes, Inc. v. Handel, </em>5th Dist. No. 07CA006, 2007-Ohio-2581, 2007 WL 1544711, at \u00b6 42-43, quoting <em>Delman v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 534 N.E.2d 835. \u201cFurther, negligent misrepresentation can only be found where an affirmative false statement is made, not merely where the statements are omitted.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 44, citing <em>Textron Fin. Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 137, 149, 684 N.E.2d 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court held that a claim for negligent misrepresentation is a tort action, which cannot be asserted where an express contract is at issue. As noted above, there was no express contract between Otterbein Homes and the association because the land and money were transferred as a gift. The trial court also held that \u201c[a] plaintiff who has suffered only economic loss due to another\u2019s negligence has not been injured in a manner which is legally cognizable or compensable.\u201d The trial court correctly stated the economic-loss rule. See <em>Corporex Dev. &amp; Constr. Mgt., Inc. v. Shook, Inc., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 412, 2005-Ohio-5409, 835 N.E.2d 701, at \u00b6 6. As stated above, the transaction in this case was a gift. Because there are no contract claims on which the association could sue, it may look to tort law for causes of action, such as fraud and negligent misrepresentation. As with fraud, the injury sustained by the association would relate to the transfer of real property and money. The association has standing to bring this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 22} In the ninth claim, the association stated a claim for constructive fraud, which is defined as \u201c \u2018a breach of a legal or equitable duty, which, irrespective of moral guilt of the fraud feasor, the law declares fraudulent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>because of its tendency to deceive others, to violate public or private confidence, or to injure public interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cohen v. Estate of Cohen </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 90, 91-92, 23 OBR 218, 491 N.E.2d 698, quoting <em>Stanley v. Sewell Coal Co. </em>(1981), 169 W.Va. 72, 76-77, 285 S.E.2d 679; <em>Jackson v. Julian </em>(Tex.App.1985), 694 S.W.2d 434; <em>Security Natl. Bank v. Peters, Writer Christensen, Inc. </em>(1977), 39 Colo.App. 344, 569 P.2d 875, citing <em>Bank v.

As with the claim for actual fraud, if the association can prove its case, it will have suffered the loss of its property and money, as its claim for constructive fraud reaches back to the time of the transfer and the representations allegedly made by Otterbein Homes to the association.

A plaintiff must establish the following three elements to prove unjust enrichment: \u201c \u2018(1) a benefit conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant; (2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Keybank Natl. Assn., </em>8th Dist. No. 86327, 2006-Ohio-1725, 2006 WL 871621, at \u00b6 43, quoting <em>Hambleton v. R.G.

The Eighth District Court of Appeals has held that a gift cannot be the basis of a claim for unjust enrichment. Id., citing <em>Wendover Rd. Property Owners Assn. v. Kornicks </em>(1985), 28 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>App.3d 101, 28 OBR 198, 502 N.E.2d 226, at syllabus. Other appellate districts, however, have qualified this statement, holding that an absolute gift bars a claim for unjust enrichment, but a cause of action for unjust enrichment may accrue when the gift was conditional. See generally <em>Wheeler v. Martin, </em>4th Dist. No. 04CA15, 2004-Ohio-6936, 2004 WL 2940890; <em>Knotts v. Flynn </em>(Jan. 22, 1998), 5th Dist. No. 97AP060036, 1998 WL 172623. We agree with these courts. The association contends that the gift of Camp St. Mary\u2019s and $83,000 to Otterbein Homes was conditioned upon Otterbein Homes\u2019 retention of, apparently into perpetuity, the practices adopted by the church and the association in relation to the 99-year leases. Accordingly, the association has standing to pursue a claim for unjust enrichment on its own behalf, as its injury in fact is the loss of real estate and money. As with the claim for breach of contract, whether the association has standing to pursue a claim for unjust enrichment on behalf of its members will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 25} Rescission is an equitable remedy for breach of contract. <em>Bell v.

No. C-76712, 1977 WL 199804. \u201cThe primary purpose of rescission is to restore the status quo and to return the parties to the position they would have been in had the contract not been formed.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30, citing <em>Rosepark Properties, Ltd. v. Buess, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 366, 2006-Ohio-3109, 855 N.E.2d 140, at \u00b6 51. Because there was no contract between the association and Otterbein Homes, the association does not have standing to seek rescission based on breach of contract. However, rescission may also be available as a remedy if a gift was made as the result of fraud. See generally <em>Cooper v. Smith, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 218, 2003-Ohio-6083, 800 N.E.2d 372. Because the association has standing to claim fraud, it also has standing to pursue the remedy of rescission on its own behalf. Whether the association can bring a claim for unjust enrichment and pursue the remedy of rescission on behalf of its members will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>The Association\u2019s Standing to Bring Suit on Behalf of its Members</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 26} The association contends that it has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members for injuries sustained as a result of the changes Otterbein Homes made in its new lease policy, which was effective in 2004.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held that an association has standing on behalf of its members when \u201c(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Ohio Contrs.

The evidence is undisputed that each leaseholder has a separate lease with Otterbein Homes. These leases are express contracts between the individual leaseholders and Otterbein Homes. Because the leaseholder\u2019s rights are governed by individual, express contracts and because any alleged fraud occurred between the association and Otterbein Homes, the individual leaseholders cannot have claims for unjust enrichment. <em>Cleveland Mack Leasing, Ltd. v. Chefs Classics, Inc., </em>7th Dist. No. 05 MA 59, 2006-Ohio-888, 2006 WL 459269, at \u00b6 34, citing <em>Sammarco v. Anthem Ins. Cos., Inc. </em>(1998), 131 Ohio App.3d 544, 557, 723 N.E.2d 128 (\u201c[a]bsent fraud or illegality, a party to an express agreement may not bring a claim for unjust enrichment * * *.\u201d). Therefore, the association does not have standing to pursue a claim of unjust enrichment on behalf of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 28} On the breach-of-contract claim, the association argues that Otterbein Homes was obligated to issue new 99-year leases to people who purchase current leaseholders\u2019 structures, which are located on Otterbein Homes\u2019 real property. The association apparently contends that Otterbein Homes\u2019 change in policy concerning the termination and renewal of current leases breaches the individual leaseholders\u2019 contracts. In their individual capacities, the leaseholders would have standing to sue Otterbein Homes based on the provisions of their individual rental agreements. There is no dispute in the record that the association was formed to manage Camp St. Mary\u2019s and to protect the interests of the private residence owners; thus, this litigation is \u201cgermane\u201d to the association\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 29} None of the individual contracts were filed with the first motion for summary judgment; however, Otterbein Homes contends that the terms of each lease differed drastically. The association admits that there are slight differences in the terms of the individual lease agreements, but argues that the differences were not so substantial as to impair its standing (that is, by requiring the participation of individual members in the litigation). Consequently, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the individual members are required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to participate in this litigation, and without any of the contracts before us, we are unable to decide this question as a matter of law. Summary judgment on this issue is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 30} As to the potential remedy of rescission, the association\u2019s complaint seeks rescission of its gift of real property and money to Otterbein Homes and not rescission of the leaseholder\u2019s individual contracts. Even if the association can show breaches of the individual contracts, it has not sought rescission in that regard. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of Otterbein Homes is appropriate as to the association\u2019s representative standing on count twelve of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>Conclusions as to the Association\u2019s Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">{\u00b6 31} For the reasons expressed above, partial summary judgment in favor of Otterbein Homes is appropriate. In its individual capacity, the association does not have standing to bring a claim for breach of contract, and Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment on that issue. However, the association does have standing as an individual to bring claims for fraud, promissory estoppel, breach of constructive trust, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, and rescission, which renders summary judgment in favor of Otterbein Homes inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">{\u00b6 32} In bringing suit on behalf of its members, the association does not have standing to pursue a claim for unjust enrichment, nor does it have to have standing to seek the remedy of rescission. Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment on these issues. Because the record is not clear as to whether the association has standing to pursue a breach-of-contract claim on behalf of its members, Otterbein Homes is not entitled to summary judgment on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Issues Presented in the Second Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">\n<em>Fraud Asserted by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">{\u00b6 33} In its second motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes argued that the association cannot prove it committed fraud. First, Otterbein Homes claimed that a finding of fraud may not be based on representations concerning future actions. Otterbein Homes claimed it did not make false statements of fact, as the only promise made in regard to the individual leaseholders was to honor the terms of the individual lease agreements. Otterbein Homes also argued that the association cannot show justifiable reliance upon any of its statements. Otterbein Homes alleged that the association was no longer able to maintain its property, and it had no other option than to get rid of the land. Finally, Otterbein Homes asserted that the statute of limitations bars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the association\u2019s claim for fraud. Otterbein Homes contended that there is a four-year statute of limitations on fraud claims, and the association knew or should have known that it was no longer issuing 99-year leases at several different times, all of which occurred more than four years prior to the filing of the association\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">{\u00b6 34} The association\u2019s complaint is based on Otterbein Homes\u2019 failure to continue \u201cpast practices,\u201d including accepting payments from \u201cheirs,\u201d the payment of costs and fees, and the issuance of new 99-year leases. With respect to each of these issues, Otterbein Homes argued that the statute of limitations bars the association\u2019s claim. R.C. 2305.09 provides a four-year statute of limitations for fraud claims. However, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered or should have been discovered. R.C. 2305.09. \u201c \u2018Information sufficient to alert a reasonable person to the possibility of wrongdoing gives rise to a party\u2019s duty to inquire into the matter with due diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alum. Line Prod. Co. v. Brad Smith Roofing Co., Inc. </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 246, 671 N.E.2d 1343, quoting <em>Au Rustproofing Ctr. v. Gulf Oil Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 1985), 755 F.2d 1231, 1237, citing <em>Militsky v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, &amp; Smith </em>(N.D.Ohio 1980), 540 F.Supp. 783, 787. \u201c\u2018Once sufficient indicia of fraud are shown, a party cannot rely on its unawareness or the efforts of the opposition to lull it into a false security to toll the statute.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Au Rustproofing </em>at 1237, citing <em>Militsky </em>at 786-787.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 35} As stated above, the association\u2019s claim for fraud is based on Otterbein Homes\u2019 actions that differed from the \u201clease practices\u201d implemented when the association owned the property. On this record, the first instance in which Otterbein Homes quit using the association\u2019s \u201clease practices\u201d occurred in May 1993. At that time, Otterbein Homes issued a 25-year lease, rather than a 99-year lease, to Robert and Joyce Wolfe. Otterbein Homes entered into another 25-year lease in May 1998. If the association\u2019s duty to inquire into Otterbein Homes\u2019 leasing practices did not begin in 1993, it certainly began in 1998 after two new leases, which did not reflect the association\u2019s \u201cpractice\u201d of entering into 99-year leases, had been issued. Because the complaint in this case was not filed until November 2005, the fraud claim was clearly brought outside the four-year statute of limitations and is therefore barred. Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment on the association\u2019s claim for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty Asserted by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">{\u00b6 36} Otterbein Homes contended that it is entitled to judgment on the association\u2019s claim of breach of fiduciary duty because it did not owe any fiduciary duty to the association, and therefore, there could have been no breach. Otterbein Homes claimed that no fiduciary duty can be imposed when a gift is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>absolute, and in this case, the gift was absolute because there were no restrictions in the deed. Otterbein Homes also claimed that the cause of action is barred by the four-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">{\u00b6 37} A \u201cfiduciary\u201d is \u201c \u2018a person having a duty, created by his undertaking, to act primarily for the benefit of another in matters connected with his undertaking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Groob v. KeyBank, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 348, 2006-Ohio-1189, 843 N.E.2d 1170, 843 N.E.2d 1170, at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Strock, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 216, 527 N. E.2d 1235. A \u201cfiduciary relationship\u201d forms when \u201c \u2018special confidence and trust is reposed in the integrity and fidelity of another and there is a resulting position of superiority or influence, acquired by virtue of this special trust.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>In re Termination of Emp. of Pratt </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St.2d 107, 115, 69 O. O.2d 512, 321 N.E.2d 603. A fiduciary duty may be created informally if both parties understand that the special trust has been reposed. <em>Culbertson v. Wigley Title Agency, Inc. </em>(Feb. 13, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 20659, 2002 WL 219570. Additionally, when the parties are negotiating in an arm\u2019s length transaction, there is no fiduciary duty. <em>Landskroner v. Landskroner, </em>154 Ohio App.3d 471, 2003-Ohio-4945, 797 N.E.2d 1002, at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">{\u00b6 38} The association cannot prove that any fiduciary duty was created by Otterbein Homes\u2019 actions. The association admits that it did not retain legal counsel prior to or during the transaction with Otterbein Homes. In a memorandum to the association\u2019s members, Otterbein Homes stated its agreement to receive the gift of real property and money from the association. However, Otterbein Homes also indicated that an audit was being conducted to evaluate the \u201cfiscal impact in future years of the various leases.\u201d The memorandum also stated that Otterbein Homes had an attorney reviewing all leases to determine the long-term effect on Otterbein Homes if it assumed the leases as written. From this evidence, it is clear that Otterbein Homes was evaluating what effect the transfer would have on its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">{\u00b6 39} The association relies on select words from a letter sent from an agent of Otterbein Homes to the association on February 14, 1985. The letter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">The spirit of the acceptance action is to indicate that Otterbein Homes would be in the position to receive Camp St. Mary\u2019s as \u201csuccessors\u201d to both assets and any liabilities, subject to any restrictions in the same manner as the St. Mary\u2019s Board now has them. Donor restrictions would carry through in the same sense of TRUST as you now have them. Board designations would carry through with the same power to change as you now have them. Liability regarding leaseholders would carry the same contract provisions. Any losses experienced in this regard would be the concern of Otterbein Homes regardless of the source of funds used to cover them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The association relies primarily on the word \u201ctrust\u201d to show that it was vulnerable to Otterbein Homes\u2019 superior position. However, such an interpretation is outside the clear meaning and intent of the letter. Otterbein Homes used the word \u201ctrust\u201d to indicate that it would honor restrictions donors had placed on their charitable donations. That is the only meaning to be gleaned from the letter. The letter addresses leaseholders to the extent that Otterbein Homes promised to uphold the terms of the then existing leases. This letter does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the association placed its trust in Otterbein Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 40} The association has also produced the self-serving affidavit of Paul Stuckey, in which he states that the association placed its trust in Otterbein Homes and that that action created a position of superiority and influence in Otterbein Homes. Stuckey also \u201copined\u201d that Otterbein Homes agreed to accept the stewardship of Camp St. Mary\u2019s, which created fiduciary duties. Stucky was not qualified as a legal expert, and his opinions concerning superiority, influence, and fiduciary duties are legal conclusions rather than statements of fact. Therefore, they cannot be used to create genuine issues of material fact. See generally <em>Niermeyer v. Cook\u2019s Termite &amp; Pest Control, Inc., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-21, 2006-Ohio-640, 2006 WL 330099, at \u00b6 34, citing Civ.R. 56(E); Evid.R. 705; <em>Stamper v. Middletown Hosp. Assn. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 65, 69, 582 N.E.2d 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 41} Furthermore, there is no evidence that Otterbein Homes was acting <em>primarily </em>for the benefit of the association. Although there is evidence in the record that the association was operating at a loss and was required to make significant changes to the property by the Environmental Protection Agency, there is no evidence that Otterbein Homes took action solely to alleviate the association\u2019s problems. Likewise, although the association may have placed its trust in Otterbein Homes, there is absolutely no evidence indicating that Otterbein Homes, through its own actions, ever acted primarily for the benefit of the association. Although Otterbein Homes and the association both shared the ultimate goal of building a retirement community on the property, the evidence indicates that Otterbein Homes was acting on its own behalf, and the Association simply opted to move forward without the benefit of counsel. As shown above, Otterbein Homes\u2019 acceptance of the Association\u2019s gift was clearly based, in part, on the results of its consultations with financial experts and legal counsel. While Otterbein Homes\u2019 acquisition of the property was a benefit to the Association, Otterbein Homes\u2019 primary focus was the creation of a retirement community on the property, and Otterbein Homes was indisputably concerned about the propriety of undertaking such a task. Based on the record in this case, there is no evidence to show that a fiduciary duty was created between Otterbein Homes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the association. Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment on the association\u2019s claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\n<em>Constructive Fraud Asserted by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">{\u00b6 42} In the second motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes contended that it was entitled to judgment on the association\u2019s constructive fraud claim. Otterbein Homes argued that there was no confidential or fiduciary relationship between it and the association. As with the fraud claim, Otterbein Homes claimed that the statute of limitations bars the constructive fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">{\u00b6 43} Constructive fraud differs from actual fraud in that actual fraud requires an \u201caffirmative misrepresentation,\u201d while constructive fraud \u201cresults from the \u2018failure to disclose facts of a material nature where there exists a duty to speak.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baughman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 22204, 2005-Ohio-6980, 2005 WL 3556406, at \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Layman v. Binns </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 176, 178, 519 N.E.2d 642. Even if we assume that Otterbein Homes had a duty to speak, the association has presented no evidence to demonstrate that Otterbein Homes <em>failed </em>to make any representations. The association\u2019s complaint is based entirely on the promises Otterbein Homes allegedly did make as far as continuing the \u201ccurrent lease practices\u201d and its alleged subsequent failure to do so. Because there is no evidence in the record showing what Otterbein Homes failed to represent to the association, there are no genuine issues of material fact, and Otterbein Homes is entitled to judgment on the association\u2019s claim for constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Unjust Enrichment Asserted by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">{\u00b6 44} As stated above, a plaintiff must establish the following three elements to prove unjust enrichment: \u201c \u2018(1) a benefit conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant; (2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Keybank Natl. Assn., </em>8th Dist. No. 86327, 2006-Ohio-1725, 2006 WL 871621, at \u00b6 43, quoting <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298. In its second motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes argued that it could not have been unjustly enriched if the property had been a gift. It also argued that any time a gift is made, enrichment is expected, and therefore, the enrichment cannot be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">{\u00b6 45} The record is undisputed that the association made a gift of Camp St. Mary\u2019s to Otterbein Homes. The second element of unjust enrichment is also satisfied \u2014 that Otterbein Homes knew it had received the benefit. As to the third element, it has been held that \u201c[u]njust enrichment is inapplicable to gifts or any officious act.\u201d <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 43, citing <em>Wendover Rd., </em>28 Ohio App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>101, 28 OBR 198, 502 N.E.2d 226, at syllabus. However, other courts have been slightly more specific about the nature of the gift involved and have held that \u201c[t]he issue of unjust enrichment does not arise with absolute gifts because \u2018[ejnrichment of the donee is the intended purpose of a gift.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cooper v. Smith, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 218, 2003-Ohio-6083, 800 N.E.2d 372, quoting <em>Lane v. Saunders </em>(Dec. 13, 1985), 4th Dist. No. 85CA5, 1985 WL 17472. Generally, \u201conce an inter vivos gift is complete, it is generally absolute and irrevocable.\u201d <em>Cooper </em>at \u00b6 31, citing <em>Romaniw-Dubas v. Polowyk </em>(Aug. 10, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 75980, 2000 WL 1144784. \u201cHowever, a donor may impose conditions on a gift so -that if the conditions fail, the gift fails.\u201d Id., citing <em>Wilkin v. Wilkin </em>(1996), 116 Ohio App.3d 315, 318, 688 N.E.2d 27. The absolute or conditional nature of the gift must be resolved by examining the donor\u2019s intent, which is determined \u201c \u2018from any express declaration by the donor at the time of the making of the gift or from the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting 38 American Jurisprudence 2d (1999) 767-768, Gifts, Section 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 46} The evidence in the record shows that when the association passed its resolution agreeing to make the gift to Otterbein Homes, the resolution contained no conditions. Additionally, the deed contained no restrictions on Otterbein Homes\u2019 use of the gift. Although the association filed the affidavit of Paul Stuckey, in which he stated that the association had made a conditional gift and that the association did not consider the gift unconditional, Stuckey\u2019s affidavit is purely self-serving and is unsupported by any other evidence in the record. <em>Combs v. Spence, </em>5th Dist. No. 2006CA0034, 2007-Ohio-2210, 2007 WL 1346590, at \u00b6 21, citing <em>Ohio v. $317.49 in United States Currency, </em>5th Dist. No. 2006-CA-00318, 2007-Ohio-475, 2007 WL 333563, at \u00b6 30. See also <em>Church v. Fleishour Homes, Inc., </em>172 Ohio App.3d 205, 2007-Ohio-1806, 874 N.E.2d 795, at \u00b6 34, citing <em>Bhatia v. Johnston </em>(C.A.5, 1987), 818 F.2d 418, 421-422; <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr </em>(C.A.5, 2002), 294 F.3d 702, 710 (self-serving affidavits, unsupported and without corroborating evidentiary materials, are not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 47} Given this record, it is clear that the gift from the association to Otterbein Homes was absolute and irrevocable, and the association is unable to establish that Otterbein Homes was unjustly enriched by its retention of Camp St. Mary\u2019s. Having found no genuine issue of material fact, that Otterbein Homes is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that reasonable minds could reach only one conclusion, which is adverse to the nonmoving party, the association, summary judgment is appropriate in favor of Otterbein.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Breach of Constructive Trust Asserted by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b6 48} In its second motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes argued that the trial court had no basis for imposing a constructive trust because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>it was entitled to summary judgment on the association\u2019s claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. By extension, Otterbein Homes alleged that it could not be liable for breaching a constructive trust, because a trust never arose. We agree with Otterbein Homes\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 49} We have previously held that a trial court does not err when it refuses to impose a constructive trust if the plaintiff has not proved fraud, undue influence, or breach of fiduciary duty. See <em>Patterson v. Patterson, </em>3d Dist. No. 17-04-07, 2005-Ohio-2254, 2005 WL 1074809, at \u00b6 38. Such a principle can also be extended to the plaintiffs failure to prove a claim for unjust enrichment, which as stated above, is a basis for imposing a constructive trust. Having found herein that Otterbein Homes was entitled to summary judgment on the association\u2019s claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment, Otterbein Homes is also entitled to judgment on the association\u2019s claim for breach of constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>Breach of Contract Asserted by the Association on Behalf of its Members</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 50} In its second motion for summary judgment, Otterbein Homes argued it did not believe a \u201ccontract\u201d existed between it and the association, but if such a contract did exist, any claims thereon would be barred by the statute of limitations. Otterbein Homes alleged that the applicable statute of limitations is six years pursuant to R.C. 2305.17. Otterbein Homes claimed that similar to the fraud claim, any breach of the alleged contract should have been discovered at the time the deed was executed, or in 1987, when the leaseholders received Otterbein Homes\u2019 new financial policy, or at the very latest in October 1999 when a person unrelated to a still-living leaseholder attempted to take possession of a leasehold as an \u201cheir.\u201d Although some of these arguments raised by Otterbein Homes actually address the terms of the individual leaseholds, they were raised on the issue of whether Otterbein Homes breached the \u201ccontract\u201d it entered into with the association for the transfer of Camp St. Mary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 51} As held above, the breach of contract claim based on the gift of Camp St. Mary\u2019s to Otterbein Homes is moot because the association does not have standing to bring that claim as an individual. Since Otterbein Homes did not address the association\u2019s claims concerning Otterbein Homes\u2019 alleged breach of the individual leases in its motion for summary judgment, the trial court could not, and this court cannot now, determine the issue. See <em>Kellie Auto Sales, Inc. v. Rahbars &amp; Ritters Ents. L.L.C., </em>172 Ohio App.3d 675, 2007-Ohio-4312, 876 N.E.2d 1014, at \u00b6 34, citing <em>Mitseff, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, at syllabus; <em>Marshall v. Aaron </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 48, 472 N.E.2d 335, at syllabus; <em>Bowen v. Kil-Kare, Inc. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 84, 94, 585 N.E.2d 384. At this time, Otterbein Homes is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>for breach of contract brought by the association on behalf of its members, and those issues are remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\n<em>Promissory Estoppel, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Rescission Claims by the Association as an Individual</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 52} As a further matter, we note that the second motion for summary judgment did not address the association\u2019s claims for promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, or rescission because those claims were disposed of by the trial court on the first motion for summary judgment. Because those issues have been resolved inconsistently with the trial court\u2019s judgment, they must be remanded to the trial court for additional proceedings. We may not create counsels\u2019 strategy on these issues, nor may we create legal arguments on behalf of either party in anticipation of a potential motion for summary judgment. See <em>Kellie Auto Sales </em>at \u00b6 34, citing <em>Mitseff </em>at syllabus; <em>Marshall </em>at syllabus; <em>Bowen </em>at 94, 585 N.E.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>Conclusion on Otterbein Homes\u2019 Second Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 53} Having found no genuine issues of material fact, that Otterbein Homes is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and that reasonable minds can come to no other conclusion, Otterbein Homes is entitled to summary judgment on the association\u2019s claims for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and breach of constructive trust. Since Otterbein Homes\u2019 second motion for summary judgment did not address the association\u2019s claims brought on its own behalf for promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, or rescission, those issues are remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Likewise, Otterbein Homes\u2019 second motion for summary judgment did not address the breach-of-contract claim that the association attempted to bring on behalf of its members. That matter must likewise be remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 54} Consistent with the opinion of this court, the judgment of Auglaize County Common Pleas Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-10\">Preston, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b118-11\">Rogers, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. Assignability does not seem to be at issue here. Based on the terms of only several leaseholders' contracts, which were submitted in support of Otterbein Homes\u2019 second motion for summary judgment, the lessee had to obtain the lessor\u2019s permission before he or she could assign the lease. The continuation, or the discontinuation, of the association\u2019s practice of entering into new leases, and Otterbein Homes' eventual change in the lease policy is the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Rogers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlQ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 55} I concur with the majority in holding that the claims of the appellant should be dismissed as to fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. However, I would hold that all other issues raised by the appellant are precluded by the doctrine of \u201cmerger by deed.\u201d Accordingly, there remain no issues to be litigated, and I would affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appellant\u2019s action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
