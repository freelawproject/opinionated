Because we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 2} On June 17, 2006, a township police officer observed an eastbound pickup truck drive off the road several times. The officer stopped the pickup. When he approached the vehicle, he detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. When he asked the driver, appellant Tim E. Murphy, whether he had been drinking, appellant responded, \u201ca couple.\u201d The officer then requested that appellant perform a series of field sobriety tests, all of which appellant failed. An inquiry into appellant\u2019s record revealed multiple prior intoxicated-driving convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant was indicted for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (\u201cOMVI\u201d) in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a). The indictment included a specification that appellant had been previously found guilty six times of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. On January 4, 2007, appellant pleaded not guilty. On March 21, 2007, however, appellant agreed to withdraw his not-guilty plea and plead guilty to the indictment, pursuant to an agreement in which the state would drop related charges in the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 4} During the plea colloquy, the trial court questioned appellant regarding the plea agreement:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[THE COURT]: Would you tell me in your own words, please, what your [plea] agreement is?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[APPELLANT]: My agreement was for [a community based drug and alcohol treatment facility,] CROSSWAEH.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[APPELLANT]: What is he talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">{\u00b6 9} (Conference held off the record between appellant and his trial counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 10} \u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes, I do now understand it, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[THE COURT]: What is the agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c[APPELLANT]: The agreement is for dismissing the open container and fourth degree felony for the DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[THE COURT]: Open container?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: The State is going to dismiss those Municipal Court cases as part of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[THE COURT]: All right. And then you are pleading to the entire indictment here, including the specifications?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[THE COURT]: Is that correct, Mr. Schimmel [appellant\u2019s trial counsel]?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[THE COURT]: Ms. Croy [prosecutor]?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[THE COURT]: * * * I heard the word CROSSWAEH, which compels me to ask whether there has been any representations to [appellant] regarding what the punishment will be in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: There have been no agreements, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[THE COURT]: <em>CROSSWAEH is a possibility, </em>but the Court has not agreed that it would sentence [appellant] to CROSSWAEH.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c[THE COURT]: Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[APPELLANT]: Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">{\u00b6 28} The court continued the colloquy by explaining the elements of the charge and the specification that the state would have had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt if the case had gone before a jury. Next, the court detailed the possible penalties; the court stated, \u201cThere is a mandatory term from one to five years in the State Prison System. You are not eligible for probation. You are not later eligible for judicial release. If I give you, or I must give you, at least one year. I could give you up to five years. But whatever I do give you must be served completely without any possibility of probation or judicial release. That is a mandatory term of imprisonment.\u201d Appellant indicated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The court continued by explaining that it could sentence appellant immediately. Finally, after determining that appellant understood that he was waiving specified constitutional rights, the court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea and ordered a presentence investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 30} During his presentence investigation interview, appellant was informed that he was ineligible for CROSSWAEH. Because of this discovery, on May 4, 2007, the date originally scheduled for sentencing, appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. Appellant argued that his primary motivation for entering a guilty plea was that he wished to participate in CROSSWAEH for six months in lieu of serving six months of his sentence. Appellant maintained that the trial court stated during the plea colloquy that CROSSWAEH was a possibility, and had he known that he was ineligible for CROSSWAEH, he would not have entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The state opposed appellant\u2019s motion, contending that the plea agreement clearly stated that appellant could not change his plea once he entered into the agreement and that appellant\u2019s rethinking his agreement was not a reasonable and legitimate basis for withdrawal of the plea. The court reviewed the transcript of the plea colloquy and concluded that the possible sentences were clearly spelled out during the colloquy. The trial court found that there was \u201cno possibility for misunderstanding\u201d and denied appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. The court did not address its incorrect statements regarding appellant\u2019s eligibility for community placement. Appellant was sentenced on August 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant now presents two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cI. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s pre-sentencing motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cII. Appellant did not receive the effective assistance of counsel in entering a guilty plea and therefore his constitutional rights were violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 35} In support of his first assignment of error, appellant points to the fact that the court incorrectly informed him that he was eligible for a community-based program during his plea colloquy. Accordingly, appellant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 36} Crim.R. 32.1 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>{\u00b6 38} While a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea \u201cshould be freely and liberally grantedf,] * * * a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing.\u201d <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715. \u201c[T]he trial court must conduct a hearing to determine whether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea.\u201d Id. Further, the trial court\u2019s decision is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Id. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment or a mistake of law; the term connotes that the court\u2019s attitude is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cSome of the factors that are weighed in considering the trial court\u2019s decision on a presentence motion to withdraw a plea are as follows: (1) whether the state will be prejudiced by withdrawal; (2) the representation afforded to the defendant by counsel; (3) the extent of the Crim.R. 11 plea hearing; (4) the extent of the hearing on the motion to withdraw; (5) whether the trial court gave full and fair consideration to the motion; (6) whether the timing of the motion was reasonable; (7) the reasons for the motion; (8) whether the defendant understood the nature of the charges and potential sentences; and (9) whether the accused was perhaps not guilty or had a complete defense to the charge.\u201d <em>State v. Griffin </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 551, 554, 752 N.E.2d 310. See also <em>State v. </em>Klotz, 6th Dist. No. WD-04-079, 2005-Ohio-3864, 2005 WL 1793755, \u00b6 15; <em>State v. Dellinger, </em>6th Dist. No. H-02-007, 2002-Ohio-4652, 2002 WL 31002813, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 40} The record is clear that at the time of the plea colloquy, appellant, appellant\u2019s counsel, the court, and likely the prosecutor believed that a community-based treatment sentencing option was available. The content of the colloquy reveals that the availability of this option was important to appellant. Whether this importance was because appellant wished to spend part of his incarceration in what he perceived was a less restrictive environment or because he genuinely wished for an opportunity for substance-abuse treatment is immaterial. It is not unreasonable that appellant valued this portion of the court\u2019s sentencing options. Consequently, when it was determined that the existence of this option was erroneous, it was reasonable that appellant sought to undo the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 41} Concerning prejudice that this election might visit upon the state, \u201cprejudice to the state [must be] articulated and will not be presumed.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>141 Ohio App.3d at 554-555, 752 N.E.2d 310. The state has not articulated any specific prejudice that it would encounter if appellant\u2019s motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 42} Although the regularity of the hearing that the trial court held on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw is not at issue, the court did fail to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>appellant\u2019s argument regarding the court\u2019s erroneous statement that a community sentencing option was a possibility. The timing of the motion was reasonable; appellant made the motion prior to sentencing, immediately after he discovered that he was not eligible for community control. Appellant had an important reason for making the motion. Eligibility for community control is a significant factor in making a plea agreement, as evidenced by the requirement in Crim.R. 11 that a court must inform a defendant of his eligibility for community control during a plea colloquy. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">{\u00b6 43} After applying the <em>Griffin </em>factors to this matter, we conclude that they weigh in favor of allowing appellant to withdraw his plea. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s decision to deny appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was unreasonable. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 44} Our decision in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error renders appellant\u2019s second assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 45} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and vacated. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Ottawa County.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Judgment reversed and vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-8\">Handwork, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b389-9\">Handwork, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ArC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 46} This case compels us to once again examine that seemingly well understood, yet mysteriously elusive, term \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d What is it, what does it mean, and how shall it be examined and evaluated? Presumably, courts of appeals have rules and guidelines established to answer these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">{\u00b6 47} I feel compelled to re-ask these questions, however, and to invite reevaluation of this term in light of the majority decision, as I truly feel that the majority, when considering the facts of this case, failed to understand and to apply a proper analysis as it reviewed the trial court\u2019s decision. Certainly the abuse-of-diseretion standard was crafted, at the very least, as a standard of review because it was believed that trial judges should be free to make appropriate, lawful decisions without the fear of being second-guessed by appellate tribunals. In this case, the majority has inappropriately attempted to discern what the participants in the hearing in question \u201cbelieved,\u201d see \u00b6 40 above, what may or may not have been important to the participants, and what may or may not have been reasonable to appellant. They have subjectively substituted their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>judgment for what they think happened in place of Judge Moon\u2019s careful analysis of the entire process that he participated in and was in the best position to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 48} To suggest, as the majority does, that the trial judge abused his discretion when denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty \u2014 that is, that his judgment was arbitrary, unreasonable, and clearly erroneous \u2014 will cause the trial judges in this district to constantly look over their shoulder and ask, \u201cWhat more must I do when making a discretionary decision to avoid reversal?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 49} An \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d is a standard that has long been used in the law. That extremely high standard is defined in the Law. Com Dictionary as:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 50} <em>\u201c[A] polite way of saying a trial judge has made such a bad mistake (\u2018clearly against reason and evidence\u2019 or against established law) during a trial or on ruling on a motion and that a person did not get a fair trial. </em>* * * Examples of \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 or judges\u2019 mistakes include not allowing an important witness to testify, making improper comments that might influence a jury, showing bias, or making rulings on evidence that deny a person a chance to tell his or her side of the matter. <em>This does not mean a trial or the judge has to be perfect, but it does mean that the judge\u2019s actions were so far out of bounds that someone truly did not get a fair trial. </em>Sometimes the appeals courts admit the judge was wrong, but not wrong enough to have influenced the outcome of the trial, often to the annoyance of the losing party. In criminal cases abuse of discretion can include sentences that are grossly too harsh. In a divorce action, it includes awarding alimony way beyond the established formula or the spouse\u2019s or life partner\u2019s realistic ability to pay.\u201d (Emphasis added.) http://legaldictionary.thefreedictionary.com (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 51} Let us now look at the meaning of the words in question to discern the true import of the legal standard applied in this cause. As applicable to the case before us, \u201cdiscretion\u201d is defined by Webster as the \u201cpower of free decision or latitude of choice within certain legal bounds.\u201d Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 2008.http://www.merriam-webster.com (30 April 2008). \u201cAbuse\u201d means \u201ccorrupt practice or custom\u201d and/or \u201cimproper or excessive use or treatment.\u201d Id. If an act is denoted as \u201carbitrary,\u201d it indicates that the act is \u201cmarked by or resulting from the unrestrained and often tyrannical exercise of power\u201d and/or exists or comes about \u201cseemingly at random or by chance or as a capricious and unreasonable act of will.\u201d Id. The use of the term \u201cunreasonable\u201d refers to behavior or thought that is \u201cnot governed by or acting according to reason.\u201d Id. Finally, someone acts in an unconscionable manner when he or she is \u201cnot guided or controlled by conscience\u201d or acts or thinks in a way that is \u201cshockingly unfair or unjust.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 52} Applying these definitions to the case under consideration, we must therefore ask ourselves: When making a free decision within the latitude of legal bounds, did Judge Moon utilize corrupt, improper, or excessive practices in either a tyrannical or random and capricious way that was not governed by reason or controlled by conscience? Was the judge\u2019s decision shockingly unfair or unjust? The answer should be a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d I am astounded that the majority could find in this case that the trial judge\u2019s decision met the foregoing definitions, but can only suggest that if Judge Moon\u2019s decision is indeed an abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court of Ohio would benefit the bench and bar by revisiting the meaning of the legal standard denoted as \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d and, thereby, provide appellate courts with a road map to navigate this area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">{\u00b6 53} In analyzing whether Judge Moon acted within the bounds of his discretion, we must remember that he was present and participated in all proceedings below, viewed the demeanor of and engaged in a dialogue with appellant, and listened to all of the words spoken by appellant and his trial counsel. The following excerpt<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the change-of-plea hearing leads to a better understanding of his thought process:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cQ: Would you tell me in your own words, please what your agreement is?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cA. My agreement was for CROSSWAEH [a community based correctional facility].</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cMr. Schimmel [appellant\u2019s attorney]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c[Appellant]: Wfiiat is he talking about?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(Attorney \u2014 client conference held off the record)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c[Appellant]: Yes, I do now understand it, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cQ. What is the agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cA. The agreement is for dismissing the open container and the fourth degree felony for the DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cThe Court: Open container?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cMs. Croy [The prosecutor]: The state is going to dismiss those Municipal Court eases as part of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cQ. All right. And then you are pleading to the entire indictment here, including the specification?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>{\u00b6 65} \u201cA. Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe Court: Is that correct, Mr. Schimmel?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cMr. Schimmel: That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cThe Court: Ms. Croy?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cMs. Croy: Yes, it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe Court: If I could have that document back. I heard the word CROSSWAEH, which compels me to ask whether there has been any representations to the Defendant regarding what punishment will be in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cMr. Schimmel: There have been no agreements Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe Court: CROSSWAEH is a possibility, but the court has not agreed that it would sentence the Defendant to CROSSWAEH.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cMr. Schimmel: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cThe Court: Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cMr. Schimmel: Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">{\u00b6 76} \u201c[Appellant]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cQ: Now this agreement is actually your written plea of guilty to Count 1 of the indictment and also the specification. However, I must still take your plea in open court on the record today * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">{\u00b6 78} Judge Moon then continued by providing appellant with information concerning his sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cQ: All right. The next element is that you have previously been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations of either the State Code Section for driving while under the influence or a Municipal Ordinance governing the same matters or the laws of another state involving the same matter, do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cA. Yes, I do, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-20\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cQ. Now that is reflected also in the specification, which indicates that you had been either convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more equivalent offenses, do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cA. Yes, I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cQ. All right. Now the possible penalties, first of all we will start with the specification. There is a mandatory term of from one to five years in the State Prison System. You are not eligible for probation. You are not later eligible for judicial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b6 84} \u201cIf I give you, or I must give you at least one year. I could give you up to five years. But whatever I do give you must be served completely without any possibility of probation or judicial release. That is a mandatory term of imprisonment. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cA. Yes, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 86} Moreover, at the hearing to withdraw appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the following occurred. First, the court read that section of the change-of-plea hearing, as set forth immediately above, in which he informed appellant of the fact that, due to the specification, he was required to impose a mandatory prison sentence. Judge Moon continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cThen I went on regarding fines and the forfeiture of the vehicle. Then at the top of page 8 [of the transcript of the change of plea hearing], court says, T must require you to attend an alcohol or drug addiction program at your own expense after you are released from whatever prison term you might receive. And I have to suspend your driver\u2019s license for at least three years, but could suspend it for up to five.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cThere is just no room for misunderstanding this transcript. Now, before the defendant is sentenced, the rule says that withdrawal of the guilty plea should be freely given; however, case law says, if the defendant states no reason at all for wanting to change his plea or if his reasons are spurious or inappropriate, the court doesn\u2019t have to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cAnd, there is just no possibility for misunderstanding here. The plea will change \u2014 or will stand, and we\u2019ll set, we\u2019ll set a new sentencing date. * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">{\u00b6 90} A reading of these portions of the transcripts of the change-of-plea hearing and the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea reveals that while Judge Moon was mistaken when he stated CROSSWAEH was a possibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but not a probability, at the plea hearing, his emphasis was on the fact that there were no agreements to that effect. Further, at the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, it is clear that Judge Moon carefully reviewed what happened some months previous and found that the appellant could not have been mistaken about what he faced when sentenced. Therefore, the majority\u2019s suggestion that at the end of that hearing, appellant did not know that he faced a prison term, and only a prison term, truly strains credulity.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>{\u00b6 91} This court is not in the position to speculate as to what was in the mind of the defendant and his counsel at the close of the appellant\u2019s change of plea hearing, nor should we substitute our judgment for that of a trial judge when the record is clear that a careful, thoughtful, and lawful decision was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 92} This effort by appellant amounts, in my opinion, to little more than a change of heart by one who is no rookie in the criminal justice system and is now seeking to avoid the ultimately unavoidable jail time he faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 93} Judge Moon made the correct call in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 94} I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-17\">. These excerpts are also provided in the majority\u2019s decision, but repetition is necessary to an understanding of my dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\">. A \"possibility\u201d is defined as \u201cthe condition or fact of being possible.\u201d Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com (30 April 2008). In turn, \"possible\u201d means \"being something that may or may not occur.\u201d Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. http://www.merriam-webster.com (30 April 2008). Thus, the use of the word \"possibility,\u201d in and of itself, indicated to appellant that he may not be sentenced to serve his time at CROSSWAEH.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
