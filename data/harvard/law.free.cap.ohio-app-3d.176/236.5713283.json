For the reasons set forth below, the juvenile court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">{\u00b6 2} This case concerns the second permanent-custody determination made by the juvenile court with respect to G.N. and H.N. On March 14, 2006, the magistrate issued his original decision granting permanent custody of the children to CCDJFS, finding that the children had been in the temporary custody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>CCDJFS for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period and that it was in the children\u2019s best interest to grant permanent custody to CCDJFS. Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, over which the juvenile court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 3} On January 16, 2007, however, this court reversed the juvenile court\u2019s decision on the basis that the court had failed to properly consider the requisite statutory factors in making its permanent-custody determination. <em>In re G.N., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 76, 2007-Ohio-126, 866 N.E.2d 32. The case was remanded to the juvenile court with instructions to properly consider those factors and to accord the matter the appropriate analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, on January 24, 2007, appellant filed a Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment with the juvenile court, arguing that the court\u2019s original permanent-custody decision should not have \u201cprospective application\u201d due to appellant\u2019s progress in abstaining from drug use and in maintaining \u201ca suitable, appropriate home and lifestyle.\u201d On April 25, 2007, the magistrate issued supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law, wherein he again determined that a grant of permanent custody to CCDJFS was in the children\u2019s best interest. The magistrate\u2019s decision did not, however, address appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion. The juvenile court thereafter upheld the magistrate\u2019s decision over appellant\u2019s written objections and expressly overruled appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant now appeals the juvenile court\u2019s permanent-custody decision, advancing three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 6} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred by not permitting a hearing on [appellant\u2019s] Civ.R. 60(B) motion filed on January 24, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 8} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision to deny [appellant\u2019s] Civ.R. 60(B) motion was error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error concern the juvenile court\u2019s treatment of her Civ.R. 60(B) motion. As the record demonstrates that the motion was filed in the juvenile court after this court had reversed and remanded the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody of G.N. and H.N. to CCDJFS, we find appellant\u2019s assignments of error as to this matter without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">{\u00b6 11} Under Ohio law, it is well settled that \u201c[o]nly final judgments are subject to vacation or modification pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B).\u201d <em>Groza-Vance v. Vance, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 510, 2005-Ohio-3815, 834 N.E.2d 15, \u00b6 52, citing <em>Jarrett v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Dayton Osteopathic Hosp., Inc. </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 77, 20 OBR 407, 486 N.E.2d 99. \u201cWhere a judgment is reversed for error, and remanded for further proceedings, the cause may be taken up, by the court below, at the point where the first error was committed, and be proceeded with, as in other cases, to final judgment.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Kreusch </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 47, 51, 675 N.E.2d 571, citing <em>Montgomery Cty. Commrs. v. Carey </em>(1853), 1 Ohio St. 463, paragraph one of the syllabus, and <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1960), 114 Ohio App. 234, 237-238,19 O.O.2d 108, 181 N.E.2d 282. \u201cThe effect of a reversal and an order of remand is to reinstate the case to the docket of the trial court in precisely the same condition that obtained before the error occurred.\u201d Id., citing <em>Richman Bros. Co. v. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Am. </em>(1956), 101 Ohio App. 459, 465, 1 O.O.2d 385, 132 N.E.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, the effect of our reversal of the juvenile court\u2019s first permanent-custody decision was to reinstate the case in the trial court in a posture where no final judgment had yet been rendered as to CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. As a result, there was no final judgment from which appellant could request relief pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B), and a motion for relief from judgment was not the proper procedural device for appellant to seek introduction of evidence of her improved lifestyle. Accordingly, we find that the juvenile court did not err in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on or in denying appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion. Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 13} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding * * * a grant of permanent custody was in the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 15} In her third assignment of error, appellant contends that the juvenile court erred in finding that a grant of permanent custody was in the children\u2019s best interest when there was conflicting evidence presented as to the statutory factors governing permanent custody. As previously noted, this court reversed the juvenile court\u2019s original permanent-custody decision because it did not contain a clear indication that the court considered the required statutory factors pursuant to R.C. 2151.414 in making its permanent-custody determination. <em>In re G.N., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 76, 2007-Ohio-126, 866 N.E.2d 32. In doing so, we remanded the matter to the juvenile court to properly consider the requisite statutory factors, with clear instructions as to the analysis expected of the juvenile court, considering the magnitude of permanent-custody matters. Id. at \u00b6 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 16} As we stated therein, the Ohio Supreme Court has found permanent termination of parental rights to be \u201c \u2018the family law equivalent of the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>penalty in a criminal case,\u2019 \u201d entitling parents to \u201c \u2018every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 43, quoting <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680. We therefore continue to encourage trial courts to carefully and conscientiously review the applicable statutes governing permanent custody and to craft permanent-custody decisions to reflect that such an analysis was in fact undertaken. Where a court fails to comply with the statutory requirements governing permanent custody, we are forced to remand these matters to the trial court to do so, thereby leaving children such as G.N. and H.N. in limbo for unnecessarily prolonged periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 17} After reviewing the record in this case, we note that the juvenile court appears to have heeded our instructions to specifically consider each statutory factor pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(D). Our review of the court\u2019s decision, however, reveals a fundamental failure of the court with respect to its consideration of R.C. 2151.414(D)(4), concerning the children\u2019s \u201cneed for a legally secure permanent placement.\u201d This provision requires a trial court to consider \u201c[t]he child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency.\u201d In reversing the juvenile court\u2019s first permanent-custody decision, we specifically instructed the court that this statutory factor \u201cdoes not require the court to consider whether an agency <em>can </em>provide the necessary legally secure permanent placement, but instead requires the court to consider whether granting permanent custody <em>is the only way </em>the children\u2019s need for such placement can be achieved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re G.N., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 76, 2007-Ohio-126, 866 N.E.2d 32, at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 18} Nevertheless, on remand, the juvenile court found that \u201cthe <em>best option </em>for achieving the legally secure permanent placement the children strongly need is by granting permanent custody to the Agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such a finding was made after the court noted the \u201ctentative efforts\u201d of the children\u2019s aunt, uncle, and stepparents with respect to completing the training required for adoption and the \u201cuntrustworthiness\u201d of appellant. The court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cbest option\u201d implies there are other possible, though less desirable, options by which the children\u2019s need for a legally secure and permanent placement can be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 19} We reiterate that because R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) requires a juvenile court to consider whether a child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement \u201ccan be achieved without a grant of permanent custody,\u201d the juvenile court must specifically determine that granting permanent custody is the <em>only way </em>the child\u2019s need for such placement can be achieved to satisfy this statutory factor. Because the juvenile court did not make this determination, the court\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>with respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) is in error. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 20} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded to correctly apply R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) based on the evidence before it at the time of the magistrate\u2019s original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-7\">Walsh, P.J., and Bressler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
