Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">{\u00b6 1} In this uninsured-motorist case, defendant-appellant/cross-appellee Erie Insurance Company (\u201cErie\u201d) appeals the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee/cross-appellant, Jeffrey Fahlbush. In 2003, Fahlbush was in a car accident with defendant-appellee/cross-appellee Connie Crum-Jones, and Fahlbush sued, seeking a declaration that he was covered under an Erie insurance policy issued to Fahlbush\u2019s employer, Cincinnati Building and Contracting, Inc. (\u201cCBCI\u201d). Defendant-appellee/cross-appellee Geico General Insurance Company insured Fahlbush.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">{\u00b6 2} Before the accident, Fahlbush had been at a CBCI job site, but had left when the work at that site had been stopped because a necessary inspection had been lacking. According to Fahlbush, he drove to the next job site and, while en route, was in a car accident. In its appeal, Erie contends that it did not owe coverage because Fahlbush was not en route to another CBCI job site and that even if he was, the CBCI policy did not cover him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">{\u00b6 3} We note that Erie failed to raise below the issue whether CBCI\u2019s policy covered Fahlbush; notwithstanding this, our review of the record convinces us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>that Fahlbush was covered under the uninsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) provision of the CBCI policy and that the accident occurred while Fahlbush was acting in the scope of his employment. We must therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Fahlbush.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">{\u00b6 4} Also, on the authority of <em>Bowman v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we summarily conclude that Fahlbush\u2019s cross-appeal \u2014 urging us to reverse the trial court\u2019s decision denying prejudgment interest against Erie and Geico \u2014 is merit-less. Our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion and no basis to depart from our previous holding that prejudgment interest should generally not be awarded when the insured\u2019s coverage exceeds his or her damages \u2014 as was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\n<em>I. A Lack of Work</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">{\u00b6 5} In February 2003, Fahlbush went to his assigned job site at Village Brook Apartments and on arrival learned that he could not work because a required inspection had not been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">{\u00b6 6} The site manager advised Fahlbush about another job where CBCI was performing work. Fahlbush attempted to call three different dispatching supervisors for further instructions, but he could reach no one. Fahlbush then decided to drive to the nearest CBCI jobsite, which was at Furrow\u2019s Lumber on Reading Road in Evendale, Ohio. CBCI required Fahlbush to use his own car to drive from job site to job site, and he was considered to be on the job while in transit and was paid for his time driving between job sites. The accident occurred at the intersection of Kemper and Snider Road, when Connie Crum-Jones failed to yield the right-of-way and turned in front of Fahlbush as he was traveling along Kemper Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">{\u00b6 7} Fahlbush was injured, and his car was damaged. Fahlbush filed for workers\u2019 compensation, and the Ohio Industrial Commission ruled that Fahlbush was in the course and scope of employment when the accident occurred, thereby entitling him to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">{\u00b6 8} Fahlbush then brought this declaratory-judgment action seeking coverage under CBCI\u2019s Erie insurance policy. Fahlbush later moved for partial summary judgment on the issues of coverage and scope of employment. Oddly, Erie\u2019s memorandum in opposition did not address the issue whether Fahlbush was covered under the terms of the policy. Consequently, the hearing and trial court\u2019s decision focused on whether Fahlbush was acting in the scope of his employment. In concluding that he was, the court noted that although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>were factual discrepancies in the record, the discrepancies were immaterial to the issue of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">{\u00b6 9} The summary-judgment standard required that Fahlbush\u2019s motion be granted if (1) there were no material issues of fact remaining, (2) Fahlbush was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) based on the evidence, reasonable minds could have come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion was adverse to Erie.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, we review an entry granting summary judgment de novo;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and though the evidence must be construed in favor of the nonmoving party,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we are mindful that only genuine factual disputes that affect the outcome of the suit will preclude summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>II. Scope and Course of Employment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">{\u00b6 10} Erie contends that summary judgment was precluded because material issues of fact existed regarding whether Fahlbush was actually going to work when the accident occurred. Specifically, Erie cites inconsistencies in the record, including the following: (1) Fahlbush\u2019s letter to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) asserted that he could not reach his dispatch supervisor, and that this was not unusual, but in Fahlbush\u2019s first deposition he stated that he had never been in a situation where he was unable to make contact with his employers, (2) Fahlbush claimed in his BWC letter that he had driven to Furrow\u2019s, the closest job site, as he had done in the past, but the facts indicated that he had never in the past gone to a new job site because it was closest, and that he had never traveled to another job site without being specifically assigned by a supervisor, and (3) the affidavits of Fahlbush and Tom Jansen (another CBCI employee) conflicted, according to Erie\u2019s brief, because Jansen claimed that \u201cemployees were given discretion to go from jobsite to jobsite without the need to call the office or owners,\u201d whereas Fahlbush\u2019s affidavit went on \u201cat length to point out that he [had] tried calling the owners to get a new assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 11} In reverse order, we first note that Jansen did not testify that employees were given discretion to travel from job site to job site without the need to call the dispatching supervisors. Jansen\u2019s affidavit stated only that employees were given discretion to leave job sites to obtain tools, parts, or materials without the need to call the office or supervisors. And Erie\u2019s first and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>second examples of inconsistencies in the record were immaterial to the entry of summary judgment in this case. As the trial court correctly noted, \u201cwithout question, there are grounds to assert [that] discrepancies may be shown in [Fahlbush\u2019s] statements. But to raise the situation to the level of being a genuine issue of fact, the credibility must relate to a material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">{\u00b6 12} The issues identified by Erie \u2014 whether Fahlbush had been able to reach his supervisors and whether he had traveled to another job site without being specifically assigned by a supervisor \u2014 were immaterial to whether he was in the course and scope of his employment when the accident occurred. He clearly was.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>III. A Waived Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">{\u00b6 13} The issue whether Fahlbush was covered under the UM endorsement of CBCI\u2019s policy as an \u201cactive member\u201d of CBCI was apparent at trial. But because it was not raised by Erie in the trial court, it has been waived on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">{\u00b6 14} Under the waiver doctrine, the failure to timely advise a trial court of possible error, by objection or otherwise, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The rule ensures that the trial court is afforded an opportunity to avoid or correct an error by placing the adversary on notice of the argument and providing an opportunity for rebuttal, and by providing the trial court with an opportunity to modify its decision or to order a more complete development of the record regarding the issue for review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, a reversible error is one that has been <em>first suggested as error to the trial court.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">{\u00b6 15} Erie failed to raise the issue whether the policy covered Fahlbush at trial. Fahlbush had no notice of the argument, and the trial court was never given the opportunity to develop the record regarding that issue. For these reasons, Erie\u2019s argument that Fahlbush was not covered under the UM endorsement has effectively been waived and is barred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">{\u00b6 16} Even so, it appears that Fahlbush was covered under the UM endorsement. Insurance policies are contracts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When a term is not defined in an insurance policy, as in any contract, the ordinary meaning will prevail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>failure to define a term in an insurance policy does not automatically render the policy ambiguous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, only when no ordinary meaning of the term exists will the failure to define the term constitute an ambiguity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In cases of ambiguities, policy terms will be construed in favor of coverage.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">{\u00b6 17} The Erie UM endorsement stated that insureds were \u201cactive members of the organization.\u201d \u201cActive members\u201d was not defined in the policy. The Second Appellate District, in <em>Florence v. Brown, </em>held that an employee was not an active member under the policy, but failed to state its reasoning or to define the term.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">{\u00b6 18} Because an ordinary meaning of the term existed, the policy\u2019s failure to provide a definition did not create an ambiguity. Instead, the ordinary meaning prevailed. Literally defined, a \u201cmember\u201d is \u201cone of the individuals composing a group.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Likewise, \u201cactive\u201d is defined as \u201cmarked by present operation\u201d or \u201cengaged in an action or activity.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In that sense, Fahlbush was an active member of CBCI. Although Erie has waived the argument, we are convinced that, under the policy, Fahlbush would have been considered an active member. Perhaps the drafters meant something else, but we cannot discern exactly what. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-8\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Hendon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-11\">. <em>Bowman v.
