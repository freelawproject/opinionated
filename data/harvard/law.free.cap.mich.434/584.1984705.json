LI V FELDT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">On May 5, 1983, defendant Chou Yu-Feng Wong was driving on Pontiac Trail in Ann Arbor. In the front passenger seat was plaintiff Chen Li. In the back seat was the owner of the car, defendant Chu-Fen Wong. Chou Yu-Feng Wong ran a red light at the corner of Pontiac Trail and Barton Drive and collided with another vehicle driven by defendant Becky Belknap. Plaintiff suffered injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Plaintiff filed a complaint on March 11, 1986. Among the defendants were the City of Ann Arbor and two of its traffic engineers, Kenneth Feldt and John Robbins. Plaintiff alleged negligence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>part of the city and its engineers in the timing of the traffic signals.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The city moved for summary disposition, which was granted by the trial court because the statute of limitation had run with respect to the negligence claim. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, asserting that the city intentionally created a nuisance in setting the cycle for the traffic light. The court found that the new complaint simply restated the negligence claim, and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Plaintiff appealed in the Court of Appeals, which affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the trial court, finding that plaintiff had stated a valid intentional-nuisance claim, and that intentional nuisance was an exception to governmental immunity. 162 Mich App 767; 413 NW2d 493 (1987) .</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Defendants applied for leave to appeal in this Court. On May 31, 1988, this Court remanded<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the decision in <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139; 422 NW2d 205 (1988) . On remand, the Court of Appeals held that the intentional-nuisance exception to governmental immunity had not been abrogated by <em>Hadfield.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>170 Mich App 256; 428 NW2d 36 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">\n<em>B. GARCIA v CITY OF JACKSON</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Defendant City of Jackson is the owner of the Holton Dam. One of the purposes of the dam is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>control flooding on the Grand River. To accomplish this goal, there is an underground conduit or pipe which draws water from a retention pond above the dam, and diverts the river underneath downtown Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On June 15, 1981, a young boy drowned when he was swimming in the pond and was pulled into the pipe by the current. Thereafter, in response to citizen action, the city contracted with a company to conduct a safety-enhancement study of the dam. Also, the city posted three signs. Two stated, \"No Swimming,\u201d and one stated, \"No Swimming by Order of City of Jackson/Undertow to River Conduit Entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On February 26, 1983, before further safety enhancements were undertaken, Javier Garcia and William Sisk were at the pond upstream from the dam. Garcia decided to go swimming, despite warnings from Sisk and despite the posted signs. After jumping into the water a second time, Garcia was drawn by the undertow into the pipe and drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">On June 23, 1983, Javier Garcia\u2019s family and the personal representative of his estate filed suit against the City of Jackson. Plaintiffs\u2019 first complaint alleged nuisance per se and nuisance in fact. Plaintiffs also asserted that defendant knew of the danger and should have taken more precautions after the first drowning. The trial court granted a motion for summary disposition in favor of defendant, but allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleged only nuisance per se. After summary disposition for defendant again was granted, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, alleging only wilful and wanton misconduct. The court once again ordered summary disposition in favor of defendant because plaintiffs failed to allege ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ments of a claim in avoidance of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that although nuisance was not expressly asserted in the complaint, plaintiffs had sufficiently pled intentional nuisance, a claim not barred by governmental immunity. 152 Mich App 254; 393 NW2d 599 (1986). The Court of Appeals certified a conflict, and this Court held this case in abeyance pending a decision in <em>Hadfield, supra. </em>Once <em>Hadfield </em>was decided, this Court remanded<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the instant case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>Had\u00f1eld. </em>After remand, the Court of Appeals found that intentional nuisance had been pled and that <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>did not overrule the intentional-nuisance exception to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">On April 7, 1989, we granted leave to appeal in the instant case, consolidating it with <em>Li </em>to determine whether defendants are immune from liability on the basis of their status as governmental entities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The dispute in <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>centers on the limited issue of the scope of the nuisance exception to governmental immunity; specifically, whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>entails intentional nuisance. A majority of this Court in <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>found that \u00a7 7 of the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq., </em>mandates an historical approach to defining the proper scope of the nuisance exception.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 7 of the governmental tort liability act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Except as otherwise provided in this act, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. <em>Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed before July 1, 1965, which immunity is affirmed. </em>[MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">A majority in <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>agreed that the second sentence of \u00a7 7 preserved judicially created exceptions to immunity which were formulated before July 1, 1965.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, any case-law exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>devised after this date would not escape govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>mental immunity. We adopt the historical approach endorsed by a majority of this Court in <em>Had\u00f1eld.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The plurality opinion in Had\u00f1eld<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> undertook to explore the extent of judicially created nuisance exceptions prior to July 1, 1965. A clearly recognized exception was the \"intruding-nuisance\u201d or \"trespass-nuisance\u201d exception. <em>Hadfield, supra, </em>p 169, defined trespass-nuisance as a \"trespass or interference with the use or enjoyment of land caused by a physical intrusion that is set in motion by the government or its agents and resulting in personal or property damage.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Trespass-nuisance was the only common-law exception specifically acknowledged by the <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>plurality.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">After recognizing the trespass-nuisance cause of action, the plurality in <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>applied the historical analysis test to intentional nuisance and rejected it as a common-law exception to governmental immunity._</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The two cases which initially formulated an intentional-nuisance exception are <em>Rosario v City of Lansing, </em>403 Mich 124; 268 NW2d 230 (1978),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and <em>Gerzeski v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>403 Mich 149; 268 NW2d 525 (1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In applying the historical analysis, we note that prior to July 1, 1965, there was no recognized intentional-nuisance claim which could escape governmental immunity. Since there was no recognized pre-1965 intentional-nuisance exception, there is no basis for finding such an exception at this time. Thus, assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct in both cases in finding that plaintiffs had pled intentional nuisance, the panels improperly found an exception to governmental immunity on the basis of intentional nuisance. We hold that the historical approach defining the scope of the nuisance exception to governmental immunity mandates a finding that intentional nuisance is not an exception to governmental immunity._</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The <em>Hadfield </em>plurality left undecided whether nuisance per se and limited public nuisance claims are exceptions to governmental immunity. We remand these cases to the Court of Appeals to consider the existence of nuisance per se and public nuisance exceptions to immunity, and their applicability to these cases if, and to the extent that, they were properly raised before the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Accordingly, the decisions of the Court of Appeals in both <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>are reversed.

There was a majority for the result only.

Including the three-justice plurality which adopted the historical analysis, six participating justices agreed that the Legislature intended to codify common-law exceptions. Justice Boyle stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">The basic premise of the lead opinion is that \u00a77 of the governmental tort liability act requires a continuation of the nuisance exception as formulated prior to its enactment in 1964 and as amended by 1970 PA 155. <em>I agree that the Legislature intended to codify the common law of governmental immunity </em>.... <em>[Hadfield, </em>p 204. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Justice Levin, in a separate opinion, also agreed that at least the trespass-nuisance exception survived the enactment of the governmental tort liability act. <em>Id., </em>p 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">In yet another opinion, Justice Archer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-9\">I agree with the lead opinion that under the second sentence of \u00a7 7 <em>the exceptions to governmental immunity which existed prior to the enactment of the statute are retained. [Id., </em>p 214. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Thus, a majority of this Court has settled on an interpretation of the second sentence of \u00a7 7 as recently as March 29, 1988. In his concurrence/dissent, Justice Griffin reads \u00a7 7 not to include common-law exceptions to immunity. Justice Griffin urges an interpretation of \u00a7 7 which would undercut the studied effort manifested in the <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Even if the legislative intent behind this sentence were not clear, it has been said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-12\">Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. . . . This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. [Burnet v <em>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co, </em>285 US 393, 406; 52 S Ct 443; 76 L Ed 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), quoted in <em>Abendschein v Farrell, </em>382 Mich 510, 517; 170 NW2d 137 (1969).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\"> With reference to the second sentence of \u00a7 7, <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>398 Mich 1, 11; 247 NW2d 530 (1976), states in part, \"[o]bviously this language must be construed as an 'affirmation\u2019 of case-law precedent on the subject of the state\u2019s immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Justice Ryan adopted this interpretation in his dissenting opinion in <em>Rosario v City of Lansing, </em>403 Mich 124, 146; 268 NW2d 230 (1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">P]n order to determine the scope of the now codified immunity, we must determine the scope of its antecedent \"existing immunity.\u201d Since the common-law or \"existing immunity\u201d doctrine included certain judicially created exceptions which defined its limits, the legislatively codified immunity is limited and defined by the same exceptions. One of these exceptions is here in issue: the doctrine of \"nuisance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">In the instant case, the concurrence/dissent suggests that the \"legislative intent underlying the second sentence of \u00a7 7 could merely have been to 'affirm\u2019 the state\u2019s preexisting <em>absolute </em>[no governmental function limitation] sovereign immunity . . . .\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 601. However, in <em>Ross v Consumers Power (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 606; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-11\">[A]t the time \u00a7 7 was enacted, the state was immune from tort liability when it was engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function .... [See also <em>id., </em>p 602, n. 15.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Further support for the view that the state did not have absolute immunity prior to the enactment of the statute can be found in <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, supra, </em>p 11; <em>Manion v State Hwy Comm\u2019r, </em>303 Mich 1, 19; 5 NW2d 527 (1942); <em>Daszkiewicz v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>301 Mich 212, 220; 3 NW2d 71 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">The concurrence/dissent also suggests that the Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to treat sovereign (state) and nonsovereign entities differently with respect to immunity. However, the stated purpose of the governmental tort liability act is to \"make uniform the liability of municipal corporations, political subdivisions, and the state, its agencies and departments, when engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function . . . .\u201d Preamble to MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq. </em>Also, a member of the special committee which drafted the act stated that the committee \"sought to achieve legislation that would put all government on the same basis .... This statute puts all agencies of government on the same footing with regard to tort liability.\u201d Abels, <em>Report of committee on tort liability, </em>28 NIMLO Municipal LR 432, 464 (1965). Therefore, \u00a77 should be read to give effect to the stated purpose of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Furthermore, the nature of governmental immunity is such that there is no reason to treat the state and local entities differently. The reasoning behind governmental immunity was set forth in <em>Nicholson v Detroit, </em>129 Mich 246, 258-259; 88 NW 695 (1902):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">The true theory is that the township or city represents the State in causing these things to be done, and, like the State, it enjoys immunity from responsibility in case of injury to individuals . . . [because, in] imparting a portion of its powers, the State also imparts its own immunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Another reason to read \u00a7 7 as preserving common-law exceptions is set forth in Cooperrider, <em>The court, the legislature, and governmental tort liability in Michigan, </em>72 Mich LR 187, 279-280 (1973). The trespass-nuisance claim was valid long before the creation of the governmental function defense. Mr. Cooperrider went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-9\">It reflects one of the strongest claims for relief that can be asserted .... There is nothing in their public expressions to indicate that those who drafted the statute had any such change in mind; indeed, one of them summed the statute up in these terms: \"The net effect of Act 170, 1964, is to largely return to municipal corporations the position they enjoyed prior to the decision of the <em>Williams </em>[v <em>Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961) (abrogating governmental immunity for municipalities)] case.\u201d This is surely a situation where the legislature should be expected to express an intent to make an important change in the law in words incapable of being misunderstood, rather than relying upon implication. . . . [The governmental function defense] has never been applied by the Michigan court to protect any governmental agency against liability in a situation recognized to be within the nuisance-trespass category. [The first sentence], I submit, should be seen as a restoration of the governmental-function defense as it existed in the case law, alongside the nuisance-trespass head of liability.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\"> Justice Brickley wrote the plurality opinion joined by Chief Justice Riley and Justice Cavanagh.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b788-9\"> The Taking Clause of the constitution rests at the foundation of the trespass-nuisance exception. Justice Ryan wrote about the taking rationale in his dissent in <em>Gerzeski v Dep\u2019t of State Hwys, </em>403 Mich 149, 170; 268 NW2d 525 (1978), which is cited in <em>Hadfield, supra, </em>p 165:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">In [intruding-nuisance] cases the potentially dangerous instrumentality or condition literally moves from government-owned land onto adjacent property.

As Justice Levin observed in <em>Ross, supra, </em>pp 668-670, three years after <em>Williams </em>abrogated the common-law immunity of municipalities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">[T]he Legislature enacted the governmental tort liability act. The primary purpose of the act, which, \"was drafted by a special committee of the Michigan Association of Municipal Attorneys and lobbied through the legislature with the strong backing of that association\u2019s parent organization, the Michigan Municipal League,\u201d appears to have been to restore immunity to non-sovereign governmental units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">To achieve this purpose, the Legislature provided in the first sentence of \u00a7 7 that \"[e]xcept as in this act otherwise provided, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d The act thereby conferred uniform statutory immunity on all governmental entities\u2014 both the state and non-sovereign political units <em>alike </em>\u2014 when <em>engaged in the exercise or discharge of a \u2019\u2019governmental function.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\">To make clear that, by restoring to municipal corporations immunity for governmental functions and making uniform the immunity of all govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>mental entities for governmental functions, <em>it was not thereby waiving the state\u2019s common-law absolute sovereign immunity for non-governmental functions, the Legislature provided in the second sentence of \u00a77 that \"[ejxcept as otherwise provided herein, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed heretofore, which immunity is affirmed.\u201d The \"which immunity is affirmed\u201d clause codified the state\u2019s common-law sovereign immunity from tort liability </em>\u2014 an <em>absolute immunity except to the extent it is waived by the Legislature. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In my opinion, the fundamental purposes of the act were to restore immunity to municipalities, grant immunity to all levels of government when engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, and prevent judicial abrogation of governmental and sovereign immunity. The second sentence of \u00a7 7 was merely intended to prevent further erosion of the <em>state\u2019s </em>common-law immunity, rather than preserve any common-law exceptions to <em>governmental </em>immunity. Under this analysis, unless the activity of a municipality falls within one of the five narrowly drawn statutory exceptions,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the only question remaining in these cases is whether the activity is a \"governmental function,\u201d as defined by the Legislature.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">For these reasons, and because, in any event, plaintiffs failed to preserve for appeal the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>whether either nuisance per se or public nuisance is a common-law exception to governmental immunity, I would not remand these cases to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<author id=\"b800-5\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9T\"><em>(separate </em>opinion).

While the majority remands the cases for a determination of whether those categories of nuisance are exceptions to immunity, it opines that \"any case-law exceptions devised after [July 1, 1965, the effective date of the governmental tort liability act,] would not escape governmental immunity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question whether there is a nuisance per se or public nuisance exception to governmental immunity should be decided in a case where the court concludes that factually there is a nuisance per se or a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The Court states that the negligence per se and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>public nuisance issues can only be considered by the Court of Appeals on remand if \"they were properly raised before the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is, however, for the Court of Appeals in the first instance to decide to what extent issues need to be properly raised and what constitutes properly raising them before that Court.
