Because the prior probate court verdict did not necessarily determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant, we hold that the principles of collateral estoppel do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In February, 1986, the Michigan Department of Social Services petitioned the juvenile division of the Jackson County Probate Court to take jurisdiction of a child, then three years and ten months old, on the basis of allegations that defendant, her father, had sexually abused her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>initiated child protective proceedings, the adjudicative phase of which leads to a determination of whether statutory grounds exist for juvenile court jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If such grounds are found to exist and the court assumes jurisdiction, dispositional proceedings are conducted thereafter to determine what action, if any, should be taken with respect to the child. MCR 5.961 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">At the time the petition was filed in probate court, the defendant father had been divorced from the child\u2019s mother for a period of two months. Although the child lived with her mother, defendant had been awarded joint custody of the child from the date of the couple\u2019s legal separation in February, 1985, and prior to the filing of the petition, he had physical custody of the child every weekend. However, following the filing of the petition, unsupervised visitations by the child in the home of her father were suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Defendant contested the petition and requested a jury trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the petition was filed, but prior to the jury trial held in probate court, the prosecuting attorney, who represented the dss in the probate proceeding, filed a criminal complaint and warrant in the Jackson Circuit Court, charging defendant with second-degree criminal sexual con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>duct, on the basis of the same facts alleged in the probate court petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In the probate court trial which took place on June 16 and 17, 1986, the testimony dealt almost exclusively with the allegations of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the close of the trial, the probate court instructed the jury that the issue it was to decide was whether the child came within the jurisdiction of the court. The jury was further instructed that a child comes within the jurisdiction of the court if the child\u2019s home or environment is unfit for the child by reason of neglect, cruelty, criminality, or depravity on the part of a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The jury was given a verdict form which allowed it to check off one of two verdicts: jurisdiction, or no jurisdiction. The jury returned a verdict of \"no jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The judge then asked the jury, \"Do you say upon your oath that you find the minor ... is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>a neglected minor in the manner and form as the People have in their information in this cause charged?\u201d Each of the jury members responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On July 28, 1986, the probate judge granted a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and then ordered a new trial. However, the Jackson Circuit Court subsequently reversed, reasoning that the jury verdict deprived the probate judge of jurisdiction to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Thereafter, the Jackson Circuit Court dismissed the criminal charges against defendant on the ground that the jury verdict in probate court determined \"that the prosecution had not proved a case of sexual abuse by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed. 168 Mich App 384; 423 NW2d 668 (1988). We then granted leave to appeal, limited to the issue whether, in view of the prior proceedings in probate court, principles of collateral estoppel prohibited the subsequent prosecution of defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 431 Mich 904 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of an issue in a subsequent, different cause of action between the same parties where the prior proceeding culminated in a valid, final judgment and the issue was (1) actually litigated, and (2) necessarily determined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Jacobson v </em>Miller, 41 Mich 90, 93; 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>NW 1013 (1879); <em>Howell v Vito\u2019s Trucking &amp; Excavating Co, </em>386 Mich 37, 42; 191 NW2d 313 (1971); Restatement Judgments, \u00a768, p 293. 1 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 27, p 250.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We believe it is important at the outset to recognize that in the body of case law applying this principle the vast majority of cases involve the applicability of collateral estoppel where there are two civil proceedings. Cases involving \"crossover estoppel,\u201d where an issue adjudicated in a civil proceeding is claimed to be precluded in a subsequent criminal proceeding, or vice versa, are relatively recent and rare.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">There is no set formula for determining whether relitigation of an issue is precluded by collateral estoppel. Initially it is necessary, according to the First Restatement of Judgments, to establish that the same parties are involved in both proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court last affirmed the \"same party\u201d requirement in <em>Howell, supra </em>at 42, wherein we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>said that one of the \"critical factors\u201d in applying collateral estoppel is the determination of whether the respective litigants were parties or privy to a party to an action in which a valid judgment has been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Although the named-party plaintiff in the instant case is the People of the State of Michigan, in practical terms the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted is the Jackson County Prosecutor, who also represented the Department of Social Services in the probate court proceeding. Defendant argues that even though the Department of Social Services was the nominal party in the earlier proceeding, both the department and the prosecutor\u2019s office are creatures of the state and thus should be considered to be the same party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree. A functional analysis of the role of the prosecutor in both proceedings is appropriate in this case, and leads us to conclude that privity is sufficient to satisfy the \"same party\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In analyzing whether an issue was \"actually litigated\u201d in the prior proceeding, the Court must look at more than what has been pled and argued. We must also consider whether the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted has had a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and fair opportunity to litigate the issue. <em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc v Univ of Illinois Foundation, </em>402 US 313, 329; 91 S Ct 1434; 28 L Ed 2d 788 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">It is clear that the issue of defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of his daughter was the factual focus of the jury trial in probate court. The transcript reveals that the testimony of the witnesses and the arguments of the parties centered on the allegation of sexual abuse that is also the basis of the criminal charge. At least in this sense, it can be said that the issue whether defendant sexually abused the child was \"actually litigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We do not overlook that the rules governing child protective proceedings in probate court are significantly different than the rules which apply to criminal trials.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we will later discuss, such procedural differences raise serious doubt about the soundness of applying \"cross-over estoppel\u201d in situations such as this case presents. However, we do not base our decision on a finding that the prosecutor was seriously disadvantaged or otherwise denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. Indeed, in its brief the amicus curiae Prosecuting Attorneys Association stated that it is \"fair to say that the issue was fully litigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">We move now to a discussion of the principal ground on which our decision rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Assuming arguendo that the issue as to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>collateral estoppel is asserted has been fully litigated, we conclude that the instant case falls short with respect to another requirement, i.e., that the issue be \"necessarily determined\u201d by the judgment in the prior proceeding. An issue is necessarily determined only if it is \"essential\u201d to the judgment. 1 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a727, p 250, comment h, p 258. In order for collateral estoppel to operate as a bar to a subsequent prosecution, the jury in the earlier probate proceeding must <em>necessarily </em>have determined that defendant was not guilty of the criminal sexual conduct charged in the prosecutor\u2019s complaint. <em>MacKenzie v Union Guardian Trust Co, </em>262 Mich 563, 581-582; 247 NW 914 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The inability of a court to determine upon what basis an acquitting jury reached its verdict, is, by itself, enough to preclude the defense of collateral estoppel. See anno: <em>Modern status of doctrine of res judicata in criminal cases, </em>9 ALR3d 203, 240. Collateral estoppel applies only where the basis of the prior judgment can be ascertained clearly, definitely, and unequivocally. See <em>Dowling v United States, </em>493 US \u2014; 110 S Ct 668; 107 L Ed 2d 708 (1990); <em>Sealfon v United States, </em>332 US 575; 68 S Ct 237; 92 L Ed 180 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The verdict in the first proceeding need not explicitly have addressed the issue to be precluded, however. The fact that a verdict is a general verdict may make the determination of what issues have been decided problematic, but it does not automatically bar the application of collateral estoppel. <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436, 444; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970). In <em>Ashe, </em>the United States Supreme Court suggested that in the case of a general verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial the determination of what was necessarily determined by the verdict should start <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>with an examination of the record of the prior proceeding and culminate in an inquiry \"whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Dowling, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">That a verdict may conclusively determine certain issues by implication can be illustrated by the instant case. Had the jury in the earlier proceeding found that the probate court had jurisdiction of the child, that verdict would necessarily have determined that defendant had engaged in the conduct alleged, because that conduct was the only basis submitted to the jury for bringing her within the jurisdiction of the court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A finding that the petition\u2019s allegations were proved by a preponderance of the evidence was thus essential to a verdict of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The verdict of \"no jurisdiction,\u201d however, does not support the opposite conclusion. In the instant case, the probate judge stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">I do instruct you that this is a child protection case. It is not a criminal case. Therefore, the issue before you is not that of guilt or innocence but the issue is whether [the child] comes within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Division of the Jackson County Probate Court. You should not consider this proceeding to be in anyway [sic] involved with the criminal law so far as your deliberations are concerned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The clear import of that instruction is that even if the jury believed that a criminal violation had occurred, it was not required to find the child\u2019s home or environment to be unfit so as to warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In short, a finding of innocence was not essential to a verdict of no jurisdiction; thus, the verdict did not \"necessarily determine\u201d the issue of criminal guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Furthermore, during the course of the trial the jury learned that the child\u2019s mother had exclusive physical custody of the child and that visitations with her father had ceased. The jury might have concluded on that basis alone that the child did not require the protection of the probate court. Thus the jury\u2019s verdict could rationally have been based on grounds other than a determination of defendant\u2019s innocence of the allegations in the petition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aic\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\">Apart from our conclusion that defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence was not necessarily determined by the jury verdict in the probate proceeding, the purposes of a child protective proceeding and a criminal proceeding are so fundamentally different that application in this instance of collateral estoppel would be contrary to sound public policy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The purpose and focus of a neglect or abuse proceeding in the juvenile division of the probate court is the protection of children. To this end, proceedings may be initiated by anyone who has information that a child is in need of the court\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To maximize protection of the child, and at the same time safeguard the interests of parents whose children are the subject of a petition, the court rules provide for expedited proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The probate court\u2019s protective function is also promoted by procedure which allows for a rehearing or a new trial whenever new evidence comes to light suggesting that the child needs court protection. MCR 5.992.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In contrast, the focus of a criminal proceeding is on the guilt or innocence of the accused. The interests of children may be affected, e.g., those related to the accused, but such interests are not taken into account in determining whether an accused is guilty of criminal charges. As the United States Supreme Court stressed in <em>Standefer v United </em>States, 447 US 10, 25; 100 S Ct 1999; 64 L Ed 2d 689 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\"[T]he purpose of a criminal court is <em>not </em>to provide a forum for the ascertainment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public interest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at the same time safeguarding the rights of the individual defendant.\u201d [Quoting <em>United States v Stan</em>defer, 610 F2d 1076, 1093 (CA 3, 1979). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The disparate purposes of the two types of proceedings argue strongly against the application of collateral estoppel. If we were to endorse the proposition that a determination of no jurisdiction in a child protective proceeding operates to collaterally estop criminal charges, we would invite the risk that the proper functions of the two proceedings would be compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Typically, a child protective proceeding is initiated by the petition of a person other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>prosecutor. Once the petition is filed, however, the prosecutor must be available at the request of the probate court to review the petition for legal sufficiency and to appear at the proceedings. MCR 5.914.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">To avoid the effect of collateral estoppel, if it were to be made applicable, a prosecutor would be required to develop criminal charges indicated by the petition and bring them to trial before a determination concerning jurisdiction could be reached in the probate proceeding. However, the burden of proving criminal charges beyond a reasonable doubt, added to problems presented by conflicting procedural<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and scheduling requirements of the two courts, would make it extremely difficult, and often impossible, for the criminal charges to be brought to trial in circuit court in advance of the jurisdiction determination in probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Thus, the petitioner or the prosecutor would face an unfortunate choice that is not in the public interest: whether to proceed on the petition in probate court because of concern for the child, or to delay the probate proceeding because of concern that a verdict of nonjurisdiction would preclude criminal prosecution of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">We are persuaded by public policy considerations that such an election between criminal and child protective proceedings should not be judicially imposed through the application of collateral estoppel. See <em>Joiner v State, </em>500 So 2d 81 (Ala Crim App, 1986).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Our conclusion that collateral estoppel should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>not apply in such situations is reinforced by the Restatement of Judgments, 2d, which instructs that another exception to the general rule of issue preclusion is available when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">A new determination of the issue is warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts or by factors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction between them .... <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 28(3), p 273.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">This exception focuses on an \"analysis of the comparative quality and extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts, of their relative competence to deal with the particular issue, and of the legislative purpose in allocating jurisdiction between them.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Note, 1 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 28, p 287.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Even if it were to be assumed that the \"quality\u201d and \"extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts\u201d (probate and circuit) are comparable, we believe that the \"competence\u201d of the probate court to conclusively determine in a child protective proceeding the criminal guilt or innocence of an accused is necessarily compromised by the appropriate focus of the probate court on the protection of children. Further, the disparity of \u201clegislative purpose in allocating jurisdiction\u201d as between the two courts was underscored by the Legislature when it inserted this language in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>statute under which the petition to protect the child was filed:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Proceedings under this chapter shall not be considered to be criminal proceedings.

We remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-10\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> The initial petition read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">On or about 02-13-86, [the child] was interviewed by petitioner.

The question presented is whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that this prosecution is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. We would hold that it did not, and would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">A probate court jury found that the court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>not have \"jurisdiction\u201d of defendant Gregory Steven Gates\u2019 daughter. The majority concludes that the verdict of the probate court jury did not \"determine\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Gates had not committed the act of sexual abuse of his three-year-old daughter charged both in the information in the instant case and in the petition filed by the Department of Social Services in the earlier tried probate court proceeding. That conclusion is premised on the manner in which the jury was instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We would hold that the entire record in the probate court proceeding \u2014 the charge set forth in the petition, all the evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the instructions read as a whole\u2014 should be assessed in deciding whether the verdict of no jurisdiction constituted a determination by the jury that Gates had not sexually abused his daughter. That decision cannot properly be premised on a construction of a single sentence in the instructions viewed in the abstract, separate and apart from the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The judge instructed the jury, in the form of the statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the standard instructions developed by probate judges,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the jury must find, from all the evidence, whether the child\u2019s home or environment, by reason of criminality, was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>unfit place for her to live. The question, so posed, viewed in the abstract, did indeed permit the jury to find that the criminal conduct charged did not render her home unfit. It is possible that the jury understood the instructions as authorizing it to render a verdict that the home was fit although it was convinced that Gates had in fact sexually abused his daughter. And that the jury found that Gates had in fact sexually abused his daughter but nevertheless found that her home was fit. Possible, but not likely.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The language of the statute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the phrasing of the instructions reflect recognition that some acts of criminal misconduct might not render a home unfit for a child. A parent who circulates counterfeit money, embezzles, pollutes the environment, or commits other crimes that some might view as more or less serious, may nevertheless provide a fit home for his children. The statute does not permit the probate court to assume jurisdiction unless the jury finds that the criminal act renders the home unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The jury was thus properly instructed that \"[w]hether a parent\u2019s violation of the criminal law renders the home or environment of the child an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>unfit place for the child is for you to decide based upon all of the <em>evidence </em>in the case.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">There was, however, no evidence or argument\u2014 separate and apart from the evidence tending to show that Gates had committed the act of sexual abuse and the evidence to the contrary \u2014 focusing on or tending to show whether the home or environment was or was not fit. Thus, assuming arguendo that the jury understood that it was authorized to find the child\u2019s home fit although it found that her father had sexually abused her, there is no reason to suppose that the jury in fact found that Gates had sexually abused his daughter but nevertheless found that her home was fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The amended petition filed in the probate court alleged that Gates had touched his daughter\u2019s genitals for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All the evidence introduced by both parties was directed to the primary allegation in the petition: that Gates had touched his daughter\u2019s genitals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither Gates nor his lawyer contended, expressly or by innuendo, during the examination of witnesses or during oral argument, that even if the jury found that Gates had so touched his daughter\u2019s genitals for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, her home was nevertheless a fit place for her to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">A different question would be presented if three issues had been litigated: whether the child had been so touched, whether Gates had so touched her, and, if so, whether her home was nevertheless a fit place for her to live. Because no evidence was introduced focusing on whether the home was fit, even were the jury to find that the criminal conduct alleged in fact occurred, the majority\u2019s assertion that factors other than Gates\u2019 guilt or inno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>cence may have been the basis of the \"no jurisdiction\u201d verdict is tenuous at best.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Maryland Court of Appeals held that \"the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents the State from criminally trying the defendant on charges of sexual assault and related offenses when, in a prior civil proceeding based upon the same alleged incidents, the court dismissed the action on the ground that the State had failed to prove that the defendant had committed the acts.\u201d <em>Bowling v </em>State, 298 Md 396, 398; 470 A2d 797 (1984).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court said that \"[t]he civil character of the first proceeding does not make inapplicable the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a subsequent criminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In <em>People v Sims, </em>32 Cal 3d 468; 186 Cal Rptr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>77; 651 P2d 321 (1982), the Supreme Court of California applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a criminal case that was preceded by an administrative hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">Collateral estoppel may be applied to decisions made by administrative agencies \"[w]hen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate . . . .\u201d[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The court added that \u201d[t]he [administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>agency] decision exonerating [the accused] of fraud may be given collateral estoppel effect.

In deciding whether an issue of fact was actually litigated and determined, a court should assess the entire record and decide the question based on the probabilities and not possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">That was the approach of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970). The Court said that \"[w]here a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general verdict\u201d in deciding whether relitigation is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a court should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\"examine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The majority cites <em>Ashe </em>with apparent approval, but does not in its analysis employ the standard there stated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The trial centered on Gates\u2019 culpability. In his closing remarks to the jury, the judge said: \"When you deliberate, you are only allowed to consider the evidence which has been properly admitted in this case.\u201d The only \"evidence\u201d that had been admitted was testimony concerning whether the child had been molested and, if so, whether Gates was the person who had molested her. No evidence otherwise bearing on the fitness of her home had been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Where the trier of fact/court renders alternative determinations of fact or law either of which would have supported the earlier judgment, neither determination is \"essential to the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Where, however, only one issue is litigated,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> only one issue could have been determined, and ordinarily there is no reason to suppose that another issue, not litigated, was determined or was determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The parties frame the debate on a given issue through their presentations. They define the parameters in which the jury will consider the competing evidence and arguments. When the parties to a controversy plead, litigate, and submit an issue to the jury, a general verdict should ordinarily be regarded as deciding that issue. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>should be a strong presumption that the decision of the jury is based on the issue pled, litigated, and submitted, rebuttable only by compelling evidence that the verdict did not decide that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Here the only issue that was litigated was whether Gates had sexually abused his daughter. The overwhelming probability is that the factual issue determined by the jury, when it rendered its verdict, was whether Gates had sexually abused his daughter, as the people so vigorously, but so far unsuccessfully, contended.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">There is considerable uncertainty in most lawsuits. The law does not require absolute proof or certainty. The standard applied by the majority in the instant case, in deciding whether the factual issue of Gates\u2019 culpability was determined by the jury, is higher than the standard the jury, on the retrial ordered by the majority, will apply in again deciding that factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel evolved in response to \"the concern of the public in the settlement of litigation in the interest of a stable society and in minimizing expense and effort of the courts, as well as of litigants.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Application of the doctrine in a case where a person\u2019s liberty interests are at stake provides assurance that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">matters once determined in an adversary action shall be deemed conclusive, thus furnishing a basis upon which to predicate future conduct without fear of repeated vexation arising from relitigation of determined issues.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The people failed to convince the jury of Gates\u2019 guilt. He should not be subjected to relitigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the same basic issue \u2014 whether he sexually molested his daughter \u2014 in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The majority states that the purposes of a child protective proceeding and a criminal prosecution are so different that application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel would be contrary to sound public policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Although the general purposes of the two proceedings differ, there is an overlap, and the purposes are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The instant case demonstrates that a function of the probate court proceeding may in fact be to determine whether a parent engaged in criminal misconduct with respect to the parent\u2019s child. Where the probate court petition is based solely on an allegation of parental criminal misconduct with respect to the child, the fate of both the child and the parent are inextricably tied to the determination of the parent\u2019s guilt or innocence. The probate court cannot act to \"protect\u201d the child by acquiring jurisdiction of the child, unless the jury finds that the parent is guilty of the criminal misconduct respecting the child charged in the petition. Where sexual abuse is charged, the purpose sought to be achieved by initiating the abuse/neglect proceeding can only be realized upon a finding by the jury that the parent did in fact commit the charged act of criminal misconduct respecting the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In an abuse/neglect proceeding, various considerations may inform the jury\u2019s verdict. The application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a particular case does not, however, depend on what may occur in another case. It depends on what occurred in the particular case. In the instant case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u2014typical or atypical \u2014 the only issue pled, litigated, and submitted to the trier of fact was Gates\u2019 guilt or innocence. No evidence bearing on any other issue was provided for the jury\u2019s consideration. Collateral estoppel effect should not be denied where there is issue identity, where only one issue was pled, litigated, and submitted to the jury, because in another case more than one issue might be litigated or because there is in theory a difference in the primary purposes of the two proceedings.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The majority contends that applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel in the instant case would, in future cases, oblige a prosecutor to choose between commencing a criminal prosecution to vindicate the public interest in ascertaining guilt and filing a petition in probate court to protect the interests of the child.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Reference is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>made to the so-called \"42 day\u201d rule set forth in MCR 5.972, which provides that if a child has been taken from the home, i.e., the child is \"in placement,\u201d \"the trial must commence as soon as possible but not later than 42 days after the child is placed by the court . . . .\u201d The majority argues that because of the forty-two-day rule, it would be \"extremely difficult, and often impossible, for the criminal charges to be brought to trial in circuit court in advance of the jurisdiction determination in probate court.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The scheduling problem \u2014 which case to try first \u2014can be resolved by agreement of the parties or by an amendment of the court rules that this Court has the power to decree. The Court is currently considering a proposal to extend the time frame from forty-two to sixty-three days.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Prosecutors are generally called upon to participate in an abuse/neglect proceeding.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When the prosecutor is intimately involved in the litigation, such that the prosecutor has a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in the abuse/neglect proceeding, and those issues are actually litigated in the probate proceeding and are the same issues sought to be litigated in the criminal prosecution, the doctrine of collateral estoppel should apply.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The probate court is a court of record,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> in contrast with an administrative agency.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The prosecutor generally represents the petitioner in a child protective proceeding. The lawyers on both sides are likely to be the same in both the child protective proceeding and the criminal proceeding. This is not a case where the litigants did not have as strong an incentive to litigate in the earlier proceeding as they have in the later proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">If the prosecutor does not participate in the probate court proceeding, application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel may be inappropriate because the prosecutor has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The record does not substantiate the majority\u2019s assertion that the competence of the probate court to determine in a child protective proceeding the criminal guilt or innocence of the parent \"is necessarily compromised by the appropriate focus of the probate court on the protection of children.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The prosecutor in the instant child protective proceeding focused entirely on the asserted criminal guilt of Gates.
