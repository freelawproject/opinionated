The plaintiff, Old Orchard by the Bay Associates, filed a complaint on February 10, 1978, in Oakland Circuit Court, alleging that defendant, Hamilton Mutual Insurance Company, was liable under a surety bond for latent defects relating to the construction of an apartment project which Old Orchard owns. The litigation was pending for three years, during which time the parties commenced discovery, and in 1980 the case was mediated.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">By a stipulated order filed February 6, 1981, Old Orchard and Hamilton Mutual voluntarily submitted their entire dispute to statutory arbitration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arbitration proceedings, including extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>evidentiary hearings, took place throughout 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 6, 1985, five years after the execution of the arbitration agreement, the Commercial Arbitration Tribunal entered an award of $300,000, plus statutory interest, in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The arbitrator\u2019s interest award to Old Orchard was computed from the date of the filing of the circuit court complaint at the statutory judgment rate, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. Subsequently, defendant Hamilton Mutual filed several motions, including a claim that the arbitrators erred in awarding interest other than that allowable under the prejudgment interest statute, MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, from the date of the arbitration award. The trial court confirmed the award in all respects on May 21, 1986, including confirmation of the award of interest at the statutory judgment rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Defendant Hamilton Mutual appealed on several issues. The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished opinion, affirmed on all issues, except as to the interest award. In a split decision, the Court of Appeals held that MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>have been applied, allowing for an award of five percent annual interest from the date of the 1985 arbitration award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal, while denying the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal as cross-appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 430 Mich 891 (1988). The defendant claims that the plaintiff is entitled to interest only from the date of the arbitration award at a five percent annual rate under MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4. We reject that argument and reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals on the interest issue and hold as follows: (1) where the parties to a contract dispute have no agreement to arbitrate, and (2) do not later stipulate to an interest entitlement or rate (assuming the original action is not dismissed),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3)(a) statutory interest is awardable on the judgment from the date of the filing of the complaint until the judgment is entered, and (b) such interest is also awardable thereafter until the judgment is paid, as provided in MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Before discussing the merits, the relevant statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>tory provisions are set forth briefly. Two statutes potentially govern the award of interest to the prevailing party in any contractual dispute. MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 authorizes the award of interest where the parties fail to agree on the matter of entitlement to interest in an action. It applies to specified types of disputes founded on a contract that are resolved less formally \"by verdict, report of referees, award of arbitrators, or by assessment made by the clerk of the court or by any other mode of assessment according to law . . . .\u201d Statutory interest under MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 accrues <em>from the date of the award until payment or judgment is rendered thereupon.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 authorizes the payment of interest on all money judgments awarded in \"civil actions.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The award of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>statutory judgment interest under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 is mandatory, although the parties may vary the applicable interest rate within certain parameters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The statutory interest provision that applies in a given action is a purely legal question to be resolved by means of statutory interpretation, except where the parties stipulate to an interest schedule or otherwise agree on the matter of interest as part of their arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parties in the instant dispute, however, never agreed upon the matter of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Plaintiff Old Orchard alleges that it was error for the Court of Appeals to state as a broad rule that \"interest on an arbitration award in an action founded on a contract is governed by MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree. This conclusion is based on a close examination of both the language and history of the two interest statutes at issue, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>as the purposes that the Legislature sought to accomplish in enacting these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">As this Court stated in <em>White v Ann Arbor, </em>406 Mich 554, 562; 281 NW2d 283 (1979), and <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 478; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), the interpretative task at hand requires the Court to infer legislative intent from the language used in the statute, as well as to consider the statutory language in the context of the special subject matter which it addressed. The meaning of the statute must be viewed \"in light of the general purpose sought to be accomplished or the evil sought to be remedied by the constitution or statute.\u201d <em>White, supra </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The rationale for awarding statutory interest under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 is primarily a compensatory one. The Revised Judicature Act interest statute serves the purpose of compensating the prevailing party for loss of the use of the funds awarded as a money judgment, as well as offsetting the costs of bringing a court action. In <em>Denham v Bedford, </em>407 Mich 517, 534-536; 287 NW2d 168 (1980), this Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">The Michigan Legislature has dictated that interest should accrue from the date of filing the complaint. . . . [T]he legislative purpose was to compensate the prevailing party for the delay in payment of money damages and to cover the costs of litigation . . . .[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The second purpose of awarding judgment inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>est is to provide an incentive for prompt settlement. See <em>Gage v Ford Motor Co, </em>423 Mich 250, 257; 377 NW2d 709 (1985). The award of statutory prejudgment interest under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 in suits to collect on an insurance contract is a useful illustration; in this context, prejudgment interest serves a distinct deterrent function by both encouraging settlement at an earlier time and discouraging a defendant from, delaying litigation solely to make payment at a later time. See <em>Matich v Modern Research Corp, </em>430 Mich 1, 12-15; 420 NW2d 67 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In this case, the plaintiff filed a complaint to resolve a contract dispute in the absence of any prior agreement to arbitrate or any agreement on the appropriate interest rate. Is this a \"civil action\u201d resulting in a judgment of recovery in the form of \"money damages\u201d and therefore governed by the prejudgment interest provisions of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013? Or, is the plaintiff\u2019s recovery more properly considered a \"liquidation\u201d or \"ascertainment\u201d of debt pursuant to the \"award of an arbitrator\u201d and therefore governed by MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Since 1965 there have been two prejudgment interest statutes in Michigan, rather than just one. Until recently, the statutory scheme was more orderly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By exploring the history of the two interest statutes, one can see that they share both common purposes as well as common origins.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">A summary of the evolution of the two interest statutes which must be interpreted is summarized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The right to judgment interest originated in an 1827 Michigan territorial statute which created an entitlement to interest from the time a judgment was entered. See 2 Laws of Territory of Michigan, p 491 (1874). In an even earlier statute (an act of 1809), a conventional rate of interest was authorized (at the specific rate of six percent) under any contract \u2014 with only a few specified exceptions. (The 1809 act was copied from a Vermont statute, see 4 Laws of Territory of Michigan, pp 61-62 [1884].) Both statutes then appeared together in chapter 6 of the Revised Statutes of 1838.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>The placement and language of these provisions indicate that they were intended to further a common purpose. Section 8 (now MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013) applied to all actions resolved by means of formal dispute resolution, and \u00a7 9 (now MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4) applied to contract-based claims where the amount owed was to be determined by report of referees, award of arbitrators, or by any other mode of assessment according to law. Yet, the purpose of both provisions was the same as is evident from their language and function. The two statutes were coordinated to accomplish the same goal of compensating parties for the loss of the use of funds wrongfully detained for the period when they were due but unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The subsequent history of the two provisions, prior to 1965, does not alter this conclusion. While these statutory provisions have since been assigned to separate chapters in the Compiled Laws,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> their language was, until 1965, essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the same as when originally enacted. MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, formerly \u00a79 of the 1838 Revised Statutes, has remained substantively unchanged. (The only minor amendments made to this provision, in 1846, were editorial in nature. See RS 1846, ch 34, \u00a77.) MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 also did not undergo any major changes even as it was moved and edited.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Since its amendment in 1965, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, however, entitles a prevailing party to prejudgment interest from the filing of the complaint to the entry of a judgment in any civil action. Moreover, the various provisions of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 are clearly designed to encourage settlement and to compensate the prevailing party for the value of money wrongfully obtained. See, generally, <em>Rittenhouse v Erhart, </em>424 Mich 166, 190-193; 380 NW2d 440 (1985) (discussion of how MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, in its present form, as of the 1980 amendments, clearly seeks to further both goals).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Both MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 and MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 were enacted by the same Legislature. Given the manner of their enactment and the similar functions that the two statutes have performed for more than a century, the amendment of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 in 1965 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>highly problematic. The extension of that interest statute to prejudgment interest awards causes two formerly compatible statutes to be in irreconcilable conflict. Only by concluding that the \u00a76013 interest provision has repealed MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 by necessary implication, insofar as civil actions are concerned, can any sense be made of the two interest statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">While repeals by implication are not favored, it is a question of legislative intent whether or not there has been such a repeal of an earlier statute by a subsequently enacted one. See <em>Attorney General ex rel Owen v Joyce, </em>233 Mich 619, 621; 207 NW 863 (1926); <em>Yarger v City of Hastings, </em>375 Mich 413, 417; 134 NW2d 726 (1965). The latest legislative expression on the entitlement to prejudgment interest must control where two interest statutes specifically address the issue of entitlement and cannot be harmonized.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Plaintiff maintains that the enactment of 1965 PA 240 repealed MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 to the extent that it might apply to the award of arbitration under the unique circumstances in which arbitration was agreed to in this case. The 1965 amendment clearly broadened the entitlement to prejudgment interest under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The defendant argues that the two interest statutes do not overlap, but this position is untenable given the plain language of the two statutes. First, the argument assumes that MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 provides the exclusive entitlement to interest <em>even after a court enters a money judgment con\u00f1rming an arbitration award. </em>Yet, this cannot be reconciled with the language of MCL 600.6013; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>27A.6013 which requires that interest be awarded from the date of the filing of the complaint. Moreover, MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 by its own terms, does not extend as far as the defendant contends; in fact, it authorizes the award of interest \"only 'until judgment shall be . . . rendered\u2019 upon the verdict, arbitration award, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The overlapping coverage of the two statutes creates a conflict regarding the entitlement to prejudgment interest that appears to be irreconcilable. The only way to harmoniously apply the two interest provisions would be to apply them both at the same time. Yet, such simultaneous application would yield a double recovery for the prevailing party from the date of the arbitration award to the date of judgment. This is surely inconsistent with any rational view of legislative intent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Since there appears to be no way to justify application of only one of the statutes over the other,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we find that MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 and MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 are in conflict, as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The defendant contends that the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to prejudgment interest is governed exclusively by MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4. This argument ignores the express terms of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 which applies to a money judgment recovered in a civil action. Perhaps, defendant concludes that only MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>here by reading that statute too narrowly. MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 applies to arbitration awards, as well as to awards entered by verdict, report of referees, assessment made by the clerk of the court, or otherwise. Following the logic of defendant\u2019s argument would result in awarding prejudgment interest on a jury verdict under MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, exclusively, even though it precludes a judgment of money damages in a \"civil action.\u201d But this result would make MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 inoperative where it plainly applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Thus, we are constrained by the rules of statutory construction to award prejudgment interest in the instant dispute on the basis of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 by resorting to rules of statutory interpretation. Normally, two statutes which share a common purpose or object are to be interpreted in pari materia. This is the appropriate rule to apply where two statutes are enacted by the same assembly with a common purpose. The rule requires that the two statutes be strictly construed so as to avoid interpreting one in a manner that defeats the main purpose of another on the same subject. <em>Detroit v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>374 Mich 543, 558, 561; 132 NW2d 660 (1965), cert den 382 US 107 (1965); <em>Richardson v Jackson Co, </em>432 Mich 377, 384; 443 NW2d 105 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">But where the two statutes cannot be reconciled, this rule of statutory construction does not apply. Specifically, the rule of in pari materia does not control here since it would likely result in upholding the policy embodied in MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, the earlier statute, in a manner tending to contradict the plain language of the subsequent statute (i.e., MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013). See <em>People ex rel Pellow v Byrne, </em>272 Mich 284, 288; 261 NW 326 (1935), quoting <em>Voorhies </em>v <em>Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>220 Mich 155, 157-158; 189 NW 1006 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Any judicial attempt to read a restriction into MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013, however, is foreclosed. This Court cannot refuse to award prejudgment interest in a \"civil action\u201d (from the date of the filing of the complaint) in contravention of the plain language of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. Were we to hold that MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 applies and that plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment interest from the date of the complaint, it would violate the rule of <em>Voorhies, </em>since the force of the two statutes could not thereby be preserved. See, generally, <em>Rathbun v Michigan, </em>284 Mich 521, 544-545; 280 NW 35 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Our conclusion that MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 applies is supported by the rule that the Revised Judicature Act authorization for prejudgment interest is remedial in nature and so must be liberally construed. <em>Denham, supra </em>at 528-529, citing MCL 600.102; MSA 27A.102.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Given the broad statutory definition of a \"civil action\u201d in Michigan, and given the parties stipulation to arbitrate made in the context of a properly filed lawsuit, we conclude that the judgment in favor of plaintiff was made pursuant to a \"civil action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">This Court has defined the term \"civil action\u201d broadly enough so that this suit satisfies the requirements of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award was preceded by a complaint and ended in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>money judgment. Furthermore, this is not a case where the money judgment rendered was not made by a \"court\u201d or lacked the procedural attributes of a civil action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Rather, a trial court entered the judgment in dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We distinguish this case from those actions which are brought for the sole purpose of obtaining a judgment confirming the award. In asking the court to apply MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, the defendant relies upon cases interpreting the two interest statutes that are inapplicable to the instant suit. See <em>Morgan v Kamil, </em>144 Mich App 171; 375 NW2d 378 (1985), lv den 422 Mich 970 (1985); <em>Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co v Garden City, </em>151 Mich App 83; 390 NW2d 687 (1986). The salient fact in this case is that the parties chose to arbitrate only after the filing of the complaint. By contrast, in <em>Morgan, supra, </em>the parties had agreed to arbitrate prior to the filing of the complaint; moreover, the circuit court dismissed the case after entering an order compelling arbitration.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co, supra, </em>involved a preexisting arbitration agreement also.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In these two cases, as well as in <em>Osinski v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>DAIIE, </em>69 Mich App 426; 245 NW2d 76 (1976), the Courts held that MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 specifies the entitlement to interest on judgments entered merely to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. Also, the arbitration proceedings in those cases were held prior to the bringing of the circuit court action. Thus, by applying MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4, in those cases, the Court of Appeals reached correct results.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 does not apply to money judgments which are ordered as the result of contractually agreed upon means of dispute resolution which a court lacks the power to alter. This rationale justifies the failure to apply MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 to the prejudgment phase of the litigation. But, even in the above cases, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 might have authorjzed prejudgment interest if the party required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pay it had successfully moved to vacate the award on the ground (1) that there was no enforceable agreement to arbitrate, or (2) that the arbitrator\u2019s decision must be set aside. See <em>DAIIE v Gavin, </em>416 Mich 407, 440-441; 331 NW2d 418 (1982). In <em>Morgan, supra </em>at 173, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 may have governed the award of prejudgment interest if the Court had not dismissed the complaint. In all the above cases, MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 governs the award of postjudgment interest, according to its plain language.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Defendant argues that \"this case is not a civil action because an agreement to arbitrate, whether reached before or after the filing of a complaint, precludes a circuit court\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction while the arbitration is pending.\u201d The defendant relies incorrectly on the <em>Morgan </em>decision to support the view that the trial Court in this case lost subject matter jurisdiction over this lawsuit when the parties entered into their agreement to arbitrate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">When the instant complaint was filed, the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to decide the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tract claim presented to it. By stating in their stipulation that the court would \"retain[ ] jurisdiction\u201d over the dispute, the parties clearly consented to allow the court to enter the judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award. Given this stipulation, the court properly retained jurisdiction and entered a judgment conforming to the decision of the arbitrator.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The text and history of MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 and MCL 438.7; MSA 19.4 simply do not support the conclusion that a party who prevails in an arbitration proceeding is less entitled to prejudgment interest when the award is made in the context of a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The policy of encouraging arbitration is in no way frustrated by the award of a higher rate of interest at an earlier point in the litigation under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013. The parties have some flexibility in specifying the appropriate rate of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">By drafting agreements that require the arbitration of any disputes as a condition precedent to bringing a court action, parties prevent an entitlement to prejudgment interest under MCL 600.6013; MSA 27A.6013 from ever arising prior to the filing of an action to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. Thus, the result of this case will neither encourage nor discourage parties, who intend to prevent litigation, from engaging in arbitration.

If the parties have agreed that an arbitrator shall decide questions of contract interpretation, the merits of the dispute are for the arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Where a court finds itself weighing the pros and cons of each party\u2019s interpretation of substantive provisions of the contract, it is likely that the court has gone astray. The question for the court is not whether one interpretation or another is correct, but whether the parties have agreed that an arbitrator shall decide which of the competing interpretations is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Similarly, see <em>St Clair Prosecutor v AFSCME, </em>425 Mich 204; 388 NW2d 231 (1986); <em>Port Huron Area School Dist v Port Huron Ed Ass\u2019n, </em>426 Mich 143; 393 NW2d 811 (1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">Arbitration is a matter of contract. In contracting for arbitration, parties generally agree to substitute an arbitrator for a judge and jury as factfinder and decision maker on all questions, factual and legal. Whether questions of law are \"primarily or even ordinarily within the province of arbitration\u201d is a question of contract and not of law. It is well within the province of parties to a commercial arbitration to allow the arbitrator to decide questions of law as well as of fact, and agreements to arbitrate have generally been construed as contracts for deciding questions of law as well as of fact. <em>[DAIIE v Gavin, </em>416 Mich 407, 446-447; 331 NW2d 418 (1982) (Levin, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> To the extent that the reasoning in <em>Waldrop v Rodery, </em>34 Mich App 1; 190 NW2d 691 (1971), is inconsistent with the reasoning in this opinion, I would no longer follow <em>Waldrop.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> See <em>Tobacco Workers Int\u2019l Union, Local 317 v Lorillard Corp, </em>448 F2d 949, 956 (CA 4, 1971), where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared in a union\u2019s action against an employer for specific performance of a collective bargaining clause providing for arbitration of employee grievances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">While a contract may contain provisions detailing what remedies should be applied to compensate for a particular breach, labor contracts, like other contracts, commonly do not. Part of what the parties bargain for when they include an arbitration provision in a labor agreement is the \"informed judgment\u201d that the arbitrator can bring to bear on a grievance, especially as to the formulation of remedies. . . . Therefore, we conclude that, although the agreement is silent as to remedies, the fashioning of an appropriate remedy is not an addition to the obligations imposed by the contract. In deciding that the agreement did not provide for retroactive pay in promotion cases, the District Court usurped the function of the arbitrator.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b464-6\">Griffin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9W\">I concur in the result.
