We granted leave in this declaratory judgment case to decide whether the State of Michigan, Department of Social Services, may constitutionally require the Emmanuel Baptist Bible Church and its preschool<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to obtain a license and comply with certain administrative rules in order to operate their preschool and daycare programs. Defendant objects to the license requirement and to certain administrative rules promulgated pursuant to the childcare organization act, 1973 PA 116,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that the statute and rules violate its constitutional rights to religious freedom contained in the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The particular rules objected to are Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>400.5104,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which sets educational qualifications for program directors; Rule 400.5106,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which requires day-care centers to provide a program for emotional development of children \"including [a] positive self-concept;\u201d and Rule 400.5107,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which prohibits corporal punishment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant also objects to \u00a7\u00a7 2(3)(c) and 5(1) of the act, MCL 722.112(3)(c); MSA 25.358(12)(3)(c), and MCL 722.115(1); MSA 25.358(15)(1), to the extent that the provisions give the dss authority to inspect the financial records of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">From September 15, 1974, to June 1, 1979, the church\u2019s preschool was licensed by the dss to operate as a \"childcare center\u201d under 1973 PA 116 to care for twenty children from two and one-half through six years of age. During those years the format of the church\u2019s preschool and day-care programs varied somewhat. Initially, the preschool program was operated on a half-day, morning basis. By the time of application for the second renewal of a license in 1975, the defendant operated a full-day program, presumably as a day-care center, along with the preschool half-day program. In 1978, twenty to forty children were in the preschool and about ten children remained in the afternoon for day care.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">On May 18, 1978, the defendant was issued a two-year license by the dss. However, on May 3, 1979, the principal of the Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, Mr. Mark Asir\u00e9, informed representatives of the dss that the defendant no longer wanted its preschool and day-care center to be licensed. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>assertion was subsequently confirmed by the church\u2019s pastor, Rev. Harold E. Asir\u00e9. On November 8, 1979, the dss \"closed\u201d the license of the preschool to operate as a childcare center, effective June 1, 1979. However, the church continued thereafter to conduct its preschool/day-care programs until the time of trial in December, 1982. From 1980 to 1982, twelve to twenty-eight children were in defendant\u2019s preschool or day-care programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">The dss filed the instant action against defendant on April 29, 1980, seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant is subject to the requirements of the childcare organization act, 1973 PA 116, and. seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining defendant from operating or maintaining a childcare center without a license from the dss. Defendant raised as affirmative defenses that the Legislature had improperly delegated licensing authority to the dss, that the act was unconstitutional under the First Amendment as applied to defendant, and that the administrative rules enumerated above infringed upon its First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Following a bench trial, the trial court issued a written opinion on January 19, 1984. The court specifically found that defendant\u2019s preschool and day-care programs constituted \"religiously grounded\u201d activity. Nevertheless, it held that defendant was required to obtain a license to operate its preschool/day-care programs on the ground that the state had a compelling interest in protecting children in childcare centers which outweighed defendant\u2019s interest in being free from such state regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The trial court also decided, however, that the administrative rules relating to director qualifications, program content, and corporal punishment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>as well as the statutory provisions relating to inspection of financial records, should not be applied to this defendant. The court held that the state \"should develop and employ less intrusive means of regulating a church-operated day-care center .... In all other respects Defendant Church should be required to obtain a license from [the] dss and to comply with reasonable regulations of fire, safety and health requirements of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On appeal in the Court of Appeals, the dss challenged that portion of the trial court\u2019s order which held that defendant was exempt from particular rules and statutory provisions. Defendant filed a cross-appeal challenging the underlying licensing requirement of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In its opinion, the Court of Appeals agreed with the circuit court that the defendant\u2019s \"claim is undoubtedly rooted in [its] fundamentalist Christian doctrine. Moreover, regulation poses some burden on the free exercise of religion . . . .\u201d 150 Mich App 254, 264; 388 NW2d 326 (1986). However, the Court of Appeals found that the state\u2019s interest in protecting children outweighed the burden imposed on the defendant\u2019s First Amendment rights. The Court of Appeals thus affirmed' the trial court\u2019s requirement of licensure but reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling on exemptions. We then granted leave to appeal. 428 Mich 909 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A unanimous Court holds that the regulation prohibiting corporal punishment is justified by a compelling state interest and may be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">A majority of the justices is of the opinion that</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">(1) The First and Fourteenth Amendments do not prevent the state from compelling the defendant to conform to the licensure requirements of the childcare organization act.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">(2) The state may not enforce the accreditation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>aspects of the program director qualification rule, 1980 AACS, R 400.5104(2)(a), since to do so would violate the free exercise of religious beliefs of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">(3) The state may not enforce the program content rule, 1980 AACS, R 400.5106(l)(c), since the rule is unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Court does not decide whether the financial disclosure provisions violate the defendants\u2019 rights of the free exercise of religion and freedom of association, since the state has not exercised its statutory authority to compel financial disclosure, making these issues unripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">At least four justices concur in every holding statement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b583-7\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, Archer, and Griffin, concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> For convenience, the entities are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the \"defendant\u201d or the \"church.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> As amended by 1978 PA 438; 1980 PA 32, 232, 510; 1981 PA 126; 1984 PA 139.

I conclude (1) that the state may require defendant preschool to obtain a license pursuant to the terms of the childcare organization act; (2) that the Michigan Department of Social Services either must exempt defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the program director qualifications rule (1980 AACS, R 400.5104) insofar as it requires that the director obtain minimal educational training only from a state accredited college or university or must undertake an independent evaluation of the credentials of defendants\u2019 program director to determine whether his qualifications satisfy the minimal educational criteria set forth in Rule 104; (3) that the program content rule (1980 AACS, R 400.5106) is unconstitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>vague on its face and may not be enforced against the defendants; (4) that in order to protect the defendants\u2019 (mefnbers\u2019) rights of association under the First Amendment, the dss, in applying the provisions of the act which give authority to the dss to inspect defendants\u2019 financial records, may not request information from the defendants that reveals the source or identity of the defendants\u2019 financial support; and (5) that the administrative rule (1980 AACS, R 400.5107) prohibiting corporal punishment is justified by a compelling state interest and therefore enforceable against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">1 write separately to join Justice Griffin\u2019s \"com curring\u201d opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to form a majority on the issue of the Free Exercise Clause standard of review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the issue whether the defendants\u2019 claims regarding the licensing rules are ripe for review, and the issue whether the licensing rules are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I also write separately to join the dissenting opinion (Boyle, J.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to form a separate majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>on the issue whether the license requirement is constitutional as applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW TO BE APPLIED TO FREE EXERCISE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">A. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The religion clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> encompass two distinct but interrelated concepts \u2014 the guarantee of free exercise of religion by all persons, and the prohibition of the establishment of religion by government. I am primarily concerned here with the free exercise facet of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In <em>Sheridan Road Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462; 396 NW2d 373 (1986), cert den 481 US 1050; 107 S Ct 2183; 95 L Ed 2d 839 (1987), this Court divided equally and affirmed a holding by the Court of Appeals that a statute requiring nonpublic school teachers to be certified by the state is constitutional. The three opinions in <em>Sheridan Road </em>recognized the four basic elements of the Free Exercise Clause standard of review described by Justice Williams, 426 Mich 475, though each opinion applied that standard differently. I write separately, in part, to discuss the proper application of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">B. ELEMENTS OF THE STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The first inquiry is whether the free exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>claim is \"rooted in religious belief,\u201d <em>Wisconsin v </em>Yoder, 406 US 205, 215; 92 S Ct 1526; 32 L Ed 2d 15 (1972). A religious belief must be based on more than purely secular or philosophically based personal concerns to be protected by the First Amendment, <em>id. </em>at 215-216. Religiously motivated conduct need not stem from adherence to the tenets of a particular religious organization, however, to enjoy the protection of the Free Exercise Clause, <em>Frazee v Illinois Dep\u2019t of Employment Security, </em>489 US 829, \u2014; 109 S Ct 1514; 103 L Ed 2d 914, 920 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">While a court may inquire into whether a religious belief is genuine or sincere, it should not decide the \"truth\u201d or \"reasonableness\u201d of the belief. <em>United States v Ballard, </em>322 US 78; 64 S Ct 882; 88 L Ed 1148 (1944). As explained by the Court in <em>Thomas v Review Bd Ind Employment Security Div, </em>450 US 707, 714; 101 S Ct 1425; 67 L Ed 2d 624 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">The determination of what is a \"religious\u201d belief or practice is more often than not a difficult and delicate task .... However, the resolution of that question is not to turn upon a judicial perception of the particular belief or practice in question; religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">In sum, the Court must accept an organization\u2019s good-faith characterization that its activity is grounded in religious belief because \"[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants\u2019 interpretations of those creeds.\u201d <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>490 US \u2014; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766, 786 (1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Assuming the sincerity of a claimant\u2019s religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>beliefs, the party asserting a free exercise claim must show that a particular regulation burdens its practice of religion. <em>Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Foundation v Secretary of Labor, </em>471 US 290, 303; 105 S Ct 1953; 85 L Ed 2d 278 (1985); <em>United States v Lee, </em>455 US 252, 256-257; 102 S Ct 1051; 71 L Ed 2d 127 (1982). The question is whether the \"affected individuals [would] be coerced by the Government\u2019s action into violating their religious beliefs ... [or whether] governmental action [would] penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.\u201d <em>Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass'n </em>485 US 439, 449; 108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">A substantial burden was shown in <em>Yoder </em>because the school attendance law pressured the claimant with severe penalties to forego activity mandated by the claimant\u2019s religious beliefs. There is an equally significant constitutional burden on religious belief if the law compels conduct that is contrary to religious faith, see, e.g., <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398, 404, 406; 83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965 (1963); <em>Lyng, supra </em>at 448-449.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">A claimed burden on religious beliefs may be deemed constitutionally insignificant, but only (1) if the claimant\u2019s beliefs do not create an irreconcilable conflict between the mandates of law and religious duty, or (2) if the legal requirement does not directly coerce the claimant to act contrary to religious belief, <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v California Bd of Equalization, </em>493 US_; 110 S Ct 688; 107 L Ed 2d 796 (1990);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Internal Revenue, </em>supra; <em>Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Foundation, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">In <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, supra, </em>there was no evidence that the collection and payment of the sales tax violated the appellant\u2019s sincere religious beliefs. In <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, supra, </em>104 L Ed 2d 786, the claimant\u2019s religious beliefs, unlike those in this case, did not forbid entirely compliance with the law (i.e., receiving or paying taxes for the religious sessions). The Court found that the denial of a tax deduction to the Church of Scientology for expenses incurred in conducting \"auditing or training sessions\u201d did not impose a substantial burden on the claimant\u2019s faith.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Foundation, supra, </em>there was no necessary conflict between law and religious duty, making it unnecessary to order a Free Exercise Clause exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In all these cases, the Court evaluated the claimants\u2019 assessment of the religious nature of the conflict between law and religious faith, rather than imposing an objective evaluation of the degree of burden on the claimant. For example, in <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>104 L Ed 2d 786-787, rather than substituting its own objective analysis of the degree of burden imposed on the activity (i.e., to avoid strict scrutiny of the regulation), the Court accepted the claimant\u2019s characterization of the degree of burden and applied strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Once it is established that a substantial burden has been imposed by a civil authority on the practice of a sincerely held religious belief, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>state must prove a compelling interest that justifies both (1) any direct burdens on religiously motivated conduct, and (2) the imposition upon individuals of a \"hard choice\u201d between religious belief and conformity to a legal obligation because of their religious beliefs. See <em>Hobbie v Unemployment Appeals Comm of </em>Florida, 480 US 136, 141-142; 107 S Ct 1046; 94 L Ed 2d 190 (1987).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">C. APPLYING THE STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">No balancing of interests is required if accommodation of that burden would not unduly impair or materially detract from the furtherance of compelling state interests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is the state\u2019s burden to prove that there are no alternative, less drastic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>means to accommodate the free exercise claim. See <em>Sheridan Road, supra </em>at 540-544 (Riley, J.); see also <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 215 (only state interests \"of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Of course, it is true that \"[not] all burdens on religion are unconstitutional,\u201d <em>United States v Lee, supra </em>at 257. But this conclusion must be reached after applying strict scrutiny. The United States Supreme Court has consistently applied strict scrutiny where a law compelled conduct in violation of a sincerely held religious belief, see <em>Sherbert v Verner </em>and <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In fact, in <em>Lee, </em>the Court specifically rejected the use of an \"objective burdens\u201d analysis as a threshold requirement preliminary to applying strict scrutiny balancing analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In a more recent case, <em>Bowen v Roy, </em>476 US 693; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986), a majority of the Court determined that strict scrutiny balancing analysis must be applied to decide the constitutionality of requiring an applicant for welfare benefits to submit a number in order to receive benefits if that act violates the applicant\u2019s sincerely held religious belief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <em>Bowen </em>Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ordered that, on remand, the claimant, Stephen Roy, must be exempted from the duty to supply the number (assuming the dispute remained justiciable).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The burden that the licensing law imposes on defendants in this case is analogous to the burden imposed on claimant Stephen Roy, at least as to the second issue addressed in <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 727 (O\u2019Connor, J.) (partial concurrence).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Even more recently, in <em>Lyng, supra, </em>the Court made it clear that it is not applying a new version of strict scrutiny, and has not adopted a threshold burden requirement for all Free Exercise Clause cases. In <em>Lyng, supra </em>at 457-458, the Court applied a threshold burden analysis to determine the degree to which a law burdened the claimant\u2019s religious practices. <em>Lyng </em>involved no direct legal coercion which forced the claimant to act in a manner contrary to a religious belief.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court sought to foreclose a broad reading of its <em>Lyng </em>decision by including the proviso that the case would be decided differently if the destruction of sacred lands had directly coerced the claimants to act contrary to their religious beliefs, <em>id. </em>at 453.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Because <em>Lyng </em>was limited by the language of the decision to its facts, it is readily distinguishable from this case. The claimants in <em>Lyng </em>sought access to sacred Indian sites on lands that they did not own or have any legal right to use. By contrast, the defendants here are affirmatively compelled to submit to a license requirement that directly infringes upon religiously motivated activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Since strict scrutiny has consistently been applied in cases where the challenged statute or regulation directly coerces the defendant to violate religious beliefs \"under pain of criminal penalty,\u201d see <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 706, n 16 (Burger plurality), <em>Yoder, supra </em>at 207-209, 223, and <em>Lyng, supra </em>(O\u2019Connor, J.), it must be applied here as well. But, it must be applied properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The dissent applies a version of strict scrutiny\u2014 the \"substantial state interest test\u201d \u2014 that is not consistent with established law, see <em>post, </em>pp 455, n 4, 456, n 5, and 466-467 (Boyle, J.). This standard departs from established precedent in at least two respects. First, it improperly places the burden of proof on the free exercise claimant in establishing the existence of less restrictive alternatives. Second, it does <em>not </em>place the burden on the state of showing that there are no less restrictive alternatives that can accommodate the claimant\u2019s burden.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Yoder </em>remains good law, and must be applied here in the manner as described in <em>Sheridan Road, supra </em>at 574-578 (Riley, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>D. OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF BURDENS</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The dissent takes the position that strict scrutiny need not be applied to the licensing requirement because the burdens imposed on defendants\u2019 religious beliefs are not constitutionally significant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Yet, the dissent offers no clear standard or methodology by which this Court can, on this record, reject the defendant\u2019s sincerely held religious belief that the licensure requirement compels it to violate a religious duty.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">While the dissent relies upon <em>Lyng, supra, </em>to avoid the demands of strict scrutiny, <em>post, </em>p 456 (Boyle, J.), the case cannot be extended to the type of burden that licensing imposes on the defendants\u2019 religious beliefs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The <em>Lyng </em>majority expressly declined to disturb prior cases which applied strict scrutiny on facts much more similar to the facts present here.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">To substitute an objective judicial determination of the degree of burden imposed by the licensure requirement for the religious beliefs articulated by the claimants, as the dissent has done, would inject this Court into the realm of theologians. Such an \"objective burdens\u201d analysis, if adopted, would eventually create a body of law giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>greater weight to some burdens than to others. Under this approach to the Free Exercise Clause, there is a distinct danger that the protection of religious freedom will be limited to those religious groups whose identity or convictions are familiar to and accepted by the members of the court deciding a free exercise claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II. GENERAL LICENSURE REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The defendants-appellants claim that the state impermissibly burdens the free exercise of their religious belief by requiring a license before the church may engage in its childcare ministry. Since we hold that the First Amendment requires that defendant be protected from the coercive burdens that licensure imposes, we must determine if the license requirement can survive the exacting demands of strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">a. defendants\u2019 interest</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">According to defendants\u2019 religious beliefs, it is sinful to submit to a license in order to practice their day-care ministry. Being forced to accept the submission that licensure connotes, the defendants\u2019 doctrinal autonomy is offended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">It is the function of a license that causes the religious objection. . . . Submitting to licensing is seen as submitting a religious ministry commanded by God to the authority of the state to decide whether or not the activity may be conducted. The state\u2019s own expert witness on licensing explained the philosophy of licensing as \"the administrative lifting of a legislative prohibition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">I assume, as did the trial court, that defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>religious objection to submitting to a licensing statute is sincere. See <em>post, </em>pp 432-433 (Griffin, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Turning to the question whether the licensing requirement burdens the exercise of defendants\u2019 religious belief, I conclude that the burden is coercive in the required sense so as to trigger strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendants may go to jail if they follow their religious beliefs instead of submitting to the licensure requirement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">There is ample support in the record for the conclusion that it is, the defendants\u2019 belief that licensure of their day-care ministry would be a sin contrary to church doctrine. The defendants object to licensing because they think submission to a license amounts to what the Bible defines for them as a form of \"Moloch worship.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2Q\">The defendant church offers a scriptural basis for its more general objection to licensure, and, of course, \"[c]ourts are not arbiters of scriptural in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>terpretation.\u201d <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 716.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Dr. Rushdoony testified that the operation of a day-care ministry has become central to the exercise of the defendants\u2019 religion. According to his testimony, the day-care center, as an \"instrument of evangelization,\u201d has also become essential to the very survival of the church as a growing religious community.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The testimony taken during trial reveals why defendants believe licensing of their day-care center to be a violation of a religious duty.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The operation of the day-care center is an act of religious worship for the church. The day-care center functions both as a forum for religious instruction and as a forum for evangelization (i.e., by bringing new membership into the church). The defendants view licensing of their day-care center as intrusive upon their evangelical and worship ministry. Their faith dictates that they may not submit that ministry to a licensing agent of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The defendants are offended by the legal mandate to obtain a license for their day-care center, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>but are not offended by a license for driving a motor vehicle or a license to insure the safety of their buildings. The defendants do not object to safety regulations because the licensing of their secular activities does not infringe upon the practice of religion. The defendants have drawn religious distinctions between different kinds of licenses because they view the activity which the license regulates very differently. \"[I]n every sense, [licensure], affirmatively compel[s] [the defendant church], by threat of sanctions, to refrain from religiously motivated conduct or to engage in conduct that [it] find[s] objectionable for religious reasons,\u201d <em>Sheridan Road, supra </em>at 553-554, and n 48 (Riley, J.) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The record does not support the dissent\u2019s characterization of defendants\u2019 religious beliefs and of how those beliefs are burdened.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This characterization ignores the religious meaning to defendants of submitting the operation of a day-care ministry to a state licensing authority and thereby exceeds the restraints on our interpretative role suggested by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>104 L Ed 2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">To summarize, the burden imposed by licensure of the day-care center must be analyzed under strict scrutiny because (1) the day-care ministry cannot be operated without a license, and (2) the state is unwilling to adopt an alternative form of regulation to accommodate the defendants\u2019 religious concerns. Given the nature of the defendants\u2019 sincerely held religious objection to licen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>sure, it is clear as a matter of \" 'constitutional fact,\u2019 \u201d <em>post, </em>p 463 (Boyle, J.), that the burden imposed by licensure is both direct and coercive so that strict scrutiny must be applied to analyze the constitutionality of the state\u2019s restriction on defendants\u2019 religious practices, see <em>Hobbie, Sherbert, </em>and <em>Thomas, supra, </em>and <em>Bowen, supra </em>at 727 (O\u2019Connor, J.) (partial concurrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">B. THE STATE\u2019S INTEREST</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">I conclude that the state has met its burden of showing a compelling state interest. Moreover, the state has met its burden of showing the existence of its interest in licensing, which is \" 'of the highest order,\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 718; <em>Sherbert v Verner, supra </em>at 405 (defining what constitutes a \"compelling state interest\u201d). A compelling state interest attends the imposition of some type of license or registration requirement on child daycare centers. At oral argument, even defendant agreed that a license or registration certificate is necessary to make sure that no childcare institution falls below a certain level of performance with respect to the obvious criteria of health and safety. In order to vindicate its interest in prohibiting unsafe or unhealthy conditions in day-care centers,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the state must assert its authority over those centers before they can be allowed to operate. The state cannot determine if minimum standards are met unless it has a regulatory mechanism that allows it to inspect those aspects of the management of any childcare facility which might pose reasonably foreseeable harm to children. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>failure of even one day-care center to submit to prior on-site or random inspections creates a possibility of serious harm to children unable to protect themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">C. NO LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I also find that the state has carried its burden of showing that the license requirement is the least restrictive alternative capable of accomplishing the state\u2019s legitimate objective. The state produced adequate evidence proving that licensing, compared to registration, is a superior method of achieving compliance with fire, health, and safety rules;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> indeed, licensing is essential to the achievement of compelling state interests in all child daycare centers.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The concurrence concludes that \"a different scheme of regulation,\u201d such as the registration of unapproved government-run day-care centers, could be employed as an alternative to licensing, <em>post, </em>p 442 (Griffin, J.). While registration may be a \" 'less obtrusive form of regulation\u2019 than licensing, <em>Sherbert, supra, </em>374 US 407,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 442 (Griffin, J.), it does not accomplish the state\u2019s compelling interests. The specific registration program that the defendant church proposed as a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>restrictive alternative cannot accomplish the state\u2019s compelling interests adequately since it makes no explicit provision for either <em>prior </em>on-site inspection or random spot inspections by dss personnel.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, registration is not an adequate substitute for licensing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The dissent concludes that the defendant\u2019s claim of burden regarding some forms of registration but not others is \"difficult to understand,\u201d <em>post, </em>pp 465-466 (Boyle, J.). The incomprehensibility of a religious belief, however, is no reason to refuse to accord it the protection of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On this factual record, it is not possible to determine if registration as a form of regulation burdens defendant\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since registration would not achieve the state\u2019s compelling interests, it is unnecessary to address the degree to which registration burdens the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Therefore, I reject the defendants\u2019 claim that they are entitled to be exempt from the license requirement. The state\u2019s interest in licensing is compelling enough to justify the burdens on defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion that licensing and registration impose. Because the state has satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>its burden under strict scrutiny of proving with evidence that there are no alternative, less drastic means of regulation to accomplish the state\u2019s interest, the defendants\u2019 request for an exemption from the licensing requirement need not be granted.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">III. PROGRAM DIRECTOR QUALIFICATION RULE 104</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The defendants challenge the constitutional validity of the accreditation requirement in the program director qualifications rule.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The pertinent language of Rule 104(2) specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(a) A program director shall have completed a minimum of 60 semester hours of credit at an accredited college or university and shall have completed not less than 12 semester hours in child development, child psychology, or early childhood education. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">(b) A program director shall have been awarded the child development associate credential by the child development associate consortium and shall have completed not less than 12 semester hours in child development, child psychology, or early child<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>hood education at an accredited college or university.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">A. JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">1. <em>The Factual Record: </em>The record reflects that the defendants employed program directors from unaccredited institutions. The defendant church returned its license, in part, due to the \"accreditation problem,\u201d as well as to avoid the inherent conflict between licensure and the church\u2019s religious beliefs.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The record also reflects that the defendant indicated a willingness to violate the terms of Rule 104 after extensive consultations with the plaintiff regarding the accreditation aspects of the rule. The dss refused to provide a license to defendants, in part because they employed program directors who had received degrees from unaccredited schools (and who, as a result, were found not to be in compliance with 1979 AC, R 400.121[3]).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Finally, it is clear that the removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>of the accreditation limitation would eliminate the defendants\u2019 objection to Rule 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The state filed this declaratory judgment action in 1981 in response to defendants\u2019 decision to discontinue the license. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint and prior enforcement actions sought, inter alia, to enjoin the operation of the preschool until the defendants would supply documentation of the fact that their program directors complied with Rule 104 in conformity with its interpretation of the predecessor regulation, R 400.121(3). The result of granting the state\u2019s prayer for declaratory relief would be th\u00e1t the court could immediately order, pursuant to this litigation, that the defendants cease operation of their preschool until such time as they comply with Rule 104.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Therefore, the result of the plaintiff\u2019s filing of these proceedings is that defendants face a real and immediate threat of irreparable injury to the constitutional rights they alleged (in their answer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint) to be infringed by Rule 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">2. <em>Ripeness: </em>The defendants\u2019 claims are ripe for review. The violation of the defendants\u2019 allegedly constitutionally protected conduct is an \"injury in fact.\u201d This \"chilling\u201d injury is directly related to a legitimate fear of prosecution. Since the state has not disavowed its intent to enforce the regulations as written, a declaratory judgment on the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of defendants\u2019 claims regarding Rule 104 is appropriate in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">MCR 2.605(A)(1) provides that a Michigan court may grant declaratory relief \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . .\u201d An adjudication of the defendants\u2019 claims will serve to prevent defendants\u2019 actual injuries or losses before they have occurred.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">There is ample authority for the proposition that a real and immediate threat to protected constitutional rights can give rise to standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. The defendants need not first expose themselves to an actual prosecution under the challenged provision so long as their fear of prosecution is not imaginary or wholly speculative,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>and </em>so long as the state agency has not disavowed its intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>invoke the criminal penalty provisions in the statute.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Moreover, the factual record is too well developed to have any valid basis for conjecture as to the defendants\u2019 \"fear of prosecution\u201d arising from the possibility that the plaintiff will deny a license for their failure to comply with Rule 104. By maintaining this action, and by its prior enforcement actions, the plaintiff has provided a \"palpable basis\u201d for assuming that the license will be revoked.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The dissent contends that \"[tjhere is no evidence that if defendants decided to comply with the licensure requirement, that the state would deny them a license on the basis that the program director did not attend an accredited college or university.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 472 (Boyle, J.). This argument misses the mark for purposes of analyzing the ripeness issue. The opportunity for an adjudication of constitutional rights in a judicial forum, as authorized by state and federal declaratory judgment procedures, must remain available where there is \" 'a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ellis v Dyson, </em>421 US 426, 433; 95 S Ct 1691; 44 L Ed 2d 274 (1975).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The ripeness issue we have addressed is not based upon Article III considerations, but is prudential in nature. The fact that the statute or regulation being challenged has not yet been applied to anyone, or has not been enforced against the person challenging its constitutionality, is not a constitutional obstacle to reaching the merits of the claim.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> There are simply no ripeness concerns of constitutional magnitude that prevent us from deciding these claims.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Thus, a proper ripeness analysis must balance the need for further factual development, combined with any unc\u00e9rtainty as to whether defendants will actually suffer future injury, with the potential hardship of denying anticipatory relief.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The \"prudential rules\u201d of standing and ripeness that might preclude this Court from reaching the merits of defendants\u2019 claims need not be invoked here. First, the declaratory judgment procedure has allowed the issues to become sharpened so as to make them fit for judicial resolution, <em>Warth v Seldin, </em>422 US 490, 500-501; 95 S Ct 2197; 45 L Ed 2d 343 (1975). Second, the hardship that would result from not deciding the case is a severe one.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">3. <em>Exhaustion of Remedies: </em>The defendants are not barred from raising a constitutional challenge to Rule 104 in this judicial forum as the dissenting opinion implies, see <em>post, </em>p 470, n 28 (Boyle, J.). A party need not first adjudicate its constitutional claims before the administrative body which has jurisdiction over the matter if such effort would be useless in resolving the constitutional claim. See <em>Trojan v Taylor Twp, </em>352 Mich 636, 638-639; 91 NW2d 9 (1958).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The record demonstrates that the dss has developed a four-step test as an alternative to Rule 104:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">First, [t]he Department would look to a long list of accrediting agencies, including the American Association of Bible Colleges to see if any of those organizations recognized the college in question. Secondly, . . . the Department would . . . determine whether or not a Michigan state college . . . would recognize any of those credits on a transfer basis .... [TJhirdly, the Department would go to the state in question such as South Carolina where Bob Jones University is, and to see whether any colleges in South Carolina would accept those credits on a transfer basis. And, finally, if that didn\u2019t pan out there\u2019s the exemption provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Rule 118 which any licensee or applicant can apply for an exemption <em>as long as the goal of the rule is complied with. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This exemption procedure is inadequate for several reasons. The dss has not established the adequacy of this procedure because it produced no evidence to prove that the program directors employed by defendant could transfer all their credits to an accredited institution (i.e., so as to comply with the terms of Rule 104.)<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The dss also has not demonstrated that defendants\u2019 religious objection to Rule 104 could be accommodated by the 1980 AACS, R 400.5118 exemption. The Rule 118 exemption is inadequate because it is available only where the \"intent\u201d of Rule 104 is satisfied, an ambiguous and undefined criteria.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Finally, upon this record, I conclude that the dss never formalized the exemption procedure (Rule 118) in a manner that created an adequate alternative to Rule 104.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The practice of the dss in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>enforcing Rule 104 was to withhold an exemption to Rule 104 unless an \"accredited\u201d school was willing to accept transfer credits from an unaccredited college or university.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Given this agency practice, the likelihood that a successful agency settlement of defendants\u2019 free exercise claims, even if defendants had sought an exemption from Rule 104, is extremely remote. This Court may decide these claims, and there is a need for settled law to govern the agency\u2019s future regulation in this area.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">B. MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">For the reasons set forth by Justice Griffin, I believe that \"the record clearly establishes that the accreditation limitation [imposed by Rule 400.5104(2)(a) in selecting a program director] places a burden upon defendants\u2019 free exercise rights.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 444 (Griffin, J.). Strict scrutiny of Rule 104 is justified in this case because the regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>lation is a substantial infringement of defendants\u2019 religious beliefs, backed by the coercive threat of injunctive and criminal penalties that may be imposed for noncompliance with this condition for licensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Also, the enforcement of Rule 104 infringes upon a parental \"privacy\u201d right to be free of the kind of state regulation embodied in Rule 104. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, supra, </em>acknowledged the existence of the \"fundamental rights\u201d of parents \"to direct the intellectual and religious education of their children, and the rights of their children to receive that direction without unnecessary interference by the state.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>I agree that the constitutional right implicated in <em>Yoder </em>and <em>Pierce v Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925), is infringed upon here for the same reason that the <em>Yoder </em>Court determined that such a right was implicated by the Wisconsin compulsory school law.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Indeed, \"this parental interest is particularly compelling [when it is] combined with a free exercise claim.\u201d <em>Sheridan Road, supra </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The effect of Rule 104 is that the members of the defendant church, in their role as parents, cannot direct the education of their children. The dissent (Boyle, J.) never addresses the fact that Rule 104 will frustrate the defendants\u2019 ability to appoint a spiritual minister of their own choosing to oversee the church\u2019s biblically commanded evangelical function of which the church preschool is an integral part. Rule 104 is a direct interfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ence with the defendants\u2019 right to determine the nature of the moral values, religious beliefs, and educational preparation that their preschool age children shall receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Even assuming that the state has a compelling interest in imposing minimum educational standards upon preschool teachers, Rule 104 is not the least restrictive means of accomplishing this state interest. The dss has an entirely nonintrusive alternative available to it, namely, to determine the sufficiency of a program director\u2019s educational credentials by means other than the \"accreditation associations.\u201d In the absence of contrary evidence, we must assume that the state\u2019s interests can be otherwise served in this manner without unnecessary expense or undue cost to the state.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">I would hold that the program director accreditation rule, R 400.5104(2)(a), is unconstitutional as applied to defendants.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The dss either must grant defendants an exemption to Rule 104 or undertake an independent evaluation of the credentials of defendants\u2019 program director to determine whether his qualifications satisfy the minimum educational criteria set forth in Rule 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">IV. THE PROGRAM CONTENT RULE 106</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Rule 106 prohibits the operation of any child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>day-care center that does not provide \"opportunities for the developmental growth\u201d \u2014 including \"[the promotion of a] positive self-concept.\u201d We would hold that this rule is unconstitutional under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">While we do not address the defendants\u2019 claim that the program content rule violates their rights under the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the First Amendment,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> we would find the rule to be unconstitutionally vague under each of three variations of the vagueness doctrine. I disagree with the dissent (Boyle, J.) insofar as it concludes that Rule 106 is not unconstitutionally vague in all its applications.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The concurrence (Griffin, J.) would hold that the program content rule is unconstitutionally vague but does not analyze the rule explicitly in terms of the overbreadth doctrine.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>A. JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Defendants\u2019 challenge of Rule 106 is ripe for review since the claim was timely raised on the basis of an adequate factual record. The record indicates that the enforcement of Rule 106 has occasioned some efforts by dss officials to interfere with the teaching of religious doctrine to children by the defendant church. Moreover, because we address the vagueness of the rule on its face, the issue is ripe even though the program content rule was never actually applied to the defendant church.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">B. THE VAGUENESS DOCTRINE: INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The defendants\u2019 challenge of the facial validity of the program content rules can be decided on three analytically distinct \"vagueness\u201d grounds. There are three distinct strands of vagueness analysis that this Court recognized in <em>Woll v Attorney General, </em>409 Mich 500, 533; 297 NW2d 578 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">A statute may be challenged for vagueness on the grounds that it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">[1] is overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">[2] does not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, or ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">[3] is so indefinite that it confers unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>determine whether an offense has been committed.[<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We begin with the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">C. RULE 106 DOES NOT PROVIDE FAIR NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">If the term \"positive self-concept\u201d has no core meaning to be reasonably understood, or that can be commonly accepted as valid, the statute is vague on its face. See <em>Blackwelder v Safnauer, </em>689 F Supp 106, 126 (ND NY, 1988), a state law will be found to be unconstitutionally vague on its face only when its requirements are \" 'expressed in terms of such generality that \"no standard of conduct is specified at all.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Coates v Cincinnati, </em>402 US 611, 614; 91 S Ct 1686; 29 L Ed 2d 214 (1971). See also <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc, </em>455 US 489; 102 S Ct 1186; 71 L Ed 2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s experts testified that the term \"positive self-concept\u201d has no fixed definition. Dr. Ruopp stated that the term \"positive self-concept\u201d is incapable of any precise or objective definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">Positive self-concept I think is the \u2014 can be defined broadly enough so that it can be used by anybody of any particular persuasion to define what they are doing with the children. I don\u2019t think anybody will say that they want to give the children negative self-concept.[<footnotemark>65</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The testimony of another state expert on child development, Dr. Elliott, confirms Dr. Ruopp\u2019s view that the term \"positive self-concept\u201d can be defined in a potentially limitless number of ways. Dr. Elliott acknowledged that any definition of the term \"positive self-concept\u201d necessarily reflects the \"different philosophical bases\u201d of the opinions held by anyone venturing to define \"positive self-concept.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Thus, Rule 106 requires all child day-care centers to adopt curriculum and programs that promote a feeling in children which cannot be accurately defined. This rule is void on its face because persons \"of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . . .\u201d <em>Connally v General Construction Co, </em>269 US 385, 391; 46 S Ct 126; 70 L Ed 322 (1926). Moreover, the indeterminate nature of the rule is inherent in its operative language. Since the term \"positive self-concept\u201d suffers from the same species of vagueness that was also inherent in the term \"mental anguish\u201d (as defined by the Court of Appeals) in <em>People v Petrella, </em>424 Mich 221, 263; 380 NW2d 11 (1985), citing 124 Mich App 745, 763; 336 NW2d 761 (1983), more exact language must be employed.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> There is also no ordinary or generally understood meaning that can be derived from this term \u2014 though there was in <em>Pe</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>trella, supra </em>at 257\u2014and so, there is no alternative but to strike down the rule containing this language on the grounds of vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">D. OVERBREADTH OP PROQRAM CONTENT RULE 106</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">1 also find that Rule 106 is unconstitutionally \"overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms.\u201d <em>Woll, supra, </em>409 Mich 533. The over-breadth doctrine provides an independent, and wholly distinct, ground for deciding that Rule 106 is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Under <em>Broadrick v Oklahoma, </em>413 US 601, 615; 93 S Ct 2908; 37 L Ed 2d 830 (1973),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">[the overbreadth] must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Rule 106 may be struck down if it too severely \"chills\u201d a day-care operator\u2019s right to teach abstract ideas that do not pose any \"harm\u201d to children which the state may regulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Because the term \"positive self-concept\u201d does not \"communicate its reach in words of common understanding,\u201d <em>Boos v Barry, </em>485 US 312, 332; 108 S Ct 1157; 99 L Ed 2d 333 (1988), the rule will have a chilling effect on the rights of free expression enjoyed by defendant church members.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The rule fails to establish \"minimal guidelines\u201d to govern its enforcement and, thereby, permits the punishment of constitutionally protected free speech activities. See <em>Kolender v Lawson, </em>461 US 352, 358; 103 S Ct 1855; 75 L Ed 2d 903 (1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>(O\u2019Connor, J., majority). See, generally, Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d ed), \u00a7 12-32, p 1034, n 11. Because the curriculum content rule is clearly a content-bused restriction on speech Under the reasoning in <em>Boos, supra, </em>this Court must apply a very exacting degree of judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has struck down nearly every content-based restriction on speech, outside the realm of low-value speech, that it has considered in the past thirty years.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">I find that the state has not shown a compelling interest sufficient to justify infringing upon the potentially broad range of constitutionally protected speech that Rule 106 may be interpreted to prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">I decline to provide a saving construction of the program content rule by striking the term \"positive self-concept\u201d from the regulations to cure the dangers of overbreadth since there is no limiting construction that can be made to cure the constitutional defect. <em>Bd of Airport Comm\u2019rs of Los Angeles v Jews for Jesus, </em>482 US 569; 107 S Ct 2568; 96 L Ed 2d 500 (1987). Moreover, were we to attempt to cure the overbreadth problem by defining the limits of the permissible reach of state regulation of the curriculum of private day-care centers, we might risk delving illegitimately into the legislative domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">E. RULE 106 CONFERS UNSTRUCTURED AND UNLIMITED DISCRETION ON DSS OFFICIALS</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Finally, Rule 106 also delegates too much discretion to agency administrators to withdraw licensure from childcare centers because of problems in preschool curriculum content. Rule 106 fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>provide any minimal guidelines to notify child daycare center operators of the type of conduct that will run afoul of the rule and, therefore, subjects the exercise of free speech rights \"to an unascertainable standard.\u201d <em>Ellis v O\u2019Hara, </em>612 F Supp 379, 381 (ED Mo, 1985), citing <em>Coates v Cincinnati, supra </em>at 614. See also <em>Niemotko v Maryland, </em>340 US 268, 271; 71 S Ct 325; 95 L Ed 267 (1951) (reversing a disorderly conduct conviction of a Jehovah\u2019s Witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The broad discretion that Rule 106 confers on the dss, unconstrained by any clear standard, is accompanied by an implicit mandate to the agency to carefully scrutinize and evaluate the curriculum of day-care centers. Indeed, the rule would be unenforceable if the dss did not inject itself into the curriculum of child day-care centers to some degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Justice Brennan described the dangers of this type of unlimited discretion in <em>Lakewood v Plain Dealer Publishing Co, </em>486 US 750; 108 S Ct 2138; 100 L Ed 2d 771 (1988). The government may not regulate expressive activity pursuant to narrowly drawn content-neutral standards \"when the only standard provided is the unbridled discretion of a municipal official\u201d \u2014 even if some more limited delegation of regulatory authority would be permissible under the constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 764, n 9. Moreover, the licensing scheme at issue here \"pose[s] a real and substantial threat of the identified censorship risks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759. Thus, Rule 106 is unconstitutionally vague in a third sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">V. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The defendants have raised the further claim that the statutory provisions relating to the finances of child day-care center license applicants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>MCL 722.112; MSA 25.358(12), violate \"sensitive First Amendment rights.\u201d The evidence indicates that the defendants at one time were required by the dss to disclose financial information pursuant to these provisions. The requirement for license applicants to submit a financial statement was discontinued by a policy memorandum issued in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">A. JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The defendants\u2019 claims regarding the financial disclosure provisions were timely raised below and are justiciable now. Where a party voluntarily ceases an activity challenged as illegal, a court may continue to exercise jurisdiction over the controversy, so long as \" 'there is [any] reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v WT Grant Co, </em>345 US 629, 633; 73 S Ct 894; 97 L Ed 1303 (1953). This exception to the mootness doctrine has been applied to address a challenge to an administrative regulation even though the regulation was withdrawn during the pendency of litigation challenging its legality, <em>Los Angeles v Lyons, </em>461 US 95, 101; 103 S Ct 1660; 75 L Ed 2d 675 (1983), and to a city ordinance challenged on vagueness grounds that was also repealed during the litigation.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">I disagree with the dissent which argues that the defendants\u2019 claims are moot, see <em>post, </em>p 474 (Boyle, J.). The instant claim is not moot; rather, the issue presented here remains ripe because \" 'mere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case,\u2019 \u201d <em>Deakins v Monaghan, </em>484 US 193, 201, n 4; 108 S Ct 523; 98 L Ed 2d 529 (1988), and cases cited therein._</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>B. FREEDOM OF RELIGION CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The defendants\u2019 claims are unripe. I agree with the Court of Appeals that there is a lack of evidence in the record to show an actual infringement upon the free exercise of defendants\u2019 religion resulting from the enforcement of this statutory provision in 1974. If the dss undertakes a complete inspection of the financial records of churches who run childcare centers, there is some risk of an entanglement between church and state. I also recognize that there is some authority for the proposition that a statute allowing the state to gather financial information from a church may violate First Amendment religious freedoms absent any showing at all that the church has already suffered actual burdens. <em>Surinach v Pesquera de Busquets, </em>604 F2d 73, 75-77 (CA 1, 1979).<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I decline, however, to decide if the statutory financial disclosure provisions violate defendants\u2019 First Amendment freedoms of religion on this limited factual record. First of all, defendants have not offered evidence or even claimed that completing a single financial form when applying for a childcare center license burdens their ability to practice their religion freely. Second, the record does not show any significant \u201cregulatory entan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>glement\u201d that has resulted from the minimal financial disclosure which has taken place. See <em>Walz v Tax Comm of New York City, </em>397 US 664, 674; 90 S Ct 1409; 25 L Ed 2d 697 (1970). The unique circumstances justifying the opposite conclusion in <em>Surinach </em>and <em>NLRB v Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>440 US 490; 99 S Ct 1313; 59 L Ed 2d 533 (1979), are not present here.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">If the dss should rely on its statutory authority to require childcare organizations to prove they are financially stable<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> and compel extensive disclosure of financial information, such requirements may interfere too greatly with the defendants\u2019 freedom of religion and for that reason be unconstitutional <em>as applied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">C. FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I do not reach or decide defendants\u2019 freedom of association claims because it is impossible to discern the breadth of financial information that the dss will actually require to be disclosed. The defendants\u2019 claim, which relates to the mere existence of the statutory authority relating to financial disclosure, is unripe._</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The defendants claim that these statutory provisions compel financial disclosure in violation of the First Amendment by infringing upon associational freedoms. The First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the church members\u2019 \"freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,\u201d and disclosure of the identities of a group\u2019s members or contributors may have the practical effect of discouraging the exercise of these constitutionally protected rights. <em>NAACP v Alabama ex rel Patterson, </em>357 US 449, 460; 78 S Ct 1163; 2 L Ed 2d 1488 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The statutory provisions at issue give the dss the authority to compel disclosure of a broad range of information relating to the defendants\u2019 \"general financial ability.\u201d This information is intended to show the dss that operators have a capability of adequately funding their childcare center.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">If we were to decide the merits, this statute would be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Strict scrutiny would apply even in the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>a factual record of past harassment.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> If the dss at some future date compels a broad range of financial information, including the identity of donors to the defendant church, this could exert a \"chilling\u201d effect on the associational rights that the church may assert on behalf of its members. See <em>Shelton v </em>Tucker, 364 US 479; 81 S Ct 247; 5 L Ed 2d 231 (1960).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The control which dss exerts over the defendant church by periodic licensing of its childcare \"ministry\u201d is no less pervasive than the control the Arkansas School Board exercised over the public school teacher in <em>Shelton. </em>Also, like the disclosure requirement in <em>Shelton, </em>the childcare organization act \"does not provide that the information it requires be kept confidential.\u201d <em>Shelton, supra </em>at 486. Thus, if the members\u2019 contributions were required to be disclosed, the church might legitimately fear that the identity of its contributors \"might displease those who control [its] . . . destiny [i.e., dss officials],\u201d which \"would simply operate to widen and aggravate the impairment of constitutional liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-487. I leave this issue to be decided later upon an adequate record.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">VI. THE CORPORAL PUNISHMENT RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I agree with a unanimous Court that Rule 107 does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The rule clearly serves a compelling state interest in guaranteeing the health and safety of children at day-care facilities. No alternative regulation exists that would burden the defendants\u2019 religious belief to a lesser extent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> The defendants are Emmanuel Baptist Bible Church and its preschool.

I recognize that this opinion is in the \"dissent\u201d on certain issues; (1) whether defendants can be required to be licensed, (2) whether the Court should decide if the financial disclosure regulations infringe upon the free exercise of religion, and (3) whether the program content rule, R 4Q0.5104(2)(a), violates defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> I agree in principle with the concurrence about the proper application of the standard of review. We differ only on the result in this case, that is, whether, on this record, registration is an alternative, less drastic means of accomplishing the state\u2019s interests. Our disagreement on this issue is limited to whether the state has produced sufficient evidence to justify refusing to exempt the defendants from the license requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> While I agree with the concurrence that (1) the application of Rule 104 is unconstitutional, and (2) that the challenged portions of Rule 106 are unconstitutional, my reasoning differs in many respects from that of the concurrence. Also, I agree with the concurrence that the statutory financial disclosure requirements ppse a risk of \"chilling\u201d the defendant church\u2019s First Amendment rights, but I do not decide the merits of that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\"> All references to \"dissent\u201d and \"dissenting\u201d opinion are to the opinion of Justice Boyle.

First, inspections need to be made on a periodic and random basis both before a daycare center opens and throughout its operation. The registration program as implemented by dss for \"family day-care homes,\u201d does not require prior on-site inspections, requires no further routine inspection during the three-year period-of the registration certificate, and the dss can only randomly inspect ten percent of all registered daycare homes.

Ample evidence was introduced at trial to show that the Emmanuel Baptist Preschool program is part of the church\u2019s ministry, and that the program is pervasively religious and was established by the church to impart its religious doctrine to the children of its members and to others who might attend. Witnesses for defendants testified that the preschool was established in response to a Biblical command, that the concept of \"calling\u201d is basic to fundamentalist ministries, and that this ministry \u2014the preschool program \u2014 is \"mandated\u201d by the Lord. As the trial court found, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">The evidence establishes that the child care program operated by Defendant Church is an integral part of the total educational ministry of the church. Defendant Church belongs to the fundamentalist Christian movement which believes that the operation of a school, including a preschool, is an extension of the Christian home and of the church. All aspects of the preschool program are permeated with religious doctrine. The children are taught to understand the philosophy of the scriptures about obedience to parents and those in authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">It is determined that Defendant Church\u2019s activity in operating the day care center is religiously grounded and, as such, it is protected by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Concluding that the trial court was justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>finding that the church\u2019s preschool/day-care program is rooted in its fundamentalist Baptist doctrine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we turn to consider whether the act\u2019s licensure requirement burdens the free exercise by defendants of their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">A license has been defined as \"the permission by competent authority to do an act which, without such permission, would be illegal.\u201d <em>People v Henderson, </em>391 Mich 612, 616; 218 NW2d 2 (1974). In this case, the church contends that \"submitting to licensing places the state in sovereignty over the Lord in violation of its religious belief.\u201d The church maintains that its preschool/day-care program was established in response to a Biblical command \"to teach the precepts of the word of God to our children.\u201d Dr. Rushdoony, an expert witness called by the church, described the religious nature of the church\u2019s claim against licensing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">[T]he concept that the State has the right to govern what belongs to Christ is religiously offensive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">They see their right to operate a ministry as indeed a mandate from Jesus Christ who is Lord, who is sovereign, and therefore in that sense, it is absolute. . . .

Harold Asir\u00e9, \"the function of a license or the power to license is the power to withdraw the license. And the power to withdraw the license is the power to control whether or not we would have pre-school or not.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Licensing, by its very nature, is a prior restraint. <em>Cantwell v Connecticut, </em>310 US 296; 60 S Ct 900; 84 L Ed 1213 (1940); cf. <em>Murdock v Pennsylvania, </em>319 US 105; 63 S Ct 870; 87 L Ed 1292 (1943), and <em>Follett v McCormick, </em>321 US 573; 64 S Ct 717; 88 L Ed 938 (1944) (flat license taxes operated as a prior restraint on the exercise of religious liberty). \"Whenever a prior restraint impinges upon First Amendment rights, it carries a heavy presumption against constitutional validity.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc v Rochford, </em>585 F2d 263, 271 (CA 7, 1978). In <em>Cantwell, supra, </em>the Supreme Court struck down an ordinance which required a Jehovah\u2019s Witness to obtain a license before soliciting funds for religion purposes. The Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">[T]o condition the solicitation of aid for the perpetuation of religious views or systems upon a license, the grant of which rests in the exercise of a determination by state authority as to what is a religious cause, is to lay a forbidden burden upon the exercise of liberty protected by the Constitution. [310 US 307.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The act\u2019s requirement that defendants obtain a license from the dss before they may conduct their preschool/day-care program \"affirmatively com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>pel[s] [defendants], by threat of sanctions, to refrain from religiously motivated conduct or to engage in conduct that they find objectionable for religious reasons.\u201d <em>Bowen v Roy, </em>476 US 693, 703; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986); see also <em>Sheridan Road, supra, </em>p 554 (Riley, J.). From the perspective of these particular defendants, the act\u2019s licensing provision requires submission to the authority of the state to decide whether this religious activity may be conducted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude, as did the trial court, that the evidence adduced in this case demonstrates that defendants\u2019 practice of their religion is burdened by the act\u2019s licensing requirement. Accordingly, we turn now to consider whether such a burden is nevertheless outweighed by a compelling state interest which justifies denial of an exemption in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The dss contends that the state has a \"compelling interest in the health, safety and welfare of children in day-care facilities.\u201d That the state has a fundamental interest in protecting its citizens, especially the young, is not contested. See <em>Barsky v Bd of Regents of SUNY, </em>347 US 442, 449; 74 S Ct 650; 98 L Ed 829 (1954); <em>Prince v Massachusetts, </em>321 US 158, 168-169; 64 S Ct 438; 88 L Ed 645 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Dss witnesses emphasized at trial that preschools and day-care centers may present hazards to children\u2019s safety in the form of insufficient staff, improper nutrition, dangerous toys, the reception of sick children, and the specter of \"child abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>including excessively severe disciplinary practices.\u201d Although that is true, the United States Supreme Court, nevertheless, \"has consistently asked the Government to demonstrate that unbending application of its regulation to the religious objector 'is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowen v Roy, supra, </em>476 US 728 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The state does not meet its burden merely by showing a compelling interest in the general subject matter of its regulation. To override claims of religious exemption, the state must demonstrate a compelling need to apply the law in the particular case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">[D]espite its admitted validity in the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interest that the State seeks to promote . . . <em>and the impediment to those objectives that would \u00a3ow from recognizing the claimed . . . exemption. [Yoder, supra, </em>406 US 221. Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Otherwise stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">In applying the least restrictive alternative-compelling interest requirement, it is crucial to avoid the error of equating the state\u2019s interest in denying a religious exemption with the state\u2019s usually much greater interest in maintaining the underlying rule or program for unexceptional cases. Only the first interest \u2014 that in denying an exemption \u2014 is constitutionally relevant when an exemption is sought. [Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1st ed), p 855.][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In the instant case defendants concede that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>state\u2019s interest in protecting the health and safety of young children is of the highest order. Defendants do not object to regulations that directly relate to health, fire, sanitation, and other safety requirements; indeed, the church\u2019s preschool would submit to licensing of its facilities for safety reasons. However, defendants reject the proposition that the state has constitutional authority to license the ministry activity itself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the dss to argue, as it does, that it has a compelling interest in the broader purpose of \"licensing and regulating day-care facilities\u201d or \"providing young children with quality preschool programs,\u201d (see the Court of Appeals opinion, 150 Mich App 264, 267) is to beg the question in this case. As against defendants\u2019 fundamental right of religious freedom, such a contention on the part of the dss falls short of identifying a recognized compelling state interest for purposes of First Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">As in <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, supra, </em>the instant case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">involves the fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of the State, to guide the religious future and education of their children. The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition. If not the first, perhaps the most significant statements of the Court in this area are found in <em>Pierce v Society of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Sisters </em>[268 US 510; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925)], in which the Court observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\"The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\u201d 268 US at 534-535.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">The duty to prepare the child for \"additional obligations,\u201d referred to by the Court, must be read to include the inculcation of moral standards, religious beliefs, and elements of good citizenship. <em>Pierce, </em>of course, recognized that where nothing more than the general interest of the parent in the nurture and education of his children is involved, it is beyond dispute that the State acts \"reasonably\u201d and constitutionally in requiring education to age 16 in some public or private school meeting the standards prescribed by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">However read, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pierce </em>stands as a charter of the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. <em>[Yoder, supra, </em>406 US 232-233.][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">There is even more reason here than in <em>Yoder </em>to accommodate the defendants\u2019 free exercise claims. In this case, the state\u2019s interest is of a decidedly different nature than the interest in compulsory education involved in <em>Yoder </em>and <em>Sheridan Road, supra. </em>Where a government undertakes to require parents to see that their children receive a certain level of education, regulation of the quality and content of the educational program may be necessary. See <em>Sheridan Road, supra, </em>pp 478-480. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ever, the state has never asserted an interest in requiring all children to be exposed to a state regulated preschool/day-care program in order to enhance their social, physical, intellectual or emotional development. Rather, as explained by the dss\u2019 own expert, Mr. Class, the state\u2019s interest in regulating preschool/day-care programs is preventive. He pointed to the regulation of public health as an analogy to the underlying purpose of licensing childcare centers. When such a broad prophylactic purpose has the effect of regulating protected activity in advance, it becomes suspect. <em>NAACP v Button, </em>371 US 415, 438; 83 S Ct 328; 9 L Ed 2d 405 (1963).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\">To be sure, the power of the parent, even when linked to a free exercise claim, may be subject to limitation ... if it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens. <em>[Yoder, supra, </em>406 US 233-234.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">But in this case, nothing in the record indicates that exempting these particular defendants from the licensing requirement would pose a \"grave and immediate\u201d danger to the state\u2019s interest in protecting the welfare of the children involved. <em>West Virginia Bd of Ed v Barnette, </em>319 US 624, 639; 63 S Ct 1178; 87 L Ed 1628 (1943). This is not a case in which harm to the health or safety of those children attending defendants\u2019 preschool/day-care program has been demonstrated or even implied. As noted above, defendants are more than willing to submit to health and safety requirements and have done so in the past.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Absent any evidence that it would interfere with the state\u2019s interest in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of preschool children, a religious exemption from licensing is warranted under the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that less burdensome alternative means are available by which the dss could fulfill its stated interest. Although not required to do so under the strict scrutiny standard, defendants have convincingly pointed out that the state could accomplish its legitimate objective through a program of registration, such as that allowed for family day-care homes where six or fewer children are cared for at a time. MCL 722.111(f)(iii), (1), (m) and (n); MSA 25.358(ll)(f)(iii), (1), (m) and (n). Defendants recognize that application of the act\u2019s more limited requirement of registration, rather than licensure, would still subject their preschool program to some state control. For example, the state could make periodic inspections and enforce standards relating to the safety, health, and welfare of the children. See MCL 722.111(1), (m); MSA 25.358(11) (1), (m), MCL 722.115; MSA 25.358(15). However, as defendants see it, the less obtrusive procedure of registration would accommodate defendants\u2019 fundamental religious objection to the concept that the state, through its power to grant or withhold a license, is to decide whether the pervasively religious activity of this ministry is to be conducted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>It is noteworthy that under the existing statutory scheme a childcare center which is operated by the state or by a local unit of government within this state need not be licensed, but only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">evaluated and approved at least once every 2 years, using this act and rules promulgated thereunder for similar nongovernmental organizations licensed under this act. A report of the evaluation shall be furnished to the funding body for each child care organization. Unless child care organizations are approved, or provisionally approved, as meeting the appropriate administrative rules, state funds shall not be appropriated for their continued operation. [MCL 722.116; MSA 25.358(16).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">As the Court of Appeals discussed in <em>Erickson v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>108 Mich App 473, 479; 310 NW2d 428 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Although a state or local government run facility is subject to the same rules of operation as its private counterpart, including criminal penalties for failure to comply with such standards, MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>722.125; MSA 25.358(25), the state\u2019s formal approval of the facility does not constitute a similar prerequisite to operation. In fact, the language of MCL 722.116; MSA 25.358(16) discloses that the state\u2019s only recourse against unapproved government run facilities, which are not otherwise subject to the criminal penalties noted above, is to withhold state funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">That a different scheme of regulation exists for state and local government-operated facilities serves to demonstrate that the dss could be more flexible in the instant case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Thus, while it is conceded that the state has a fundamental interest in the health, safety, and welfare of children in preschool/day-care programs, the record presented warrants the conclusion that the state\u2019s legitimate purposes could be achieved in the case of these defendants by utilizing a \"less obtrusive form of regulation\u201d than licensing. <em>Sherbert, supra, </em>374 US 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">For these reasons, we would hold that the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause precludes the dss from requiring the defendants\u2019 preschool/daycare program to be licensed under the childcare organization act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">We turn now to defendants\u2019 claims that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>addition to the licensing requirement, certain regulations promulgated by the dss pursuant to the childcare organization act also impinge upon their First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Rule 400.5104(2)(a), issued by the dss, requires that the \"program director [of a childcare center] shall have completed a minimum of 60 semester hours of credit at an <em>accredited </em>college or university . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">No one disputes that in the view of the church and its members the program director of its preschool/day-care program is considered to be an \"underpastor\u201d of the church. At trial, Rev. Harold Asir\u00e9, testified that the \"number one qualification\u201d of a program director is that the person be a \"Born Again Christian.\u201d He said the defendants looked to the fundamentalist Christian colleges to find a program director because such colleges teach a Biblically-based philosophy of education. It was pointed out that some of these colleges forgo state accreditation on the ground of religious belief. Rev. Asir\u00e9 conceded the possibility that a person who had attended an accredited college could be acceptable as a program director, if that person were a \"Born Again Christian.\u201d According to Rev. Asir\u00e9, the religious beliefs of the applicant would be the paramount criterion for selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The dss does not contest that the choice of a program director by these defendants would be severely circumscribed if they were limited in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>selection to graduates of accredited colleges. We believe the record clearly establishes that the accreditation limitation places a burden upon defendants\u2019 free exercise rights. As held by the court in <em>Rayburn v General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, </em>772 F2d 1164, 1168 (CA 4, 1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">[Perpetuation of a church\u2019s existence may depend upon those whom it selects to preach its values, teach its message, and interpret its doctrines both to its own membership and to the world at large.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">Any attempt by government to restrict a church\u2019s free choice of its leaders thus constitutes a burden on the church\u2019s free exercise rights. [See also <em>Kedroff v St Nicholas Cathedral, </em>344 US 94; 73 S Ct 143; 97 L Ed 120 (1952).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The dss nevertheless contends that \"the State has a compelling interest in assuring that program directors have the minimum level of knowledge, which will enable them to adequately supervise child care staff and to design and maintain programs which are appropriate to the needs of preschool age children.\u201d At trial, the dss introduced the deposition testimony of Dr. Norris Class, an expert witness. Dr. Class discussed the vulnerability of small children and listed risks related to childcare centers. Regarding staff qualifications, Dr. Class testified \u00e1s follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">There are risks relating to the character defect of staff and to the lack of qualifications of staff to carry out role assignments properly and/or responsibly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Other experts gave similar testimony on behalf of the state on the importance of director training. However, none of the expert testimony offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the dss concerned the importance of program director training at an accredited college, rather than an unaccredited fundamentalist Christian school. Dr. Ruopp specifically testified that it is the type of training received that is most important, rather than the number of years involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\">We tested the hypothesis that years of education made a difference and discovered that years of education by themselves made no difference. What made a difference . . . was that caregivers had specific training in child development and daycare ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The testimony of Mr. Gazan, another dss witness, indicates that the interest of the dss in having an accreditation requirement is to make sure that a person selected for director has in fact attended a college, rather than a diploma mill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">We at the Department of Social Services have neither the responsibility nor the ability to go around and evaluate . . . whether or not that college is or is not providing a level of academic learning that is on a college level. . . . [W]e want to be sure that the credits earned are not something that were earned by way of a hundred dollar fee with some paper mill college ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Such testimony undercuts plaintiff\u2019s argument that the accreditation requirement is closely related to director qualifications. Rather, it suggests that accreditation is utilized to ensure that a director\u2019s training is not completely counterfeit. Moreover, there is record evidence that the department has issued alternative guidelines which would allow the hiring of directors from unaccredited colleges, a development which further demonstrates that the accreditation requirement is not essential to the dss\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>We conclude that the dss has failed to sustain its burden to show a compelling basis for its refusal to recognize in the case of these defendants an exemption from the accreditation requirement of Rule 400.5104(2)(a). Accordingly, we would hold the accreditation requirement unconstitutional as applied to these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Another of the challenged dss regulations is Rule 400.5106(l)(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">(1) A center shall provide a program of daily-activities and relationships that offers opportunities for the developmental growth of each child in the following areas:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">(c) Emotional development, including <em>positive self-concept. </em>[Emphasis supplied.][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">With respect to this regulation, we join in the reasoning and conclusion of Justice Cavanagh, and add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">This Court said in <em>Woll v Attorney General, </em>409 Mich 500, 533; 297 NW2d 578 (1980), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">A statute may be challenged for vagueness on the grounds that it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">\u2014is overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms, or_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>\u2014does not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">\u2014is so indefinite that it confers unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed.

There, perhaps more than elsewhere, statutory vagueness and statutory over-breadth are constitutional vices often related and sometimes functionally inseparable. See, e.g., <em>NAACP v Button, </em>371 US 415, 423-433; 83 S Ct 328; 9 L Ed 2d 405 (1963). For \"where a vague statute 'abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms\u2019 it 'operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms,\u2019 \u201d <em>Grayned v City of Rockford, </em>408 US 104, 109; 92 S Ct 2294, 2299; 33 L Ed 2d 222 (1972), quoting in turn <em>Baggett v Bullitt, </em>377 US 360, 372; 84 S Ct 1316; 12 L Ed 2d 377 (1964) and <em>Cramp v Board of Public Instruction, </em>368 US 278, 287; 82 S Ct 275; 7 L Ed 2d 285 (1961); and \"[uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to ' \"steer far wider of the unlawful zone\u201d . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden area were clearly marked.\u2019 \u201d [Citations omitted.] \"The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform [citizens of] what is being proscribed.\u201d <em>Keyishian v Board of Regents, supra, </em>385 US [589] 604; 87 S Ct [675] 684 [17 L Ed 2d 629 (1967)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">Consequently, \"standards of permissible statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tory vagueness are strict in the area of free expression.\u201d <em>NAACP v Button, supra, </em>371 US at 432 .... \"Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 433; 83 S Ct at 339; \"[precision of regulation must be the touchstone in [that] area . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438 ... . <em>[Buckley v Valeo, </em>171 US App DC 172, 225-226; 519 F2d 821, 874-875 (1975), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part 424 US 1; 96 S Ct 612; 46 L Ed 2d 659 (1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">A statute is vague when the conduct it forbids is so unclear that persons \"of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Connally v General Construction Co, </em>269 US 385, 391; 46 S Ct 126; 70 L Ed 322 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Attempting, presumably, to justify the regulation, one of the dss witnesses, Dr. Ruopp, testified that it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">written as a sign post rather than as a prescription, you really \u2014 you can justify just about anything you do with children that is reasonable and intelligent, all the way from, I suppose, secular humanism on the one hand to the most rigorous kind of religious training that you can give.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We agree with defendants that such testimony serves to demonstrate that because the rule is subject to such wide and varied interpretations, it is vague to the point that persons of ordinary intelligence must \"guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Connally, supra, </em>269 US 391. \"Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to ' \"steer far wider of the unlawful zone\u201d . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grayned v Rockford, supra, </em>408 US 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Particularly where First Amendment freedoms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>are at stake, such vagueness in a regulation is constitutionally intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Defendants also claim that their First Amendment rights are violated by certain provisions of the childcare organization act which purport to give the dss authority to investigate the financial condition of a childcare center.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The dss argues that its interest in insuring that basic services are provided to children in childcare centers necessitates such regulation. Yet, it is undisputed that in a policy memorandum issued by the dss on September 10, 1974, the requirement that license applicants submit financial statements was discontinued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">This is to inform you that the Financial Statement form (DSS-3603) is no longer to be used in connection with the application requirements for licensure or approval. Both the format and the information required is of dubious value, and provides no rule related information pertinent to determining a licensing recommendation._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>It is expected that new applicants may desire consultation with respect to the fiscal management of a child care center. Consultation can be provided by using other sources of information, or resources much more appropriately than the aforementioned form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Defendants contend that inspection of their financial status could entail disclosure of their funding sources. We agree that such compelled disclosure could affect free exercise rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">[T]he invasion of privacy of belief may be as great when the information sought concerns the giving and spending of money ... for \"[financial transactions can reveal much about a person\u2019s activities, associations, and beliefs.\u201d <em>[Buckley v Valeo, supra, </em>424 US 66.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Even though the dss has rescinded the practice of requiring financial disclosure by license applicants, the statutory provisions authorizing such regulation remain in effect. The potential, alone, for such inspection to occur in the future is a sufficient burden to chill defendants\u2019 decision-making process for their religiously based programs. See <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago v NLRB, </em>559 F2d 1112 (CA 7, 1977), aff\u2019d on statutory grounds 440 US 490; 99 S Ct 1313; 59 L Ed 2d 533 (1979); <em>Surinach v Pesquera de Busquets, </em>604 F2d 73 (CA 1, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The dss has effectively conceded, through its policy memorandum, that it does not have a compelling interest in initial financial disclosure of license applicants. Further, the record in this case shows that the dss is able to make a determination regarding whether basic services are being provided at childcare centers without financial inspection. One dss witness, Mr. Gazan, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">The only time that the financial status of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>center would be a matter of concern would be if it was obvious it was interfering with the ability of that center to provide adequate staff. To pay the heat bills \u2014 and by the way, we have had actual cases where, because a licensee was not paying their heat bill, ultimately it was turned off. They were continuing to try to care for children so they could receive the income, hopefully be able to pay their bills. Then it becomes a legitimate area of our concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">It appears that the dss\u2019 purpose in reviewing finances is to ascertain otherwise observable facts, i.e., whether adequate staff, heat, and the like is provided. Particularly in view of the fact that the dss has introduced no evidence to show that any such problem has ever existed with respect to defendants\u2019 preschool/day-care programs, we conclude that application of the financial inspection and disclosure requirements of the act to these defendants would violate their right to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Finally, defendants follow a literal interpretation of the Biblical admonition, \"Spare the rod, spoil the child.\u201d The preschool/day-care staff uses a Ping-Pong paddle to spank children when such discipline is deemed necessary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The childcare organization act authorizes the dss to promulgate rules for \"discipline of children.\u201d MCL 722.112(3)\u00a9; MSA 25.358(12X3)\u00a9. Rule 400.5107(2Xa) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">(2) Staff shall be prohibited from ... (a) [h]it-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ting, shaking, biting, pinching, or inflicting a form of corporal punishment.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Defendants assert that the plain language of this rule burdens the exercise of their religious belief that the use of corporal punishment to discipline children is required by the Bible. While conceding that the rule \"may well be burdensome on Defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion,\u201d the state contends that its interest in protecting the health and well-being of children overrides any burden placed on defendants\u2019 rights. As stated by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">The state\u2019s interest is clear and compelling. The rule protects very young children from physical harm by prohibiting potentially abusive forms of discipline. Child abuse by adults is a major risk to children receiving daily out-of-home care in daycare centers. Children in age ranges to 6 are not likely to protest abusive punishment. Thus, although the prohibition against spanking with a Ping-Pong paddle burdens the church\u2019s free exercise of its religious beliefs, the state\u2019s interest in protecting its very young outweighs the burden. In so holding, we recognize that some practices rooted in religious principle may be dangerous to the health and welfare of certain members of society. [150 Mich App 271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Other courts have recognized the profound interest of the state in preventing the infliction of physical or emotional harm to children in childcare center facilities by means of corporal punishment. See, e.g., <em>Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc v Lukhard, </em>661 F Supp 300, 312-313 (ED Va, 1987), rev\u2019d on other grounds 846 F2d 260 (CA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>4, 1988); <em>State ex rel Pringle v Heritage Baptist, </em>236 Kan 544; 693 P2d 1163 (1985); Johnson v California State Dep\u2019t of Social Services, 123 Cal App 3d 878; 177 Cal Rptr 49 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In this instance, we agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, and we conclude that Rule 400.5107(2)(a) may be constitutionally applied to defendants despite the possible burden on religious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Accordingly, we would affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b647-6\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b647-7\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">We conclude that a compelling state interest in protecting children in childcare centers from physical and emotional harm justifies the imposition of the licensure requirement. We would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals to the extent it holds compliance with the licensure requirement does not violate the defendants\u2019 constitutional rights under the Free Exercise or the Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, and that the defendants must comply with the regulation prohibiting corporal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We would vacate that portion of the opinion addressing the program content regulation, finding the rule void on its face because it is overbroad and presents a realistic danger that the rule will compromise First Amendment rights, specifically the freedoms of religion and speech. We would also vacate those portions addressing the program director regulation, finding any issues relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>rule not ripe for review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the financial inspection regulation, finding any issues relating to the rule moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The Court must determine whether the State of Michigan, Department of Social Services, may constitutionally require the Emmanuel Baptist Church to obtain a license and comply with certain administrative rules in the childcare organization act, 1973 PA 116, in order to operate its preschool and day-care programs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or whether the requirement that the defendants comply with the act constitutes a violation of defendants\u2019 rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The defendants\u2019 request for exemption is premised on a sincerely held belief which is asserted as being in conflict with and thus burdened by the state requirement. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2d ed), \u00a7 14-12, p 1242. The free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed \"a substantial burden,\u201d <em>United States v Lee, </em>455 US 252; 102 S Ct 1051; 71 L Ed 2d 127 (1982), on the observation of a central religious belief or practice; if so, the state will prevail only if a compelling interest justifies the burden. <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>490 US \u2014; 109 S Ct 2136; 104 L Ed 2d 766 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>We recognize that \"[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants\u2019 interpretations of those creeds.\u201d <em>Hernandez v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, supra, </em>p 786, citing <em>Thomas v Review Bd Ind Employment Security Div, </em>450 US 707, 716; 101 S Ct 1425; 67 L Ed 2d 624 (1981). The standard for' evaluating free exercise claims has not been consistently articulated by the United States Supreme Court. However, unless an allegation of a burden on a sincerely held religious belief is to automatically require invalidation of a licensing regulation and an entitlement to exemption, a court cannot analyze the purpose or compelling interest of the state without fully addressing the nature and extent of the burden on a claimant\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Thus, we agree fully with Justice Cavanagh\u2019s view that before a court applies the strict scrutiny, compelling state interest, and no less restrictive alternative formulation, the significance of the burden on the activity must be evaluated. <em>Ante, </em>pp 394-395.

See <em>Lyng v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>485 US 439, 464-465; 108 S Ct 1319; 99 L Ed 2d 534 (1988); <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v California Bd of Equalization, </em>493 US \u2014; 110 S Ct 688; 107 L Ed 2d 796 (1990). In these cases the conclusion that the harms inflicted by the challenged government policies were not the sort that would trigger the protection of the Free Exercise Clause made further constitutional analysis unnecessary. Lupu, <em>supra, </em>p 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The extent of the required showing is not clear or articulated the same in each case. What is clear from the analysis employed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lyng </em>and <em>Swaggart </em>is that neither <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205; 92 S Ct 1526; 32 L Ed 2d 15 (1972), nor <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398; 83 S Ct 1790; 10 L Ed 2d 965 (1963), set the standard for all claims of violation of the free exercise of religion and that the existence of an effect on a sincerely held religious belief does not in and of itself require the state to demonstrate a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>In <em>Sherbert v Verner, supra, </em>the Court applied traditional strict scrutiny and held that plaintiff\u2019s disqualification for workers\u2019 compensation benefits abridged her right to the free exercise of religion. Although the burden was \"indirect,\u201d the ineligibility ruling forced plaintiff to choose between forfeiting benefits or abandoning one of the precepts of her religion. \"Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 404. In <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, supra, </em>p 219, the Amish persuasively established a practice which pervaded their mode of life and which \"would [have been] gravely endangered] if not destroy[ed],\u201d by the state\u2019s requirement of compulsory formal education after the eighth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Despite the fact that the United States Supreme Court has consistently reiterated the strict scrutiny test, application of the test to situations other than government benefits or the <em>Yoder </em>case suggest distinct, although as yet not fully articulated, methodology. The Court has not employed a mechanistic approach to all free exercise claims and a multifactored balancing process is at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">When this Court recently addressed the Free Exercise Clause in <em>Sheridan Road Baptist Church v Dep\u2019t of Ed, </em>426 Mich 462, 486; 396 NW2d 373 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>(1986), cert den 481 US 1050 (1987), the central focus of the plaintiff\u2019s general objection was, as in this case, that licensure itself interfered with the church\u2019s sovereign right to minister.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our effort here, as it was then, is to articulate the appropriate method to resolve the claim, stemming from our conviction that Supreme Court precedent does not mandate unvarying application of the strict scrutiny applied in <em>Yoder.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The conclusion that the United States Supreme Court would apply the <em>Yoder </em>test to the licensing requirement on the record before us ignores the fact that the Court has expressly distinguished <em>Yoder </em>as a case that involved not merely an effect on religious activity, but a compulsion by the state to coerce the plaintiffs to act contrary to their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The claimant\u2019s showing of sincerity that its religious beliefs are burdened if its organization is required to abide by the state requirements at issue will not always be sufficient unless it can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>also demonstrate a significant burden.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Foundation v Secretary of Labor, </em>471 US 290; 105 S Ct 1953; 85 L Ed 2d 278 (1985). Thus, initially the inquiry is whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">\"[the] government has placed a <em>substantial burden </em>on the observation of a central religious belief or practice . . . .\u201d [Emphasis added. <em>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, supra, </em>107 L Ed 2d 806, citing <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>104 L Ed 2d 786.][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In addition, even in circumstances in which the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that the claimant\u2019s beliefs are sincere and that the government\u2019s proposed actions would have severe adverse effects on the practice of its religion, \"incidental effects of government programs, which may make it more difficult to practice certain religions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into acting contrary to their religious beliefs, [do not] require [the] government to bring forward a compelling justification for its otherwise lawful actions.\u201d <em>Lyng, supra, </em>pp 450-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The defendants\u2019 religious objection to the licensing requirement is not that their religion precludes having a license but, rather, that the \"function\u201d of the license implies that the state is sovereign and could withdraw permission for religious activity that is mandated by religious belief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Asire\u2019s testimony carefully focused on his belief that the \"function\u201d of licensing is to imply the state\u2019s authority to forbid the day-care ministry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also testified, however, that a parishioner who enrolled a child in a licensed day-care center would not be violating a fundamental tenet of the faith. Defendants\u2019 expert Dr. Rushdoony testified that there was no religious objection to having a driver\u2019s license. Thus, it is not licensure that violates defendants\u2019 belief, but the symbolic significance of the license in relation to the ministry of childcare.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state\u2019s guideline precluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>use of spanking except with the open palm, by contrast, directly conflicts with and substantially burdens appellant\u2019s belief that to spare the rod is to spoil the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In its most recent decision in the free exercise area, <em>Swaggart, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court reiterated that a regulation neutral on its face may offend the constitutional requirement if it unduly burdens the rights guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause. Noting the distinction between the sales tax at issue and a flat license tax imposed as a restraint in advance of press and religion, the Court observed that the tax at issue applied to all sales and was not a tax on the right to disseminate religious ideas, information, or beliefs per se. More significantly for the instant case, Justice O\u2019Connor further observed for the unanimous Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">[B]ecause appellant\u2019s religious beliefs do not forbid payment of the . . . tax, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Sherbert v Verner, </em>374 US 398 (1963), and its progeny is misplaced .... Appellant has never alleged that the mere act of paying the tax, by itself, violates its sincere religious beliefs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">We therefore conclude that the collection and payment of the generally applicable tax in this case imposes no constitutionally significant burden on appellant\u2019s religious practices or beliefs. <em>[Swaggart, supra, </em>107 L Ed 2d 810-811.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">While we acknowledge the obviously distinct factual context, we observe that licensure, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tax in <em>Swaggart, </em>involves a neutral regulation and a less direct conflict between defendants\u2019 belief and the statute than those established in <em>Sherbert </em>and <em>Yoder. </em>The defendants do not object to licensure because licensure places any restriction on what they may believe or what they may do. <em>Bowen v Roy, </em>476 US 693; 106 S Ct 2147; 90 L Ed 2d 735 (1986). Licensure, qua licensure, does not force the defendants to choose between a religious duty and enjoyment of government benefits or coerce the defendants to give up their religious beliefs on pain of prosecution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, reliance on <em>Yoder </em>and <em>Sherbert </em>for the proposition that the licensure requirement imposes a constitutionally significant burden seems misplaced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Were the state, to assert a right to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>whether there is a need for defendants\u2019 day-care center, for example, an intrusion into defendants\u2019 evangelical activities analogous to that presented by the corporal punishment guideline would be presented. Having reviewed the record, mindful that \" 'First Amendment questions of \"constitutional fact\u201d compel [the] Court\u2019s de novo review,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we conclude that the requirement of a license in this case does not impose a \"constitutionally significant\u201d burden on defendants\u2019 religious practices or beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Alternatively, assuming the United States Supreme Court would find that licensure, qua licensure, is a constitutionally cognizable burden in these circumstances, we agree with Justice Cavanagh that the burden is clearly not unconstitutional.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This state recognizes that the governmental interest involved, \"the care and protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>children, has long been a matter of utmost state concern.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, for example, <em>Fisher v Fisher, </em>118 Mich App 227, <em>232; 324 </em>NW2d 582 (1982). Further, should the Court focus on the purpose of the licensure requirement, the same conclusion must be reached.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The defendants concede that the state\u2019s interest in protecting the health and safety of young children \"is of the highest order,\u201d but dispute that the state has identified a compelling interest in licensing and regulating day-care facilities or regulating preschool programs. The defendants\u2019 conclusion is based on the fact that, unlike the interest in compulsory education in <em>Yoder, </em>the \"state has never asserted an interest in having all children exposed to a preschool/day-care program in order to advance and enhance their social, physical, intellectual, and emotional development.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The fact that an activity is mandated by the state is evidence of the state\u2019s interest. But the opposite is not true. The fact that the state has not mandated an activity is not dispositive of the state\u2019s interest in the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Finally, while we observe it is difficult to under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>stand how registration which would also function to imply the state\u2019s approval to operate the daycare center is less burdensome than licensure,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we acknowledge that the \"incomprehensibility of a religious belief,\u201d is not a \"reason to refuse to accord it the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d Opinion by Justice Cavanagh, <em>ante, </em>p 406. Rather, we point out only that if the burden on the defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion is the power to withdraw approval, and a day-care center can operate only with the state\u2019s approval under either registration or licensure, this argument would admit of no limitation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Therefore, on the basis of the minimal and indirect burden the licensure requirement imposes on the defendants\u2019 exercise of religion, and of the substantial state interest in protecting the health and welfare of preschool children being cared for outside their homes and the logical nexus between the interest to be attained and the means of attaining it, or on the basis that there is no less restrictive alternative to satisfy the state\u2019s compelling interest, we would hold that the state may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>constitutionally require the defendants to comply with the licensure requirement of 1973 PA 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">III. THE REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In addition to the licensing requirement itself, the defendants contend that particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the childcare organization act impinge upon their First Amendment rights. Although the lower courts addressed the merits of this issue, it must first be observed that these regulations have never been applied to the defendants. This presents an additional issue which this Court has a duty to address, that is, whether the condition precedent to the relief sought by the defendants regarding these regulations has been shown.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Shavers v Attorney Gen</em>eral, 402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Contrary to the assertions made by the defendants the free exercise claims regarding the regulations are not ripe for review.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The dss has never brought any action to compel the defendants to comply with the regulations, either in order to be licensed or to prevent revocation of a license.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Thus, there is not an adequate factual record upon which to determine the validity of the claims made by the defendants that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">factual record is too well developed to have any valid basis for conjecture as to the defendants\u2019 \"fear of prosecution\u201d arising from the possibility that the plaintiff will deny a license for their failure to comply with Rule 104. By maintaining this action, and by its prior enforcement actions, the plaintiff has provided a \"palpable basis\u201d for assuming the license will be revoked.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] [Opinion of Justice Cavanagh, <em>ante, </em>p 411.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We are compelled to emphasize that this is <em>not </em>a situation in which the defendants have been denied a license or threatened with revocation of their license unless they comply with the express terms of the regulations. In fact, the defendants themselves informed the dss that they refused to be licensed. Thus, there is no support for the claim that after extensive consultations with the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>dants regarding the accreditation aspects of the rule, \"[t]he dss refused to provide a license to defendants, in part because they employed program directors who had received degrees from unaccredited schools (and who, as a result, were found not to be in compliance with 1979 AC, R 400.121[3]).\u201d Opinion of Justice Cavanagh, <em>ante, </em>p 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">In this case when the defendants informed the dss that they refused to be licensed, the state brought an action to prevent them from operating the childcare center without a license and requested the court to declare that the defendants were subject to the childcare act. The state has never brought an action to compel strict compliance with the regulations and, further, although the act provides for exemptions from the regulations, the defendants have made no attempt to secure an exemption from any of the rules.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Since the state has never applied the regulations and the defendants have never applied for the exemption, there is not a developed factual background against which this Court can intelligently assess the defendants\u2019 claim that any of the regulations place a significant burden on their free exercise of religion, or that the state would not exempt the defendants from the regulations in a manner which would not burden the free exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of their religion. Thus, it is not possible for the Court to determine the validity of the defendants\u2019 claims that compliance with the terms of the regulations involves direct \"coercive\u201d burdens on their free exercise of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">While a declaratory judgment is intended to provide a broad flexible remedy to make the courts more serviceable to the people, the prudent use of judicial resources requires sufficient pleading and proof to present the court with a defined issue, shaped and sharpened by the adversarial posture of the parties. Here, where both the activity suggested and the reaction to it are merely hypothesized, we would find declaratory relief inappropriate because the decision requested would be purely advisory and the issues are not ripe for review.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In addition, MCR 2.605, the actual controversy requirement, requires that the Court not decide moot questions in the guise of giving declaratory relief. See <em>McMullen v Secretary of State, </em>339 Mich 175; 63 NW2d 599 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">A. PROGRAM DIRECTOR</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">This Court has been asked to determine whether an exemption to the program director requirement is constitutionally mandated because the accreditation limitation in selecting a director places a burden on the defendants\u2019 free exercise of their religious beliefs.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The defendants believe the accreditation require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ment directly conflicts with their religious beliefs because the very act of proscribing any standard burdens the defendants\u2019 right to free exercise of religion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> We do not reach the merits of this issue since we conclude that the defendants\u2019 claim regarding the program director regulation is not ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The complaint filed by dss <em>did not </em>seek \"inter alia, to enjoin the operation of the preschool until the defendants would supply documentation of the fact that their program directors complied with Rule 104 in conformity with its interpretation of the predecessor regulation, R 400.121(3). \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Opinion of Justice Cavanagh, <em>ante, </em>p 409. Further, there is <em>nothing </em>in the record which supports the conclusions that the credentials of defendant\u2019s current program director were the occasion for the state\u2019s requested injunctive action, or that the state will force defendants to cease operations if at some future time they hire a director whose credentials are not as expressly required under Rule 104.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>There is no evidence that if defendants decided to comply with the licensure requirement, that the state would deny them a license on the basis that the program director did not attend an accredited college or university.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The regulation simply reflects the state\u2019s intention to guard against the risk of operating a childcare center under the guidance of an unqualified individual, and Rule 400.5118(1), which provides for exemptions if used by the defendant, provides a method of avoiding any burden imposed by the rule.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">B. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">MCL 722.115(1); MSA 25.358(15X1) requires the dss to investigate the financial responsibility of an applicant for a childcare center license. We agree with the Court of Appeals that there is a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>evidence in the record to show an actual infringement upon the free exercise of defendants\u2019 religion resulting from the enforcement of this regulation in 1974. Therefore, we find that the defendants\u2019 claims that their rights of freedom of religion and freedom of association have been violated by the mere existence of the regulation relating to financial disclosure are not ripe for review.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Further, since the requirement for applicants to submit a financial statement was discontinued by a policy memorandum issued on September 10, 1974, we also find that the issue is moot.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> We do not agree with Justice Griffin\u2019s conclusion that the \"potential, alone, for such inspection to occur in the future is a sufficient burden to chill defendants\u2019 decision-making process for their religiously based programs.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Further, <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago v NLRB, </em>559 F2d 1112 (CA 7, 1977), aff\u2019d 440 US 490; 99 S Ct 1313; 59 L Ed 2d 533 (1979), does not provide any authority for the conclusion that the claimant need only make a showing of a remote possibility of a conflict with the religious clauses of the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Amendment to demonstrate a sufficient burden. In <em>NLRB, </em>the court addressed charges that had actually been filed, thus providing the necessary factual background against which the church\u2019s claims could be assessed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> See Tribe, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14-11, p 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In any event, the requirement for applicants to submit a financial statement has been discontinued, and thus, the defendants\u2019 challenge to this regulation is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">C. PROGRAM CONTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Although we have found the program director and financial disclosure requirements inappropriate subjects for declaratory action, we consider defendants\u2019 facial challenge to the regulation regarding program content ripe for review and hold it constitutionally invalid.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendants claim that Rule 400.5106(l)(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>concerning \"positive self-concept\u201d is unconstitutional on its face, has the potential as applied to the religious ministry of the defendants to impose a significant burden on the defendants\u2019 free exercise of religion, and is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> While we would conclude that the question regarding application of the rule is not ripe for review, we agree with Justice Cavanagh that whether the regulation is void on its face can be addressed prior to enforcement.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">While Justice Cavanagh concludes that Rule 106 is unconstitutionally \" 'overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and further that \"[t]he overbreadth doctrine provides an independent, and wholly distinct, ground for deciding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>that Rule 106 is unconstitutionally vague,\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> we do not reach the issue whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague since we find that it is void under the overbreadth doctrine.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">A statute will be considered unconstitutionally overbroad when it is written so broadly that there is a realistic danger the statute will compromise recognized First Amendment rights not before the Court.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The record supports the defendants\u2019 asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tion that the rule would allow the state to determine what type of religious doctrine may appropriately be taught to preschool children and may compromise the defendants\u2019 freedoms of speech and religion.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Thus, we would hold that the program content rule is unconstitutional on its face because it is overbroad, and, as such, may not be applied to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">IV. ESTABLISHMENT clause</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Throughout the proceedings, the defendants have contended that the licensing requirements of 1973 PA 116 and the administrative rules promulgated thereunder violate the defendants\u2019 rights guaranteed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. However, while we recognize that the violation of the Establishment Clause does not require a coercive act on the part of the state, in this case the licensing and regulations at issue do not constitute impermissible state involvement with the defendants\u2019 religious ministry, nor impermissible excessive government entanglement with religion.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>Lemon v Kurtzman, </em>403 US 602; 91 S Ct 2105; 29 L Ed 2d 745 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The dss may constitutionally require the defendants to comply with the licensure requirements of the childcare organization act, MCL 722.111 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 25.358(11) <em>et seq., </em>and certain administrative rules promulgated thereunder, in order to operate the preschool and day-care programs.

However, if the state could achieve its goal as well by a means which would not burden the religious practice, it will be required to adopt the alternative means. If the state\u2019s interest is of a lesser magnitude it will be required to grant the exemption and accept a less effective means of fulfilling its goal.

The Diocese responded that the teacher\u2019s contract was not renewed because the teacher married a divorced Catholic and was no longer in good standing with the Church. <em>[NLRB, supra, </em>p 1125.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> The childcare organization act authorizes the nss to promulgate rules regarding \"programs ... to assure the healthy physical, emotional, and mental development of children served.\u201d MCL 722.112(3) (f); MSA 25.358(12)(3)(f).

The panel concluded the defendants\u2019 concerns were about the <em>potential </em>for abuse in the \"positive self-concept\u201d rule and had failed to show any actual infringement, refusing to invalidate a statutory scheme merely because it might be subject to an unconstitutional interpretation. <em>DSS v Emmanuel Baptist Preschool, </em>150 Mich App 254, 274-275; 388 NW2d 326 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\"> When a law is attacked facially on the grounds it is constitutionally overbroad, a claimant may successfully challenge a statute without the Court addressing the claimant\u2019s particular concerns. Justice Cavanagh declines to address the defendants\u2019 concern that the program content regulation imposes an impermissible burden of the free exercise of their religion, instead finding that the vagueness of the regulation threatens the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\"> In this case the defendants do not claim that the regulation that childcare centers provide programs which assure healthy \"emotional development, including positive self-concept,\u201d is unconstitutional in every conceivable application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\"> It is true that where a statute abuts the sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms the considerations which support the overbreadth doctrine may merge with those underlying a vagueness analysis.

The Court recognized that facial challenges to laws are permitted if a law reaches a \"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\u201d seeming to reject the requirement that a statute must be found vague in all of its possible applications.

Nowak, Rotunda &amp; Young, Constitutional Law (3d ed), \u00a7 16.8, p 840. In addressing defendants\u2019 facial challenges of the rules, we would first determine whether the enactment of the program content regulation reaches a \"substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct,\u201d and, if so, the facial vagueness challenge need not be addressed.

Further, it is not mere speculation to fear that the state will interfere with defendants\u2019 religious program, since a consultant who inspected the school twice felt compelled to comment on the religious nature of the program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\"> The Court of Appeals held that this case presented no Establishment Clause issue because that clause is only violated by aid to or sponsorship of religion.
