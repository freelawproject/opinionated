Consequently, the limitation period does not bar a majority of the tax debt imposed upon the officer. Further, we would hold that the Department of Treasury is not required to send individual notice of personal liability to derivatively liable officers. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Appellant Seabourn S. Livingstone was the sole owner, chairman of the board of directors, and treasurer of the St. Clair Rubber Company, a corporation subject to the Use Tax Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the appellee, Department of Treasury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>issued a notice of intent to assess St. Clair as a result of a use tax audit deficiency for the period July 1, 1978, through June 30,1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">St. Clair timely appealed the assessment to a Department of Treasury hearing referee. On July 12,1982, the referee issued a recommendation that the intent to assess be finalized for the amount of the deficiency deemed owing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The referee\u2019s decision was not appealed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, on September 29, 1982, under the authority of MCL 205.22(2); MSA 7.657(22)(2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the department issued a notice of final assessment against St. Clair. St. Clair, nonetheless, failed to remit the taxes and interest due.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">In accordance with MCL 205.96(3); MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>7.555(6)(3),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the department issued notices of personal liability, individually, against appellant, Seabourn S. Livingstone, and H. Gordon Wood, the named secretary of the corporation, for the unpaid assessment against St. Clair. In a consolidated effort, both Livingstone and Wood appealed their liability to the Michigan Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">On September 23, 1986, the tribunal issued its opinion and judgment. Citing <em>Metro GMC Truck Center, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>4 MTTR 54, 56 (Docket No. 74377, September 6, 1985), and <em>Rowland v Collins, </em>48 Ohio St 2d 311; 358 NE2d 582 (1976), the tribunal concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-6\">\"[A]n unappealed final assessment becomes due and payable by operation of law. Because the corporate officer\u2019s liability for the overdue tax is derivative in nature, the corporate officer is bound by the oscitancy of the corporation.\u201d Petitioners, therefore can not raise the statute of limitations bar and exemption claim, nor challenge the method of computation once the assessment is final. The position of primary or secondary debtor has no [effect] on the right of the Petitioners to challenge the makeup of the assessment. The finality of the assessment is the factor which establishes a bar to such a challenge.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>On October 13, 1986, Seabourn Livingstone filed a claim of appeal, arguing that assessments against derivatively liable corporate officers were separate and distinct from those against the corporation, as was the officer\u2019s right to assert the statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Tax Tribunal, holding that a corporate officer\u2019s liability for unpaid corporate taxes was not separate and distinct from the assessment against the corporation, and thus separate notice of an unfiled return or an unpaid tax was not required when the officer, by his responsible corporate position, already knew or should have known that the tax had not been paid. Further, the Court held that the \"finality\u201d of the assessment on the corporation barred the corporate officer from contesting the amount of taxes owed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We subsequently granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The issue before us involves the interplay between two provisions of the Use Tax Act. MCL 205.91 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.555(1) <em>et seq. </em>The specific provisions at issue provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-8\">If a corporation licensed under this act fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of its officers having control, or supervision of, or charged with the responsibility for making the returns and payments shall be personally liable for the failure. [MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6X3).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>A deficiency, interest, or penalty shall not be assessed after the expiration of 4 years from the date set for the filing of the required return or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. [MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10X3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The first, and perhaps, least difficult aspect of the task before us concerns the determination of exactly when and under what circumstances a corporate officer may be held personally liable for unpaid corporate use taxes. In addressing this question, the Court of Appeals in <em>Peterson v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>145 Mich App 445, 450; 377 NW2d 887 (1985), held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">In order to hold a person personally liable for a corporation\u2019s tax liability under [MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3)], the Department of Treasury must first show that the person is an officer of the corporation. Then it must show either (1) that this officer has control over the making of the corporation\u2019s tax returns and payments of taxes; or (2) that this officer supervises the making of the corporation\u2019s tax returns and payments of taxes; or (3) that this officer is charged with the responsibility for making the corporation\u2019s returns and payments of taxes to the state. [See also <em>Keith v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>165 Mich App 105, 108; 418 NW2d 691 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">We agree that personal tax liability will not attach to corporate officers who simply have significant involvement in the financial affairs of a corporation. The involvement must be tax specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">In this case, the appellant\u2019s \"responsibility for making the returns and payments\u201d of taxes pursuant to MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6X3) is uncontested.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was further conceded at oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that the statute renders the appellant \"derivatively\u201d liable. On that account, the appellant cites the factually similar, <em>Bloom v United States, </em>272 F2d 215, 221 (CA 9, 1959), in which the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit espoused the following supposition regarding derivatively liable parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-5\">In our view, [the applicable statutory section] imposes a separate and distinct liability upon the officer of the corporation who has the duty or is responsible for the collection and payment of the tax and who willfully fails either to collect the tax or to pay it over. While this liability is denominated \"penalty\u201d it is \"to be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes are assessed and collected.\u201d While it might be said that the assessment made on appellant is derivative of the assessments made on the corporation, in that they both relate to taxes collected or withheld by the corporation, the liability imposed upon appellant by [the applicable statute] is statutory and in such cases the statutory limitations are controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The conclusory nature<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the <em>Bloom </em>court\u2019s characterization and application of the terms \"derivative,\u201d \"solely of derivative character,\u201d and \"separate and distinct,\u201d unfortunately diminishes their effect here. Hence, we believe that as a preliminary matter the term \"derivative liability,\u201d as it pertains to corporate officers, in this context, ought to be clearly defined and effectively applied to the facts at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The <em>Random House Dictionary of the English </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number><em>Language </em>(2d ed, unabridged), defines the term \"derivative,\u201d as \"not original; secondary.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed) offers, \"Coming from another; taken from something preceding; secondary. That which has not its origin in itself, but owes its existence to something foregoing. Anything obtained or deduced from another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Our application of the preceding to the present facts leads us to the conclusion that the liability imposed upon the appellant was, indeed, strictly and solely derivative for several reasons. First, in 1923, St. Clair Rubber Company established itself as an incorporated entity under the laws of our state. Arguably, one of the most attractive features of modern incorporation is the opportunity for individuals to avail themselves of limited liability. See Henn &amp; Alexander, Law of Corporations (3d ed), \u00a7 79, p 148. When a business person, such as the appellant, cognitively makes the decision to incorporate, we believe, he also cognitively enjoys the benefit of having shielded himself, in however limited a Sense, from the direct or primary responsibility to answer, legally, in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Second, the tax liability imposed under MCL 205.96(1); MSA 7.555(6)(1), was created by St. Clair Rubber Company, the corporate entity, by its \"storage, use, or consumption of \u201d tangible personal property or services. See MCL 205.91 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.555(1) <em>et seq. </em>The ensuing corporate taxation was not based on or directed at the activities of Seabourn Livingstone, the individual. The responsibility for the tax originated from acts \"solely\u201d attributed to the entity, St. Clair Rubber Company. St. Clair, and not Mr. Livingstone, was the principal tax actor and, hence, the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Finally, MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3) expressly provides: \"any of its officers . . . shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>personally liable for the failure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute does not say \"shall be personally liable for the <em>taxes,\u201d </em>so as to create the arguable \"separate and distinct\u201d liability, suggested in <em>Bloom, supra. </em>The phrase \"liable for the failure\u201d plainly carries with it the notion that <em>failure </em>is the condition necessary to be fulfilled in order for the provision to be activated. Thus, in this case, it is the fact of St. Clair Rubber Company\u2019s failure<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to pay its requisite taxes, that provides the fabric from which the appellant\u2019s liability derives._</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Moving to the more difficult issues presented by this case, we next address whether the four-year limitation period for the assessment of use taxes is applicable to a corporate officer who has been held personally liable for use taxes his corporation failed to pay, and whether the department is required to send individual notice of personal tax liability to corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The appellant argues that the language \"shall <em>not be assessed </em>after the expiration of 4 years,\u201d found in MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10)(3), should be interpreted to preclude assessment against derivatively liable corporate officers. (Empahsis added.) The appellant also believes that the department should be required to send individual notice of personal tax liability to corporate officers held so liable. To the contrary, the department asserts that because the original assessment against St. Clair Rubber Company became \"final\u201d on September 29, 1982, the appellant cannot collaterally attack the amount due for any reason, including the statute of limitations. The department further asserts that because the appellant personally received notice of his corporation\u2019s tax deficiency, the necessity for sending individual notice of liability was obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">As noted by the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals, this case poses an issue of first impression in this state. Therefore, our consideration encompasses a discussion of the rules regarding the interpretation and applicability of statutes of limitations, the direction taken by our sister courts in addressing statutes of limitations and the requirement of individual notice, as well as the policy implications any decision by this Court may have concerning this issue of great public significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">STATUTES OF LIMITATION</p>\n<p id=\"A7X\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The limitation provision at issue was enacted to govern the time in which the Department of Treasury could assess use taxes. With specific regard to the construction of statutes of limitation, this Court in <em>McKisson v Davenport, </em>83 Mich 211; 47 NW 100 (1890), reasoned that statutes of limitation should be construed in a manner that best effectuates the policies the Legislature intended to promote. Furthermore, whenever dismissal of an action filed beyond a statute of limitations would not further the Legislature\u2019s objectives in proscribing the limitation period, a plaintiff should be given an opportunity to assert his claim. 54 CJS, Limitation of Actions, \u00a73, pp 17-18, n 19, citing <em>Platoro Ltd, Inc v Unidentified Remains of a Vessel, </em>614 F2d 1051 (CA 5, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">In <em>Lenawee Co v Nutten, </em>234 Mich 391, 396; 208 NW 613 (1926), we further acknowledged that \"[i]n placing a construction upon the language of [a statute of limitation], we should . . . have in mind the purpose of such statutes.\u201d In <em>Sproat v Hall, </em>189 Mich 28, 32; 155 NW 361 (1915), we determined that the \"whole chapter\u201d in which a statute of limitation was contained, was \"to be read as one act, with its several parts and clauses mutually acting on each other as their sense requires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Correspondingly, Sands advises, \"whenever the legislature enacts a provision it has in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter,\u201d and \"legislation is never written on a clean slate, nor is it ever read in isolation or applied in a vacuum.\u201d 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7\u00a7 51.02, 53.01, pp 453, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">It has been universally held that statutes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the government must receive a strict construction in favor of the government. See <em>Badarroco v Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>464 US 386, 391-392; 104 S Ct 756; 78 L Ed 2d 549 (1983) (When a taxpayer files a fraudulent return, taxes may be assessed \"at any time\u201d regardless of whether the limitations period has run). Furthermore, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, observed that \"limitation statutes barring the collection of taxes otherwise due and unpaid are strictly construed in favor of the government.\u201d <em>Lucia v United States, </em>474 F2d 565, 570 (CA 5, 1973) (A statute of limitations for excise wagering tax was held to be inapplicable because the extent to which assessments are barred is exclusively controlled by Congress; there is no fundamental right to have taxes assessed and collected within any period of limitations). See also <em>McDonald v United States, </em>315 F2d 796, 801 (CA 6, 1963) (A statute of limitations did not bar assessment of excise taxes where no return was filed; a limitation barring collection of taxes must receive strict construction in favor of the government). Pacific <em>Coast Steel Co v McLaughlin, </em>61 F2d 73, 75 (CA 9, 1932) (Statutes of limitation barring the collection of income and excess profit taxes that are justly due and unpaid must receive a strict construction in favor of the government). <em>Loewer Realty Co v Anderson, </em>31 F2d 268, 269 (CA 2, 1929) (Statutes of limitation barring the collection of income taxes must receive a strict construction in favor of the government such that collection after the expiration of the limitation period is not barred).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The appellant\u2019s contention that the limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>period should be deemed applicable to any person \"assessed\u201d thereunder, is based, primarily, on the belief that the sentence containing the four-year period makes no internal reference to whom it should apply, i.e., the sentence itself contains no limiting words like \"against <em>the </em>taxpayer.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, viewing the limitation statute in the light most favorable to the Department of Treasury, we find significant the fact that succeeding sentences in the provision do expressly refer to <em>\"the </em>taxpayer\u201d and the <em>\"person </em>subject to tax under this act.\u201d MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10X3). (Emphasis added.) These specific references throughout the whole of the provision dissuade us from believing that their absence from the seminal sentence prescribe, exclusively, to whom the provision should apply. Furthermore, we believe their inclusion is indicative of the Legislature\u2019s intent that the dictates found therein be directed, not at <em>\"any </em>person\u201d but at <em>\"the taxpayer</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">The dissent believes that derivatively liable corporate officers are \"taxpayers\u201d under the statutory scheme in operation here. In principal support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>this assertion, the dissent contends that it is the officer\u2019s status as a \"taxpayer\u201d that provides the right of appeal in this Court. The dissent further believes that corporate officers are \"assessed\u201d when their tax liability arises under MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3). We disagree with both propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">We have concluded that because \u00a7 10(3) refers to \"the taxpayer\u201d and the <em>\"person </em>subject to tax,\u201d the Legislature intended \u00a7 10(3) to apply solely to principle tax actors. (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, a person who becomes liable either primarily or derivatively <em>can </em>be termed, in the most literal sense, a \"taxpayer,\u201d i.e., one who pays taxes. However, this does not diminish or effect the plain truth that Mr. Livingstone, in his status as a derivatively liable corporate officer under \u00a76(3), did not engage in the taxable acts out of which the principle or primary tax liability in this case was born. The appellant simply cannot occupy the same taxpayer status as St. Clair Rubber Company. Therefore, the limitations period in \u00a7 10(3) was drafted with the intent that it apply narrowly to the events surrounding the taxable activity from which the principle assessment against St. Clair was rendered. Thus, contrary to the dissent, our conclusion that the appellant is not a \"taxpayer\u201d does not rest feebly and trivially upon hollow word usage or placement, but on a substantively sound and well-founded premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Accordingly, St. Clair, the tax actor, was \"assessed\u201d in accordance with MCL 205.21(1); MSA 7.657(21)(1); St. Clair was sent notice of the department\u2019s intent to levy; St. Clair requested and received an informal conference at which the hearing officer affirmed the assessment in accordance with MCL 205.21(2); MSA 7.657(21)(2); St. Clair refused or failed to appeal the department\u2019s final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>determination as provided in MCL 205.22; MSA 7.657(22), etc. The procedures accorded the appellant here were the department\u2019s notification to him that his personal liability had been triggered and his right of appeal to the Tax Tribunal, the Court of Appeals, and finally here, in accordance with MCL 205.22(1); MSA 7.657(22)(1).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s blanket assertion that \"the responsible officer in this case was accorded procedures applicable to 'taxpayers\u2019 throughout the <em>whole </em>assessment and collection process.\u201d See <em>post, </em>p 824, n 22. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Moreover, the word \"assess,\u201d as used in the phrase \"shall not be assessed,\u201d encompasses a great deal more than presentment and collection<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of a tax bill. As a practical matter, in order for a party to be \"assessed,\u201d the department must: identify the taxable party, categorize the taxable activity, estimate the tax value associated with the activity, measure the quantity of activity, and fix the amount of taxes due and payable to the state.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Accordingly, the word \"assessed,\u201d as used in the instant provision, refers to a process which has its anchor in the tax activities of \"the taxpayer,\u201d while presentment and collection represent only ministerial steps in the procedure. In the present case, the Department of Treasury properly \"assessed\u201d a tax deficiency against St. Clair Rubber Company within the constraints of MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10X3). However, upon the happening of the condition, i.e., nonpayment of the taxes due, the department sought to enforce and collect the debt created by St. Clair\u2019s default in accordance with MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Any interpretation or construction of the use tax limitation period must be done with comprehensive and simultaneous examination of statutes with which it must function. Hence, our task here is not to construe and interpret the limitation period in isolation. See <em>Hall, supra </em>at 32. Our consideration necessarily includes the statute under which the tax assessment liability was imposed, which, in this case, is \u00a7 6(3). See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7\u00a751.02, 53.01, pp 453, 549. Because both provisions are contained in the Use Tax Act, they are to be construed as mutually acting toward the fulfillment of the purpose envisioned by the Legislature in enacting them. See <em>Nutten, supra </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The dissent has proposed that the repeal of MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10)(3) was intentionally preceded by the 1986 addition of MCL 205.27a(2), (5); MSA 7.657(27a)(2), (5) to the Revenue Division of the Department of Treasury.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">The dissent contends that the <em>near </em>duplicity of the language found in the now repealed \u00a7 10(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>and \u00a7 27a(2) necessarily presumes that the legislative intent of the drafters of \u00a7 10(3), as well as of \u00a76(3), can be gleaned from or evidenced by an analysis of subsections 27a(2) and (5). We disagree with this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Certainly, the Legislature compiled Michigan\u2019s tax statutes with the intent of enacting specific provisions directed to particular types and kinds of liabilities. We do not believe the Legislature intended or intimated that subsections 27a(2) and (5) or any provision of the Revenue Division be applied or adopted in the place of provisions specifically enacted under other self-contained tax acts. Our decision in this case is governed by an analysis of the interrelationship between \u00a7\u00a7 6(3) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>10(3) as they read at the time the appellant was aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Furthermore, the language appearing in subsections 27a(2) and (5) is not identical to that contained in the provisions of the Use Tax Act. Accordingly, in our view those entities bound by the Use Tax Act should be bound and guided narrowly by the specific provisions of the act itself. We do not believe that it was the Legislature\u2019s intent to adopt subsections 2 and 5 in the place of provisions specifically enacted within other self-contained tax acts. Hence, we do not agree that the case at bar was affected in any way by the aforementioned 1986 amendments of the Revenue Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">The limitation period at issue, now MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10)(3), was first introduced into the Use Tax Act in 1949. Apparently, rejecting the application of a general civil limitation period to tax assessments, the Legislature felt it necessary to enact a provision specifically designed for tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6X3), the statute imposing corporate tax liability in this case, originally contained no provision for derivative liability. However, in 1971, subsection c, now subsection 3, was enacted. Thus, we may consider that in enacting this provision, the Legislature had in mind matters of monetary recourse and the establishment of derivative resources for tax debt payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Construing the statutes together, we conclude that the limitation provision applies only to those \"persons,\u201d hence, private corporations, see MCL 205.92(a); MSA 7.555(2)(a),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> who store, use, or consume tangible personal property or services. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>we noted previously, the corporate officer, although \"charged with the responsibility for making returns and payments\u201d of corporate taxes, is nonetheless not the taxable actor and cannot, therefore, be \"assessed.\u201d The transposition of a tax debt onto a derivatively liable party, irrespective of the terminology used,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is an ancillary, ministerial step in the collection process, created, apparently in light of the Legislature\u2019s recognition of the need to insure the <em>payment, collection </em>or satisfaction of tax deficiencies \"assessed\u201d against corporate tax actors. Thus, commensurate with what we deem to be a reasonable interpretive analysis of legislative intent and purpose, we conclude that operation of the use tax limitation period is restricted to the corporate entity \"subject to the tax,\u201d which, in this case, is St. Clair Rubber Company.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Statutes of limitation serve several purposes in jurisprudence. As arbitrary enactments,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> they are designed to accord and limit a reasonable time within which an action may be brought. As a general rule, the limitation period begins to run at the time when a complete cause of action or right of action accrues or arises or when there is a demand capable of present enforcement. See 54 CJS, Limitation of Actions, \u00a781, p 117. See also <em>Howard v General Motors Corp, </em>427 Mich 358, 384-385; 399 NW2d 10 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Statutes of limitation are, in essence, intended to exact diligence in the prosecution of a litigant\u2019s claim. Accordingly, \"[l]imitation statutes are not enacted for the sake of defeating legal claims, but only to require notice of such claims within a reasonable time and thus guard against the unfair handicaps of defending against unfounded and belated suits.\u201d <em>Lynch v American Motorists Ins Co, </em>101 F Supp 946, 949 (ND Tex, 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">In the present case, the appellant believes that the limitation period found in \u00a7 10(3) applies to corporate officers on the basis of the assumption that corporate officer liability is \"separate and distinct.\u201d Accordingly, the appellant contends that because he received the first notice of personal liability three years after such notice was sent to St. Clair, he should only be responsible for paying a portion of the taxes owed to the state. However, because we do not believe corporate officer liability to be \"separate and distinct,\u201d or that \u00a7 10(3) applies to such officers, we also do not believe notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>other than that sent by the department in this case, is required to be sent to officers liable under \u00a76(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">The courts below in their analyses of the notice prong of this action relied principally on three cases: <em>Van Orman v Indiana, </em>416 NE2d 1301 (Ind App, 1981), <em>Keith v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, supra, </em>and <em>Ball v Indiana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>525 NE2d 356 (Ind Tax Ct, 1988). <em>Van Orman, </em>the first decided of these, involved, as in the case at bar, the State of Indiana\u2019s suit against a corporate president to recover unpaid corporate sales and use taxes. F. Harold Van Orman, the President of Van Orman Enterprises, Inc., complained that no notice of the department\u2019s intent to hold him personally liable for Van Orman Enterprises\u2019 unpaid taxes was given within the three-year corporate tax period of limitation, and, for that reason, the state should have been barred from collecting the tax debt. The court, disagreeing with Mr. Van Orman, reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-6\">[I]t would not be unreasonable to conclude [that] Van Orman, as president and general manager of Van Orman Enterprises, Inc., was obviously aware that the corporation had failed to pay the sales and use tax during the period in question. He not only signed the protest to the State\u2019s assessment, but he participated in the hearing on the assessment. To say that Van Orman was unaware of the corporation\u2019s failure to pay the tax or to contend that he was unaware of his personal liability, in the face of [the statute outlining conditions for personal liability of corporate officers], is ludicrous. All persons are charged with the knowledge of the rights and remedies prescribed by statute. . . . The clear pronouncement of the statute is, ipso facto, sufficient notice that a duty exists to remit the tax fund held in trust. No personal notice of the assessment is required. <em>[Id. </em>at 1306. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Although devoid of a statute of limitations discussion, the per curiam decision in <em>Keith v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, supra, </em>nonetheless provided the lower courts in this case with much of the substantive reasoning on which their decisions were based. The facts in <em>Keith </em>similarly involved the personal liability of corporate officers for unpaid corporate use taxes. The issue there, however, was whether proper notice of the corporate officer\u2019s liability for payment of the corporate sales tax was given pursuant to MCL 205.24(1); MSA 7.657(24)(1).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Holding that notice to the corporate officer was not necessary, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-5\">Statutory notice provisions are designed to provide due process of law, the purpose being to provide the taxpayer with notice that a deficiency assessment has been levied for certain taxes and to afford the taxpayer an opportunity to contest it. A defect in formal notice does not violate due process if notice was in fact given. . . . The due process test concerning notice is whether the means chosen to serve notice are reasonably calculated to reach the party, and not whether notice is actually received. <em>[Id. </em>at 109. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Despite semantic distinctions between the statute considered at bar and the Indiana sales and withholding tax statute analyzed in <em>Ball v Indiana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, supra, </em>the lower courts in this case found its reasoning persuasive. In <em>Ball, </em>which, likewise, dealt with whether notice of a tax deficiency sent and received by a corporation provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>sufficient notice to the responsible officer, the Indiana Tax Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-4\">When notice to the corporation is notice to the officer, the officer is apprised of the amount assessed against the corporation. Because [the corporate officer\u2019s] personal liability for the tax is purely derivative, he is also effectively apprised of his potential personal liability for the amount assessed against the corporation. Notice to the corporation is therefore reasonably calculated to apprise the responsible officer of his personal liability for corporate tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-5\">Since the responsible officer\u2019s personal liability for the tax is purely derivative, the application of a separate statute of limitations to the responsible officer\u2019s assessment makes no sense.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] <em>[Id. </em>at 358-359. See also <em>Rowland v Collins, </em>supra.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We reject the appellant\u2019s assertion that derivatively liable officers should receive individual notice of the Treasury\u2019s intention to seek personal collection. We believe that a corporate officer who is liable under MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6X3) must have necessarily been intimately involved in the corporation\u2019s failure to pay taxes and consequently does not need formal notice of such liability to be able to defend in a subsequent action. See <em>United States v Hunter Engineers &amp; Constructors, Inc, </em>789 F2d 1436 (CA 9, 1986). The service of notice to derivatively liable corporate officers would simply add an additional formalistic requirement upon which parties liable under MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3) could rely for the purpose of thwarting the Legislature\u2019s intent to recover the unpaid use taxes from such person. We believe a conclusion by this Court that the appellant, Mr. Livingstone, who, on his own admission, consciously failed to pay the taxes owed by a corporation he individually owned, and whose activities he personally oversaw, is not now responsible to remit the same, in its entirety, would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Officers who are made personally aware of corporate tax deficiencies and who, through neglect or intent, fail to make provisions for the satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of the corporate tax debt when due, simply cannot be allowed to take advantage of their own omissions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> To say that the appellant was unaware of his imminent personal liability in the face of MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3), would be unrealistic. The clear pronouncement of the statute is, we agree, ipso facto sufficient notice that a duty exists to ultimately remit the tax liability to the state. See <em>Van Orman, </em>416 NE2d 1306.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the use tax statute of limitation found in MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10)(3), has no application to derivatively liable corporate officers. Consequently, the statute of limitation here should not bar a majority of the use tax imposed upon the appellant. We further would hold that the Department of Treasury is not required to provide individual notice of personal liability to derivatively liable officers. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b994-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\"> The phrase \"majority of the alleged use tax\u201d can be summed up as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-8\">St. Clair Rubber Company, as a corporate entity, was assessed for use taxes on December 10, 1981, for the three year period beginning July 1, 1978, through June 30, 1981. The appellant believes that because he received the first notice of <em>personal </em>liability on July 27, 1984, that under the four-year statute of limitations found in MCL 205.100(3); MSA 7.555(10)(3) he should only be liable for the taxes owing from July of 1980, thus extinguishing his obligation to pay the taxes owing for years 1978 and 1979. Accordingly, the appellant asserts that if the statute of limitations is found to be applicable to derivatively liable corporate officers, that \"a majority\u201d of his tax liability should be barred. Thus, contrary to the belief of the dissent, Mr. Livingstone\u2019s attempted application of the corporate limitations period to corporate officers is, as a practical matter, an attack on challenge to the \"amount\u201d of the assessment against St. Clair, for which, of course, Livingstone became liable upon St. Clair\u2019s failure to pay.

Accordingly, the dissent believes \u00a7 6(3) derivative liability is triggered each time a corporation fails to so file or pay. We disagree. It is our belief that the Legislature intended \u00a7 6(3) derivative liability to be activated following the allotment of a full and fair opportunity for a corporation to file and pay taxes, either voluntarily, as per MCL 205.96(1); MSA 7.555(6)(1) or following MCL 205.21(1) and (2); MSA 7.657(21X1) and (2), assessment and levy. We believe adoption of the literal reading urged by the dissent, i.e., the random, monthly activation of \u00a7 6(3) liability, so as to create responsibility for tax payment in the corporation one month, and in the derivatively liable officer the next, etc., would mock the purpose of the provision itself. For we agree that \"[w]hile the intention of the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law should not be sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words.\u201d 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 46.07, p 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">In the present case, St. Clair failed to file and pay \"on or before the fifteenth day of each calendar month,\u201d for three years. Accordingly, the department assessed St. Clair for the three years it had been tax deficient. MCL 205.21(1); MSA 7.657(21X1). The taxpayer, St. Clair, clearly availed itself of the procedural avenues for review and evaluation in accordance with MCL 205.21(2); MSA 7.657(21X2) and following a final determination of the taxes due, St. Clair, indeed, still failed to file, pay, or even appeal further. It was not until the assessment amount was deemed \"final\u201d that the appellant received notice of his personal, derivative liability. We believe the procedure followed by the department reflected a reasonable interpretation of the legislative scheme in operation here. Accordingly, we do not believe corporations and corporate officers can be \"assessed\u201d at the same time because \u00a7 6(3) liability cannot attach to a corporate officer until the provisions found in MCL 205.21(1) and (2); MSA 7.657(21X1) and (2) have been fairly and fully availed and any assessments made thereunder, deemed final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b981-5\"> The dissent, further, cites <em>Allan v United States, </em>386 F Supp 499 (ND Tex, 1975), in support of the notion that a derivatively liable corporate officer <em>is </em>a taxpayer. However, we distinguish <em>Allan </em>on the basis of several facts. <em>Allan </em>concerned facts governed by 26 USC 6672, a federal tax statute, very different from MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3) and MCL 205.22; MSA 7.657(22), i.e., the right to appeal under the federal scheme, apparently, must be limited to those deemed \"taxpayers.\u201d Furthermore, the court in <em>Allan </em>specifically limited its reasoning to a \"\u00a7 6672 setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. Likewise, <em>Williams v United States, </em>unpublished memorandum opinion of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, decided October 6, 1983 (Docket No. 82 C 3505), and <em>Holcomb v United States, </em>622 F2d 937 (CA 7, 1980), each cited by the dissent, as well, analyze and construe the federal tax scheme as it relates to waiver forms. Finally, in <em>Calderone v United States, </em>799 F2d 254 (CA 6, 1986), the court reasoned that corporate officers and corporate entities can be assessed at the same time on the basis of a \"separate and distinct\u201d liability analysis. The case at bar does not involve waiver forms or \"separate and distinct\u201d liability. We, therefore, find the federal dicta cited by the dissent neither binding nor persuasive. See also n 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b983-5\"> In terms of a corporate officer\u2019s right to be before this Court, we note that MCL 205.22; MSA 7.657(22) explicitly begins, \"A <em>person </em>aggrieved by an assessment, decision, or order of the department . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We do not believe the provision either states or implies that the aggrieving \"assessment\u201d is one necessarily made as against the <em>person </em>appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">We believe St. Clair <em>and </em>the appellant both find their rights to appeal in \u00a7 22. In light of the Legislature\u2019s decision to incorporate the term \"person aggrieved\u201d into the appeal provision, as opposed to uniformly utilizing the term \"taxpayer,\u201d we likewise do not believe the Legislature intended to allow appeals by \"persons aggrieved\u201d only to the Tax Tribunal or the Court of Claims, while affording \"taxpayers\u201d with appeals to the Court of Appeals and this Court. Indeed, the ability to appeal from a final determination of the Tax Tribunal is limited only by its own self-contained statutory framework. See MCL 205.753(2); MSA 7.650(53)(2). Accordingly, the appellant, Mr. Livingstone, is appropriately before this Court as a person aggrieved by an \u201cassessment\u201d made against St. Clair.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\"> Importantly, the use tax limitation period contains the phrase \"shall not be assessed\u201d and not \"shall not be collected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\"> Our reasoning that appellant Livingstone could not be \"assessed\u201d was deduced principally from our determination that the liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>imposed upon him was unequivocally derived from that which was first imposed upon St. Clair. The dissent wishes to render the term \"derivative liability\u201d a nullity when it asserts that a corporate officer\u2019s liability may be labeled \"derivative\u201d but that the officer is to be \"assessed\u201d a \"separate and distinct\u201d indebtedness. To the contrary, we believe application of the term \"derivative liability\u201d to corporate officers under MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3), directs that <em>every </em>facet of an officer\u2019s resultant financial responsibility, including being \"assessed,\u201d derives not from the officer\u2019s acts, but from the corporation\u2019s taxable business functioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\"> The dissent curiously believes that the Legislature \"intended to refer to MCL 205.100; MSA 7.555(10),\u201d or \u00a710, instead of MCL 205.107; MSA 7.555(17), or \u00a7 17, when it drafted the sentence, \"The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided in section 17,\u201d found in \u00a76(3). It is upon this creative premise of \"legislative mistake\u201d that the dissent hinges its assertion that derivatively liable officers are \"assessed\u201d for taxes in the same manner as principal corporate taxpayers. It is our belief, however, that this assertion cannot be proved or disproved by this Court, as such matters can only be appropriately resolved by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">However, we note that \u00a7 17 has been repealed. Moreover, before its revocation, the provision read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-8\">Any person who fails or refuses to make any return required under this act or who makes any false or fraudulent return or false statement in any return, with intent to defraud the state or evade payment of the tax or any part thereof imposed by this act, or who aids or abets another in any attempt to evade the payment of the tax or any part thereof as imposed by this act, <em>or any person or president, vice-president, secretary or treasurer of any company or association who makes or permits to be made for any person, company or association any false return or any false statement in any return required in this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>act, with the intent to evade or assist in evading the payment of any tax hereunder, </em>shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $500.00 nor more than $5,000.00 or imprisoned in the county jail not more than 1 year, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any person who shall knowingly swear to or verify any false or fraudulent return, or any return containing any false or fraudulent statement, with the intent to defraud or to aid, abet or assist in defrauding the state, shall be guilty of the offense of perjury, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished in the same manner provided by law. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">We believe the referenced sentence found in \u00a7 6(3) was drafted in order that it be made clear that corporate officers were subject to the same severe penalties as principal taxpayers for tax evasion, etc. Thus, we think the Legislature\u2019s intent was clear. Consequently, we find the dissent\u2019s assertions of legislative mistake unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b985-10\"> (2) A deficiency, interest, or penalty shall not be assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>after the expiration of 4 years after the date set for the filing of the required return or after the date the return was filed, whichever is later.

In <em>Associates, </em>the court held that the same limitation period applicable to principally taxed corporate employers should also be applicable to its lenders. The court further held that under 26 USC 6303(a),* a lender was a \"person liable for the unpaid tax,\u201d so that separate notice of liability was required to be sent to a lender within the principal taxpayer limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">We decline to apply the reasoning found in <em>Associates </em>to the present facts for several reasons. First, the court in <em>Associates </em>principally addressed the tax ramifications arising out of an individual\u2019s choice to <em>lend </em>funds to a corporation, a situation clearly distinguishable from the case at bar. Second, our decision today narrowly speaks with regard to derivative corporate officer liability as outlined in MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3), and does not purport to supply any guidance as to corporate lenders or sureties. Third, and most important, the opinion espoused in <em>Associates </em>was repudiated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v Jersey Shore State Bank, </em>479 US 442; 107 S Ct 782; 93 L Ed 2d 800 (1987), where the Supreme Court held that the language found in 26 USC 6303(a), to the effect that \"notice of [an assessment] to each person liable for the unpaid tax,\u201d did not require the government to provide notice and a demand for payment to a lender before bringing suit to collect sums for which the lender was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">* Section 6303.

It said that, since corporate officer liability does not arise until \"after\u201d the corporation fails to pay the tax due, the corporation is \"primarily liable, the corporate officer\u2019s liability is secondary\u201d and \"derivative.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The Court of Appeals said that \"the failure,\u201d referred to in the statute,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> for which a responsible corporate officer is liable is the failure of the corporation \u2014 years after the tax became due on the fifteenth of the month following the month for which it was payable \u2014 to pay an <em>assessment </em>by the department against the corporation<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>mately becomes final after exercise or failure to exercise appellate rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The concurring opinion agrees with the result reached by the lead opinion for the reasons expressed in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Section 6(3) of the Use Tax Act provides that a responsible corporate officer \"shall be personally liable for <em>the failure\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) The \"failure\u201d for which the responsible officer is personally liable is not, however, a failure of the corporation to pay an <em>assessment. </em>The \"failure,\u201d as explicitly stated in the statute, is the failure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the corporation \"to <em>file </em>the required returns or to <em>pay </em>the tax due . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The return is required to be filed and the tax paid<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> on the fifteenth day following the month in which the tax liability arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">When a corporation fails on the fifteenth day of the month following either to file the required return or to pay the tax, the responsible officer <em>then </em>becomes, on <em>that </em>fifteenth day, \"personally liable for the failure\u201d of the corporation, and the four-year statute of limitation begins to run as to an assessment against the corporation and also as to an assessment against a responsible officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">This reading, a simple, uncomplicated, literal reading of the statute, is not impugned by the characterizations of corporate officer liability pressed by the Court of Appeals and adopted by the majority. One can agree that an officer\u2019s liability arises \"after\u201d the corporation fails to pay the tax, that a corporation is \"primarily liable,\u201d that a responsible officer\u2019s liability is \"secondary\u201d and \"derivative,\u201d without agreeing with the conclusion that corporate officer liability arises only after the corporation has failed to pay an <em>assessment </em>rather than when the corporation failed timely to <em>file </em>the return and <em>pay </em>the tax without assessment by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">The statute does <em>not </em>require assessment of the corporation as a precondition to liability of the corporation or of the responsible officer. Nor does the statute require that the department assess the corporation or seek to collect from the corporation before proceeding against the officer. The liability of the officer arises, without regard to assessment of the corporation, when the corporation fails timely to file the return or pay the tax due._</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>The department, as a matter of convenience or courtesy, may seek first to collect from the corporation, the primary obligor, but it is not obliged to do so. It may proceed against the principal (the corporation) or the surety (the responsible officer) or both at the same time. This Court should not be swayed by the department\u2019s lament that it is administratively inconvenient to administer the law as it is written.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The law of suretyship provides an apt analogy. As a corporate officer who became liable for the corporation\u2019s failure to pay taxes, Livingstone was in essence, <em>as the Attorney General argued in this Court, </em>a surety for St. Clair. The liability of a surety, as a general rule accrues at the same time as that of the principal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Because a surety\u2019s liability accrues at the same time as the principal\u2019s it is not necessary that a creditor proceed against the principal before proceeding against the surety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">The remedies are not inconsistent, but are merely cumulative; both may be pursued at the same time until the plaintiff\u2019s damages are satisfied. <em>Stated differently, a creditor\u2019s right to proceed against the surety exists independently of his right to proceed against the principal.[</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The same treatise also states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\"><em>Ordinarily, an obligee\u2019s cause of action against the surety accrues at the same time as does the cause of action against the principal obligor, </em>and it is not necessary for the principal\u2019s obligation to be settled or determined before the obligee can proceed against the surety.[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The department need not have assessed St. Clair before assessing Livingstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The Court of Appeals endorses the department\u2019s view that the finality of the amount of the assessment against St. Clair would bar collateral attack by Livingstone on the amount of the assessment. (Livingstone does not challenge the amount of the assessment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Surely a responsible corporate officer could raise a defense of payment. The analysis of the Court of Appeals opens the door to ipse dixit decisions concerning which defenses may be raised and which may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The law of suretyship again serves as a guide. This Court recently reiterated the rule that a surety may raise defenses available to the principal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\"The <em>surety is in such cases permitted to defend, however, by showing all matters that might have been asserted by the principal in the bond. Clearly, the surety is permitted to defend on any ground personal to himself which was not an issue, and could not be made an issue, in the action as it was waged.\u201d [P R Post Corp v Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>land Casualty Co, </em>403 Mich 543, 548; 271 NW2d 521 (1978). Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">While a judgment against a principal may be prima facie evidence in an action against a surety, it is not conclusive. A surety is free to raise defenses available to the principal. Similarly, Livingstone, as surety for St. Clair, is not bound by a judicial or quasi-judicial determination against St. Clair to which he was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Federal cases interpreting a statute of limitation in the Internal Revenue Code support a reading of use tax \u00a7 10(3), the statute of limitation, that includes responsible officers within its coverage. The Internal Revenue Code provides in \u00a76672 a procedure for assessing \"responsible persons\u201d who fail to pay over employer withholding taxes<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and a statute of limitation on assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Federal cases indicate that the statute of limitation set forth in the federal act applies to actions against officers. <em>Williams v United States,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is illustrative. In August, 1976, Williams, an officer of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>company that failed to pay withholding tax during 1972 and the first quarter of 1973, was assessed the full amount of the unpaid taxes under \u00a7 6672. Williams moved for summary judgment on the basis that the statute of limitation<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> precluded assessment. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-4\">Since the statute of limitations began running on April 15, 1973, plaintiff argues that the penalty assessment [pursuant to \u00a7 6672] on August 4, 1976, came outside the limitation period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-5\"><em>The Government agrees with the plaintiff\u2019s legal analysis, </em>but offers as evidence a waiver form apparently signed by Williams that extended the limitation period by one year. . . . The Government\u2019s response to the motion establishes the existence of the genuine issue of material fact that prevents summary judgment. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In <em>Holcomb v United States, </em>622 F2d 937, 939 (CA 7, 1980), as in <em>Williams, </em>the Internal Revenue Service maintained that the statute of limitation had not run with respect to a \u00a76672 action<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> against the responsible corporate officers because the officers had signed a waiver extending the limitation period. The United States Court of Appeals said that the jury had accepted the officers\u2019 claim that they were intentionally misled into signing the waivers. The government was <em>not </em>per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>mitted to recover from the officers with respect to the last two quarters of 1968, \"those claims having been barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">In <em>Calderone v United States, </em>799 F2d 254 (CA 6, 1986),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the court<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> said that the personal liability of the responsible person under \u00a7 6672 is \"separate and distinct from that imposed upon the employer\u201d and that the <em>\"Service need not have attempted to collect from the employer before assessing a responsible person \u201d </em>under \u00a7 6672 (emphasis added). .</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The court in <em>Calderone </em>explained that the irs policy statement<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \"contemplates that in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>cases the irs will seek payment from others <em>at the same time </em>it is seeking collection from the corporation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>p 258. <em>Calderone </em>controverts the department\u2019s contention, endorsed by the Court of Appeals and, by adoption, the majority, that the statute of limitation cannot apply to corporate officers because the department is barred from proceeding against a responsible officer until the corporation exhausts its appellate rights and then fails to pay an assessment that has so become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">It is most unusual for there not to be a statute of limitation on assessment. Absent a statute of limitation, responsible officers are exposed to assessment indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The Court of Appeals said that the result it reached would not expose Livingstone or other corporate officers to stale claims or deny them due process of law because notice of the assessment and tax liability may be expected to reach corporate officers. The Court reasoned that since a responsible corporate officer will be privy to such information, corporate officers are not entitled to separate notice of assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">The Court of Appeals confuses knowledge of indebtedness with the kind of notice required by statute to toll the running of a statute of limitation.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>Although a responsible corporate officer, such as Livingstone, may have actual knowledge of the assessment of the corporation and his potential liability, that does not toll the running of a statute of limitation.

While the department issued notice of intent to assess the corporation, it did not issue a notice of intent to assess Livingstone.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Livingstone did not receive notice until the department issued the assessment on July 27, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Under the statutory scheme, Livingstone was subject to assessment. As such, he was entitled, no less so than the corporation, to the statutorily prescribed procedural protections of the assessment process, including notice of intent to assess.

In enacting \u00a727a of the general revenue provisions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Legislature made explicit its intent that the statute of limitation applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>the assessment of officers as well as to an assessment of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In 1986, two years before the repeal of the statute of limitation set forth in \u00a7 10(3), the Legislature enacted \u00a7 27a as part of the general revenue provisions. This section contains both a statute of limitation identical in relevant wording and substance to that contained in Use Tax Act \u00a7 10(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>and </em>a provision making responsible officers liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due, also identical in relevant wording and substance to that contained in Use Tax Act \u00a76(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>statute of limitation and the provision making officers liable are now both contained in one section of the general revenue provisions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Section 27a(5), the section of the general revenue provisions mirroring Use Tax Act \u00a7 6(3), in providing that responsible officers shall be personally liable, states that \"[t]he sum due for a liability may be assessed and collected under <em>the related sections of this act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) By deleting the erroneous reference in \u00a76(3) of the Use Tax Act to \u00a7 17 and replacing it with the emphasized language, the Legislature made clear that the sum due for officer liability is to be assessed and collected under related sections of the act, including the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">The lead opinion, however, remains steadfast in its position that the limitation period has no application to officers because officer liability is \"derivative.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The term \"derivative\u201d is not found in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">The opinion nevertheless argues that the dissent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>does not accord the label \"derivative liability\u201d sufficient weight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-4\">The dissent wishes to render the term \"derivative liability\u201d a nullity when it asserts that a corporate officer\u2019s liability may be labeled \"derivative\u201d but that the officer is to be \"assessed\u201d a \"separate and distinct\u201d indebtedness. To the contrary, we believe application of the term \"derivative liability\u201d to corporate officers under MCL 205.96(3); MSA 7.555(6)(3), directs that <em>every </em>facet of an officer\u2019s resultant financial responsibility, including being \"assessed,\u201d derives not from the officer\u2019s acts, but from the corporation\u2019s taxable business functioning.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Because responsible officers are merely \"derivatively liable,\u201d they cannot, according to the opinion, \"occupy the same taxpayer status\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as the primary taxpayer and are not entitled to statutory protections, including the statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">The unstated premise, with which I disagree, is that a person whose liability is derivative is not a \"taxpayer\u201d and is not \"assessed\u201d and, therefore, is not entitled to statutorily prescribed process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">The lead opinion finds \"significant\u201d that sentences surrounding the sentence containing the limitation period refer to <em>\"'the </em>taxpayer\u2019 \u201d and \" 'the <em>person </em>subject to tax under the act.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Reading these terms into the statute of limitation, the opinion reasons that since the statute applies only to taxpayers, and Livingstone, it assumes, is not a taxpayer, the statute cannot apply to Livingstone._</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The opinion\u2019s syllogism rests on the false premise that Livingstone is not a \"taxpayer\u201d within the meaning of the procedures prescribed for assessment and collection of unpaid tax.

The total column was titled, \"Total this <em>Assessment </em>,\u201d and a note in the corner indicated that the document was an \"Original <em>Assessment </em>Copy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The notice also contained the following notations: \"In reply refer to <em>assessment </em>number B783970A;\u201d <em>\"Assessment </em>issued July 27, 1984;\u201d \"As a general rule, the Department files liens on all taxes at the time payment on an <em>assessment </em>is due;\u201d \"This <em>assessment </em>is made pursuant to information available to the Department.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The lead opinion attempts to avoid this pronounced evidence that the department regarded the proceeding against Livingstone to be an assessment by arguing that while a corporate officer, such as Livingstone, may be a \"person aggrieved by an assessment,\u201d he is not \"assessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The opinion ignores the use of the word \"assess\u201d in \u00a7 6(3).

The opinion explains that corporate officer liability is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-5\">activated following the allotment of a full and fair opportunity for a corporation to file and pay taxes, either voluntarily, as per MCL 205.96(1); MSA 7.555(6X1) or following MCL 205.21(1) and (2); MSA 7.657(21X1) and (2), assessment and levy.[<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Reasoning that responsible officers do not become liable until quite some time after the corporation has been assessed, the lead opinion concludes that they may not be assessed at the same time as the corporation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The opinion does not (and could not) cite any statutory source for the proposition that the department must avail itself of the provisions discussed above before an officer may become liable and be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Rejecting the view expressed in this opinion that corporate officer liability is triggered on the fifteenth of each month when the corporation fails to pay taxes or file the required return for the previous month, the opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-8\">We believe adoption of the literal reading urged by the dissent, i.e., the random, monthly activation of \u00a7 6(3) liability, so as to create responsibility for tax payment in the corporation one month, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the derivatively liable officer the next, etc., would mock the purpose of the provision itself.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">The view here expressed that a responsible officer becomes liable on the fifteenth of each month when the corporation fails either to file the required return or pay the tax is compatible with the legislative purpose of creating a derivative source for payment of unpaid taxes.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Triggering of officer liability on the fifteenth of each month in which the statutory duty has not been met, is more determinate than triggering that liability at some later point \u2014 perhaps years after the tax became due \u2014 when the corporation has exhausted its rights of administrative and judicial appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Finally, the lead opinion, agreeing with the Court of Appeals, declares that responsible officers are not entitled to notice of the department\u2019s intent to seek to collect from them. The opinion accepts the assumption of the Court of Appeals that an officer who is subject to liability as a responsible officer is necessarily informed of his potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Like the Court of Appeals, the opinion focuses on the notice requirement exclusively through a due process lens. Livingstone, as a responsible officer subject to assessment, was <em>statutorily </em>entitled to notice pursuant to the procedures set forth in the general revenue provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Requiring notice to responsible officers, will not, as the opinion fears, constitute a needless administrative burden on the department and impede the collection of unpaid taxes. The department may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>by providing notice within the four-year limitation period, preserve its rights against responsible officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">The statutory scheme does not differentiate between the procedures applicable to the assessment of corporations and those applicable to the assessment of responsible officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">To hold, as the lead opinion would, that the statute of limitation is inapplicable to the assessment of responsible officers, is to allow such officers to be subject to an indefinite threat of liability.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Section 6(3), added by 1971 PA 161, in terms provides that the sum due the department for the personal liability of the officer \"may be assessed and collected as provided in <em>section 17.\" </em>It is clear, however, that the draftsperson and the Legislature intended to refer to \u00a7 10 (MCL 205.100; MSA 7.555[10]) and not \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Section 17, now repealed, did not provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>methodology for assessment and collection of tax. Section 17 provided that a person who failed to file a return or who filed a false or fraudulent return or statement with intent to defraud would be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and prescribed a criminal penalty therefor. It was also provided that in some circumstances the person would be guilty of perjury, a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Section 10, as originally enacted, 1937 PA 94, \u00a7 10, provided that the State Board of Tax Administration shall have the power to assess any person who neglects or refuses to make a return required by the act, and that the board shall give such person written notice of assessment. Section 10 was amended in 1949 to provide for the manner in which such notice shall be given, for the assessment of penalties and interest after notice and hearing, and that penalties and interest, where there was fraudulent intent, shall not be waived, and to provide a six-year statute of limitations. 1949 PA 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Section 10 of the 1949 act was amended by 1980 PA 165 to provide for the four-year statute of limitation (see n 5) and to provide that the tax imposed by the act would be administered by the revenue commissioner pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1-19 (MCL 205.1-205.19; MSA 7.657[1]-7.657[19]) of the revenue division act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Sections 11, 11a, 12, 13, <em>and 17 </em>of the Use Tax Act were repealed by 1980 PA 165. Thus there was no \u00a7 17 when Livingstone was assessed in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Act 165 provided that it would not take effect unless legislation to which it was tie-barred, 1980 PA 162, was enacted into law. Act 162 amended the revenue division act and added \u00a7\u00a7 21-30 (MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>205.21-205.30; MSA 7.657[121]-7.657[130]), which <em>set forth procedures observed in assessing St. Clair and Livingstone. </em>See ns 18-21 for the text of \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, and the opening sentences of \u00a7 25(1). It is clear that \u00a7\u00a7 21 <em>et seq. </em>of the revenue division act replace and substitute for the repealed sections of the Use Tax Act and so much of \u00a7 10 as concerns assessment and collection other than the specific four-year statute of limitation of the Use Tax Act retained in \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">That the reference in 1971 PA 161 is a misnomer is clear not only from the context but also on examination of an act signed the same day, 1971 PA 160, which added \u00a7 15(2) of the General Sales Tax Act \u2014 language, word for word, the same as use tax \u00a7 6(3). The last sentence of Act 160 added to \u00a7 15(2) language paralleling the language added to \u00a76(3) providing that the sum of such liability \"may be assessed and collected as provided in section 11.\u201d Section 11 of the General Sales Tax Act <em>concerned the assessment and collection of that tax. </em>Section 11 was, together with other sections of the General Sales Tax Act concerning assessment and collection, repealed by 1980 PA 164, which was also tie-barred to the enactment of 1980 PA 162 adding \u00a7\u00a7 21-30 to the revenue division act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">For the foregoing reasons, it is clear that the Legislature intended, when it referred in \u00a7 6(3) to \u00a7 17, to refer both to \u00a7 10 of the Use Tax Act as amended in 1949, and to the revenue division act, including added \u00a7\u00a7 21-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Section 10 was amended in 1988 by 1988 PA 376, \u00a7 1. Although this amendment does not apply to the instant case, the Legislature\u2019s action is a guide in understanding its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">In so amending \u00a7 10, the Legislature repealed the statute of limitation then contained in that section. Two years before the 1988 amendment, however, the Legislature added \u00a727a to the general revenue provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 27a contains a statute of limitation, \u00a727a(2), applicable to all taxes administered by the revenue division and identical in relevant wording and substance to the statute of limitation contained in use tax \u00a7 10(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">The addition, in 1986, of the statute of limitation contained in general revenue \u00a7 27a(2), and the subsequent repeal of its duplicate, contained in use tax \u00a7 10(3), suggests that the entirety of the procedures set out in the general revenue provisions should be read as governing the administration of the Use Tax Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Section 27a contains a provision, \u00a727a(5), also governing all taxes administered by the revenue division, making corporate officers personally liable for failure to pay taxes. This section is similar to \u00a7 6(3) of the Use Tax Act. We may anticipate the future repeal of \u00a7 6(3) to eliminate the remaining duplicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Section 27a(5), the successor to \u00a7 6(3), does not contain the reference to \u00a7 17. Section 27a(5) con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>eludes: \"The sum due for a liability may be assessed and collected under the related sections of this act.\u201d The Legislature has thus resolved any confusion engendered by the erroneous reference to \u00a7 17. The Legislature has clarified its intent that the general revenue provisions governing assessment and collection, including the statute of limitation contained in \u00a7 27a(2), shall be followed by the department in seeking to enforce the personal liability of a responsible officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The author of the concurring opinion asserts that the instant case will have limited value in light of the differences in statutory language between general revenue provision \u00a7 27a and its predecessor Use Tax Act \u00a7 10(3).

See <em>ante, </em>p 800, n 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">While <em>Slodov </em>eliminated the possibility that an innocent officer who assumes control of a corporation at a time when the corporation has no funds with which to satisfy the tax obligation will be held accountable for corporate tax debt incurred before his employment, it did nothing to cut short the period in which an officer who <em>was </em>in office at the time the debt was incurred may be held liable for that debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-11\"> 1986 PA 58, \u00a7 1, MCL 205.27a; MSA 7.657(27a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
