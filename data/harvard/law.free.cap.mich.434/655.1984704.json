Nearly half a century ago, in <em>Rucker v Michigan Smelting &amp; Refining Co, </em>300 Mich 668; 2 NW2d 808 (1942), this Court held that a subsequent injury sustained under similar circumstances was not compensable because it did not arise \"out of and in the course of employment\u201d within the meaning of the act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this appeal we are asked to extend workers\u2019 compensation coverage to include plaintiff\u2019s automobile accident injuries.

Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">While engaged in defendant Chrysler\u2019s employ on April 1, 1978, plaintiff Corrine Dean suffered a work-related injury when an explosion hurled a piece of metal against her leg. Defendant does not dispute that this injury is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. Plaintiff returned to work around May 19, 1978, and was placed on restricted or favored-work status. Plaintiff did not report to work on June 28, 1978, in order to attend an appointment with her personal physician to review the results of lab tests and receive further treatment in connection with the prior work-related leg injury. While en route from home to her physician\u2019s office plaintiff sustained multiple injuries in a one-car motor vehicle accident in which her car apparently flipped over a concrete barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">In addition to workers\u2019 disability compensation for the workplace leg injury, which is not contested, plaintiff seeks coverage under the act for the injuries sustained in the June 28, 1978, motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A hearing referee found that although \"plaintiff\u2019s injury, while travelling to the doctor\u2019s office [did] not constitute a new compensable injury ... it [was] a consequence of the origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>nal injury and the disability . . . therefore, [was] compensable as resultant therefrom.\u201d The wcab affirmed with modifications not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">Subsequently, a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished per curiam opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finding that <em>Rucker </em>controlled, the Court concluded that the injuries sustained in the automobile accident did not arise out of and in the course of plaintiff\u2019s employment because they were not the direct and natural result of the compensable primary injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s initial application to this Court for leave to appeal was denied. 431 Mich 913 (1988). However, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, and we then granted leave to appeal. 432 Mich 921 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In <em>Rucker, supra, </em>the plaintiff suffered a work-connected injury while in the defendant\u2019s employ and was sent to a doctor who treated the injury. Afterwards, the doctor sent the plaintiff home in a taxicab at the expense of the defendant\u2019s insurer. While en route, the cab was involved in a collision, resulting in an injury to the plaintiff\u2019s eye. In determining whether the accident which occasioned the plaintiff\u2019s eye injury \"arose out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d the <em>Rucker </em>Court stated the general rule that injuries arise out of the employment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">\"[w]hen there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises 'out of\u2019 the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.\u201d [300 Mich 671, quoting <em>Appleford v Kimmel, </em>297 Mich 8, 12; 296 NW 861 (1941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The <em>Rucker </em>Court unanimously held that there was \"no causal connection\u201d between the prior work-related injury and the injury suffered in the taxicab collision. 300 Mich 672 (emphasis added). Although <em>Rucker </em>is virtually indistinguishable, plaintiff in this case urges that <em>Rucker </em>no longer controls. It is claimed that <em>Rucker </em>was overruled by the plurality decision in <em>Whetro v Awkerman, </em>383 Mich 235; 174 NW2d 783 (1970), to the extent that <em>Rucker </em>required a proximate cause between the injury and employment. In <em>Whetro, </em>three members of this Court stated \"that the law in Michigan today no longer requires the establishment of a proximately causal connection between the employment and the injury to entitle a claimant to compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">We reject the argument that <em>Whetro </em>had such an effect with respect to a subsequent injury that occurs away from the workplace. Aside from the fact that the <em>Whetro </em>plurality opinion is not prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>dent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it simply does not address the question of compensability of such a second or subsequent injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><em>Whetro </em>is distinguishable from <em>Rucker </em>on two grounds. First, the <em>Whetro </em>claimant was injured when a tornado destroyed the building <em>\"wherein he was working for his employer </em>. . . <em>.\u201d Id. </em>at 239. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, unlike the employee in <em>Rucker </em>and in this case, the claimant in <em>Whetro </em>was actually engaged in his employer\u2019s business when he was injured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Secondly, <em>Whetro\u2019s </em>focus was not on a second or subsequent injury; rather, the question there was whether the first, and only, injury was compensable. By contrast, the issue in this case, as in <em>Rucker, </em>is whether a second or <em>subsequent </em>injury is compensable. Accordingly, <em>Whetro </em>did not overrule <em>Rucker, </em>expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In his treatise on workmen\u2019s compensation, Professor Larson recognizes that the causation rules applicable to a workplace primary injury are not the same as the causation principles which should apply to a second or subsequent injury that occurs away from the workplace. As Larson explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">A distinction must be observed between causa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>tion rules affecting the primary injury . . . and causation rules that determine how far the range of compensable consequences is carried, once the primary injury is causally connected with the employment. As to the primary injury, it has been shown that the \"arising\u201d test is a unique one quite unrelated to common-law concepts of legal cause, and it will be shown later that the employee\u2019s own contributory negligence is ordinarily not an intervening cause preventing initial compensability. <em>But when the question is whether compensability should be extended to a subsequent injury or aggravation related in some way to the primary injury, the rules that come into play are essentially based upon the concepts of \"direct and natural results,\u201d and of claimant\u2019s own conduct as an independent intervening cause. </em>[1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 13.11, p 3-502. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">\"The basic rule\u201d to be applied to second injury cases according to Professor Larson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">is that a subsequent injury, whether an aggravation of the original injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable <em>if it is the direct and natural result </em>of a compensable primary injury. <em>[Id., </em>p 3-503. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">However, Larson is required to concede that the \"basic rule\u201d is inadequate to justify compensation for most second injuries because, \"in the strict sense, none of the consequential injuries we are concerned with are in the course of employment . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 13.11(d), p 3-542. Thus, Larson finds it \"necessary to contrive\u201d a new \"quasi-course of employment\u201d concept for analyzing the more difficult cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-8\">By this expression [quasi-course of employment] is meant activities undertaken by the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>following upon his injury which, although they take place outside the time and space limits of the employment, and would not be considered employment activities for usual purposes, are nevertheless related to the employment in the sense that they are necessary or reasonable activities that would not have been undertaken but for the compensable injury. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">In further explanation of his \"quasi-course of employment\u201d approach, Larson states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">There is no intention at this point to suggest that the formulation here worked out is drawn from the pronouncements of actual cases. On the contrary, the reported opinions have developed no satisfactory overall analysis of the problem. However, if one looks at the actual holdings, one can find considerable support for the proposition that the pattern of principle here developed is not out of line with the main body of case law on the subject. [Id., p 3-546.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">While it may be true, as the dissent contends, that a tally of the decisions by courts in other jurisdictions would show that a slight majority line up with the approach taken by Professor Larson, that alone could hardly serve as a principled basis for reversal of the rule in <em>Rucker.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>would disregard our duty to construe a statute so as to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. As stated in <em>McKinstry v Valley OB-GYN Clinic, PC, </em>428 Mich 167, 190-191; 405 NW2d 88 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\"In the interpretation of statutes, the legislative will is the all-important or controlling factor. Indeed, it is frequently stated in effect that the intention of the legislature constitutes the law. Accordingly, the primary rule of construction of statutes is to ascertain and declare the intention of the legislature, and to carry such intention into effect to the fullest degree. A construction adopted should not be such as to nullify, destroy, or defeat the intention of the legislature.\u201d [Quoting 73 Am Jur 2d, Statutes, \u00a7 145, p 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">When, over a period of many years, the Legislature has acquiesced in this Court\u2019s construction of a statute, the judicial power to change that interpretation ought to be exercised with great restraint. On more than one occasion our Court has quoted with approval the statement that stare decisis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\"is especially applicable where the construction placed on a statute by previous decisions has been long acquiesced in by the legislature, by its continued use or failure to change the language of the statute so construed, the power to change the law as interpreted being regarded, in such circumstances, as one to be exercised solely by the legislature.\u201d <em>[Consumers Power Co v Muskegon Co, </em>346 Mich 243, 251; 78 NW2d 223 (1956), quoting 21 CJS, Courts, \u00a7 214, pp 388-390. See also <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Clayton Estate, </em>343 Mich 101, 107; 72 NW2d 1 (1955).][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">To the extent that prolonged acquiescence suggests legislative approval of the construction given by this Court to a statutory provision, it is reinforced when the Legislature reenacts the statutory language without change. In <em>Smith v Detroit, </em>388 Mich 637, 650-651; 202 NW2d 300 (1972), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\"><em>\"Even more persuasive is the rule that where the basic provisions of a statute have been construed by the courts and these provisions are subsequently reenacted by the legislature, it may be assumed that the legislature acted with knowledge of the Court\u2019s decisions and that the legislature intended the reenacted statute to carry the Court\u2019s interpretation with it.\u201d </em>[Emphasis in original.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Not only has the Legislature convened many times since <em>Rucker </em>was decided in 1942, but the Legislature on numerous occasions has revised and amended the act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the Legislature has never seen fit to make a substantive change in the \"out of and in the course of employment\u201d requirement, nor has it undermined in any way this Court\u2019s construction and application of that language in <em>Rucker, </em>decided nearly half a century ago.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Moreover, we believe that our decision today is consistent with the intent of the Legislature manifested by its reform efforts during the past decade. A purpose of the comprehensive 1980 and 1981 revisions of the workers\u2019 compensation system<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was to overturn or modify expansive interpretations placed upon the act by this Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the dollar amount of benefits payable to workers eligible for compensation was increased, there can be no doubt that the Legislature also intended through its 1980 and 1981 reform efforts to narrow and restrict the eligibility qualifications.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Against that background, and in light of the fact that the Legislature has never seen fit to disturb the rule in <em>Rucker, </em>we decline to overrule it because we believe that the Legislature intended the result we reach today.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">To hold that <em>Rucker </em>no longer controls the disposition of this case would not only require that we disregard legislative intent but it would have the effect of usurping legislative responsibility in an important respect. When the no-fault system was enacted in 1972, <em>Rucker </em>was the controlling law; it stood for the proposition that a subsequent injury incurred in a motor vehicle accident while en route for treatment of a prior compensable injury was <em>not </em>covered by workers\u2019 compensation. Thus, the Legislature\u2019s allocation of costs as between the no-fault and workers\u2019 compensation systems was made with an awareness<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that the no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>fault insurance system would shoulder the cost of such accidents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Justice Levin\u2019s reasoning in joining to form a majority for the result in <em>McClure v General Motors (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 191, 210; 289 NW2d 631 (1980), which involved an off-premises lunchtime accident, is directly applicable to the instant case. As he then explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">Under the case law extant when the no-fault insurance act was enacted, employers were not generally liable for off-premises lunchtime injuries and thus, under the act, the motor vehicle insurer of the worker or a family member would ordinarily bear the entire cost of motor vehicle injuries during the lunch period. An extension today of worker\u2019s compensation coverage to lunchtime automobile injuries would, because of \u00a7 3109 of the no-fault act, allow the motor vehicle carrier a deduction for worker\u2019s compensation benefits payable and thus work a reallocation, probably unforeseen by the Legislature, of the cost of insurance reparations for such accidents from the no-fault system to the worker\u2019s compensation system. This Court should not disturb the cost allocation extant when the no-fault act was enacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Justice Levin further explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">It is no answer to say that because the purpose of \u00a7 3109 was to reduce the cost of no-fault insurance, a reallocation of the cost of [such] motor vehicle accidents away from the no-fault system furthers the Legislature\u2019s purpose. The legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>decision embodied in \u00a7 3109 may have been based on assumptions regarding the existing costs to the worker\u2019s compensation system that did not include payment for [such] automobile injuries generally. An extension of worker\u2019s compensation liability to [such] automobile injuries not previously covered would impose on that system the greater part of the burden of providing insurance reparations for injuries heretofore compensated through the motor vehicle insurance system. <em>[Id. </em>at 229.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">As in the case of the off-premises lunchtime accident addressed in <em>McClure, </em>overturning <em>Rucker </em>would, for the first time, charge to the workers\u2019 compensation system the cost of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents while en route for treatment of a prior compensable injury. Because <em>Rucker </em>was settled law in 1972 when the no-fault act was passed, the Legislature had no reason to anticipate such an extension of workers\u2019 compensation liability to injuries incurred in a motor vehicle accident otherwise covered by the no-fault act. The result advocated by plaintiff would necessarily work a reallocation of the costs associated with such motor vehicle accidents as between the no-fault and workers\u2019 compensation systems, without clear direction from the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">For these reasons, and on the authority of <em>Rucker, </em>we affirm the decision <em>of </em>the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b863-8\">Riley, C.J., and Levin and Brickley, JJ., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\"> MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-11\">An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-15\"> MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-9\"> We note that a distinction has been made between \"aggravation\u201d of a preexisting compensable injury and a subsequent injury which is distinct from the prior work-related injury.

I would, therefore, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and hold that injuries \"arise[] out of and in the course of employment\u201d when they are the result of reasonable and necessary actions taken because of a previous compensable injury. MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301). Where an individual is injured in an accident occurring while en route to seek medical treatment for a prior compensable injury, the injuries arising out of that accident should be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.

The issue in this appeal calls upon the Court to determine an issue of law. We take the wcab\u2019s findings of fact as conclusive absent fraud. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a728; MCL 418.861; MSA 17.237(861). Those findings indicate that Ms. Dean suffered a compensable injury when she initially injured her right leg<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and her automobile accident occurred while she was en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>route to seek treatment for her initial injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The findings in her decision to seek treatment for her initial injury also indicate that Ms. Dean acted reasonably.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Thus, this Court is left with the task of determining a jural relationship: Given the fact that Ms. Dean was reasonably seeking treatment for a compensable injury when she was injured in an automobile accident, did her subsequent injuries arise out of and in the course of her employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The majority urges that the answer to that question lies in this Court\u2019s 1942 decision in <em>Rucker. </em>As the majority points out, <em>Rucker </em>is almost indistinguishable on its facts from this case. I believe we cannot follow <em>Rucker, </em>however, because that case does not express the law of this state. Though <em>Rucker </em>has remained on the books since 1942, it has been a dead letter for almost two decades because the theories on which that decision was explicitly based have been excised from jurisprudence interpreting the meaning of \"arising out of and in the course of \u201d employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The facts of <em>Rucker </em>are very similar to the facts of this case. Arthur Rucker was injured at work when a pot full of slag struck his leg. His employer sent him to a doctor\u2019s office for treatment. After examination and treatment, the doctor sent Rucker homeward in a taxi, at the expense of the employer\u2019s insurer. On the way home, the taxi in which Rucker rode was involved in an accident which cost Rucker the use of his left eye. He sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>for and was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his automobile accident injuries. This Court, however, reversed that award. In ruling against Mr. Rucker, this Court explicitly relied on three theories. We based our opinion on the \"peculiar and increased street risk rule,\u201d on the \"act of God rule,\u201d and on the notion that to recover disability compensation a worker must prove that an employment-associated risk proximately caused the injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In <em>Rucker, </em>this Court cited <em>Appleford v Kimmel, </em>297 Mich 8; 296 NW 861 (1941), and relied upon that case\u2019s enunciation of a proximate-causation test and the \"peculiar and increased street risk rule.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\"[A]n injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a <em>contributing proximate cause </em>and which comes from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant.\u201d [300 Mich 671, citing <em>Appleford </em>at 12-13. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">We held that there existed \"no causal connection between the leg injury received at the plant and the eye injury received in the taxicab colli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sion. The chain of causation was broken, and the eye injury came 'from a hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment 300 Mich 672, citing <em>Appleford </em>at 12. Because we found that Ruck-er\u2019s job was not a \"contributing proximate cause\u201d of his injury, the risk of a taxicab accident was not peculiar to Rucker\u2019s employment and that the risks of automotive injury were not increased by Rucker\u2019s employment, we held that his eye injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We further based our decision in <em>Rucker </em>on the \"act of God\u201d rule followed in such cases as <em>Thier v Widdifield, </em>210 Mich 355; 178 NW 16 (1920). \"Decision in the instant case is controlled by <em>Thier v Widdi\u00f1eld, </em>. . . where an employee was killed by a stroke of lightning during the course of his employment. This court held in that case, as we must hold here, that the accident was not one 'arising out of\u2019 the employment.\u201d 300 Mich 673. Because Rucker was not \"exposed by the nature of the employment to this particular danger,\u201d we denied benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Proximate cause is no longer the test for compensability under the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. Neither are the \"peculiar and increased street risk\u201d or \"act of God\u201d rules still valid in the state. We should not follow <em>Rucker </em>because <em>Rucker </em>is no longer good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In <em>Whetro v Awkerman, </em>383 Mich 235; 174 NW2d 783 (1970), this Court reviewed the history and purpose of workers\u2019 compensation and found that proximate causation had previously ceased being the appropriate test for determining whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment. The law \"no longer requires the establishment of a proximately causal connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>between the employment and the injury to entitle a claimant to compensation. . . . [I]t can be said today that if the employment is the occasion of the injury, even though not the proximate cause, compensation should be paid.\u201d 383 Mich 242-243. Thus, the causational analysis that formed a basis for our decision in <em>Rucker </em>was explicitly expunged from the law in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Further, it is no longer correct to say, as we did in <em>Rucker, </em>that automobile accident injuries are not compensable if they do not arise out of risks \"peculiar to\u201d a worker\u2019s employment. Michigan law recognizes the compensability of \"street risk\u201d injuries where employment causes an employee to be exposed through work-related travel to an injury-causing risk, even though that risk was not peculiar to the employment. In 1916, this Court held that \"[w]here employees are compelled during the course of their employment to travel about the streets, it does not seem to us to be unreasonable to say that the danger of being struck by street cars, automobiles, and traffic of every description should be taken account of.\u201d <em>Kunze v Detroit Shade Tree Co, </em>192 Mich 435, 438; 158 NW 851 (1916) (compensation was awarded a foreman who was struck by a streetcar while traveling between job sites).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\"><em>Kunze </em>began a long line of cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which hold that \"[i]f, in the discharge of his duties, the employee is required to travel upon the highway or to use other means of transportation, and while so doing, in the performance of a service to his employer, he suffers an accidental injury caused by his so traveling, he is entitled to compensation.\u201d <em>Wilhelm v Angell, Wilhelm &amp; Shreve, </em>252 Mich 648, 652; 234 NW 433 (1931) (compensation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>awarded an architect who was struck by a train while returning home from a work-related meeting).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Although Arthur Rucker\u2019s injuries were caused by risks of the street, this Court found his case to be controlled by an \"act of God\u201d case, <em>Thier v Widdifield.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Rucker </em>at 673. However, the authority of \"act of God\u201d cases ceased in 1970, after this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Whetro. </em>In fact, <em>Whetro </em>explicitly overruled <em>Thier. </em>After <em>Whetro, </em>it is no longer necessary for a worker\u2019s compensation claimant to prove what Arthur Rucker could not establish\u2014 that an injury was proximately caused by a danger arising peculiarly from the nature of the employment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">I would make explicit that the rule announced in <em>Rucker </em>is no longer valid. <em>Cessante ratione legis, cessat et ipsa lex.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To the extent <em>Rucker </em>was not overruled when <em>Whetro </em>overruled <em>Thier, </em>it should be now.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Rucker, </em>should not decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>I agree fully with the majority\u2019s conclusion that controlling precedent, unchanged by the Legislature, should not lightly be amended under the doctrine of stare decisis. I am unconvinced that principles of stare decisis dictate a different result here despite the majority\u2019s argument to the contrary. In pronouncing the demise of the rule announced in <em>Rucker, </em>we would only be making explicit that which had long been implicit. Stare decisis is an important doctrine for promoting consistency in settled principles; it was never intended to resurrect a doctrinal corpse interred, undisturbed, for almost two decades. We have often in the past modified the definition of \"arising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d even in the absence of legislative action, whenever new theories, new developments in the law, or new fact patterns have proven previous decisions to be unworkable, unfair, or anachronistic. See, e.g., <em>Crilly v Ballou, </em>353 Mich 303; 91 NW2d 493 (1958), which changed the law in the state regarding the compensability of injuries caused by horseplay, after noting that the cases upon which the previous rule was based had been overruled and review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ing how the previous rule failed to comport with the principles and policies behind workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Given <em>Rucker\u2019s </em>ceasing authority in this area, I would look to Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation to resolve this case. The majority, too, looks to Professor Larson for guidance but fails to apply Larson\u2019s rules to the facts of this case. The majority ignores the fact that Professor Larson regards injuries like Ms. Dean\u2019s as the paradigmatic example of compensable consequences of work-related injuries.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">According to Professor Larson\u2019s treatise, \"[t]he basic rule is that a subsequent injury, whether an aggravation of the original injury or a new and distinct injury, is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury.\u201d 1 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 13.11, p 3-503. The Court of Appeals adopted Professor Larson\u2019s analysis on this point in <em>Schaefer v Williamston Community Schools, </em>117 Mich App 26; 323 NW2d 577 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">As Professor Larson points out, this \"direct and natural result\u201d rule is easily applied in a variety of circumstances, such as where a worker is further injured by complications from the initial compensable injury, or where a compensable injury exacerbates a preexisting medical condition. In those situations it is easy to characterize the secondary injuries as \"direct and natural results\u201d of compensable injuries. See Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.11(a), (b), pp 3-503 to 3-535. See also <em>Braxton v Chevrolet Grey Iron Foundry Div of General Motors Corp, </em>396 Mich 685; 242 NW2d 420 (1976) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>(aggravation of a preexisting occupational disease is also compensable); <em>Klein v Len H Darling Co, </em>217 Mich 485; 187 NW 400 (1922) (benefits were granted where a worker died of an emotional shock caused by the death of a fellow employee at his hands); <em>Adams v W E Wood Co, </em>203 Mich 673; 169 NW 845 (1918) (reinjury of a compensable broken arm is also compensable when it was caused during the claimant\u2019s travel when returning to work on the company doctor\u2019s advice).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">However, as is evident from our grant order, the facts presented here do not present so clear a case. We must decide whether Ms. Dean\u2019s injuries are a \"direct and natural result\u201d of her workplace injury, despite the lack of a direct causal connection between the first and second injuries. In analyzing this question, I find the \"quasi-course-of-employment\u201d test proposed by Professor Larson persuasive. The majority cites this test and then fails to apply it without explanation and, most significantly, without offering a test or framework to take its place. The best the majority can offer is a forty-year-old case that was conceptually debunked decades ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The quasi-course of employment test incorporates the \"arising out of\u201d and the \"in the course of \u201d tests. It makes compensable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-6\">activities undertaken by the employee following upon his injury which, although they take place outside the time and space limits of the employment, and would not be considered employment activities for usual purposes, are nevertheless related to the employment in the sense that they are necessary or reasonable activities that would not have been undertaken but for the compensable injury. [Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.11(d), p 3-542.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The causal link required in this test is different from that required in tort law. For an injury-subsequent to an on-the-job injury also to be compensable, it is not necessary that employment proximately cause the second injury. However, employment must be more than a \"but for\u201d cause of that second injury. An injury following the initial compensable injury is also compensable when it arises out of activities which are reasonable and necessary in light of the compensable injury. The claimant\u2019s negligence in causing the second injury will not break the chain of causation, but a claimant\u2019s intentional conduct which causes a second injury will where that conduct \"may be regarded as expressly or impliedly prohibited by the employer.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 3-543.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">To apply the quasi-course-of-employment test to Ms. Dean\u2019s case, I take as given that her April 1 injury was compensable,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> her trip to Dr. Ganesh\u2019s office on June 28 was for the purpose of treatment for her work-related injuries,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and her decision to seek Dr. Ganesh\u2019s treatment that day was reasonable in light of those initial injuries.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">In light of these findings, it is for us to decide only whether it is reasonable and necessary for a person in Ms. Dean\u2019s situation to seek medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>treatment for a work-related injury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In other words, we must determine the jural relationship between trips to seek medical attention for compensable injuries and employment in terms of the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">For the following reasons, I would find that a trip to the doctor\u2019s office to seek treatment of a compensable injury is an activity that is reasonable or necessary in light of the initial compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">When Corrine Dean suffered an injury which arose out of and in the course of her employment on April 1, 1978, Chrysler Corporation had a duty to provide her with necessary medical care or reimburse her for her reasonable medical expenses occasioned by that injury. MCL 418.315(1); MSA 17.237(315)(1). This duty was required both by statute and by contract, since the terms of the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute can be said to be incorporated into an employment contract entered into and executed within this state. See <em>Wilson v Doehler-Jarvis, </em>358 Mich 510; 100 NW2d 226 (1960); <em>Thomas v Parker Rust Proof Co, </em>284 Mich 260; 279 NW 504 (1938); <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178; 189 NW 221 (1922). Ms. Dean had the right, under both the statute and her employment contract, to seek medical care on her own if Chrysler failed to provide it. MCL 418.315(1); MSA 17.237(315X1).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Furthermore, Ms. Dean was under a duty imposed by the statute, and hence her employment contract, to seek medical attention in order to mitigate the damages of her April 1 injuries. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172; 312 NW2d 640 (1981). Injured employees have a duty to submit to proper medical and surgical treatment. Any unreasonable refusal to do so will release the employer\u2019s obligation to compensate for a work-related injury. <em>Kolbas </em>v <em>American Boston Mining Co, </em>275 Mich 616; 267 NW 751 (1936); <em>Coombs v Kirsh Co, </em>301 Mich 1; 2 NW2d 897 (1942); <em>Dyer v General Motors Corp, </em>318 Mich 216; 27 NW2d 533 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Thus, Ms. Dean\u2019s trip to a doctor\u2019s office to seek care for her April 1 injuries was both reasonable and necessary in light of those injuries. Given the wcab\u2019s finding that Ms. Dean was en route to Dr. Ganesh\u2019s office for the purpose of treating work-related injuries, I would hold that the injuries resulting from her automobile accident are also compensable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The majority\u2019s holding puts this Court in a clear minority of courts that have addressed this issue. Most courts that have published opinions discussing the compensability of injuries consequential to on-the-job injuries have ruled in favor of a claimant injured en route to seek medical attention for prior injuries.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Professor Larson notes in his treatise at \u00a7 13.13, p 3-564, that \"[w]hen an employee suffers additional injuries because of an accident in the course of a journey to a doctor\u2019s office occasioned by a compensable injury, the additional injuries are generally held compensable . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Professor Larson indicates in his treatise that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\">a fall or automobile accident during a trip to a doctor\u2019s office has usually been considered sufficiently causally related to the employment by the mere fact that a work-connected injury was the cause of the journey, without any necessity for showing that the first injury in some way contributed to the fall or accident. Of course, if the prior injury in any way contributes to the second accident, the case is that much stronger, as when pain or drugs or a weakened member may have played a part. [Larson, supra, \u00a7 13.13, pp 3-567 to 3-569.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Given the board\u2019s finding that Ms. Dean\u2019s trip to Dr. Ganesh\u2019s office on June 28 was for the purpose of \"obtaining] medical treatment for the residuals of an injury received in the course and scope of her employment,\u201d 1987 WCABO 189, the injuries she received in the accident en route to Dr. Ganesh\u2019s office are also compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">I disagree with the separate opinion in dissent favoring a remand to determine whether Ms. Dean\u2019s possible intoxication or some other intentional act on her part may have defeated the causal nexus between the first and second accident. I view the \"intentional intervening act\u201d issue in the quasi-course test as an affirmative defense Chrysler had the duty to plead and prove. I agree with the separate opinion that Chrysler would not be liable under the quasi-course test if it could prove that Ms. Dean intentionally drove while intoxicated, drove recklessly or intentionally caused the accident. However, proof of these sorts of actions have always barred workers from recovering for their injuries. Under MCL 418.305; MSA 17.237(305),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a claimant who intentionally causes an accident is clearly barred from receiving compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Workers whose voluntary intoxication causes their injuries have been denied compensation, cf. <em>Rose v Paper Mills Trucking Co, </em>47 Mich App 1; 209 NW2d 305 (1973), as have been workers injured by their own reckless driving, cf. <em>Day v Gold Star Dairy, 307 </em>Mich 383; 12 NW2d 5 (1943). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>also <em>Fortin v Beaver Coal Co, </em>217 Mich 508; 187 NW 352; 23 ALR 1153 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Under <em>Adkins </em>and <em>Schaefer, supra, </em>it was clear to Chrysler that it could escape liability for a secondary injury by proving that Ms. Dean\u2019s intentional conduct caused her accident. In fact, Chrysler made this argument before the wcab, noting that Ms. Dean received a traffic ticket because of the accident and referencing the accident report\u2019s mention that Ms. Dean might have been drinking. Chrysler has already made and lost the arguments for which the separate opinion in dissent would order a remand. I see no reason to send this case back in order to let Chrysler prove facts it could not or did not prove earlier regarding an accident that happened twelve years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Finally, I address two policy concerns raised by the majority. The majority claims that this Court should follow legislative \"reform efforts\u201d which narrow the category of Michigan workers eligible for workers\u2019 disability compensation. <em>Ante, </em>pp 666-667. Citing Justice Levin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>McClure v General Motors Corp (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 191, 209; 289 NW2d 631 (1980), the majority also argues that we should deny Ms. Dean benefits because the Legislature has determined that her no-fault insurer should bear the risk imposed by Ms. Dean\u2019s automotive excursions to the doctor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">As to the first contention, while it may be true that the current legislative trend is generally to limit the number and types of compensable claims,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> such \"reforms\u201d narrowing entitlements for other, specific categories of injured workers are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>not precedent for the issue before the Court and they do nothing to mitigate our clear duty to construe this remedial statute liberally. See <em>Bower, supra </em>at 191. The clear purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Disability Act is to compensate persons injured on the job. <em>Basil v Butterworth Hosp, </em>272 Mich 439; 262 NW 281 (1935). Therefore, it is this Court\u2019s duty to interpret the act so as to provide compensation to all persons whose injuries can be said to arise out of and in the course of employment, except where the Legislature clearly intends to exclude an employee from the benefits of the act. The majority fails to give effect to legislative intent because it denies compensation to a woman whose injuries are a direct and natural result of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">I also reject the majority\u2019s reliance on Justice Levin\u2019s <em>McClure </em>concurrence for two reasons. First, this argument rests on the assumption that <em>Rucker </em>was good law in 1972, when the no-fault act became law. It was not. I agree with the majority that the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of existing judicial interpretations of workers\u2019 compensation law when it enacted the no-fault act. We can therefore presume that the Legislature was aware that the \"peculiar and increased street risk rule,\u201d the \"act of God rule\u201d and the proximate causation rule upon which <em>Rucker </em>rested were no longer good law. <em>Rucker </em>was as much an anachronism in 1972 as it is today. The majority\u2019s reasoning threatens to atrophy our body of workers\u2019 compensation laws with cases involving automobile accidents decided prior to 1972. When it is clear to the Court and the Legislature that the doctrinal bases of a prior workers\u2019 compensation case are no longer valid, there is absolutely no reason the case should survive simply because it involves an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>accident. By 1970, <em>Rucker </em>was a dead letter, even though it had never been explicitly overruled. The Legislature did not breathe life into it by passing the no-fault laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Second, in advancing this policy argument, the majority would have us fix entitlements in this area, not on the basis of our interpretation of the language of the act, but on our best guess as to how the Legislature intended to allocate risk in this area, despite the clear pronouncement in the no-fault act that no-fault liability shall always be secondary to workers\u2019 compensation liability. Ultimately, the majority opinion requires us to allocate risk in contravention to legislative direction. This Court is precluded from setting workers\u2019 compensation disability policy in this state. <em>Buehler v Univ of Michigan, </em>277 Mich 648; 270 NW 171 (1936). It is our task to take the statute as drafted by the Legislature and construe its language consistent with the legislative intent. We are only following the policy expressed by the Legislature when we construe this act to allow compensation to a worker who has proven the existence of injuries arising out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Furthermore, the majority fails to see that there are important differences between the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act and the no-fault act besides the identity of the risk bearer. The workers\u2019 compensation act is not intended as a substitute for insurance. <em>Rector v Ragnar-Benson, Inc, </em>313 Mich 277; 21 NW2d 129 (1946); <em>Luteran v Ford Motor Co, </em>313 Mich 487; 21 NW2d 825 (1946). Therefore, we cannot believe the converse to be true, particularly where the Legislature has indicated within the language of the no-fault act that a no-fault insurer\u2019s liability is secondary to the liability of a workers\u2019 compensation insurer. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>MCL 500.3109; MSA 24.13109. Even though Ms. Dean is entitled to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits for her injuries, she is not precluded from recovering against her no-fault insurer for benefits her workers\u2019 compensation insurer would not cover. <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164; 289 NW2d 708 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In her automobile accident on June 28, 1978, Corrine Dean suffered injuries which arose out of and in the course of her employment. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board found that Ms. Dean was on her way to her doctor\u2019s office, from whom she was receiving necessary treatment for injuries which she received in a compensable injury on April 1. Ms. Dean\u2019s trip to the doctor\u2019s office was a necessary and reasonable activity which she would not have undertaken but for her April 1 work-related injuries. The Court of Appeals incorrectly relied on <em>Rucker, supra </em>because the legal principles on which <em>Rucker </em>was premised are no longer valid points of law in this state.
