We hold the no-fault insurer has no duty to indemnify the general liability insurer because the landowner\u2019s conduct did not arise from the use of a motor vehicle and was beyond the scope of the no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Shell Oil Company contracted with Ernest E. Kuhns, doing business as Corrosion Control Company, to sandblast pipes. Shell Oil, in turn, contracted with B &amp; L Hotshot, Inc (blh), to deliver pipes to Corrosion Control\u2019s premises, and, after sandblasting, to pick up the sandblasted pipes and return them to Shell.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">On April 10, 1980, Russell Naasko, a blh foreman, and another blh employee drove to Corrosion Control\u2019s premises in a blh boom truck to retrieve the sandblasted pipes. During the loading operation, Naasko held a guideline attached to the pipe being lifted by the boom.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Naasko was injured when the boom came into contact with an overhead electrical power line Consumer\u2019s Power Company maintained on Corrosion Control\u2019s premises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Naasko was severely burned and collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In June 1981, Naasko sued Corrosion Control and Consumer\u2019s Power Company in Kalkaska Circuit Court. Naasko asserted a landowner\u2019s liability claim against Corrosion Control. In his complaint, Naasko alleged that Kuhns ordered the blh employee, who had delivered the pipes to Corrosion Control\u2019s premises, to place them near the power line where they would be sandblasted. Naasko claimed that, by storing the sandblasted pipes near an overhead power line, Corrosion Control created a hazardous work environment. He further alleged that Kuhns knew or should have known that, when blh employees came back to pick up the finished pipes, the boom would come into contact with the overhead power line. Naasko\u2019s wife asserted a loss of consortium claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Celina Mutual Insurance Company, Corrosion Control\u2019s general liability insurer, agreed to defend Corrosion Control and filed an answer on its behalf. The only affirmative defense raised was Naasko\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">In June 1983, six months after mediation, Celina tendered to Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Company, blh\u2019s no-fault motor vehicle insurer, its defense of Corrosion Control. Celina claimed that, through the acts or omissions of Naasko and his co-workers, Corrosion Control became an additional insured under the omnibus clause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Aetna\u2019s no-fault policy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued to blh. Aetna, however, refused to defend Corrosion Control. The following day, which was less than one month before trial, Naasko settled with Corrosion Control for $32,000, which Celina paid._</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Celina, subrogated to any claim Corrosion Control might have against Aetna, then filed the present lawsuit in November 1983. In addition to requesting a declaration that Aetna wrongfully refused to defend Corrosion Control in the underlying suit, Celina sought to recover the $32,000 settlement paid to Naasko and the cost of Corrosion Control\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Both parties moved for summary disposition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal, however, only concerns Aetna\u2019s amended motion for summary disposition in which Aetna claimed that, even if the blh vehicle was insured under its policy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Corrosion Control had no contractual rights under the policy because Naasko\u2019s complaint against Corrosion Control did not state a claim arising out of the use, ownership, or maintenance of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The trial court rejected Aetna\u2019s argument and denied the motion, holding that, even though Naasko\u2019s complaint alleged a landowner\u2019s liability claim, Naasko\u2019s injuries arose from the use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of the omnibus insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>clause<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Aetna\u2019s policy, the trial court concluded that Corrosion Control was an additional insured under Aetna\u2019s liability policy. Consequently, the court held that Naasko\u2019s complaint alleged an injury within the scope of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Aetna appealed, and the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, decided June 23, 1988 (Docket No. 95658). The Court held that Corrosion Control was an additional insured under Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause, and that it was \"using\u201d the boom truck as a motor vehicle when Naasko was injured. The Court, consequently, concluded that Naasko had pled a cause of action within the scope of Aetna\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Aetna subsequently applied for leave to appeal, which we granted to determine whether Aetna is liable to Celina for the costs of Corrosion Control\u2019s defense and the $32,000 settlement Celina paid to Naasko. 432 Mich 892 (1989)._</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Three elements establish prima facie liability coverage under Aetna\u2019s policy. First, the injury must arise from the use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, the tortfeasor must be an insured.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the motor vehicle from which the injury arose must be \"an owned or a temporary substitute\u201d vehicle within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Aetna alleged in its amended motion for summary disposition that, pursuant to MCR 2.116(C) (8), Celina had failed to state a claim for which the law could grant relief because Aetna, as a matter of law, had no duty to indemnify or defend Corrosion Control in Naasko\u2019s suit. A motion for summary disposition brought under MCR 2.116(C)(8) tests the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>Abel v Eli Lilly &amp; Co, </em>418 Mich 311, 323; 343 NW2d 164 (1984), cert den 469 US 833 (1984). For purposes of Aetna\u2019s amended motion for summary disposition, therefore, we assume, without deciding, Celina\u2019s allegation that Naasko\u2019s injuries, as against his employer, arose from the use of the blh boom truck and were otherwise within the scope of Aetna\u2019s policy. Consequently, our task is to determine whether Corrosion Control is an insured under Aetna\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">This Court held in <em>Citizens Ins Co of America v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536; 309 NW2d 174 (1981), that the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq., </em>did not abrogate a nonmotorist defendant\u2019s tort liability even though his negligence caused a motor vehicle accident. Defendant Tuttle\u2019s cow was roaming on a highway when a Zaiger Beverage Company truck struck the cow. Citizens Insurance Company, Zaiger Beverage\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>insurer, paid Zaiger\u2019s no-fault claim for the damage to its truck. Subsequently, Citizens Insurance, subrogated to Zaiger\u2019s claim, sued Tuttle.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">We began our analysis in <em>Tuttle, </em>by examining the language of the section of the no-fault act abrogating tort liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use within this state of a motor vehicle with respect to which the security required by section 3101(3) and (4) was in effect is abolished .... [MCL 500.3135(2); MSA 24.13135(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Subsection (2) addresses tort liability that arises from either a defendant\u2019s wrongful act or failure to act. 411 Mich 544. Only that liability, however, arising from a defendant\u2019s \"ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle\u201d is abrogated. Thus, from the plain and unambiguous statutory language, we concluded that, in order for tort liability to be abrogated, the no-fault act required more than a plaintiff\u2019s injuries having arisen merely from the use of a motor vehicle. The defendant\u2019s wrongful act or omission, upon which his liability was predicated, must also have arisen from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. In addition to the plain and unambiguous statutory language, we also found support for this position in the model no-fault act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the unreasonableness of a contrary construction in light of other sections of the Michigan no-fault act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the act\u2019s policy to eliminate duplicative recoveries and reduce insurance costs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS7\">Because defendant Tuttle was negligent, if at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>all, for the improper keeping of his cow, we concluded that his wrongful act did not arise from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle. The act, consequently, did not abrogate his tort liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">In the instant case, the wrongful act asserted is Tuttle\u2019s improper keeping of his cow. Such a wrongful act does not relate to the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. Tuttle\u2019s tort liability, if any, arose only from his alleged wrongful keeping of the cow, not from the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">Tuttle would have been subject to tort liability for his wrongful keeping of a cow whether it collided with a motor vehicle, trampled a rose garden, or walked through a plate glass window. His tort liability in the instant case no more \"arose from\u201d the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle than it would have \"arisen from\u201d the ownership, maintenance or use of a rose garden or a plate glass window. It arose solely from the wrongful keeping of a cow. [411 Mich 545.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Hence, Tuttle\u2019s conduct was beyond the scope of the no-fault act. His conduct was still subject to tort liability, even though the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s truck arose out of the plaintiff\u2019s use of a motor vehicle and the damage was otherwise compensable under first-party benefits provided by the Citizens Insurance no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The analysis of Celina\u2019s argument that Corrosion Control is an additional insured under Aetna\u2019s policy requires that we revisit the same issue addressed in <em>Tuttle, </em>but from the opposite perspective. Thus, the narrow question presented today is whether Corrosion Control is a motorist defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>whose tort liability falls within the scope of the no-fault act and Aetna\u2019s policy. In light of the policy\u2019s language, the no-fault act, and the principles set forth in <em>Tuttle, </em>we are unpersuaded that Corrosion Control is a motorist defendant because its alleged wrongful act and, hence, its alleged liability, did not arise from the use, ownership, or maintenance of the blh boom truck. Consequently, we hold that Naasko\u2019s injury, as to Corrosion Control, was beyond the scope of Aetna\u2019s liability policy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Corrosion Control, therefore, had no contractual rights under Aetna\u2019s policy, even if Naasko\u2019s claim was false, fraudulent, or groundless.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We first note that the Court of Appeals conclusion of law that Corrosion Control \"used\u201d the blh boom truck is incorrect. An omnibus clause extends liability coverage to a person or organization legally responsible for the use of the named insured\u2019s vehicle. See 12 Couch, Insurance, 2d, \u00a745:291. Although an agency or contractual relationship is not necessary in order for a third party to become an additional insured, <em>id., </em>\u00a745:305, p 638, there must be, at the very least, some type of relationship between the named insured and the party alleged to be an additional insured in order to find that the latter is legally responsible for the use of the named insured\u2019s motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that, within the meaning of Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause, Corrosion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Control was \"using\u201d the blh boom truck when \"[Corrosion Control] had B &amp; L Hotshot use the truck to load and transport the pipes from its premises to a location specified by Shell Oil Company pursuant to the contract entered into between Corrosion Control and Shell Oil Company.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As Aetna correctly points out, however, the only inference that can be fairly drawn from the allegations in Celina\u2019s complaint is that Shell Oil, and not Corrosion Control, was legally responsible for the use of blh\u2019s boom truck when Naasko was injured. In its complaint, Celina specifically pled that blh and Naasko \"were on the Corrosion Control premises pursuant to a contract with Shell Oil to load and deliver pipe which had been sandblasted by Corrosion Control.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In addition, Naasko\u2019s complaint alleged that Corrosion Control ordered blh employees to place the presandblasted pipes near the overhead power line in the first place. Although this allegation standing alone may support a landowner\u2019s liability claim sounding in negligence, when added to Celina\u2019s admission that blh was acting pursuant to a contract with Shell Oil Company, there is simply no basis on this record for concluding Corrosion Control was \"using\u201d the blh boom truck or was otherwise legally responsible for blh\u2019s own use of the truck when Naasko was injured. Therefore, we reject the lower courts\u2019 holdings that Corrosion Control \"used\u201d the blh boom truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">More fundamentally, however, we also reject the lower courts\u2019 conclusions that, without consideration of the underlying nature of its own alleged wrongful conduct, Corrosion Control could become an insured under the policy solely as a result of the acts or omissions of Naasko and blh. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>explained in <em>Tuttle, </em>the no-fault act did not abolish tort liability and impose third-party no-fault compensation merely because an <em>injury </em>happens to arise from the use, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle. What is abolished is <em>tort liability </em>arising from the use, operation, or maintenance of a motor vehicle. Because liability, at the very least, requires a defendant\u2019s wrongful act or failure to act, <em>Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 544, we concluded in <em>Tuttle </em>that the no-fault statute left intact tort liability arising from an act other than the use, ownership, or maintenance of a motor vehicle. Although Naasko\u2019s injuries arguably arose from the use of the blh boom truck, the issue here is whether Naasko\u2019s complaint alleges Corrosion Control\u2019s wrongful conduct, upon which its liability to Naasko is predicated, also arose from the use of the boom truck. We believe it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Nowhere on the face of the complaint does Naasko allege facts indicating that Corrosion Control\u2019s wrongful conduct arose from the use, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle. To be sure, Naasko does allege that his injuries arose from the use of the blh boom truck and that Kuhns created an unsafe work environment by negligently instructing blh employees to place the pipes near the overhead power lines. While these allegations may form a sufficient basis for Naasko to state a prima facie claim for first-party benefits under the policy as against his employer,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it is an insufficient basis to support the legal conclusion that Corrosion Control\u2019s own negligence also arose from the use of the blh boom truck and fell within the scope of Aetna\u2019s no-fault policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Even if we look to the gravamen of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>plaint, we can only conclude that Corrosion Control was negligent, if at all, for directing blh employees to place the pipes near the overhead power lines in the first place. Although the blh boom truck was involved, Corrosion Control\u2019s conduct no more arose , from the use of the blh boom truck than did the defendant\u2019s from the beverage truck in <em>Tuttle. </em>Corrosion Control was negligent, if at all, for the very reason Naasko alleged in his complaint: By ordering the pipes placed near the overhead power line, Corrosion Control failed to maintain a safe workplace. As we stated in <em>Tuttle, </em>in spite of the no-fault act, compensation for injuries nonmotorist defendants cause is still determined by fault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">The no-fault act is a system of compensating injuries and damages incurred in accidents <em>caused by </em>motor vehicles. Compensation is due without regard to fault, and the tort system for adjudicating fault was partially abolished. In the context of the no-fault act, therefore, the abolition of \"tort liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use ... of a motor vehicle\u201d carries the implicit sense of tort liability for injuries or damage <em>caused by </em>the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">Only persons who own, maintain or use motor vehicles can be subject to tort liability for injuries or damage caused by the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. The nonmotorist tortfeasor cannot be subject to tort liability for injuries or damage caused by the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle. The abolition of tort liability for injuries or damage caused by (arising from) the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, therefore, does not abolish the tort liability of the nonmotorist tortfeasor. [411 Mich 545-546. Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Under the plain language of the no-fault act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>our interpretation of the act in <em>Tuttle, </em>therefore, the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct, upon which liability is predicated, must also arise from the use, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle in order for the tortfeasor\u2019s liability to be abolished and for the plaintiff to receive no-fault compensation under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy. Absent this causal link between the plaintiff\u2019s injury and the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct, the no-fault act does not abrogate the tortfeasor\u2019s liability, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to compensation, as against the tortfeasor, is determined only with regard to fault under common-law tort principles. It is precisely this causal link that is missing in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Celina also argues that the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Michigan Mutual Liability Co v Ohio Casualty Ins Co, </em>123 Mich App 688; 333 NW2d 327 (1983), supports its claim that Corrosion Control is an additional insured. Although Celina vigorously contends that it \"stands in the same shoes as Michigan Mutual\u201d and Corrosion Control is as much an additional insured as Uganski Crane &amp; Truck Service, Michigan Mutual\u2019s insured, we are unpersuaded. As the Court of Appeals noted, Uganski\u2019s negligence arose from the act of preparing to tow a Michigan Foundry &amp; Supply Company truck, during which Helmer, a Michigan Foundry employee, was injured. Thus, the Court unanimously concluded Uganski\u2019s negligent use of its own vehicle, in conjunction with the Michigan Foundry truck, could not \"be considered such an independent, intervening, disassociated act that Helmer\u2019s injury did not arise out of or flow from the maintenance or use of the Michigan Foundry truck.\u201d 123 Mich App 696. In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>however, Corrosion Control is clearly a nonmotorist defendant, and its alleged failure to maintain a safe work environment is far different than \"[preparing to tow a disabled or stuck vehicle[,] ... an activity that is identifiable with the maintenance and use of such vehicle and foreseeably necessary.\u201d 123 Mich App 695-696. Thus, we reject Celina\u2019s reliance on <em>Michigan Mutual.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The reasoning and analysis of cases such as <em>Central Mutual Ins Co v Walter, </em>143 Mich App 332; 372 NW2d 542 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 851 (1985), however, does persuade us that Corrosion Control is not an additional insured.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An automobile brought into a service station for repair leaked gasoline onto the station floor. The fuel spread, came into contact with the open flame of a hot water heater located in the service bay, and a fire erupted.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Central Mutual Insurance Company (cmi) insured the premises and settled the property damage claim. Cmi then sued Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, the automobile\u2019s insurer. Cmi\u2019s legal theory was that, since the property damage arose from the use or maintenance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>motor vehicle, the damage fell within the scope of daiie\u2019s property protection clause issued pursuant to MCL 500.3121(1); MSA 24.13121(1).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the trial court agreed with cmi and granted its motion for summary disposition, the Court of Appeals reversed. The Court held that the property damage did not arise from the ownership or maintenance of an automobile within the meaning of \u00a7 3121(1). The Court reasoned that, although proximate causation is not required, a minimal causal connection of some sort must exist between the injury and the defendant\u2019s use, maintenance, ownership, or operation of a motor vehicle. 143 Mich App 336. The Court found support for this proposition from our decision in <em>Tuttle </em>by noting that the property damage resulted from a premises hazard unrelated to the use, maintenance, or operation of a motor vehicle. 143 Mich App 337. As in the present case, the mere fact that a motor vehicle was involved in an incident resulting in bodily injury or property damage is simply not sufficient to bring a claim asserted against a nonmotorist defendant within the scope of a no-fault liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Finally, the conduct of the underlying litigation also persuades us that the parties themselves did not regard Naasko\u2019s claim to fall within the scope of Aetna\u2019s policy. Neither Naasko\u2019s complaint nor Corrosion Control\u2019s answer raised the issue of no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>fault coverage. In addition, Corrosion Control expressly conceded in its trial brief, filed almost two years after Naasko brought suit and nearly one month before trial, that \"[t]he duties owed by Mr. Kuhns to the Plaintiff were strictly limited to those owed by an owner of land to a business invitee.\u201d It was only when Celina was on the verge of settling Naasko\u2019s claim \u2014 nearly six months after mediation and less than one month before trial was scheduled to begin \u2014 that Celina first raised the no-fault issue by tendering its defense to Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In light of the plain and unambiguous language of the no-fault act and our holding in <em>Tuttle, supra, </em>it is clear that, in order for a claim to fall within the scope of the no-fault act and third-party liability policies issued pursuant to the act, an injured plaintiff must show more than that his injuries arose merely from the use, operation, or maintenance of a motor vehicle. Because the act abrogates tort liability arising from the use, operation, or maintenance of a motor vehicle, the defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, which gives rise to that liability, must also arise from the use, operation, or maintenance of a motor vehicle. Since Corrosion Control was negligent, if at all, under a landowner\u2019s liability claim and not from the use, ownership, or maintenance of the blh boom truck, Corrosion Control is a nonmotorist defendant whose tort liability is beyond the scope of the no-fault act and Aetna\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Because Naasko\u2019s complaint failed to allege a claim against Corrosion Control falling within the scope of Aetna\u2019s no-fault policy, Corrosion Control had no rights under Aetna\u2019s policy. We hold, therefore, that Aetna likewise had no duty to indemnify Celina, as Corrosion Control\u2019s subrogee, for the costs of Corrosion Control\u2019s defense or the settlement paid to Naasko.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The Court of Appeals opinion in this case is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-6\">Riley, C.J., and Boyle, J., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\"> The truck had a flat bed with a mounted boom crane.

Although there is nothing wrong with this, his opinion only serves to perpetuate the same flawed analysis that the lower courts employed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The opinion fails to articulate a principled analysis of Aetna\u2019s entire omnibus clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We agree with Justice Brickley\u2019s contention that our task in this case is to interpret a contract of insurance. In this regard, surely no one can dispute that the principles articulated in the no-fault act and case law interpreting the act shed light on the contracting parties\u2019 no-fault insurance agreement. We also agree that the concurring opinion reaches the legally correct result. The opinion, however, rests upon mere conclusory statements without articulating a principled analysis of Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">As the concurring opinion notes, whether Corrosion Control is an additional insured under Aetna\u2019s policy rests upon \"its liability <em>because of </em>[the] acts or omissions\u201d of either Naasko or blh. As the concurring opinion correctly states, \"because of \u201d is not the mere \"but for\u201d causation test commonly found in tort law, but rather, a more narrowly construed concept implying \" 'a relationship connecting the culpable acts of persons using the vehicle to [the] liability of another, who then becomes an \"insured.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>p 311. \"Because of,\u201d at the very least, includes, but surely is not limited to, vicarious liability as defined in tort and agency law. See <em>post, </em>pp 311-312.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Although the concurring opinion attempts to analyze the \"relationship\u201d between Corrosion Control and Naasko, it fails to consider the fact that both Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause and the New York trial court\u2019s interpretation of similar language in <em>Long Island Lighting Co v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co, </em>76 Misc 2d 832; 350 NYS2d 967 (1973), expressly refers to the \"liability\u201d of the alleged additional insured. In Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause, \"liability\u201d precedes \"because of\u201d and refers to the alleged liability of the alleged additional insured: \"(d) any other person or organization but only with respect to his or its <em>liability </em>because of acts or omissions of an Insured under (a), (b) or (c) above.\u201d [Emphasis added.] The court in <em>Long Island Lighting </em>also noted that the \"liability\u201d referred to is that of the alleged additional insured: \" 'The words imply a relationship connecting the culpable acts of persons using the vehicle to [the] <em>liability of another, </em>who then becomes an \"insured.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>p 311 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The ultimate question of the case is whether a sufficient relationship links Naasko\u2019s injuries to Corrosion Control\u2019s alleged liability within the meaning of Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause. As the omnibus clause itself clearly indicates, one factor included in the analysis of this relationship is Corrosion Control\u2019s alleged liability. The issue that the concurring opinion fails to resolve in a principled analysis concerns the scope of this relationship: what \"liability\u201d does Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause refer to? As the court in <em>Long Island Lighting </em>correctly noted, the parties to a third-party liability no-fault contract do not \" 'demonstrate[ ] [an] intent to deem as an \"insured\u201d just any party whose own separate negligence, apart from the vehicle, was a contributor to an accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>p 312. As the court aptly stated, any other result or interpretation of the no-fault contract would be \" 'bizarre.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The concurring opinion essentially rests upon the New York trial court\u2019s observation, albeit a correct one, that it would be \"bizarre\u201d to conclude that Corrosion Control is an additional insured under Aet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>na\u2019s policy where its alleged liability arose from a premises hazard unrelated to the use of the blh boom truck. In contrast, we have attempted to provide a principled analysis and rational explanation supporting the proposition that the parties to a no-fault insurance contract, absent a contrary agreement, did not intend to extend third-party liability coverage to individuals or organizations like Corrosion Control, \" 'whose own separate negligence, apart from the vehicle, was a contributor to an accident.\u2019 \u201d See <em>post, </em>p 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Thus, although it may be true, it is wholly inadequate to rest upon the conclusion that \"Corrosion Control, if it is indeed liable at all, is liable because of its own negligence . . . [and] not 'because of \u2019 Naasko\u2019s acts or omissions . . . .\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 312. The undisputed fact is that if Corrosion Control\u2019s <em>own </em>alleged negligence and resultant liability did arise out of the use of the blh boom truck, Corrosion Control would fall within Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause. It is this precise limitation upon the conduct of third-parties, which the parties to the no-fault contract have agreed, that the concurring opinion fails to analyze. It is for this reason that, within the meaning of Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause, the requisite relationship linking Corrosion Control\u2019s alleged liability to Naasko\u2019s injuries is missing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b500-7\">Brickley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aao\">(concurring). The argument made by Celina, which was accepted by the Court of Appeals, is that Corrosion Control is an additional insured under \u00a7 n(d) of the no-fault policy issued by Aetna, and that coverage for Naasko\u2019s injuries otherwise exists under the policy. We agree with the lead opinion\u2019s characterization that \"our task is to determine whether Corrosion Control is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>insured under Aetna\u2019s policy.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The lead opinion, we believe, takes the wrong route to answer that question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this reason, we are compelled to write separately, even though we agree with the lead opinion\u2019s ultimate conclusion \u2014 that Corrosion Control is not covered under Aetna\u2019s policy. In our judgment, it is ill advised to create new law to resolve a contractual dispute when the case can be simply resolved by interpreting the contract itself. In particular, we find that the lead opinion\u2019s extension of <em>Citizens Ins Co of America v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536; 309 NW2d 174 (1981), is unnecessary and invites confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We prefer to follow the lead of <em>Long Island Lighting Co v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co, </em>76 Misc 2d 832; 350 NYS2d 967 (1973), a case cited by neither party. <em>Long Island Lighting Co </em>features a policy substantially identical to Aetna\u2019s, a strikingly similar set of facts, and a more legally responsive approach to the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The lead opinion correctly observes that <em>Tuttle </em>focused on tort liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Tuttle, </em>we held that the owner of a cow which wandered onto a road and was hit by a truck could not claim the immunity from tort liability granted in the no-fault act because the liability of the cow\u2019s owner did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>arise from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The lead opinion states that Corrosion Control\u2019s wrongful conduct did not arise from the use of the boom truck.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The conclusion then drawn in the lead opinion is, in our view, somewhat strained. The lead opinion contends that because Corrosion Control\u2019s negligence did not arise from the use of the boom truck, coverage under Aetna\u2019s no-fault policy is unavailable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">There are, we believe, several problems with this analysis. First, <em>Tuttle </em>involved solely a question of statutory interpretation \u2014 did the liability of the cow\u2019s owner arise from the operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle for purposes of statutory immunity from tort liability? Our goal in that case, as in every case involving the interpretation of a statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was to discern the intent of the Legislature. <em>Tuttle, supra, </em>pp 544-546. By contrast, we are asked in this case to determine whether particular acts and omissions are covered by a particular insurance contract. As we explained in <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich 208, 217; 444 NW2d 803 (1989), the considerations we bring to bear on matters of statutory construction and contract interpretation are not identical. Unless a further link in the lead opinion\u2019s argument is provided to support the conclusion that, in the no-fault context, established principles of insurance contract interpretation are not applicable, we cannot accept the conclusion that <em>Tuttle </em>controls the outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In addition, the analysis we conducted in <em>Tuttle </em>is simply not necessary in this case. In <em>Tuttle, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>were required to determine whether the cow owner\u2019s tort liability arose from the operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle in order to decide whether his tort liability had been abrogated. In the instant case, our task of determining whether the operation of Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause renders Corrosion Control an \"additional insured\u201d does not require us to embark upon the same inquiry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The lead opinion, however, relies on <em>Tuttle </em>to manufacture a rule of law which would restrict the coverage provided under \u00a7n(d) of Aetna\u2019s policy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to motorist defendants whose wrongful acts arise from the operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Clearly, no such requirement is incorporated in the omnibus clause itself. Nor is the reading of the lead opinion\u2019s \"motorist defendant\u201d requirement into the contract justified by some other contractual provision of Aetna\u2019s policy. Moreover, unlike the situation presented in <em>Tuttle, </em>there appears to be no statutory provision obviously applicable to the instant case which would support the engrafting of the motorist-defendant requirement onto Aetna\u2019s omnibus clause. Simply put, the lead opinion has rewritten Aetna\u2019s policy to make it say something that it does not.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In our judgment, the argument that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">[b]ecause the act abrogates tort liability arising from the use, operation, or maintenance of a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tor vehicle, the defendant\u2019s [insured\u2019s?] wrongful conduct, which gives rise to that liability, must also arise from the use, operation, or maintenance of a motor vehicle.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">need not be made and is misleading. If Aetna is required to defend and indemnify Corrosion Control, it is not because of any statutory limitation on tort liability, but rather because Corrosion Control is covered under Aetna\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Upon inspection of Aetna\u2019s policy, we conclude that the following requirements must be satisfied in order for Corrosion Control, the indemnitee, to be covered by the motor vehicle owner\u2019s insurer (Aetna).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> First, the indemnitee must be an insured under Aetna\u2019s policy. Second, the covered injuries or damage must be caused by an occurrence. Third, the injuries or damage must arise out of the operation, maintenance, or use, including loading or unloading, of an automobile. Fourth, the automobile must be an owned or temporary substitute automobile. In resolving the coverage question, we need look no further than the first requirement, which is not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Under \u00a7 n(c)(2) of Aetna\u2019s policy, Naasko qualifies as an insured because he was using the boom truck during loading and was an employee of the named insured, B&amp;L Hotshot, Inc. Section n(d) provides that any other person or organization which becomes liable because of the acts or omissions of an insured under \u00a7ii(c) is also an insured. Thus, Celina contends, Corrosion Control is liable <em>because of </em>the acts of Naasko, who was \u00e1n insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>under \u00a7ii(c); Corrosion Control, argues Celina, is therefore also an insured. In our view, however, the interpretation of the words \"because of\u201d suggested by Celina and the Court of Appeals below is too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We would adopt, instead, the analysis of this issue in <em>Long Island Lighting, supra. </em>In that case, a truck operator named McGovern was electrocuted when a boom on the truck touched a high-tension wire maintained by defendant Long Island Lighting Company (lilco). Lilco, like Celina, sought to claim coverage under an automobile insurance policy issued to the owner of the truck. Like Celina, lilco argued that its liability arose \"because of\u201d the acts of McGovern and that it was, therefore, an additional insured under the policy. In rejecting lilco\u2019s claim, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">Lilco rests its case on a broad construction of the words in section n(d), \"liability because of acts or omissions of an insured under (a), (b) or (c) above.\u201d It contends any organization is insured with respect to its liability occasioned <em>because of </em>acts or omissions of an insured. Says lilco, in effect, \"McGovern\u2019s employee, an insured, drove the truck into the wires, and therefore his act led in sequence to the accident and resulting claim against lilco.\u201d This position is that \"but for\u201d McGovern\u2019s acts there would have been no loading, no accident, no lilco liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">However, the court believes that there is a more circumscribed meaning to \"because of\u201d than merely being a sequential link in the chain of events. The words imply a relationship connecting the culpable acts of persons using the vehicle to liability of another, who then becomes an \"insured.\u201d The phrase appears to include persons or organizations held in by way of vicarious liability or derelictions of McGovern, its employees, or a consensual user of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>There is no demonstrated <em>intent </em>to deem as an \"insured\u201d just any party whose own separate negligence, apart from the vehicle, was a contributor to an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">The end result under lilco\u2019s interpretation would be bizarre. A wholly negligent instrumentality in an accident causing injury to a McGovern employee would then become an \"insured\u201d under McGovern\u2019s own policy simply because an employee\u2019s totally faultless act was one sequential factor out of many events leading to an accident. Every person encountering McGovern\u2019s staff would then potentially be an \"insured.\u201d A negligent contractor leaving a pothole in the road, a property owner poorly lighting an area, a party who improperly marks off a hazard, would all become \"insured\u201d under lilco\u2019s attempted construction when the McGovern car, however innocently driven, met disaster upon their encounter. The end result is too odd to accept. Some rule of reason must accompany the semantic exercises. <em>[Long Island Lighting Co, supra, </em>pp 836-837. Additional emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">To this analysis we would add the observation that Corrosion Control, if it is indeed liable at all, is liable because of its own negligence, not because it must answer vicariously for the acts of Naasko. If Naasko were to succeed in recovering a tort judgment from Corrosion Control, it would be incumbent on Naasko to demonstrate that Corrosion Control\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of his damages. Thus, Corrosion Control would not be liable unless it were shown that Corrosion Control\u2019s liability arose not \"because of\u201d Naasko\u2019s acts or omissions, but \"because of \u201d its own acts or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that Corrosion Control is not an insured under Aetna\u2019s policy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>that Celina\u2019s claim therefore fails.
