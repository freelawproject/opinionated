We granted leave to appeal to determine whether the trial court properly admitted the disputed expert testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">A. <em>PEOPLE v BECKLEY</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Defendant, Robert Lee Beckley, was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for having sexual intercourse with his fifteen-year-old daughter. At the time of the incident, the victim had been living with her father; her parents were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">She testified that on the evening of May 29, 1983, her father returned home, under the influence of alcohol,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, while watching television, defendant began rubbing her back. Thereafter he gave her several \"French kiss[es].\u201d A short time later, defendant called his daughter into his bedroom and requested that she \"lay down with him for a while.\u201d The victim was pulled onto the bed, at which time defendant removed her clothing while holding her arm and had vaginal intercourse with her. Following the incident, defendant made her promise not to tell anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">According to the victim, the incident lasted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>about ten minutes after which she got out of bed, picked up her clothing and went to the bathroom where she washed and dressed. She made two phone calls to her mother relaying that her father had made passes at her, but withholding information as to the intercourse. During the first phone call, the victim refused her mother\u2019s request to pick her up. Yet, immediately thereafter she called her mother again and asked to be picked up. She was waiting outside when her mother arrived and they went to her paternal grandmother\u2019s home. The mother and grandmother discussed defendant\u2019s advances without mention of the intercourse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">A few days later, the victim, accompanied by her grandmother, made a trip to defendant\u2019s home so that she could pick up her belongings. On the trip, Wilda Beckley, testified that the victim said, \" 'By the way, Grandma, that mess the other night, ... I made a mountain out of a molehill. . . . My dad didn\u2019t do anything to me.\u2019 \u201d The victim denied making such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The act of intercourse was not revealed until approximately one year later when the victim wrote about the incident in a journal for a high school English assignment. According to the victim, during the interim year she had told some of her friends about the passes, but had continued to deny that any intercourse had taken place. Apparently, the only person she told about the entire incident was her boyfriend. Further during the one-year time period between the incident and disclosure, she continued to see her father on various occasions. However, the victim and her father were never alone together._</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Defendant affirmatively denies having sexual intercourse with his daughter. However, he admits that he \"French\u201d kissed her and that he called her to join him in bed. However, as he explained to his daughter, the incident was merely a game to see if his daughter was sexually active. Thus, defendant\u2019s version of the facts was substantially the same as the victim\u2019s up until the time of the journal entry which disclosed sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The victim was the first witness called by the prosecution to testify. On cross-examination, the defense tried to discredit the victim\u2019s allegations by suggesting that the complainant\u2019s behavior was inconsistent with a person who had been victimized. Four specific items of behavior of the complainant were brought out on cross-examination: (1) the delayed disclosure, (2) the medium of disclosure, (3) the complainant\u2019s continued desire to see the alleged offender, and, (4) the victim\u2019s initial tendency to deny sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Following testimony by the victim, the prosecution sought permission to call Robin Smietanka as an expert witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court qualified Ms. Smietanka as an expert pursuant to <em>People v </em>Stull, 127 Mich App 14; 338 NW2d 403 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the court limited the testimony to the victim\u2019s behavior observed by the expert which would be consistent with the profile of an incest victim. The court specifically stated that it would disallow any testimony concerning the complainant\u2019s credibility and whether or not any sexual assault had actually taken place. Further the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>court allowed the prosecution to present the expert testimony in its case in chief because \"it . . . appealed] that defendant would raise these issues by attack on the credibility of the complainant . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Ms. Smietanka testified that the bulk of psychiatric literature suggests that victims of sexual abuse exhibit certain patterns of behavior that are indicators of the abuse. Specifically, she commented on the four instances of behavior observed in the complainant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On direct examination, Ms. Smietanka testified that the delayed disclosure, disclosure to a third party outside the family, continual contact with the offender, and initial reporting of only \"passes\u201d are all typical behavioral characteristics of a victim of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">On cross-examination the defense also centered its questioning on the victim\u2019s lack of memory about conversations with persons concerning the incident. Ms. Smietanka testified that such inconsistencies were not necessarily indicative of a lie, but of an attempt on the part of the victim to minimize the event. Thus they were not inconsistent with behavioral patterns of sexually abused persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Defense counsel drew out the fact that the complainant\u2019s parents had gone through a bitter divorce, that the complainant\u2019s mother was very vindictive, and that within days preceding the journal entry defendant had hurt complainant\u2019s feelings. Ms. Smietanka testified that these factors would be significant; however, \"[t]he additional factors that you have asked about would certainly need to be explored, but just based on what you said, it would not rule out a sexual abuse.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b895-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>On redirect examination, the prosecutor tried to draw out those indicators that the expert thought would support a finding of sexual abuse. The expert responded that the following behavioral patterns would also be indicators of abuse: (1) the child\u2019s ability to recount any pattern of activity which would demonstrate that the incident was not an isolated event; (2) a progression of actual sexual activity; (3) a tendency towards secrecy; (4) exertion of pressure or coercion, i.e., threats as a result of the victim disclosing or attempting to disclose the event; and (5) the child\u2019s ability to give explicit details of the sexual activity. Thus, the examination of this witness was no longer limited to the four specific behavioral characteristics originally attacked by defendant on cross-examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">On recross-examination the defense again tried to emphasize that the symptoms exhibited could be from another source. For example, whether or not school trouble could be the result of some other problem in the child\u2019s life. Ms. Smietanka testified that it would be less likely to see school trouble as a symptom of sexual abuse. However, she did suggest that many of the same symptoms seen in a child of sexual abuse could be seen when the parents are divorcing.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Following the testimony, the defendant moved for a mistrial or to strike the testimony. The ground upon which the defense relied was that the witness\u2019 testimony enhanced the credibility of the witness to the extent that she supported what the complainant was relating about the ultimate question in the case. The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s .motion on the ground that the scope of the witness\u2019 testimony was widened by defense counsel rather than by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"AS8\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\n<em>B. PEOPLE v BADOUR</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Defendant\u2019s conviction arises out of an incident involving her six-year-old daughter. Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct on an aiding and abetting theory and sentenced to thirty to sixty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The victim accused her mother of holding down her arms and legs and forcing her to perform fellatio on defendant\u2019s live-in boyfriend, Roy Erving. The incident came to the attention of the authorities when the victim was locked out of her home during January, 1985. It was at this time that she was placed in foster care. Initially, only Roy Erving was accused and it was not until June, 1985, that the victim raised allegations against her mother. This occurred when the victim began counseling at Lutheran Child and Family Services, during a group session called \"Daughters United.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, the psychologist to whom the victim made the allegations contacted a counselor at the Department of Social Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The defendant has generally denied the allegations raised against her. In November, 1984, she moved out of the house that she and Roy shared for six years. Thereafter, defendant had ceased to have any type of relationship with Roy and argued that therefore there would be no reason for her to allow him to perform sexual acts on her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The prosecution\u2019s first witness was Lynn Butter-field, a psychologist employed by Lutheran Child and Family Services. The trial court certified Ms. Butterfield as an expert over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>On direct examination, Ms. Butterfield gave testimony relating to sexually abused children generally, as well as an opinion relating specifically to observable behavior of the complainant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">On cross-examination defense counsel tried to elicit testimony that would suggest that the \"symptoms\u201d that the victim was experiencing were the direct result of being placed in foster care. Further, that she was lying in an attempt to get back at her mother and Roy for breaking up. In response, Ms. Butterfield testified that placing a child into a new setting could produce feelings of fear, lack of trust, and anxiety. As to the question about whether or not the victim was lying, Ms. Butterfield stated that such a conclusion could not be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">On redirect examination the prosecutor brought out testimony as to whether or not children had the ability to invent sexual acts. In response Ms. Butterfield testified generally that children basically have no knowledge of sexual acts and therefore there is no way a child could invent a specific sexual act without experiencing it. However, she qualified the answer, stating that much of what a child knows or is able to relate concerning sexual acts depends on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The prosecution called a second expert, Dr. Shinedling, over defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court limited Dr. Shinedling\u2019s testimony to the behavior patterns of children who were sexually abused. However, the court prohibited \"syndrome type\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> testimony and any expert opinion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>whether or not the victim had been sexually assaulted. Dr. Shinedling testified as to the type of test that he generally gives children to determine their developmental level. Dr. Shinedling also testified as to what expectations a person could have when dealing with a child and their precision as to dates and sequences of events. Specifically Dr. Shinedling stated that children are very imprecise and have a hard time conceptualizing days, weeks, or months.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Consistent with Ms. Butterfield\u2019s testimony, Dr. Shinedling testified that a child who had not experienced a sexual act typically could not fabricate the story. He qualified the statement by suggesting that the ability to fabricate would depend on the age of the child. However, sexually inexperienced children would tend to view a sexual act as something other than what it actually was. Concerning a sexually abused child\u2019s disclosure patterns, he stated that it was rare for a sexually abused child to volunteer any information.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Thereafter, Dr. Shinedling testified regarding the tests he had specifically given the victim. The only conclusion that Dr. Shinedling drew, in terms of an opinion, were about the victim\u2019s intelligence level. He suggested that the victim was borderline dull to normal range of intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The Court of Appeals upheld the admissibility of the expert testimony in both cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Beckley, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">A rape counselor\u2019s testimony is admissible, un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>der established precedent, for the narrow purpose of rebutting an inference that a complainant\u2019s postincident behavior was inconsistent with that of an actual victim of sexual abuse, incest or rape, A cautionary instruction must be given to the jury. The evidence herein fits squarely into these categories. [161 Mich App 120, 129; 409 NW2d 759 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The <em>Badour </em>panel ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because Ms. Butterfield did not testify regarding \"rape trauma syndrome.\u201d Rather, she testified merely regarding a child\u2019s behavior following an alleged incident of sexual abuse. 167 Mich App 186, 196; 421 NW2d 624 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The common arguments in each case, raised by defendants in this Court, attack the admissibility of the expert testimony on the following grounds: (1) the testimony is unreliable because it fails to meet the <em>Davis/Frye</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test; (2) the testimony of each expert amounted to an opinion as to the truthfulness and credibility of the complaining witness; and (3) the testimony was unfairly prejudicial. The prosecution has responded, arguing first that the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test is inapplicable because the expert testimony in each case did not involve techniques, instruments, or a specific scientific method of a technical nature. Further, the evidence was properly admitted pursuant to MRE 702 governing admission of expert testimony. Defen-, dant in <em>Badour </em>raises two additional arguments: (1) that the expert was not qualified to give an opinion on the basis of the \" 'indicia\u2019 of a sexually abused child,\u201d and (2) that the expert testimony concerning the complainant\u2019s identification of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>fendant was inadmissible hearsay.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Conversely, the prosecutor in <em>Badour </em>argued that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the particular witness had sufficient training and education to be treated as an expert for purposes of rendering an opinion in this case. The prosecutor asserts in response to defendant\u2019s hearsay argument that the evidence was not offered for the truth of the allegations, but to show why the child was originally undergoing counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Because \"syndrome\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> evidence as it relates to child abuse cases is a relatively new development in the law and novel to our Court, we begin our analysis with an examination of the law of other jurisdictions. The division among the courts of the nation as to the admissibility of \"syndrome\u201d evidence in child abuse cases has spawned various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>theories of admissibility ranging from admission of syndrome evidence generally-, including an opinion on the specific behaviors of the child victim, to admission of testimony only as to a specific behavior associated with the syndrome. Because syndrome evidence is not necessarily probative of abuse,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the trend among the various jurisdictions is to admit the evidence of behavioral patterns of sexually abused children only as rebuttal or rehabilitative evidence. Even the most liberal of the theories for admitting the evidence does not allow admission as substantive evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\"><em>State v Kim, </em>64 Hawaii 598; 645 P2d 1330 (1982), has adopted the most liberal approach to admissibility. In <em>Kim, </em>the defendant was convicted of second-degree rape of his thirteen-year-old stepdaughter. After informing her mother, the complainant was taken for a medical examination. The examiner was Dr. Mann, a pediatrician and child psychiatrist. At trial, the defense attempted to impeach the complainant\u2019s credibility. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>after the trial court ruled that the defendant had placed the complainant\u2019s credibility at issue and therefore expert testimony was admissible for rebuttal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Dr. Mann was allowed to testify concerning evidence of the syndrome generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">On appeal, after announcing the general rule that the jury is the sole judge of credibility, the court ruled that any danger that the jury would surrender its function is diminished if the testimony remains consistent with its specific purpose. The <em>Kim </em>court allowed Dr. Mann to testify with respect to this particular complainant. In fact, he opined that he found the victim\u2019s account \"believable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Further, the <em>Kim </em>court specifically required that all information on which the syndrome was premised must be submitted to the jury for its assessment. It reasoned that such information was necessary to \"enable the jury to evaluate the mode as well as conclusions of the expert . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">The court in <em>Kim </em>recognized that there were dangers in allowing syndrome testimony. The dangers that the court identified were that the expert may usurp the jury\u2019s function, a battle of the experts may result, and there may be an invasion of the victim\u2019s privacy. However, the ultimate ruling of the court was that the value of evidence outweighed any of these dangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The continuum of expert testimony for rehabilitative purposes runs from the approach adopted in <em>Kim </em>to a more conservative approach where testimony is allowed only on specific behavioral instances to which the defendant has opened the door in an attempt to discredit the victim\u2019s testimony. This conservative approach permits syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>drome testimony only with respect to the specific characteristics that the defendant has attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In <em>People v Bowker, </em>203 Cal App 3d 385; 249 Cal Rptr 886 (1988), the California court applied this approach to test the admissibility of syndrome-type evidence. The court ruled that because syndrome evidence could be misconstrued as a predictor of child abuse, testimony of an expert should be limited to popular \"myths\u201d which would have an effect on the jury\u2019s consideration as to the credibility of the witness. The use of expert testimony was also limited to rebuttal evidence following an attack by the defendant on the complainant\u2019s credibility. The court ruled that the evidence must be targeted at a specific \"myth\u201d and gave examples of the appropriate use of the testimony. It stated that if the misconception were disclosure, the prosecutor\u2019s evidence would be designed to show that delayed reporting is not inconsistent with child sexual abuse. Further, recantation was another myth which the court specifically gave as an example of how the testimony could be used on rebuttal. One further limitation was placed on the use of such information. The court stated that \"[bjeyond the tailoring of the evidence itself, the jury must be instructed simply and directly that the expert\u2019s testimony is not intended and should not be used to determine whether the victim\u2019s molestation claim is true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. The instruction is intended to protect against the misapplication of the evidence as a diagnostic tool to determine that the complainant is a victim of child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Between <em>Kim, </em>which allows syndrome evidence generally, an evaluation of the child victim characteristics, and an opinion on the believability of the victim, and <em>Bowker, </em>which allows testimony concerning only those specific characteristics attacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and no vouching, is a middle ground which allows the expert to testify in general terms as to any and all behavior patterns that are seemingly inconsistent with crime victims generally.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The only common factor where courts have accepted some use of syndrome evidence, is that the evidence is admissible only to rehabilitate the victim\u2019s testimony. However, each case differs with regard to the limitations placed on the use of the rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">We find that the rebuttal limitation as expressed by the majority of jurisdictions is the preferable approach. Although similar to the conservative theory announced in <em>Bowker, </em>we find that the Court of Appeals in <em>Beckley </em>best describes what the rule should be in Michigan. Accordingly we would hold that evidence of behavioral patterns of sexually abused children is admissible \"for the narrow purpose of rebutting an inference that a complainant\u2019s postincident behavior was inconsistent with that of an actual victim of sexual abuse, incest or rape.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, for reasons that will be more fully developed below, we would hold that only those aspects of \"child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome,\u201d which specifically relate to the particular behaviors which become an issue in the case are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In Michigan, MRE 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">If the court determines that recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Admissibility under this rule requires that the evidence comply with a three-part test. First, the expert himself must be qualified. Second, the evidence must serve to give the trier of fact a better understanding of the evidence or assist in determining a fact in issue. Finally, the evidence must be from a recognized discipline. The determination of whether a witness is qualified to render an expert opinion rests within the discretion of the trial court. Such a determination will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">We turn first to an examination of the credentials of the experts who testified in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">MRE 702 defines an expert in general terms, and expertise can be satisfied by a wide array of qualifications. A witness is qualified as an expert by virtue of knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education in a pertinent field. \"[WJithin the scope of the rule are not only experts in the strictest sense of the word, . . . but also the large group sometimes called 'skilled\u2019 witnesses . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In cases involving sexual abuse of children, expert testimony has been presented by physicians,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> crisis counselors,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> social workers,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> police officers,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and psychologists.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The study of child sexual abuse is an emerging, if not well-defined, specialized field of human behavior. Not all psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers will qualify to give expert testimony on the subject. However, in <em>Jenkins v United States, </em>113 US App DC 300; 307 F2d 637 (1962), the court held that lack of a medical degree does not automatically disqualify a witness from rendering an expert opinion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Further, the <em>Jenkins </em>court noted that what was determinative was the nature and extent of knowledge and actual experience, not the claim to the title \"psychologist.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See also <em>Croda v Sarnacki, </em>414 Mich 882; 332 NW2d 712 (1982), rev\u2019g 106 Mich App 51; 307 NW2d 728 (1981). Further, Michigan endorses a broad application of the requirements for qualifying an expert. <em>Dudek v Popp, </em>373 Mich 300, 306; 129 NW2d 393 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Robin Zollar Smietanka, the expert in <em>Beckley, </em>is a certified social worker.

Her counseling primarily includes victims of child sexual abuse and victims of incest. Her active caseload in this area began in 1976, and she testified that she has counseled somewhere between 1200 and 1500 child victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Lynn Butterfield, an expert in <em>Badour, </em>is a family counselor at Lutheran Child and Family Services. She earned a Bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and a Master\u2019s degree in counseling psychology.

Further, he is licensed to practice psychology in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">It is clear from the record, that the experts herein have the appropriate educational background as well as extensive firsthand experience with sexually abused children. Accordingly, the trial court in qualifying each individual as an expert, did not, in our view, abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">In addition to assessing a witness\u2019 qualifications, the trial judge must also make a determination as to the relevancy of the evidence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The general test of relevancy is whether the evidence has a tendency to render any fact more probable than it would without the evidence. However, a more specific test is applied to expert testimony. Expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>testimony is relevant and therefore admissible if it \"assistfs] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0T\">This Court has applied the standard announced in MRE 702 as early as 1874 where Justice Campbell wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">[Expert] testimony is not desirable in any case where the jury can get along without it; and is only admitted from necessity, and then only when it is likely to be of some value. <em>[People v Morrigan, </em>29 Mich 4, 8 (1874).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The test applied in <em>Morrigan </em>was further defined by this Court in <em>People v Zimmerman, </em>385 Mich 417, 427; 189 NW2d 259 (1971). The <em>Zimmerman </em>Court stated that necessity constitutes the essential factor in determining admissibility. However, basing admission of expert testimony on \"need\u201d has been criticized,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and more recently this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>has stated that the proper standard to be applied is helpfulness to the jury. See <em>People v Smith, </em>425 Mich 98; 387 NW2d 814 (1986). \"Generally, the testimony must assist the jury in understanding the evidence or the factual issues, and the witness must have sufficient qualifications 'as to make it appear that his opinion or inference will probably aid the trier in the search for truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 106 (citations omitted). The <em>Smith </em>Court quoted the advisory note to FRE 702 for guidance in applying the evidentiary rule which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-6\">\"Whether the situation is a proper one for the use of expert testimony is to be determined on the basis of assisting the trier. 'There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Id. </em>Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Advocates of the use of expert testimony in sexual assault cases suggest that without expert testimony jurors cannot properly assess an individual\u2019s reaction to a sexual assault.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> A victim\u2019s reactions to a sexual assault, especially if the assailant is a family member, are unique to the particular crime. This uniqueness puts the evidence beyond the jury\u2019s ability to properly evaluate the facts in issue absent expert testimony.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Further, there is general agreement among ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>perts that reactions of a victim of sexual assault vary quite significantly from those of a victim of the \"average\u201d crime.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The findings of professional research suggest that there are many seemingly inconsistent responses to the trauma of the incident which require some form of explanation. Further, there is considerable authority suggesting that society has a prevailing distrust of the female who complains of rape.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This historical distrust of the female complainant is nullified a bit when dealing with child sexual abuse; however, such distrust is not eliminated. It is not surprising that jurors would be skeptical about a child\u2019s complaint of sexual abuse because of a child\u2019s susceptibility to external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>influences.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Further, there seems to be a prevalent view that children fantasize about sexual acts. Another possible misconception concerning the child victim is the belief that when a child suffers an injury it will be reported immediately. However, postponement of disclosure is readily viewed by experts as consistent with the behavioral patterns of a child who has been sexually abused. Other suggested misconceptions are that sex offenders are always strangers and that physical injury will almost always result from the incident.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Given the possibility of these misconceptions, it would be helpful and appropriate to allow expert testimony in child sexual abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Additionally, the evidence is relevant and helpful to a jury because of the nature of the crime. In most criminal sexual conduct cases there are no nonparticipant witnesses to the crime, which reduces the cases to weighing the defendant\u2019s credibility against that of the victim\u2019s.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Even more important is the fact that, at least in <em>Badour, </em>we are dealing with a child of tender years. Generally, children of such a young age will have difficulty on the witness stand, and therefore their credibility may easily be attacked by the defense. Further, given the fact that disclosure in child sexual abuse cases is generally delayed because of coercion, guilt, or some other reason, there will be no physical evidence to corroborate the victim\u2019s allegations. Therefore we hold that expert testimony will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>under certain circumstances, assist the jury in understanding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The final inquiry under MRE 702 is whether the testimony is derived from a \"recognized scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge . . . .\u201d Defendants do not argue, nor do we suggest, that the mental health discipline is not a recognized field of specialized knowledge. It is undeniable that there is an emerging cadre of social and behavioral scientists and clinicians who specialize in the treatment and the study of the victims of child sexual abuse. It would further deny reality not to recognize this field of practice and study. However, defendants do object to any expert testimony based on child sexual abuse syndrome because there is no fixed syndrome which is recognized by the profession.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus it is urged upon us that when the subject of the expert testimony is child sexual abuse syndrome, the reliability of the evidence should be examined under the principles of the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Although not specifically mentioned in the evidentiary rule, the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test has been en-grafted by case law to determine whether a novel scientific principle or technique is \"recognized\u201d within the relevant scientific community. It is a test whereby the trial court, in determining admissibility, judges the reliability of the scientific principle or technique as a threshold matter. The foundational requirement for admissibility under the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test is that the proponent of the evidence must show that the scientific principle or technique has gained such general acceptance within the scientific community as to render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>technique or principle reliable. Further, general scientific acceptability must be established by disinterested scientists.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The <em>Davis/Frye </em>test restricts the admissibility of relevant evidence on the basis of general scientific acceptance to ensure that a jury is not relying on unproven and ultimately unsound scientific methods. Further, it protects against the jury being overcome by the aura of the expert\u2019s testimony about the results or the inferences drawn from the testing procedure. The <em>Davis/Frye </em>test seeks to ensure that the jury is the ultimate factfinder and that it will not \"abandon its responsibility to decide the critical issues and simply adopt the judgment of the expert [because of] an inability to accurately appraise the validity of the underlying science.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATq\">Although the <em>Frye </em>test has been criticized by commentators, this Court reaffirmed its application in <em>People v </em>Young, 418 Mich 1; 340 NW2d 805 (1983).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The <em>Davis/Frye </em>test has been applied in Michigan to various scientific devices and techniques;<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> however, as a general rule, the <em>Davis/ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Frye </em>test has not been applied to behavioral sciences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">Psychologists, when called as experts, do not talk about things or objects; they talk about people. They do not dehumanize people with whom they deal by treating them as objects composed of interacting biological systems. Rather, they speak of the whole person.[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Thus, it is difficult to fit the behavioral professions within the application and definition of <em>Davis/ Frye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">This principle is best illustrated by the admissibility of a psychiatrist\u2019s testimony in a criminal trial on the issue of insanity. See, e.g., <em>People v Martin, </em>386 Mich 407, 421; 192 NW2d 215 (1971). In <em>Martin, </em>we recognized that the \"field of human medicine\u201d has a limited use as evidence in a criminal trial because it lacks reliability. However, we did not exclude the evidence, nor did we submit the evidence to scrutiny under the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The ultimate testimony received on syndrome evidence is really only an opinion of the expert based on collective clinical observations of a class of victims. Further, the issues and the testimony solicited from experts are not so complicated that jurors will not be able to understand the \"technical\u201d details. The experts in each case are merely outlining probable responses to a traumatic event. It is clearly within the realm of all human experience to expect that a person would react to a traumatic event and that such reactions would not be consistent or predictable in all persons. Finally, there is a fundamental difference between techniques and procedures based on chemical, biological, or other physical sciences as contrasted with theories and assumptions that are based on the behavioral sciences.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We would hold that so long as the purpose of the evidence is merely to offer an explanation for certain behavior, the <em>Davis/Frye </em>test is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Having set forth the standards governing admissibility of the testimony, we turn now to the limitations on its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The use of expert testimony in the prosecution of criminal sexual conduct cases is not an ordinary situation.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Given the nature of the offense and the terrible consequences of a miscalculation \u2014 the consequences when an individual, on many occasions a family member, is falsely accused of one of society\u2019s most heinous offenses, or, conversely, when one who commits such a crime would go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>unpunished and a possible reoccurrence of the act would go unprevented \u2014 appropriate safeguards are necessary. To a jury recognizing the awesome dilemma of whom to believe, an expert will often represent the only seemingly objective source, offering it a much sought-after hook on which to hang its hat. Therefore admissibility of expert testimony, under the limitations set forth in this opinion, is an effort to accommodate the uniqueness of the child victim\u2019s reactions while at the same time avoiding undue reliance on such testimony. The expert testimony offered is based at best on an inexact scientific foundation, and therefore the evidence is only admissible when a victim\u2019s behavior becomes an issue in the case.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We note first that child sexual abuse syndrome evidence is essentially a therapeutic tool. The syndrome is merely \"umbrella terminology\u201d which serves only to define the broad range of <em>possible </em>physical, psychological, and emotional reactions that a child victim could potentially experience.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Its purpose is to provide \"a 'common language\u2019 for the professionals working to protect sexually abused children.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> It is not intended as a diagnostic tool for detection of sexual abuse. Thus, it has no probative value in terms of being able to detect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sexual abuse on the basis of the existence of certain behavioral characteristics.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The existence of the syndrome assumes the presence of abuse and merely seeks to explain an individual child\u2019s reaction to it. For example, in <em>People v Gray, </em>187 Cal App 3d 213; 231 Cal Rptr 658 (1986), a child psychologist testified that the syndrome itself could not be diagnosed or tested, but rather was an attempt on the part of psychologists to identify traits and characteristics of child sexual abuse. Similarly, Justice Benke, concurring in <em>People v Bowker, supra, </em>defined syndrome as \"nothing more than a set of symptoms which tend to occur together\u201d but which do not resolve the question whether abuse occurred. 203 Cal App 3d 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Admitting evidence that a syndrome exists can be prejudicial to a defendant because the experts are in general agreement that there is no single specific set of characteristics that can be attributed to every individual in diagnosing child sexual abuse.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Within the group of sexually abused children there is a significant variation among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>factors that can be observed and diagnosed. \"There is no single effect that has been observed in all children. Whether there is some unique and specific effect of sexual abuse is unknown.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Therefore, what the expert and the practitioner must look for are certain behavioral patterns of the victim in a given case that are representative of sexually abused children generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Indeed, the evidence has a very limited use and should be admitted cautiously because of the danger of permitting an inference that as a result of certain behavior sexual abuse in fact occurred, when evidence of the syndrome is not a conclusive finding of abuse. Although syndrome evidence may be appropriate as a tool for purposes of treatment, we would hold that it is unreliable as an indicator of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">As reliability diminishes, the prejudicial effect of the evidence increases. Evidence, although relevant, is excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>MRE 403.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Accordingly, we would hold that the admissibility of syndrome evidence is limited to a description of the uniqueness of a specific behavior brought out at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In keeping with the purpose for which the evidence is admissible (i.e., to provide background data relevant to an evaluation of this victim\u2019s behavior), the party offering the testimony must identify the specific behavior or statement at issue in the case. Further, because there is no fixed syndrome<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> that collectively defines the profile of the typical child who has been sexually abused, expert testimony must be tailored individually to each particular behavior at issue in the case. Expert testimony is only admissible to cast light on the individual behaviors observed in the complainant, therefore the expert must not render an opinion that a particular behavior or a set of behaviors observed in the complainant indicates that sexual assault in fact occurred. We note that generally effective cross-examination will prevent the jury from drawing such a conclusion; however, a limiting instruction may also be necessary and should be given on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Once qualified to give an expert opinion, MRE 702 does not limit the scope of the expert\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>mony. However, \"[t]he expert must be an expert in the precise problem as to which he undertakes to testify.\u201d <em>Zimmerman, supra </em>at 453 (Adams, J., separate opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">A person qualifies as an expert under the scientific study of behavior when there is \"mastery of a specialized field of knowledge about a group of either children who have been sexually misused, or adults who have sexually misused children.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In this light, the expertise of the witness does not center upon the complainant in any individual case. Rather, the expertise of the testifying expert concerns only whether the specific behavior at issue is commonly or uncommonly associated with sexually abused children as a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">We emphasize that the purpose of allowing expert testimony in these kinds of cases is to give the jury a framework of possible alternatives for the behaviors of the victim at issue in the case in relation to the class of abuse victims. In this respect, the expert\u2019s role is to provide sufficient background information about each individual behavior at issue which will help the jury to dispel any popular misconception commonly associated with the demonstrated reaction. Thus to assist the jury in understanding the unique reactions of victims of sexual assault, the testimony should be limited to whether the behavior of this particular victim is common to the class of reported child abuse victims. The expert\u2019s evaluation of the individual behavior traits at issue is not centered on what was observed in this victim, but rather whether the behavioral sciences recognize this behavior as being a common reaction to a unique criminal act. Therefore we would hold that because a witness qualifies as an expert because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>knowledge and experience in dealing with others who have been abused, and not on the basis of an examination of the particular victim, the expert\u2019s testimony should be confined to an explanation of the behavior traits at issue, as defined by the science that forms the basis of the expertise. This rule does not preclude a party from questioning an expert regarding the expert\u2019s familiarity or understanding of the victim\u2019s behavior at issue. Further, the expert is allowed to define the victim\u2019s behavior in terms of the factual background that may have a relationship to those aspects of the victim\u2019s behavior which become evidence in the case. However, an expert cannot introduce new facts based on personal observations of the complainant unless the evidence would be otherwise admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We also note that MRE 704 provides that the opinion provided by the expert can \"embrace! ] an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-6\">Nevertheless, there is a meaningful distinction between expert testimony that a particular child was sexually abused, and expert testimony that a child demonstrates behaviors commonly observed in the class of sexually abused children. In the latter case, the expert does not offer a direct opinion on the ultimate question of whether abuse occurred.[<footnotemark>57</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Therefore, any testimony about the truthfulness of this victim\u2019s allegations against the defendant would he improper because its underlying purpose would be to enhance the credibility of the witness. To hold otherwise would allow the expert to be seen not only as possessing specialized knowledge in terms of behavioral characteristics generally associated with the class of victims, but to possess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>some specialized knowledge for discerning the truth. \"Psychologists and psychiatrists are not, and do not claim to be, experts at discerning truth. Psychiatrists are trained to accept facts provided by their patients, not to act as judges of patients\u2019 credibility.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">It was for similar reasons that we limited the use of psychological evidence in <em>People v LaLone, </em>432 Mich 103, 109; 437 NW2d 611 (1989). In <em>LaLone, </em>we tested whether hearsay statements regarding the identity of the perpetrator of a crime were admissible under the MRE 803(4) hearsay exception. The witness in <em>LaLone </em>was a psychologist who \"treat[ed] mental and emotional disorders rather than physical ones.\u201d Evidence is admissible under MRE 804(3) because of its reliability, i.e., patients normally do not fabricate with regard to the cause of an injury or when they may have pain. The statements made to a doctor are cloaked with a sense of reliability because accuracy is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Further, we noted that those in the mental health profession generally work with statements that are both true and untrue in diagnosing and treating a patient for a mental disorder. Mental health professionals generally only receive information from the patient. They start with the basic assumption that the history they receive is what the patient believes to be the truth, not necessarily what actually is the truth. Thus, in <em>LaLone, </em>we ruled that statements made to a psychologist were less reliable than those made to a physician and were not within the specific language of the rule which allows evidence of information necessary for medical treatment or medical diagnosis._</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Accordingly, we find that appropriate expert testimony is limited to providing the jury with background information, relevant to the specific aspect of the child\u2019s conduct at issue, which it could not otherwise bring to its evaluation of the child\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We caution that to permit the expert witness to render a legal conclusion regarding whether abuse in fact occurred, exceeds the scope of the rule. The conclusion whether abuse occurred is outside the scope of expertise, and therefore not a proper subject for expert testimony. The jury must make its own determination from the totality of the evidence whether the complainant was sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">\"It should be kept in mind that those who write about sexual abuse of children are normally child advocates who research and write with the paramount goal of protecting abused children.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Given the abhorrence of the crime, it is inevitable that those who treat a child victim will have an emotional inclination toward protecting the child victim. The expert who treats a child victim may lose some objectivity concerning a particular case. Therefore to avoid the pitfall of the treating professional being inclined to give an opinion regarding whether the complaining witness had been sexually abused, we caution the trial court to carefully scrutinize the treating professional\u2019s ability to aid the trier of fact when exercising discretion in qualifying such an expert witness.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">In <em>Beckley, </em>the trial judge specifically stated that the prosecution could present expert testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>mony because \"it . . . appealed] that defendant would raise these issues by attack on the credibility of the complainant . . . Also, the trial court limited the testimony to whether any of the behaviors observed in the victim were consistent with the profile of an incest victim. The trial court took great care to limit the expert testimony offered to only those aspects of the victim\u2019s behaviors that were relevant to the case and to minimize the prejudice to defendant. Therefore, we would hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by allowing expert testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Because the \"profile\u201d of this victim included only four specific responses to the alleged incident, the trial judge accordingly limited the expert\u2019s testimony. Although the expert\u2019s testimony was limited, on cross-examination, redirect examination and recross examination the testimony went beyond the scope of the appropriate limitation. The net result of Ms. Smietanka\u2019s testimony was exposure of the jury to a wide range of behavioral characteristics attributed to the \"syndrome\u201d generally. However, Ms. Smietanka did not specifically testify with regard to the \"syndrome,\u201d but rather spoke only in terms of general behavioral patterns. Further, the word syndrome was not used, nor was there any mention of definitional behaviors commonly associated with child sexual abuse syndrome. Thus the jury was not left with the impression that there exists a collective set of behaviors attributable to sexually abused children. In this light, Ms. Smietanka continued to be objective and was acting in an advisory role.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Additionally we note that Ms. Smietanka, as the treating professional, was allowed to give an opinion as to the particular child victim. Specifically, on cross-examination she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>Q. </em>Is there anything that is in fact inconsistent with sexual abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-4\"><em>A. </em>Yes. There are some things that are very inconsistent with sexual abuse, and those are indicators that you look for when you are doing an initial diagnosis to set up a treatment plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\"><em>Q. </em>I see. Are any of those things that you\u2019ve seen in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\"><em>A. </em>In this case I have not seen things that would lead me to believe that this particular child was not sexually abused. I have seen things that would lead me to believe that, given the set of experiences and the circumstances, that they would fit the criteria for someone who has been sexually abused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">This is an example of a line of questioning which, on direct examination, would be inappropriate. However, it was defense counsel who opened the door to this line of questioning and who elicited this response from the testifying expert. Defendant\u2019s question was direct, and he left open the possibility that the expert would respond negatively and in a manner that could be construed as an expert conclusion with regard to the truthfulness of the victim\u2019s allegations. On direct examination, similar testimony crosses the line of acceptability, yet in this case reversal is not required in view of the fact that the response was brought out by defendant. Defendant cannot now complain that the expert\u2019s testimony served to vouch for the complainant\u2019s credibility when he allowed and in fact drew out the response. To hold otherwise would allow defendant an appellate parachute to escape conviction because of damaging testimony that turns the tide toward the believability of the complainant\u2019s allegations. Although we would hold that it is only appropriate to allow a background explanation of the behaviors at issue, the increased scope of the testimony under the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>this case did not prejudice defendant; thus, reversal is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Accordingly, in <em>Beckley, </em>we would affirm the rulings of the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In <em>Badour </em>the trial court disallowed testimony concerning the \"fixed syndrome\u201d as a predictor of sexual abuse because it lacks sufficient scientific reliability. However, the trial judge ruled \"that an expert, on their [sic] own experience, and training, and knowledge, can make observations and give . . . their conclusions about those observations, even to the degree that, in their opinion, these children, or this child, showed indicia of being sexually abused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Unlike <em>Beckley, </em>the trial court in <em>Badour </em>was not sensitive to the need to restrict the expert\u2019s testimony and failed to address the purpose for which the evidence was admitted. The trial court allowed expert testimony without consideration regarding whether the behaviors of this victim were an issue in the case. Further, the trial court made no determination as to whether the evidence would be helpful to rebut any inference that would necessarily result when the complainant\u2019s post-incident behavior became an issue in the case. We do note that the trial judge did not have an opportunity to exercise discretion in this area because the expert was the first witness called to testify. Even so, the net effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling was to allow the expert to give testimony beyond that necessary to help the jury to understand the victim\u2019s behavior. The testimony was not limited to background information; thus, the expert\u2019s role was heightened from that of advisor to one of advocate. The consequences of the ruling were to allow the expert to vouch for the complainant\u2019s credibility which left the jury with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>impression that, in the expert\u2019s opinion, the victim had in fact been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Because the testimony in <em>Badour </em>exceeded the scope of the rules announced, we would reverse and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">On the basis of the origins, the purpose, and the limitations of the so-called child sexual abuse syndrome, we are unwilling to have such evidence introduced as a scientific tool, standing on its own merits as a doctrine or bench mark for determining causality in child sexual abuse cases. However, we think, as do so many jurisdictions who have grappled with the phenomenon, that behavior attributed to the syndrome has a place in expert evidence jurisprudence in child sexual abuse cases. There has developed a body of knowledge and experience about the symptomatology of child abuse victimization. We therefore conclude and would hold that persons otherwise properly qualified as experts in dealing with sexually abused children should be permitted to rely on their own experience and their knowledge of the experience of others to rebut an inference that specific behavioral patterns attributed to the victim are not uncharacteristic of the class of child sexual abuse victims.

Further, the underlying pathological process must be recognized as a disorder within a standard diagnostic manual. The symptom pattern is not assigned the label of a diagnosis, but rather, the symptom pattern is evidence of the underlying pathological process to which it is causally connected. For these reasons, it is not medically proper to diagnose the existence of a syndrome.

Its conclusions will depend on (1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the state of knowledge presently existing about the subject of the proposed testimony and (2) on the court\u2019s appraisal of the facts of the case. [3 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 702(02), p 702-18.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Thus, the proper resolution of these cases begins with relevancy. Relevancy exists only as a relation between an item of evidence and a matter properly provable in the case. The kind of fact to which proof may properly be directed is a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action. MRE 401. \"The fact to be proved may be ultimate, intermediate, or evidentiary.\u201d 1 Weinstein &amp; Berger, <em>supra, </em>pp 401-3 through 401-4. However, as the advisory committee to the federal rules stated, \"The fact to which the evidence is directed need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>not be in dispute.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 401-4. Thus, evidence which is not related to a proposition such as the elements of the claim or crime that must be proved (the consequential fact), may be \"admitted for other purposes including: to establish background information, [or] to evaluate the credibility of a witness . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 401[05], p 401-29.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">In these instances, the test is not whether the proffered evidence tends to prove or disprove any consequential fact, but rather whether the evidence will aid the court or jury in determining the probative value of other evidence offered to affect the probability of the existence of a consequential fact. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The lead opinion recognizes that expert testimony will assist the jury in evaluating the testimony of the child witness, noting various \"misconceptions\u201d about a child\u2019s behavior following sexual abuse and that sexual abuse prosecutions often amount to a credibility contest between the victim and the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the lead opinion erroneously characterizes expert testimony in these cases as \"rebuttal\u201d or \"rehabilitative]\u201d evidence <em>(ante, </em>p 710), going so far as to say it is never admissible as \"substantive\u201d evidence. What the lead opinion seems to mean is that it is not admissible with regard to the issue of guilt, a proposition with which I agree. However, when credibility is an issue in the case, then expert testimony addressing that issue is admissible if it will assist the jury, and it is substantive evidence. Thus, numerous jurisdictions allow the use of expert testimony to assist the jury in evaluating credibility, without reference to rehabilitation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>rebuttal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basic relevancy/helpfulness principles suggest the appropriate limitations on expert testimony in child abuse cases. First, the testimony is not admissible where offered to prove that the act occurred because experts have no demonstrated ability to reliably make such a determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, an expert may not evaluate the credibility of the complainant; as the majority notes, psychologists are not qualified to judge veracity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the expert\u2019s testimony is admissible to assist the factfinder in its evaluation of credibility._</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>If, as the lead opinion finds, it is clear that expert testimony is frequently helpful in evaluating the credibility of a child sexual abuse complainant, it should be equally clear that its usefulness can become apparent in a variety of ways, Inferences arising from common myths or misconceptions may arise from sources such as a mother\u2019s statement that shows delayed reporting, a foster parent\u2019s recital of seductive behavior, or a teacher\u2019s revelation of sexual activity by the child victim with other children. Where there is no physical corroboration of a young child\u2019s accusation, credibility is uniquely critical; where the testimony is halting or without affect, memory and testimonial competence are in question; where the offender and the parent have separated, there may be an inference that the child is a pawn in the adult dispute; if the offender and the parent remain together, an argument may be advanced that the accusations are motivated by the child\u2019s having been disciplined for poor school work, rebelliousness, or sexual activity. As review of the hundreds of cases before us on application for leave to appeal evidences, the relevance and helpfulness of such testimony to the credibility question may become apparent at preliminary examination, during discovery, at pretrial motions, in the case in chief, or from the defendant\u2019s proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The lead opinion\u2019s inclination to limit the specificity of the expert\u2019s testimony is founded on a misapprehension of the nature and purpose of expert testimony in general. The lead opinion emphasizes that \"the expertise of the witness does not center upon the complainant in any individual case,\u201d and reasons that \"because a witness quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>fies as an expert because of knowledge and experience in dealing with others who have been abused, and not on the basis of an examination of the particular victim, the expert\u2019s testimony should be confined to an explanation of the behavior traits at issue, as defined by the science that forms the basis of the expertise.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The theme, not explicitly stated, is that since the expertise of the expert stems from general knowledge and not from knowledge of the particular case, the expert\u2019s testimony should focus on generalities and not on the case at hand. However, it is typically true of any expert that expertise is derived from general experience or knowledge, rather than from experience or knowledge concerning the facts of the case in which the expert is qualified. Yet that does not preclude the expert from applying general principles or knowledge to the facts at hand. Indeed, it is the ability to do so which distinguishes an expert from a lay witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-4\">An observer is qualified to testify because he has firsthand knowledge of the situation or transaction at issue. The expert has something different to contribute. This is the power to draw inferences from the facts which a jury would not be competent to draw. [McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 13, p 33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Thus, I would not relegate the expert to a role which is merely advisory. I would permit the expert to testify that the particular child\u2019s behavior is consistent with behavioral characteristics observed in children assumed to have been abused. The limitation suggested by the lead opinion\u2019s reasoning is inconsistent with its own finding that expert testimony in child abuse cases is admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>to help the factfinder, since the jury will presumably be most helped by an expert who is allowed to apply expert knowledge to the case at hand. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit observed in <em>United States v Azure, </em>801 F2d 336, 340 (CA 8, 1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">[The doctor] might have aided the jurors without usurping their exclusive function by generally testifying about a child\u2019s ability to separate truth from fantasy, by summarizing the medical evidence and expressing his opinion as to whether it was consistent with [the victim\u2019s] story that she was sexually abused, or perhaps by discussing various patterns of consistency in the stories of child sexual abuse victims and comparing those patterns with patterns in [the victim\u2019s] story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The lead opinion\u2019s formulation, and to an even greater extent the dissent\u2019s, would impose on the expert a variation of the sterile inquiry previously imposed on character testimony, where the witness will be qualified and then answer one or two sanitized questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In sum, I would hold that an expert should not be permitted to appropriate the jury\u2019s function by testifying that a child witness is truthful. Nor may the behavioral expert in a child abuse case testify on the basis of behavior for the purpose of establishing that a sexual abuse occurred. An expert witness may testify in child sexual abuse cases where the expert\u2019s testimony would assist the factfinder in evaluating the child\u2019s credibility. The expert may testify on a sufficient foundation that the child\u2019s behavior is consistent with the behavior of other children who have allegedly been assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">It is the province of the trial court to weigh against the necessity for expert testimony the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>inherent dangers of such testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A given case may present an unwarranted potential for the trier of fact to be overly impressed with the expert merely because of the expert\u2019s status, for the trier of fact to assume that the expert is vouching for the credibility of the child witness even when that is not the case, or that there is too great a danger that the jury will become distracted from its principal mission by a battle between experts. These are the familiar claims of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time that may lead the trial court, in its discretion, to conclude that the danger associated with the admission of expert testimony outweighs its probative value so that the evidence must be limited or excluded altogether pursuant to MRE 403. Where expert testimony is admitted, the trial court on request should give a limiting instruction to the effect that the testimony may be used to aid in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, but that it should not be used to determine whether sexual abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s result in <em>Badour, </em>but briefly address why reversal is compelled. I would reverse because the defendant objected to the testimony on the ground that it was offered to show that the child had been abused, and the testimony revealed that the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in offering it was simply to show that the child had been abused and that the defendant had participated in it. The defendant later raised a question regarding the victim\u2019s motive in testifying that might have made the evidence helpful on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>issue of credibility and specifically declined a limiting instruction. The prosecution made no affirmative use of the testimony in argument. Ordinarily reversal would not be warranted in these circumstances. Here, however, in view of the halting and incomplete testimony of the victim and the fact that the expert testimony was directed not only to the question whether abuse had occurred but to the defendant\u2019s participation in it, I cannot conclude that the trial did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Beckley, by contrast, demonstrates a near-perfect model for proper procedure in the use of such evidence. Following a pretrial hearing, the trial court held that it \"would appear that the defense intends to raise the issue of whether an incest victim would have acted as the complainant did . . . .\u201d The expert, Robin Zollar Smietanka, was to be allowed to testify whether she saw anything in the complainant which was inconsistent with the profile of an incest victim. She was specifically precluded from testifying that she thought the complainant was telling the truth or whether in fact the complainant had been an incest victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Robin Smietanka\u2019s testimony on direct examination that the complainant\u2019s behaviors were typical of a child who had been sexually abused was properly admissible to aid the jury in evaluating the credibility of the witnesses. In <em>Beckley, </em>the helpfulness of expert testimony in evaluating credibility became apparent in the pretrial motion and from the defendant\u2019s opening statement. The complainant\u2019s seemingly unusual behavior was revealed on direct examination of the complainant and was the subject of attack on cross-examination. Smietanka\u2019s conclusion that the complainant\u2019s behavior was consistent with sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>was properly admissible to assist the factfinder in evaluating whether the victim\u2019s behavior was indicative of falsehood. While the expert testified on redirect examination to what she called \"victim symptoms\u201d which had not been put at issue by examination of the complainant, her testimony was nevertheless relevant and proper, since it was responsive to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination. <em>State v Myers, supra, </em>pp 611-612. The jury in <em>Beckley </em>was instructed that it was not to consider the expert\u2019s testimony as bearing on whether the complainant had in fact been an incest victim. Credibility was at issue, and a proper limiting instruction was given. There was no error in Robin Smietanka\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">I concur in the express limitations on expert testimony which the lead opinion articulates: that the expert may not render an opinion that sexual abuse occurred or vouch for the credibility of the child witness. Yet the lead opinion seems uncomfortable in its conclusion, on one hand suggesting that because the expert\u2019s qualifications derive from general knowledge and not from knowledge of the case in which the expert is qualified the focus of the expert\u2019s testimony should remain general, while explicitly holding that the expert may testify regarding \"familiarity or understanding of the victim\u2019s behavior at issue.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">I would hold that where aspects of a child\u2019s behavior create credibility issues about which a qualified expert is prepared to testify, the expert\u2019s testimony is admissible if the trial court determines that it will aid the factfinder, so long as the expert does not render an opinion that sexual abuse occurred or vouch for the credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>child witness.

Conclusive physical evidence is available only in a minority of cases, <em>id., </em>p 151, leaving as a basis for \"diagnosis\u201d the child\u2019s statements and behaviors. The difficulty here, however, is that the behaviors identified with sexual abuse may be caused by stresses other than sexual abuse. <em>Id., </em>p 143; de Young, <em>A conceptual model for judging the truthfulness of a young child\u2019s allegation of sexual abuse, </em>56 Am J Orthopsychiatry 550, 555 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\"><em> </em>Those who deal with sexually abused children readily admit that judging the veracity of a child who complains of sexual abuse is a problem within the mental health profession.

The difficulty of the problem is attested to by the profusion of articles addressing the question of how to assess the truthfulness of a child\u2019s accusation of sexual abuse.

Consequently, the expert\u2019s testimony is limited to an explanation of the complainant\u2019s specific postincident behavior traits that have been challenged as being inconsistent with those of known sexual abuse victims. In addition, the expert is precluded from stating an opinion that the complainant was sexually abused. Finally, the jury must be instructed as to the limited purpose for which the expert\u2019s testimony is offered. Because the lead opinion would permit an expert to refer to the complainant in this particular case and does not limit the expert\u2019s testimony to a discussion of the specific postincident behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>traits at issue without reference to the complainant or the specific facts of this case, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In California, the very state to which this Court looks for guidance in this case, experts testifying as to syndrome evidence must confine their remarks to the class of child abuse victims in general. <em>People v Roscoe, </em>168 Cal App 3d 1093; 215 Cal Rptr 45 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the court in <em>People v Bowker, </em>203 Cal App 3d 385; 249 Cal Rptr 886 (1988), rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that syndrome evidence is admissible so long as the expert does not testify that the complainant in the case before the court has been abused, even the prosecution conceded that, whenever syndrome evidence is admissible, the expert\u2019s testimony must be confined to the general class of child sexual abuse victims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument only height<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ens this tension. Relying largely on <em>People v Roscoe, supra, </em>168 Cal App 3d 1093, he asserts the sole effect of <em>[People </em>v] <em>Bledsoe </em>[36 Cal 3d 236; 203 Cal Rptr 450; 681 P2d 291 (1984)] as applied to [child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome] evidence is to prohibit experts from testifying that the particular victim was abused. He contends the same testimony is admissible as long as the expert\u2019s remarks are confined to the class of abuse victims in general. <em>(Roscoe, supra, </em>168 Cal App 3d 1099-1100.) In our view, however, this argument misconstrues the rationale underlying <em>Bledsoe </em>and reads <em>Roscoe </em>far too broadly. The Supreme Court cannot have intended the <em>Bledsoe </em>exception to give with one hand what had been previously taken away by the other. <em>[Bowker, supra </em>at 392-393.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Consequently, an expert testifying on the basis of syndrome evidence is precluded from making any reference to the particular complainant or specific facts before the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>People v Gray, </em>187 Cal App 3d 213, 215-222; 231 Cal Rptr 658 (1986); <em>People v Jeff, </em>204 Cal App 3d 309, 329-332, 337-339; 251 Cal Rptr 135 (1988); <em>People v Bergschneider, </em>\u2014 Cal App 3d \u2014, \u2014; 259 Cal Rptr 219, 226-227 (1989); <em>People v Stark, </em>\u2014 Cal App 3d \u2014, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u2014; 261 Cal Rptr 479, 483-484 (1989); <em>People v Leon, </em>\u2014 Cal App 3d \u2014, \u2014; 263 Cal Rptr 77, 84-87 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">Under the rule the lead opinion would adopt today, the danger is too great that the trier of fact will improperly infer that an expert testifying on the basis of syndrome evidence is, in effect, concluding that the particular complainant before the court has been abused. It is this very danger that the California rule, which the lead opinion purports to adopt, was intended to prevent. The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome is a therapeutic tool. The syndrome assumes abuse, and the relevant scientific community does not rely upon syndrome evidence to prove that abuse in fact has occurred. As the Court in <em>Bowker </em>noted, the inherent danger in failing to narrowly circumscribe an expert\u2019s testimony to the general class of child abuse victims is that syndrome evidence can all too easily be misconstrued as constituting a method of proving or predicting child abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">Fundamentally, <em>Bledsoe </em>must be read to reject the use of [child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome] evidence as a <em>predictor </em>of child abuse. It is one thing to say that child abuse victims often exhibit a certain characteristic or that a particular behavior is not inconsistent with a child having been molested. It is quite another to conclude that where a child meets certain criteria, we can predict with a reasonable degree of certainty that he or she has been abused. The former may be appropriate in some circumstances; the latter . . . clearly is not. <em>[Bowker, supra </em>at 393. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">The ultimate purpose of child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome evidence is to dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding sexual as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sault crimes. See <em>ante, </em>pp 709, 716-717 (Brickley, J.). Once an expert witness presents evidence disabusing the specific misconception at hand, such as delayed disclosure, syndrome evidence has served its proper function. This function can be accomplished just as effectively without reference to the complainant before the court. Although the lead opinion recognizes that syndrome evidence is, by nature, as highly prejudicial as it is probative, see, e.g., <em>ante, </em>pp 723-725 (Brickley, J.), it wholly fails to recognize that the marginal probative value of the expert\u2019s testimony with reference to the specific complainant before the court pales in comparison to the increased and substantial degree of prejudice a criminal defendant will face.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The line of questioning that took place in <em>Beckley </em>demonstrates that when an expert is permitted to refer to the particular complainant and facts of the case, a criminal defendant faces substantial prejudice that no curative instruction can undo. Under these circumstances, the practical effect is to extend the use of syndrome evidence to the improper purpose of proving or predicting sexual abuse, a use for which syndrome evidence no longer proves sufficiently reliable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the lead and concurring opinions conclude that the defendant himself \"opened the door\u201d to an improper line of questioning when cross-examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the prosecution\u2019s expert witness, see, e.g., <em>ante, </em>p 731 (Brickley, J.), the error requiring reversal in this case occurred during the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of expert witness Robin Smietanka:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-5\"><em>Q. </em>Mrs. Smietanka, do you know [the child]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-7\"><em>Q. </em>How did you come to know [her]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-8\"><em>A. </em>[She] was referred to me by Carol King, who is a Protective Services\u2019 worker out of the Children\u2019s Unit of the Muskegon County Department of Social Services. Mrs. King called me and asked me if I would see [the child] for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment in regards to alleged sexual abuse or incest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-9\"><em>Q. </em>Are you aware of the fact that after the incident that\u2019s alleged in this case that [the child] reported only that her father had made passes at her, referring to some inappropriate kisses, and that that\u2019s all she initially reported in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I am aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-11\"><em>Q. </em>Well, based upon your rather extensive practice and your familiarity with the literature and so on and your knowledge of that particular behavior and the other circumstances in which that behavior manifested itself, and by that I mean [the child], her age, her sex and so on, do you have any opinion as to whether that kind of behavior would be typical of a victim of such sexual abuse such as [this child]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\"><em>A. </em>That behavior would be typical of a victim of the age and characteristics of [this child]. Many times disclosure is delayed for an extended period of time. Many times disclosure is made to what we would call like a third-party source. That would be somebody outside of the family. And many times disclosure is not full disclosure. A child will let go of so much information in an attempt to get a behavior to stop or to make sure that that behavior does not occur again without wanting to fully disclose the intimate details or the extensiveness of the behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number><em>Q. </em>Are you familiar with the fact that the victim in this case . . . waited a year before reporting the fact of intercourse, before reporting that it was more than passes, that there was in fact intercourse, after a delay of a year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I am familiar with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\"><em>Q. </em>Do you have any opinion as to whether that type of behavior would be typical or normal for a victim who was sexually abused at [this child\u2019s] age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\"><em>A. </em>From both my own caseload experience and from the literature, that would be a fairly common response of a child to wait ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Aside from the obvious prejudice deriving from the prosecution\u2019s repeated references to the complainant as a \"victim,\u201d a jury could reasonably infer that Ms. Smietanka, who testified that she had personally examined the complainant for purposes of diagnosis and treatment, was, at the very least, predicting that the complainant in fact had been sexually abused. The proper purpose of Ms. Smietanka\u2019s testimony was merely to dispel the misconceptions that the specific postincident behavior traits at issue, such as delayed disclosure and the complainant\u2019s initial tendency to deny sexual intercourse, were inconsistent with those postincident behavior traits exhibited by children who in fact had been sexually abused. The prosecution could have dispelled these misconceptions just as effectively without the repeated references to the child or the facts of this case. Under this limitation, the very real potential for unfair prejudice to the defendant would truly be kept at a minimum while permitting the people to effectively uncover the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The sexual abuse of children is among the most cruel and heinous of criminal acts. The criminal preys upon the very weaknesses that children are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>most unable to overcome: helplessness and innocence. In cases of incest, the very person morally responsible for protecting a child from the dangers of life is usually the very same person who would subject the child to the cruelest of mankind\u2019s inhumanities in order to indulge in self-gratification. Thus, society has the highest interest in protecting defenseless children from incurring substantial and permanent injury at the hands of a child abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">At the very same time, a fundamental value deeply cherished by our society is the right to a fair and impartial trial. The fairness of the procedures under which a criminal prosecution is conducted is zealously guarded to as high a degree as are the justness and righteousness of the substantive rule of law upon which a conviction is based. Because the additional probative value to be gained by permitting an expert to refer to the complainant and particular facts before the court is ever so slight when compared to the increased and substantial degree of prejudice a criminal defendant will face under the lead opinion, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b945-6\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\"> See <em>ante, </em>p 710 (Brickley, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-8\"> Expert testimony is, of course, not admissible to prove that the complainant in fact has been sexually abused. As the majority and concurring opinions correctly note, \"syndrome\u201d evidence is not a scientific technique that determines whether a child has been abused. Rather, it is a therapeutic tool developed to explain postincident behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\"> Credibility questions arise whenever the defendant denies the victim\u2019s story, explicitly or implicitly suggesting misrecollection or fabrication. If, in every such case, the jury could be informed that a doctor had diagnosed the complainant, based upon the specific facts in the case, as a child molest [sic] victim (or rape victim, or whatever), then the protection against misuse of psychologists\u2019 testimony erected by <em>[People </em>v] <em>Bledsoe </em>[36 Cal 3d 236; 203 Cal Rptr 450; 681 P2d 291 (1984)] would be largely dismantled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-8\">Where the expert refers to specific events, people, and personalities and bases his opinion as to credibility on his diagnosis of this witness, then the conclusion that the witness is credible rests upon the premise that the diagnosis is accurate, and that in fact molestation had occurred. The jury in effect is being asked to believe the diagnosis, to agree that the doctor\u2019s analysis is correct and that the defendant is guilty. Such a result would subvert the sound rule adopted by a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>Bledsoe. It follows, therefore, that the expert testimony authorized by </em>Bledsoe <em>to permit rehabilitation of a complainant\u2019s credibility is limited to discussion of victims as a class, supported by references to literature and experience (such as an expert normally relies upon) and does not extend to discussion and diagnosis of the witness in the case at hand. [Roscoe, supra </em>at 1099-1100. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b940-6\"> In <em>Bledsoe </em>our Supreme Court held that the rape trauma syndrome does not meet the <em>Kelly-Frye[*] </em>standard of admissibility as a scientifically accepted test for establishing whether a rape occurred. Therefore, such evidence is not admissible to prove guilt in a criminal trial. In <em>Roscoe </em>this court extended <em>Bledsoe </em>to child molest [sic] cases and, as defendant states, clarified the manner in which expert testimony explaining trauma behavior may be introduced. As we explained, the opinion testimony should be based upon the literature in the field and general, professional experience of the witness rather than upon an analysis and diagnosis based upon a review and evaluation of the facts in the case at hand. <em>[People v Jeff, </em>204 Cal App 3d 309, 337; 251 Cal Rptr 135 (1988).]</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">[* <em>People v Kelly, </em>17 Cal 3d 24; 549 P2d 1240 (1976); <em>Frye v United States, </em>54 App DC 46; 293 F 1013 (1923).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\"> The function of rape counselors \"is to help their clients deal with the trauma they are experiencing\u201d and \"the historical accuracy of the client\u2019s descriptions of the details of the traumatizing events is not vital in their tasks\u201d; the counselors \"are taught to make a conscious effort to avoid judging the credibility of their clients.\u201d <em>(Id. [People v Bledsoe, </em>36 Cal 3d], 250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The diagnosis, while scientifically acceptable for treatment purposes, is not the product of a rigorous process the goal of which is determining truth or falsity (unlike fingerprint, lie detector, or blood tests). To admit the diagnosis to prove what events occurred leading up to the therapeutic treatment would be to misuse it for a purpose never intended by those in the discipline who developed the concepts. <em>[Roscoe, supra </em>at 1097.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
