(hereinafter \u201capplicant\u201d) for the construction of a high rise condominium apartment building. Approval, granted by resolution dated September 23, 1986, includes variances from the borough\u2019s set-back, lot coverage and parking stall requirements. It authorizes construction of a 24-story building consisting of 406 dwelling units on 3.6 acres of land adjoining Gorge Road in Edgewater and .3 acres in the neighboring municipality of Cliffside Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">On this appeal plaintiffs assert that they were denied an opportunity to be heard before the Planning Board, that in addition to the variances granted the project also required a density variance which was beyond the authority of the Planning Board to grant, that a height variance was also required, that sufficient reasons were not shown for the grant of the front yard and lot coverage variances, that the variances granted significantly impaired the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance and that the resolution was invalid because it was prepared by the Board\u2019s attorney and not sufficiently reviewed by members of the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">From our careful examination of the record we are satisfied that plaintiffs and their attorneys were given every reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearings before the Planning Board. We further conclude that no density variance was required. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention to the contrary is based on area calculations which make no allowance for the .3 acres of the tract located in Cliffside Park. A somewhat analogous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>situation was presented in <em>Ciocon v. Franklin Lakes Plan. Bd,., 223 N.J.Super. </em>199 (App.Div.1988), where we said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">We hold that under the facts and circumstances presented, where a boundary line transects a property located within two municipalities, the rear-yard setback requirements of one municipality refer to the distance that the building is located from the rear-lot line located in the adjoining municipality rather than from the municipal boundary line. <em>[Id. </em>at 208].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">There is no reason why the principle there applied to interpret a set-back requirement should not also apply to a requirement limiting lot coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The height limitation of the ordinance is not exceeded by the proposed structure. The ordinance limits the building to a height of 250 feet above \u201cground floor level.\u201d The term \u201cground level,\u201d from which plaintiffs say the measurement should be made, is not used in the ordinance. The lot is steeply sloped with a difference of approximately 50 feet between its high and low points, and the building\u2019s height should be measured from its \u201cground floor level.\u201d The ordinance was properly interpreted by the Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> Affirmative reasons for granting the set-back variances are found in what the Planning Board termed \u201cthe unique topographical conditions of the proposed site as well as the testimony submitted concerning the affect [sic] of shadows view blockage of neighboring properties and aesthetic considerations____\u201d Also supported by the evidence is the Planning Board's finding that the variances in this area zoned for high rise construction would not impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Planning Board\u2019s resolution was lacking in factually supported findings is lacking in merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). Were it not for the issue to which we now turn, the Law Division\u2019s judgment would be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">During the hearing of July 15, 1986 the Chairman of the Planning Board made the following statement to the applicant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Which brings to mind, Mr. Rigolosi, since we are on the subject of our requests, if this Board sees fit to grant this I want you to consider our need for affordable housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">As you know, the state has mandated that most communities in Bergen County have a plan for affordable housing. I think this is a good time for us to start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">I want you to consider \u2014 if not on this site, maybe another site in Edgewater \u2014granting us some affordable housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">If we grant you this project \u2014 I don\u2019t want you to say anything now \u2014 I\u2019m saying that this cannot continue with all of this luxury business without considering the other people that live in this world. Somewhere along the line we have to start. I think this is a good time to start and I\u2019m saying this in front of the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">If you can\u2019t see fit to put affordable housing on that plot then maybe there\u2019s a place in Edgewater you can acquire and put some affordable housing. So just consider that. It may be in the form of a grant to the town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\"><em>Whichever way you can go, I\u2019m sure it would be taken into consideration as far as granting this particular approval. </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The matter was further pursued at the final Shearing on August 19, 1986 when the chairman reopened thh subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">Mr. Rigolosi, one of the things I pointed out to you was the problem that we\u2019re having in Edgewater with the affordable housing, and I was wondering whether there\u2019s any way that that could be incorporated with this plan, and you haven\u2019t as yet addressed that this evening. However, at the last meeting we suggested that the attorneys get together and discuss something that you could present to us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Mr. Rigolosi responded that the matter had been explored and that the applicant would be willing to contribute $500 for each unit in the proposed building, a total of $203,000. During the ensuing discussion members of the Board said what they thought about the adequacy of the \u201ccontribution,\u201d the salient fact holding their attention was the possibility that the project would yield a gross return to the builder of around $200,000,-000. One member of the Board speculated that Mr. Rigolosi had given \u201ca low-ball offer,\u201d whereupon Mr. Rigolosi replied that he was not playing \u201ca high-ball, low-ball game,\u201d and that he had made what he thought was \u201ca generous offer.\u201d He said that because of the uniqueness of the matter being negotiated between the applicant and the Planning Board there was no \u201cstandard\u201d for him to draw upon and he urged the Board to consider the magnitude of the project. Actually, Mr. Rigolosi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cthought that $100 to $200 a unit would be somewhat fair, because when you consider the number of units, that is adding on a considerable sum of money.\u201d He told the Board of the \u201cup-front money that is necessary to get this project off the ground ... [the] premium costs that must be incurred to even get this site ready ... a difficult engineering problem,\u201d and costs approximating four to five million dollars. He then stated, \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about $500 a unit, you\u2019re talking about $200,000 on top of all of that for the affordable housing.\u201d One Board member said \u201cit\u2019s a matter of opinion as to what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s equitable\u201d and that he didn\u2019t think $500 was fair. He then proposed, \u201cHow about giving us the retail value of one two-bedroom apartment in the building,\u201d to which another member added \u201c[o]n the 24th floor.\u201d Mr. Rigolosi replied, \u201c[w]hy not a studio apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We do not overlook the Board members\u2019 attempts to elevate the tone of the proceedings by gratuitously interspersing stately protestations that the amount contributed would \u201chave no bearing on our decision\u201d on whether to approve the application and that \u201conly if it is voted approval would something be done of this nature.\u201d The matter was concluded by the Board agreeing to accept the applicant\u2019s offer of $203,000. Its resolution summarized the agreement in the following language of paragraph six:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">... [T]he Planning Board has considered the proposal by this applicant that a sum of money donated by the applicant be set aside for utilization for low and moderate housing in the Borough of Edgewater. The applicant has suggested and the Planning Board has agreed to accept the sum of five hundred dollars ($500) for each of the four hundred six (406) units approved in connection with this development which amount shall be used by the Borough of Edgewater to satisfy its Mount Laurel obligation. This amount shall be paid upon the issuance of a building permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Our Supreme Court recently noted that there is \u201cwide variation in the types of exactions that governmental entities impose on developers\u201d such as requiring the construction of streets, or the dedication of land for schools or recreational purposes. <em>N.J. Bldrs. Ass\u2019n. v. Bernards Tp., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>223, 229 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(1987). In fact, as the Court observed, some municipalities \u201chave enacted \u2018linkage\u2019 ordinances that condition the right to develop commercial properties on construction of or contribution to the cost of low-and moderate-income housing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233. However, these impositions must be authorized by statute and implemented by municipal ordinance. <em>Ibid; Longridge Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Princeton Tp., 52 N.J. </em>348, 350-351 (1968); <em>West Park Ave., Inc. v. Ocean Tp., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>122, 127-128 (1966); <em>Lake Intervale Homes, Inc. v. Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>423, 441 (1958). In <em>Longridge Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Princeton Tp., 52 N.J. </em>348 (1968), the Court invalidated a condition imposed by the Planning Board that the applicant seeking subdivision approval pave an off-site road. <em>Id. </em>at 349. The Court declined to decide whether the Legislature had authorized the contribution for off-site improvements, resting its decision instead on the lack of an ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 350. The Court reasoned, in language appropriate to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">Without an appropriate ordinance setting forth standards and procedures, the planning body would be left with an impermissibly broad range of discretion in exacting off-site improvements from subdividers; landowners and developers would have no basis for planning; and reviewing courts would be without a measuring rod to gauge the validity of the imposition. <em>[Id. </em>at 351],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">As stated in <em>Battaglia v. Wayne Township Planning Board, </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 198 (App.Div.1967), in an application for site plan approval \u201cthe conditions that may be imposed must be set forth with some particularity in the ordinance and must be limited to those permitted by the authorizing statute.\u201d <em>Compare, Matter of Egg Harbor Associates (Bayshore Centre), </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358 (1983), where the Court upheld affordable housing inclusion regulations based upon statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\"><em>West Park Ave., Inc. v. Ocean Tp., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>122 (1966), emphasizes the impropriety of exactions unsupported by statute, ordinance or regulation. Plaintiff owned several lots which were part of a subdivision plan. It was informed by various municipal officials that the Township would issue no more building permits or certificates of occupancy unless plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>agreed to pay $300 per house to the Board of Education to defray school costs. Plaintiff paid rather than litigate because it feared that its project could not survive if delayed. <em>Id. </em>at 124. Counsel for the municipality executed a contract upon the payment of each $300. <em>Id. </em>at 124-125. Plaintiff thereafter sued to recover the payments it made, claiming duress. <em>Id. </em>124. It appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In reversing, our Supreme Court concluded that the payments were \u201cillegally extorted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128. The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">There being no statutory authorization, it is clear the municipality could not have lawfully exacted the charges here involved. At the oral argument before us, defendants conceded this to be so. We have no doubt the municipality was conscious of the illegality of what it did and for that reason refrained from adopting an ordinance, seeking instead to achieve its ends through the guise of \u201cvoluntary\u201d contributions with spurious \u201cagreements\u201d to make them stick. <em>[Id. </em>at 127-128].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In <em>Matter of Egg Harbor Associates (Bayshore Centre), </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358 (1983), it was stated that \u201cState and municipal bodies that have the power to control land use for the health, safety, and general welfare of the public may use that power to create housing opportunities for the poor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. Whether this language authorizes a municipality to provide for the solicitation and acceptance of money in the manner that was done here is a question we do not decide. Assuming that it does provide such authority, it is clear that an implementing ordinance was never enacted and without that the exaction is impermissible. <em>Longridge Builders, Inc. v. Planning Bd. of Princeton Tp., </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>at 350-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The facial difference between the cases discussed above and the matter before us is obvious. There the applicants sought relief from the oppressive actions of the municipalities. Here, the applicant does not. Indeed, it actually insists that its commitment to \u201ccontribute\u201d $203,000 to the municipality for affordable housing was voluntarily made, that it was intended as a gift and not to influence the Planning Board\u2019s disposition, and that the Planning Board\u2019s decision to grant subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>approval was not affected by the promise of a contribution. The Planning Board vehemently agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The trial court rested its affirmance in part upon the fact that there was \u201cno evidence of fraud or corruption____\u201d Presumably, this was based on the lack of a showing that any member of the Planning Board would enjoy a personal benefit. But the propriety of the variances does not depend upon the finding of fraud or corruption. The test is whether the local body\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. <em>Rowatti v. Gonchar, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>46, 52 (1985); <em>Kramer v. Bd. of Adjust., Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>268, 296 (1965). In our view, if the agreement to pay $203,000 to the borough for its affordable housing fund was entered into by the applicant to induce the Planning Board to grant approval and was a consideration in the mind of the Board members when they voted approval, such action could not be other than arbitrary and capricious. By this criterion the Planning Board\u2019s action must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The idea of a contribution was first proposed by the Board chairman himself who said he was \u201csure\u201d that it would be considered by the Board in connection with the application. We find it impossible to credit the disclaimers dutifully recorded at the hearing of August 19, 1986. At that hearing, the applicant offered $500 per unit, but at least one Board member thought more should be given. The Board and the applicant bargained their way to a mutually acceptable figure; one bargains for a <em>quid pro quo, </em>not for a gift. The Board\u2019s resolution itself alludes to the contribution and specifies that it is to be paid \u201cupon the issuance of a building permit.\u201d Finally, the applicant itself conceded at oral argument that its \u201cgift\u201d to the Borough would be forthcoming only if the site plan approval and variances were sustained on this appeal. There can be no doubt that the promise to pay $203,000 was a material factor in the application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Without legislated standards the possibilities for abuse in such negotiations between an applicant and a regulatory body, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>no matter how worthy the cause, are unlimited. Approvals would be granted or withheld depending upon the board members\u2019 arbitrary sense of how much an applicant should pay. Cases can be visualized in which neighboring land owners file competing applications for site plan approval of shopping center developments and where the applicant promising the larger contribution is granted approval and the other is not. Or others in which a homeowner offers $1000 to obtain a variance, but his neighbor defeats the application by offering $2000. Indeed, if we sanction the propriety of accepting contributions for affordable housing to support a variance application, no reason appears why, in the absence of controls set forth in an ordinance, a contribution to support an objection to the variance should not also be given consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We conclude that the kind of free-wheeling bidding under review is grossly inimical to the goals of sound land use regulation. The intolerable spectacle of a planning board haggling with an applicant over money too strongly suggests that variances are up for sale. This cannot be countenanced. Proceedings in which this has occurred are irremediably tainted and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We understand the applicant\u2019s situation. It responded to the Planning Board\u2019s prodding, and as a result must suffer loss of its site plan approval and variances. Were the facts in some way different from what they are, we could consider the kind of relief granted in <em>Longridge Builders, Inc., West Park Ave., Inc. </em>and <em>Lake Intervale Homes, Inc. </em>The difficulty is that it does not claim to have been victimized by the Board. Indeed, it insists that its agreement to contribute $203,000 for affordable housing in Edgewater was an act of benevolence on its part, an unconditional gift, not a payment for site plan approval, and that it did not figure in the Board\u2019s determination. In view of the findings which we have made, there is no basis to mollify our decision\u2019s impact upon the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The judgment of the Law Division dated June 30, 1987 is reversed and the resolution of the Planning Board dated September 23, 1986 is vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
