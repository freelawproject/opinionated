She contends that the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner) had, and should have exercised, authority to award counsel fees either under the Education Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:1-1 et seq.,- or under the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Petitioner, then a 15-year old student at North Hunterdon Regional High School, filed a verified petition with the Commissioner asserting that her request to try out for the football team had been improperly denied on the basis of her sex. She alleged that respondents\u2019 actions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">... in instituting, condoning, and continuing the policy of discrimination as set forth herein above violates <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36-20; violates the right of plaintiff to equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States; violates the right of plaintiff as guaranteed by Article I, Section I of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947; violates 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1681 <em>et seq. </em>and Title IX of the Code of Federal Regulations, 45 <em>CFR, </em>\u00a7 86.41; and violates 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Because football tryouts were about to commence, the matter was immediately referred to the Office of Administrative Law as a contested case, which promptly heard petitioner\u2019s application for interim relief. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued an initial decision ordering that, pending a plenary hearing, petitioner was to be permitted \u201cto compete, tryout and qualify for membership\u201d on the football team.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Shortly thereafter, the parties consented to an order which made the interim restraints permanent and allowed petitioner to submit her motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Before filing that motion, however, petitioner moved to amend her petition \u201cto include as a basis for the award of relief the provisions of New Jersey\u2019s Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>Over respondents\u2019 objections, the AU granted the motion. Petitioner then filed the motion for fees. Concluding that the Commissioner \u201chas ancillary authority to award counsel fees to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>prevailing parties in contested cases adjudicated by him,\u201d the ALJ recommended the award of a $5343.75 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The Commissioner rejected the AU\u2019s recommended decision, stating that \u201cuntil such time as he is granted statutory authority or the imprimatur of the Courts of New Jersey to do so, the Commissioner declines to grant counsel fees.\u201d The State Board affirmed that decision for the reasons expressed by the Commissioner. Petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The Commissioner correctly concluded that he does not have plenary authority to award counsel fees in determining \u201ccontroversies and disputes\u201d presented to him under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The fact that Title 18A does not specifically authorize any award of such counsel fees is not dispositive. The statutory powers accorded to an administrative agency are to be \u201c \u2018liberally construed to permit the agency to achieve the task assigned to it, and ... such administrative agency has such implied incidental powers as may reasonably be adapted to that end.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Suspension of Heller, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>292, 303 (1977) (quoting <em>In re Comm\u2019r of Banking &amp; Ins. v. Parkwood Co., </em>98 <em>N.J.Super. </em>263, 271-72 (App.Div.1967)). Administrative agencies thus have been empowered to award certain kinds of monetary relief not expressly authorized by statute. <em>See, e.g., Zahorian v. Russell Fitt Real Estate Agency, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>399 (1973) (allowing Division on Civil Rights to award compensatory damages for pain and suffering); <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>113 (1969) (allowing Division on Civil Rights to award compensatory damages for out-of-pocket losses); <em>Board of Educ., City of Newark, Essex Cty. v. Levitt, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239 (App.Div.1984) (allowing Commissioner of Education to award post-judgment interest to a claimant who has been awarded a money judgment). We find, however, that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ancillary authority does not extend to the award of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Since 1948, New Jersey has consistently adhered to the general principle that \u201clegal expenses, whether for the compensation of attorneys or otherwise, are not recoverable absent express authorization by statute, court rule, or contract.\u201d <em>State, Dept. of Environ. Protect, v. Ventron Corp., 94 N.J. </em>473, 504 (1983). Although that principle finds its dominant expression in Supreme Court rules governing practice and procedure in the courts, <em>R. </em>4:42-9; <em>see State v. Otis Elevator Co., </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1953), the legislature has not evinced a contrary view. Indeed, when the legislature has authorized awards of counsel fees, it has done so expressly and specifically. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>56:10-10 (Franchise Practices Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-5 (Tort Claims Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-19 (Consumer Fraud Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:35A-10 (Environmental Rights Act); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:13-8 (Nursing Home Bill of Rights); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:15-37 (Real Estate Guaranty Fund); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 (Law Against Discrimination). Given the public policy described in <em>Ventr\u00f3n </em>and the absence of express statutory authority, the Commissioner properly found that he could not award counsel fees as ancillary relief under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In rejecting petitioner\u2019s application for a counsel fee award, the Commissioner did not address her alternate contention that counsel fees could be awarded pursuant to the Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 et seq. That contention had been rejected by the AU, who found that the Commissioner had authority to enforce the Law Against Discrimination, but could employ only those remedies found within Title 18A. We conclude, to the contrary, that the Commissioner had authority here to award counsel fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5\u2014 27.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The Commissioner and the Division on Civil Rights (Division) have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain complaints charging acts of gender discrimination in public school courses of study and curricula. <em>Hinfey v. Matawan Regional Bd. of Educ., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>514, 520 (1978). Such discrimination complaints, however, are to be handled by the Commissioner. If filed originally in the Division, they should be transferred to the Commissioner for disposition. <em>Id. </em>That is simply a rule of administrative comity, imposed because \u201cthe educational interests of complainants, which cannot be disassociated from their discrimination grievances, can best be addressed by the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532-33. Had petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of the Division and successfully litigated her claim there, the Division certainly would have had authority to award counsel fees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1. The fact that petitioner proceeded instead before the Commissioner, as instructed by <em>Hinfey, </em>should not deprive her of that remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although respondents acknowledge that the Commissioner has jurisdiction to entertain complaints charging gender discrimination in the public schools, they contend that he can enforce only the provisions of Title 18A and has no jurisdiction to enforce the Law Against Discrimination. We find the argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Speaking for the Court in <em>Hinfey, </em>Justice Handler described the \u201cjurisdictional growth in the Law Against Discrimination\u201d and noted that public schools under the supervision of the Commissioner \u201care specifically \u2018[a] place of public accommodation\u2019 under the Law Against Discrimination.\u201d 77 <em>N.J. </em>at 523; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5. Accordingly, the Division has \u201cjurisdiction to hear and adjudicate claims of discrimination pertaining to courses of study and curricula in the public schools.\u201d 77 <em>N.J. </em>at 524. The Commissioner also has the power and the affirmative duty \u201cto decide controversies under the school law which entail invidious discrimination practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525. Given that concurrent jurisdiction, the Division can properly defer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the Commissioner since he is \u201cstatutorily charged with the same, solemn responsibility for remediating discrimination and with an even fuller responsibility over other major aspects of the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. <em>Hinfey </em>thus must be regarded as authority for the proposition that the Commissioner may enforce the Law Against Discrimination insofar as it bears on the controversy or dispute presented to him under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9. To read <em>Hinfey </em>otherwise would be to deny all protection of the Law Against Discrimination to persons victimized in a public school setting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">For the same reasons, we reject respondents\u2019 contention that since petitioner elected to proceed before the Commissioner, \u201cany remedy which she may receive is therefore limited by the statutory scope of authority granted the Commissioner.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s \u201celection\u201d was in accordance with <em>Hinfey; </em>had she filed with the Division, the matter would properly have been transferred to the Commissioner. Petitioner cannot fairly be deprived of the remedies available under the Law Against Discrimination because, as a matter of administrative comity, the Commissioner rather than the Division is mandated to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We also find it significant that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 does not provide for the award of counsel fees in the Division only. The section, rather, provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this act, the prevailing party may be awarded a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee____\u201d Counsel fees thus' can be awarded in any forum in which the action is properly brought. The legislature has provided that such actions may be brought in the Division or in the Superior Court, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13, and the Supreme Court has held in <em>Hinfey </em>that the Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>shall entertain those claims arising in the public school setting. Since actions under the Law Against Discrimination may be brought in all three forums, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 is fairly read as permitting all to award counsel fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Respondents argue that, even if the Commissioner has authority to award counsel fees under the Law Against Discrimination, the petition here was not \u201cbrought under\u201d that law and petitioner was not a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d We reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">While the original petition did not specifically plead the Law Against Discrimination, it did assert a \u201cpolicy of discrimination\u201d violative of \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States\u201d and \u201cArticle I, Section I of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947.\u201d In recommending the grant of interim relief, the ALJ himself invoked the Law Against Discrimination, noting that the legislative policy underlying the statute \u201cis fully consistent\u201d with the constitutional and statutory provisions urged by petitioner. Thereafter petitioner was granted leave to amend her petition to claim relief under the Law Against Discrimination; the order for permanent injunctive relief was not entered until some months later. That history suffices to qualify the action as \u201cbrought under\u201d the Law Against Discrimination. <em>Cf. Urban League v. Tp. Committee, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>131 (App.Div.1987). Although petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>er\u2019s substantive claim was resolved by a consent order, she was indisputably the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>See Girandola v. Allentown, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">To summarize, we hold that (1) the Commissioner does not have plenary authority to award counsel fees as ancillary relief under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6 \u2014 9; (2) the Commissioner, however, does have authority to award counsel fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1 in matters brought under the Law Against Discrimination and properly entertained by him; and (3) the Commissioner here had authority to award counsel fees to petitioner as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a proceeding \u201cbrought under\u201d the Law Against Discrimination. We accordingly reverse the decision of the State Board and remand the matter to the Commissioner to make the discretionary determination authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">We note that in <em>Hinfey </em>Justice Handler characterized two earlier Supreme Court decisions, <em>Booker v. Plainfield Bd. of Ed., </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>161 (1965) and <em>Jenkins v. Morris Twp. School Dist. &amp; Bd. of Ed., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>483 (1971), as finding that the Commissioner had \"too narrow\u201d or \u201ctoo cramped\u201d a view of his powers in dealing with discrimination. 77 <em>N.J. </em>at 525, 526.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">At oral argument, counsel for respondents suggested that petitioner might have been entitled to a counsel fee award if (1) she filed with the Division, (2) the matter was transferred to and decided by the Commissioner, (3) the Commissioner remanded the matter to the Division, and (4) the Division then supplemented the Commissioner's order by an award of fees under the Law Against Discrimination. We see no reason why a counsel fee award under the Law Against Discrimination should require that kind of tortuous procedure. Moreover, it seems most appropriate to have the Commissioner decide whether and to what extent counsel fees should be awarded in a proceeding which he himself heard and determined.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
