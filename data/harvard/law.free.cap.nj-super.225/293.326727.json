Judgment was entered for plaintiff because the option was held unenforceable under the statute of frauds, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5 <em>et seq. </em>We now hold that a series of writings, including a memorandum signed by an authorized agent of the person against whom enforcement of the agreement is being sought, may satisfy the statute. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">On or about October 31, 1981, Willard Sutton, plaintiff\u2019s late husband (Sutton),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a written lease (as landlord) with defendant (as tenant) for real property located at 2204 Stanley Terrace, Union, New Jersey. The lease was for a five-year term commencing on November 1, 1981 and was executed with other documents related to the sale of Sutton\u2019s business to defendant. The lease also contained an \u201coption to purchase\u201d the premises in paragraph 34 contained in a rider to the lease. On December 31, 1984, defendant exercised the option by forwarding to the firm of the attorney who drew the lease, as trustee, monies sufficient to invoke the option. By letter dated January 8, 1985, the attorney, Alfred R. Kinney, wrote to plaintiff and advised her of her obligation to convey the property to defendant, but she refused to do so. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>after, defendant demanded a judgment for specific performance or, in the alternative, damages, in a counterclaim to plaintiff\u2019s complaint filed in an action related to another aspect of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The lease and the rider were executed in the presence of Kinney, who was Sutton\u2019s attorney and the scrivener of both documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Paragraph 34 of the two-paragraph rider was initially signed in the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">RIDER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">34th: The tenant shall have an option to purchase the real property covered by this lease, together with any right of way which may also be assignable or transferable, during the term of this lease or any extension thereof, for the sum of $_during the first five years of the lease or at a sum to be arrived at by the average of three.appraisals during the second five years of the term if renewed. During said renewal the sale price shall be established by each party obtaining an appraiser, and the two appraisers picking a third, the average of the three appraisals shall be the established purchase price for exercise of the option to purchase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2\">fsl Gordon Lienau</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">Gordon Lienau, Tenant</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">Is! Willard Sutton</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">Willard Sutton, Landlord</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">It is not disputed that Sutton and defendant deliberately left the option purchase price \u201cblank.\u201d According to defendant, \u201cSutton didn\u2019t know what the buildings were worth,\u201d and he and Sutton \u201cagreed to leave the purchase price, contained in Paragraph 34 of the Rider, blank only until [Sutton] had the property appraised and until he [Sutton] determined a price.\u201d Defendant \u201ctrusted\u201d Sutton and was willing to accept \u201cwhatever\u201d option purchase price Sutton decided to insert in the rider. He stated in depositions that he \u201ckn[e]w it would be fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">Kinney arranged for an appraisal of the land and buildings, and on November 5, 1981, an appraiser inspected the property. On November 6, 1981, a written appraisal was sent to Kinney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The property was appraised for a total market value of $110,-000. On November 17, 1981, Kinney sent a letter to Sutton, with a copy to defendant, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Re: Speed Trucking <em>&amp; </em>Rigging</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Age\">Dear Mr. Sutton:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">Please find enclosed herewith a photocopy of an appraisal made for me by Leonard J. Zehnbauer. Please issue a check payable to Mr. Zehnbauer in the amount of $50.00 to cover the bill and forward it directly to Mr. Zehnbauer in the enclosed envelope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">I have also forwarded a copy of it to Mr. Lienau so that he can review it as well. If the two of you can agree on a figure, we can insert the figure in the lease and exchange papers and thereby close the deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">If there is any question please call. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">ALFRED R. KINNEY</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Sometime between November 17, 1981, and December 3, 1981, Kinney met with Sutton at his home and discussed the purchase price to be placed in the option. In his deposition, Kinney recalled his discussion with Sutton as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">Q. Do you recall what you and Mr. Sutton discussed with respect to the appraisal during the course of that meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">A. The value to be placed in the option to purchase that was a part of the lease that was given to Gordon Lienau.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">Q. What did Mr. Sutton say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">A. The actual words I can\u2019t recall, but the sum and substance was something to the effect that his relationship with Gordon [Lienau] was such that he wanted to sell it to Gordon for $30,000 and he didn\u2019t care that the $100,000 [sic ] was the value set forth in the [November 6, 1981] appraisal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">Q. Was anyone else present during that meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">A. Mrs. Sutton [plaintiff] was in and out I believe, of the room, and was present there most of the time. I don\u2019t recall anyone else being present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT7\">Q. Do you recall whether Mrs. Sutton participated in the conversation with respect to the purchase price of the property to be inserted into the lease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">A. Not to my recollection. Mr. Sutton was a very strong-willed individual, and I don\u2019t think it was a question of asking her opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-19\">Q. Did Mr. Sutton have any conversations with you at that time in which he indicated that $30,000 as the option price for the property was offset in any way by the amount of money [$175,000] he charged to Mr. Lienau for the [October 31, 1981] purchase of Speed Trucking &amp; Rigging [Sutton\u2019s business, which was conducted on the leased property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-20\">A. Not that I can recall. My recollection is that he just gave me that figure [$30,000], and that was the figure he wanted in the lease, and he felt that that\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>what he would expect Gordon Lienau to pay for the property, and that it was all part of one deal. There was a relationship between him and Mr. Lienau.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On or about December 3, 1981, Kinney typed \u201c$30,000.00\u201d onto a copy of the rider that had been signed by Sutton and defendant on October 31, 1981. On December 3, 1981, Kinney sent a letter to Sutton, which in pertinent part read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4I\">Re: Sutton to Lienau</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEe\">Dear Mr. Sutton:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">At this point all contingencies with respect to the sale of Speed Trucking and Rigging have been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">I have, in accordance with your direction, inserted $30,000.00 in the lease, as far as the cost of acquiring the property, under the option to purchase. I have the original of the [$175,000] note and all other papers here and will hold them here unless you request the same. I have forwarded copies of the same to you so that you may insert them in your file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">If there is anything further please advise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">Hoping this letter finds you in better health, I am,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">ALFRED R. KINNEY</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">According to defendant, Kinney also telephoned him and \u201ctold [him] that the property had been appraised and that [he] was to write in \u2018$30,000\u2019 in Paragraph 34 of [his copy of] the Rider.\u201d In his depositions, Kinney indicated that he \u201cconfirmed\u201d the $30,000 purchase price to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Defendant thought $30,000 was a \u201cvery good price\u201d and, following Kinney\u2019s telephone call, defendant \u201cpenned in\u201d the figure \u201c$30,000.00\u201d on his copy of the rider that he and Sutton had signed on October 31, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">Between October 31, 1981 and the time Kinney instructed defendant to write the figure \u201c$30,000.00\u201d on his signed copy of the rider, defendant had no conversations with Sutton \u201cas to the value of the property.\u201d However, defendant said that at \u201csome time after the property was appraised and the $30,000.00 figure agreed upon, [he] saw [Sutton] and thanked him for his kind offer.\u201d Defendant said that, in reply, Sutton told defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ant he \u201cwas like a son to him and had helped him throughout all the years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">After his meeting with Sutton conducted between November 17, 1981 and December 3, 1981, Kinney had no further personal contact with Sutton. Sutton died on February 18, 1982, leaving his entire estate to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In his written opinion granting' plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the motion judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">While recent cases are lacking, New Jersey has followed the generally recognized rule [sic] that if an option agreement neither contains a provision specifying the price, nor provides for a mode whereby the price can be ascertained with certainty, other than the future agreement of the parties, enforcement of the option contract should be denied on the ground that it is indefinite and uncertain as to price. <em>See Annot. </em>2 <em>A.L.R.ZA </em>701, 708.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The judge concluded that he had to decide the issue based on the writing at \u201cthe time at which a contract is made\u201d, that \u201c... there are good reasons to require a memorandum mentioning the purchase price\u201d and that \u201c[a]t any rate, the parties did not provide for a valid option with the purchase price stated in writing.\u201d He therefore held the option unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Defendant contends the option is enforceable \u201csince all the requirements of the statute of frauds have been satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">An option to purchase real estate embodied in a lease of that property is a contract for the \u201csale of real estate,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:l-5d, and, therefore, within the statute of frauds <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5). <em>McClung Drug Co. v. City Realty &amp; Invest. Co., </em>91 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>216, 218 (Ch. 1919), <em>affd, </em>o.b. 92 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>237 (E. &amp; A. 1920).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because such an option is an \u201cagreement or promise\u201d within the statute of frauds, the \u201cagreement or promise ... or some memorandum or note thereof\u201d must be \u201cin writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The writing required by the statute of frauds must contain the \u201cessential terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Gilbert, </em>66 <em>N.J.Super. </em>246, 252-253 (App.Div.1961) (citation omitted). Only the party \u201cto be charged therewith\u201d need sign the writing; <em>Charlton v. Columbia Real Estate Co., </em>67 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>629, 632 (E. &amp; A.1905). However, an agent \u201cacting under an oral authorization can furnish the memorandum which will bind a seller or buyer,\u201d and satisfy the statute of frauds. <em>Herzog v. Tidaback, </em>67 <em>N.J.Super. </em>14, 18 (Ch.Div.1961) (citation omitted). In other words, an authorized agent can by his signature satisfy the requirement of a writing, and the agent\u2019s authority to do so for his principal \u201cmay be created orally and may be proved by parole evidence.\u201d <em>Schenck v. Spring Lake Beach Improvement Co., </em>47 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>44, 49 (Ch. 1899). As stated in <em>Charlton v. Columbia Real Estate Co., supra, </em>67 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>at 633:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">The memorandum is only necessary to <em>evidence </em>the contract, not to <em>constitute </em>it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">The memorandum or note is only to evidence what the contract was. To prevent perjury as to such contracts, the statute declares that evidence of what the contract was must be contained in some memorandum or note in writing, signed by the party to be charged therewith [or his authorized agent]. When the memorandum exists, and is legally given in testimony, it becomes evidence of the contract claimed to have been made. The memorandum is not the contract, but only evidence of the contract. [ (emphasis in original) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Moreover, it is not \u201cnecessary that all the terms of the contract be agreed to at one time, nor written down at one time, nor on one piece of paper. If all the papers, taken together, contain the whole bargain, they form such a memorandum as will satisfy the statute [of frauds] [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632. <em>See also Johnson &amp; Miller v. Buck, </em>35 <em>N.J.L. </em>338, 343 (Sup.Ct. 1872); <em>accord Truex v. Ocean Dodge, Inc., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>44, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>50-51 (App.Div.1987) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-201; 12A:2-204); <em>Hardy v. Hangen, </em>134 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>176, 181 (Ch. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The evidence of the purchase option contract here consists of four writings. First, there is the copy of the lease and rider signed by Sutton and defendant on or about October 31, 1981 in which the option price in the rider was intentionally left blank. This writing contains all the essential terms of the purchase option contract, except the purchase price. Second, there is the copy of this same signed rider on which Kinney, on December 3, 1981 or a day or two before, typed in \u201c$30,000.00\u201d as Sutton\u2019s authorized agent and at Sutton\u2019s specific direction. Third, there is Kinney\u2019s December 3, 1981 letter, signed and sent by Kinney, to Sutton, in which Kinney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">I have, in accordance with your direction, inserted $30,000.00 in the lease, as far as the cost of acquiring the property, under the option to purchase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Fourth, defendant inserted the purchase price on his copy of the lease pursuant to the telephone call from Kinney.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Kinney\u2019s authority must be acknowledged for purposes of the motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and these writings contain all the essential terms of an option to purchase real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Contrary to the judge\u2019s opinion, the writings were sufficient as an integrated whole and contained the price for the option to purchase. Therefore, the motion judge erred in concluding the option was \u201cunenforceable under the New Jersey Statute of Frauds\u201d because the parties \u201cdid not provide for a valid option with the purchase price stated in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">In light of our disposition on the statute of frauds issue, we remand for further proceedings and for consideration of all other legal issues raised before trial, including the issue of merger.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Sutton died of cancer on February 18, 1982, leaving his entire estate to plaintiff. He was apparently aware of the illness at all times relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">The motion judge correctly concluded that an option price did not constitute \"consideration\u201d which, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-8, could be supplied by parol evidence. <em>Cf.
