Plaintiff was then 60 years old, and his wife 59. Their major assets were the marital home and their pensions. The judgment of divorce incorporating the terms of an agreement provided, among other things, that plaintiff pay defendant $650 a month alimony and, as her share of his pension, $19,000 less 40% of the value of her pension. The judgment further provided that the marital home be sold within a year and the proceeds divided equally. Plaintiff used a portion of his share of the proceeds from the sale of the home to pay defendant her net share of the value of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>pension. After these adjustments, she received approximately $75,000 of the proceeds and he received approximately $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Plaintiff was laid off from work in June 1985 and immediately moved for termination of alimony because he was no longer earning income. The trial court reduced his alimony payments from $650 to $550 a month, established arrearages in the amount of $3,600 and ordered him to pay $1,200 of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. In reducing alimony by only $100 a month and establishing arrearages of $3,600, the trial judge found that plaintiff's monthly income was $1,502, consisting of $622 Social Security benefits, $720 pension payments, and $160 payments from an annuity that plaintiff had purchased with $24,000 of his share of the proceeds from the sale of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The basic issue in this appeal is whether, for the purpose of determining alimony, the trial judge properly considered the payments plaintiff receives from his pension and from the annuity he had purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the marital home. Plaintiff contends that those payments are derived from his equitable share of the marital assets and therefore are not available to pay alimony. He relies on the holding in <em>D\u2019Oro v. D\u2019Oro, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377 (Ch.Div.1982), aff\u2019d 193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385 (App.Div.1984). We respectfully disagree with <em>D\u2019Oro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>D\u2019Oro </em>posed the question of whether pension payments to a husband who retired five months after the divorce should \u201cbe included in an income base for purposes of re-establishment of alimony[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>187 N.J.Super. at 378. As here, the wife in <em>D\u2019Oro </em>had received a portion of the value of the pension in a lump sum as part of the equitable distribution of marital assets, the preferred method of distributing a spouse\u2019s equitable share of the other spouse\u2019s pension. <em>Kikkert v. Kikkert, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 477-478 (App.Div.1981), aff\u2019d 88 <em>N.J. </em>4 (1981). The court held that \u201cit will be inequitable for plaintiff [wife] to be able to include his pension income <em>twice </em>for her benefit, first for a share of equitable distribution, and second, for inclusion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>his cash flow for determination of an alimony base.\u201d <em>D\u2019Oro, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 379. (Emphasis in original.) The court \u201cleft to another day\u201d the question of whether pension payments may be considered as a basis for alimony <em>\u201cafter </em>such point in time as defendant [husband] has received his share of \u2018present value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">There is surface appeal to the argument that a supporting spouse should not be required to pay a dependent spouse \u201ctwice\u201d from the supporting spouse\u2019s pension. <em>Kikkert </em>encourages a lump sum payment to a spouse of the value of the other spouse\u2019s future pension payments in order to avoid prolonging contacts between divorced spouses. <em>Kikkert, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477-478. (That rationale is questionable in cases where an alimony award assures post-divorce contacts.) In the present case, plaintiff \u201cadvanced\u201d to defendant the lump sum present value of his pension from his share of the proceeds of the sale of the marital home. Superficially, it seems unfair to require him to pay plaintiff part of his pension payments \u201cagain\u201d as alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The argument is unsound because equitable distribution and alimony are not the same. They are fundamentally different in one important respect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">[Equitable distribution to a wife] gives recognition to the essential supportive role played by the wife in the home, acknowledging that as homemaker, wife and mother she should clearly be entitled to a share of family assets accumulated during the marriage. Thus the division of property upon divorce is responsive to the concept that marriage is a shared enterprise, a joint undertaking, that in many ways it is akin to a partnership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\"><em>[Rothman v. Rothman, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>219, 229 (1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Alimony, on the other hand, is meant to impose on the supporting spouse the duty to give the dependent spouse sufficient financial support, within the means of the supporting spouse, to continue to live according to the economic standard that was established during the marriage. <em>Mahoney v. Mahoney, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>488, 501-502 (1982). \u201cWhen support of an economically dependent spouse is at issue, the general considerations are the dependent spouse\u2019s needs, that spouse\u2019s ability to contribute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the fulfillment of those needs, and the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to maintain the dependent spouse at the former standard.\u201d <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 152 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Thus it is not inconsistent for a dependent wife to receive the value of a portion of her husband\u2019s pension as her share of the marital partnership, and nevertheless look to later pension payments as evidence of her former husband\u2019s ability to contribute towards maintaining her at their former marital economic standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">For the same reasons it is not inconsistent to consider as evidence of his ability to pay alimony the payments he receives from an annuity purchased with his equitable share of the marital estate. The same point is made in <em>Beyer v. Beyer, </em>64 <em>Ohio App.2d </em>280, 413 N.E.2d 844, 846 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Although it is true, as plaintiff husband argues, that this sum represents the sale of an asset which was awarded to the plaintiff in the property settlement, nonetheless, this sum is an asset which may be taken into consideration in determining alimony just as any asset which the wife holds may be taken into consideration. It is of no consequence that these assets may have originated from the property settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">This is not to say that equitable distribution and alimony are unrelated. <em>Rothman </em>emphasizes that equitable distribution serves an important second purpose besides distributing the assets of the marital partnership to the partners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">Hitherto future financial support for a divorced wife has been available only by grant of alimony. Such support has always been inherently precarious. It ceases upon the death of the former husband and will cease or falter upon his experiencing financial misfortune disabling him from continuing his regular payments. This may result in serious misfortune to the wife and in some cases will compel her to become a public charge. An allocation of property to the wife at the time of the divorce is at least some protection against such an eventuality. <em>[Rothman, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 228-229.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">This relationship between equitable distribution and alimony may require the dependent spouse to tap her assets, including property received in equitable distribution, to absorb some of the diminution of the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay alimony when upon retirement his earned income is replaced by lower pension payments. <em>Cf. Lynn v. Lynn, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>341-342 (App.Div.1979), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>52 (1979) (\u201cIn our view the trial judge gave no consideration to the possibility of invading Mrs. Lynn\u2019s assets to assist in providing child support during the three-year period of Dr. Lynn\u2019s markedly diminished earnings.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We reject the <em>D\u2019Oro </em>rule that whenever upon divorce a dependent spouse receives a lump sum share of the value of the supporting spouse\u2019s anticipated pension payments as part of equitable distribution, those pension payments or any portion thereof are not to be considered in readjusting alimony after the supporting spouse retires. The same is true for other assets that spouses acquired in equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The better rule is that income and assets of both former spouses, however they were derived, are to be considered in light of the parties\u2019 circumstances in determining the supporting spouse\u2019s ability to pay and the dependent spouse\u2019s need for alimony. Those circumstances include the form in which assets are held. For instance, a judge generally would consider the availability of liquid assets such as life-time pension and annuity payments before considering the availability of a home in which a spouse is living with children. <em>See Duplantis v. Duplantis, </em>470 No. 2d 480, 482 (La.App. 1 Cir.1985). <em>Cf. Shaffer v. Shaffer, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>491, 495 (App.Div.1977) (in considering award of counsel fees to wife who had received property in equitable distribution, \u201cvalue and liquidity of the property received by the wife will have a direct bearing upon her need for the award\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Prior to the termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment, he had been receiving a net earned monthly income of $2,054. After termination that income was replaced with pension payments of $720 a month. His pension income is supplemented by an additional $920 unearned monthly income, including $622 Social Security and $160 from the annuity he had purchased with his share of equitable distribution. Plaintiff\u2019s monthly income totals $1,641. His fixed assets total $19,580, which includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>$10,200 in an IRA account that is subject to payment of an income tax upon liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Defendant\u2019s monthly income, all unearned, is $971, including $280 Social Security. Her fixed assets total almost $70,000, including an automobile. Thus the effect of the $550 monthly alimony payments is to leave plaintiff with a monthly income of $1,091 and defendant with a monthly income of $1,521.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We cannot tell whether the award is fair because the judge made no findings as to the parties\u2019 circumstances. He merely recited the amount of plaintiff\u2019s reduced income and said that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s income has been substantially reduced by reason of his no longer being employed.\u201d The judge then said that \u201cthe Court sets a proper amount of support at the figure of $550.00 per month.\u201d He gave no reasons for establishing the alimony at that level or for assessing plaintiff $1,200 of defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Williams v. Williams, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>229, 232-234 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We reverse the order modifying alimony, fixing arrearages, and awarding attorney\u2019s fees, and remand for a reconsideration of these issues in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\">We culled these figures from the exhibits in appendices to the parties\u2019 briefs. There are some inconsistencies in the record so that the figures may be slightly inaccurate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b278-8\">LONG, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"APD\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">I concur in the determination of the majority to the extent that it mandates a remand for further proceedings. Such proceedings are in order because the judge failed to make findings to undergird the award of alimony and counsel fees and the setting of arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s pension payments are income for alimony purposes. They are not income at all.\u2019 Plaintiff and defendant divided the pot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>marital assets at the time of the divorce. In so doing, defendant took her share of plaintiff\u2019s pension in a lump sum. Plaintiff now receives his share of the pension periodically. Periodicity does not change the nature of the transaction or the character of the pension payments as assets and not income. This is not a situation in which a distributed asset generates or throws off income. In that event, the income would clearly be a part of the post-judgment alimony base. Here, the pension payments sought to be tapped by defendant as alimony are plaintiff\u2019s equitable share of the marital asset; as such they are not includable in the calculation of available income for an alimony award. It is not the fact that the pension was part of the marital distribution which is pivotal. It is that the pension is not income. Simply stated, no asset, however derived, should be considered part of the income available for alimony purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">This is not to say that assets of a party may not be considered by the court in determining how to allocate real income for an alimony award. Thus, for example, a court may see fit to award a dependent spouse a disproportionate share of the supporting spouse\u2019s actual income in consideration of a disproportion in their assets. That is a far cry from the majority\u2019s conclusion which essentially allows assets to be mixed with income as a basis for an alimony calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Noteworthy as well is that the majority opinion will operate to discourage lump sum settlements in cases involving pensions subject to future receipt. Most thoughtful matrimonial lawyers will advise their clients in continuing alimony cases to await the receipt of the pension for distribution at which time both spouses will receive their share in periodic payments. This will obviate the possibility that the dependent spouse will tap the asset twice. Whether a scheme which discourages lump sum settlements is good or bad is problematic. At least this much is certain, it will contravene the plain language of <em>Kikkert </em>encouraging such settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>To the extent that it can be shown that some percentage of plaintiff\u2019s pension payments were generated after the pension was distributed, that amount, unlike the distributed share, would be includable in the alimony income base. Likewise, insofar as the annuity payments can be analyzed so that that portion which is actually income <em>generated </em>by the $24,000 which plaintiff received in distribution can be segregated out, the segregated amount could be tapped for alimony as well. These matters, in my view, would be appropriate for the remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
