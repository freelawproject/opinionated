Smith and Nancy A. Smith (Smith), at 10 Jennifer Lane (Block 139A, Lot 5), Charles G. Savini and Barbara A. Savini (Savini), at 12 Jennifer Lane (Block 139A, Lot 7), and Marion R. Suffness (Suffness), at 14 Jennifer Lane (Block 139A, Lot 8), located in the Township of Warren.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">On appeal Smith, Savini and Suffness (defendants) contend the Tax Court erred in not affirming the lots\u2019 1981 tax year assessments established by the Somerset County Board of Taxation (county board). On cross-appeal the Township of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Warren (plaintiff) contends the Tax Court erred in not adopting the lots\u2019 valuations for the 1981 tax year established by Michael S. Sorich, a real estate appraiser and plaintiff's expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The three lots, containing defendants\u2019 single-family houses, abut a quarry to their rear. As of 1986, the houses ranged in age from 17 to 22 years. Defendants appealed plaintiff\u2019s 1976, 1979 and 1981 tax assessments to the county board, which substantially reduced the assessments for all three years. Plaintiff appealed the county board assessments for all three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Prior to the original Tax Court trial, plaintiff\u2019s 1981 appeals were \u201cjoined\u201d with its 1976 and 1979 appeals \u201cper agreement of all parties;\u201d however, on January 10, 1984, when the parties appeared for trial the Tax Court Judge noted \u201cneither side\u201d was \u201cready to go ahead\u201d with the 1981 appeals. He therefore consolidated only the 1976 and 1979 appeals \u201cfor purposes of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">On January 10,1984, Sorich testified as plaintiff\u2019s only expert witness. He used the \u201cmarket approach\u201d to value the three lots for all six tax years, 1976 through 1981, because, \u201cfor single-family residences,\u201d that approach was the \u201cbest methodology in terms of measuring value.\u201d Sorich also used the \u201ccost approach\u201d to value all three lots for all six tax years, but only to \u201ctest the plausibility of the market approach.\u201d He asserted that his market approach and his cost approach \u201ccorroborated each other\u201d for each lot and tax year, in the sense that the value conclusions yielded by each approach were \u201cclose\u201d in amount. At the conclusion of Sorich\u2019s testimony on January 10, 1984, his three written appraisals were entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">After both sides rested on January 20, 1984, the Tax Court Judge rendered an oral decision. The judge noted that defendants had presented no expert evidence and concluded that Sorich\u2019s evidence \u201cestablishes what the assessment should be on those three residential lots.\u201d The judge directed entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>separate judgments, in essence \u201caffirming the original assessment\u201d for each lot for the 1976 and 1979 tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">On appeal of that Tax Court ruling, we noted that Sorich established the lots\u2019 values for 1976 and 1979 \u201cby taking subsequent comparable sales and \u2018trending back\u2019 to the assessing dates and then corroborating those findings with cost approach assessment data.\u201d <em>Township of Warren v. Suffness, et al., </em>No. A-3281-83T5, slip op. at 3 (App.Div. November 27, 1985). When applied to the 1976 tax year, we concluded So-rich\u2019s approach contained a fatal flaw:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">This approach for the year 1976 was one of total hindsight and did not use facts known or reasonably foreseeable on the [October 1, 1975] assessment date____ All [comparable] sales utilized were subsequent to October 1, 1975. <em>[Id. </em>at 7].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">This violated the principle that \u201csales of comparable property\u201d subsequent to the pertinent \u201cdate of valuation ... may not be used as direct evidence of value but may be used only to corroborate value established by comparable sales which preceded that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Because of this flaw, we overturned the 1976 assessments of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">We found no fault with Sorich\u2019s approach when applied to the 1979 tax year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">Por the tax year 1979, although only one comparable sale preceded the [October 1, 1978] assessing date, we are satisfied, with the utilization of the trending and cost approach evaluation as corroborative evidence, there is sufficient credible evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s findings and conclusions. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins., Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484 (1974). <em>[Id. </em>at 8],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">We considered at that time the fact that Sorich attributed \u201cno value\u201d to the \u201cportion of each tract that lay beneath the easement\u201d since he \u201csimply treated each tract as if the easement area did not exist,\u201d thereby (in effect) reducing the \u201cland area attributable to ... [each defendant\u2019s] ownership ... by the area of the easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. We concluded defendants had \u201cno cause to complain\u201d about this, because Sorich\u2019s land-area-reduction approach for the easement \u201cresulted in a benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>... [defendants] because they were assessed for less land area [than they actually owned].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">The judgments of the Tax Court as to the 1976 assessment values are reversed and remanded for entry of judgments consonant with this opinion. The judgments of the Tax Court as to the 1979 assessment values are affirmed. <em>{Ibid.\\</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Defendants\u2019 petition for certification of our decision to the Supreme Court was denied. 104 <em>N.J. </em>377 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Thereafter, on October 17, 1986, the parties entered into an agreement regarding plaintiff\u2019s 1981 tax year appeal whereby they agreed that the court should review the record of the prior case, including the. exhibits and the appraisal reports, and the parties would supplement and comment on this record in lieu of a plenary trial of the 1981 tax year case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">However, at the formal trial session held on December 5, 1986, plaintiff\u2019s attorney argued that the \u201cprimary issue\u201d raised by defendants in the 1981 tax year appeal was the \u201ccompetency of ... [Sorich\u2019s] methodology of the evaluation.\u201d Because the Appellate Division had determined that Sorich\u2019s 1979 tax year appraisals were \u201csatisfactory,\u201d and because Sorich\u2019s 1981 tax year appraisals were based on \u201csubstantial comparables prior to the [October 1, 1980] assessment date,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s attorney claimed that the \u201cspecific issue which is the basis of the [1981 tax year] appeal has been resolved\u201d by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The Tax Court Judge replied that as he perceived the parties\u2019 mutual understanding as to how plaintiff's 1981 tax year appeal was to be tried, \u201cI did not understand that as requiring me to come to the same result that the Court came to in the 1979 [tax] year.\u201d The Tax Court Judge rejected plaintiff\u2019s argument stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">[I]t\u2019s my job to decide the correct assessment for 1981____[bjased upon the evidence that\u2019s presented to me. If I\u2019m presented with Mr. Sorich\u2019s [prior] testimony and appraisals, I\u2019ll consider those and I\u2019ll consider whatever [new] testimony the defendants have. And then I\u2019ll come to a separate, independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>determination [for the 1981 tax year] regardless of what the Appellate Division said or what Judge Conley said with respect to the 1979 [tax] year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">On May 15, 1987, the Tax Court Judge issued three substantially identical letter opinions, one for each lot, noting that none of the parties had presented him with any \u201cadditional appraisal testimony.\u201d He noted that Sorich\u2019s appraisals contained no deduction from the improvements\u2019 value for the adverse effect of the proximity to the quarry. The Tax Court Judge found that the \u201cdwelling house\u201d on each lot \u201chas been affected by the noise and dust caused by the quarry operation,\u201d and \u201c[cjracks in ... [each] house have occurred as a result of blasting operations at the quarry,\u201d which was in operation \u201con the October 1, 1980 assessing date.\u201d He concluded \u201ca deduction must be made for economic obsolescence.\u201d By this we assume he meant to include the loss in value due to the quarry proximity and operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The judge accepted Sorich\u2019s \u201cland\u201d valuation for each lot, which was based on Sorich\u2019s analysis of comparable \u201cland sales\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>via the market approach), \u201cbut excluded] ... [Sorich\u2019s] quarry proximity adjustment.\u201d That is, the judge accepted Sorich\u2019s \u201cvalue of the ... [lots\u2019] land ... before [Sorich\u2019s] adjustment for quarry proximity.\u201d He also accepted Sorieh\u2019s \u201ctotal depreciated cost of improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">From his \u201ctotal value\u201d for each lot\u2019s land and improvements, the judge deducted \u201c25% for the adverse effect of the easement and the proximity to the quarry\u201d by allocating a 25% deduction from his total value of each lot\u2019s land and a 25% deduction from his total value of each lot\u2019s improvements. \u201cIn adopting this value by the cost approach,\u201d he found it was \u201cconsistent with the market approach as reflected by [the comparable] sales utilized by\u201d Sorich.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Plaintiff contends that under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, the Tax Court should have accepted Sorich\u2019s appraisals as establishing the lots\u2019 October 1, 1980 values because defendants presented no expert valuation evidence to contradict Sorich\u2019s appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>We reject defendants\u2019 contention that plaintiff waived its right to raise these doctrines on appeal. As plaintiff asserts, while these doctrines were not specifically raised at trial, the \u201cessence\u201d of these doctrines was raised. The purpose of the law of the case doctrine is to avoid relitigation of the same issue \u201cin the same suit.\u201d <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 128 (App.Div.1985), mod. on other grounds 106 <em>N.J. </em>557 (1987). We think it is clear that the 1981 assessment case is separate from the earlier assessment cases. This is not a situation where the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><em>Res judicata </em>is the principle which bars a party from relitigating a second time what was litigated and finally determined the first time. The general requirements for its invocation are \u201ca final judgment by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, identity of issues, parties and cause of action and thing sued for.\u201d <em>City of Hackensack v. Winner, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 27-28 (App.Div.1978), mod. on other grounds 82 <em>N.J. </em>1 (1980). In tax proceedings the action on a prior tax year cannot preclude a taxpayer from litigating a subsequent tax year because \u201cidentity of cause of action is absent.\u201d <em>Gottdiener v. Roxbury Tp., </em>2 <em>N.J.Tax </em>206, 215 (Tax Ct.1981). Therefore, <em>res judicata </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of any issue that was \u201cactually determined in a prior action, generally between the same parties, involving a different claim or cause of action.\u201d <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>181,186 (1977). <em>Accord City of Hackensack, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 28. It is applicable to questions of fact, questions of law, and mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Gonzalez, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 187. Collateral estoppel applies not only to matters or facts that are directly in issue, but also to those necessary to support the judgment rendered in the prior action. <em>Allesandra v. Gross, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 105 (App.Div.1982). It does not extend to \u201cmatters or facts ... described as merely collateral or incidental.\u201d <em>Mazzilli v. Accident, etc., Casualty Ins. Co., etc., </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>307, 315 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>On this point <em>Gottdiener, </em>2 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 206, is instructive. In <em>Gottdiener </em>the taxpayers sought farmland assessment of their property for the tax years of 1972 and 1973 pursuant to the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-23.1 <em>et seq. </em>2 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 211. The Division of Tax Appeals, where the action originated, denied their claims for both years, which denials were affirmed by the Appellate Division. <em>Id. </em>at 211-12. The central issue in the 1972-1973 action concerned the \u201crequisite income requirements\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-23.5, which in pertinent part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Land, five acres in area, shall be deemed to be actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use when the gross sales of agricultural or horticultural products produced thereon <em>together </em>with any payments received under a soil conservation program have averaged at least $500.00 per year <em>during the 2-^year period immediately preceding the tax year in issue, </em>or there is clear evidence of anticipated yearly gross sales and such payments amounting to at least $500.00 within a reasonable period of time. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In relevant part, the Division\u2019s opinion found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">that the income to this land during the pertinent years was as follows: ... 1971 \u2014 $409.60 from soil conservation; and 1972 \u2014 $661.50 from soil conservation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">The application of the statutory language makes it clear that the income requirements for 1971 and 1972 were not satisfied. Income from a soil conservation program alone is insufficient in view of the word \u201ctogether\u201d which first makes it necessary to, at least, devote the land to an agricultural or horticultural use before considering soil conservation payments. [2 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 212],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">We affirmed the decision of the Division of Tax Appeals in an unpublished opinion. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">The taxpayers then sought farmland assessment of the same property for the tax years of 1974, 1975 and 1976. <em>Id. </em>at 211. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-23.5, the taxpayers\u2019 1974 application was \u201cbased on the income requirements of the two prior calendar years, 1973 and 1972.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212 n. 1. With regard to the taxpayers\u2019 1974 application, the Tax Court found that the township\u2019s \u201creliance on collateral estoppel is well taken ... because of the unique scheme found in the act,\u201d which \u201cnecessarily implicates the two succeeding calendar years to the tax years in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215. Therefore, the court dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the taxpayers\u2019 1974 farmland claim, since \u201cthe 1974 application could never succeed because for 1972, the statutory requirements were not satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215-16. However, the court rejected the township\u2019s contention that, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the \u201csame result should obtain to the 1975 claim\u201d and found this contention to be without merit, \u201csince there has not been a prior adjudication of any issues that would affect the 1975 tax year claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In establishing the lots' values on October 1, 1975 and October 1, 1978, Sorich\u2019s \u201cstarting point\u201d was the lots\u2019 values on October 1, 1980. This was the assessment valuation date for the 1981 tax year. By our November 27, 1985 decision, we affirmed the \u201c1979 assessment values\u201d established under the identical valuation approach, asserting that we were satisfied with the utilization of the trending back from the \u201c1980 value established,\u201d and the cost approach evaluation as corroborative evidence. We found sufficient credible evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Sorich\u2019s valuation determinations for October 1, 1975 and October 1, 1978 were wholly dependent upon his valuation determinations for October 1, 1980, which was the starting point for his trending back approach. Therefore, by necessity, the <em>accuracy </em>of Sorich\u2019s valuation determinations for October 1, 1975 and October 1, 1978 was wholly dependent upon the <em>accuracy </em>of his valuation determinations for October 1, 1980. Thus, our decision upholding the 1979 assessment values established by Sorich\u2019s approach, by necessity, upheld his 1980 assessment values because those values were the integral components of the other two assessments. Sorich\u2019s methodology was wholly dependent on the accurate establishment of the lots\u2019 October 1, 1980 values. Thus, because there has been a prior adjudication on the issues that establishes the lots\u2019 October 1, 1980 values, collateral estoppel should normally apply as to those issues. <em>See Gottdiener, 2 N.J.Tax </em>at 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Plaintiff correctly contends that, subject only to the ability of the defendant in this 1981 case to present new facts or expert opinions which were not considered in the prior proceedings, the Tax Court should have considered Sorich\u2019s appraisals to be \u201cas probative\u201d for the 1981 assessment year as they were \u201cdetermined to be for the 1979 assessment year; if not more so, since the year in question [1981] is the base year of the [1979] appraisal[s],\u201d and since the 1981 appraisals do not \u201crequire any trending [back] to reach a valuation for the year in question.\u201d Thus, while the Tax Court was \u201cnot required to come to the same valuation as the 1979 case,\u201d it would ordinarily be required to accept the appraisal with the same full force and effect as it was accepted by this court unless new evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Tax Court Judge erred in concluding that the \u201cprior Appellate Division decision is not determinative of value for the 1981 tax year,\u201d simply because \u201cthe appraisal[s] relied on there did not fully adjust for adverse market factors for the 1981 tax year.\u201d We specifically affirmed without qualification the Tax Court\u2019s assessments for 1979, thereby establishing the validity of Sorich\u2019s deduction decisions concerning the easement\u2019s effect on the value of the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The issue of the adverse effect of the easement and the proximity of the quarry was before us in the prior proceeding. Not only did plaintiff\u2019s expert exclude the value of the land encompassing the easement, he also reduced comparable land values by about 30% to reflect the land\u2019s \u201cproximity to that particular quarry area.\u201d The Tax Court was clearly prevented by collateral estoppel from disturbing the prior valuations placed on the land for 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Less clear is the question of whether the Tax Court should be prevented from considering the economic impact of the quarry upon the value of the improvements. Sorich took the firm stance that there was no functional loss in the utility of the homes because of the quarry\u2019s presence, and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>as noted by the Tax Court Judge, he made no deduction from the value of the improvements. This shortcoming was not directly put in issue before this court in the prior proceeding. While it can be cogently argued that the property owners are foreclosed in this proceeding from raising the issue because of collateral estoppel, we are satisfied that the interests of justice favor not precluding the correction of this error. <em>Cf. Brown v. Brown, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 374 (App.Div.1986). These <em>pro se </em>property owners in their prior appeal appear to have recognized the issue but only in relation to the expert\u2019s use of comparables. We did not decide the issue in the context now raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We are convinced, as was the Tax Court Judge, that the failure of the expert to make a deduction from the value of the improvements for their proximity to the quarry was improper. To allow such an error to continue when specifically brought to the attention of a judicial tribunal would be a miscarriage of justice. The invoking of the doctrine of collateral estoppel cannot be allowed to perpetuate such an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">For the first time in their reply brief defendants contend that the entire controversy rule requires dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s 1981 tax year complaints. To raise this issue initially in a reply brief is improper. <em>State v. Smith, 55 N.J. </em>476, 488 (1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 400 <em>U.S. </em>949, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>232, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970). <em>Accord City of Elizabeth v.

Further, on January 10, 1984, all parties implicitly agreed not to consider plaintiff\u2019s 1981 tax year complaints at that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Because the houses on the three lots are \u201colder residential homes,\u201d defendants contend the Tax Court erred in \u201cutilizing the cost approach as the primary and only method to determine market value of ... [their] residential properties for October 1, 1980.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">No single approach must be followed in valuing real property; no particular approach is required or excluded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>assessing true value. <em>Pantasote Co. v. City of Passaic, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, 414 (1985). Which approach should predominate depends upon the facts of the particular matter, and the reaction to them by the experts. <em>New Brunswick v. State of N.J.

Penney Co., Inc. v. Lawrence Tp., </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>473, 479 (Tax Ct.1986). But the roles of each approach have been reversed in valuing older residential property. Consider <em>Rumson Bor. v. Peckham, </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>539 (Tax Ct.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In computing value \u201cby the cost approach,\u201d the Tax Court Judge noted it was \u201cconsistent\u201d with Sorich\u2019s market approach as reflected by the comparable sales utilized by Sorich. We cannot agree with defendants that the cost approach was the only approach used to determine the lots\u2019 values. Rather, the judge corroborated his cost approach with Sorich\u2019s market approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Defendants contend the Tax Court erred in adopting a totally unsupported opinion of value for the depreciated cost of the homes. Any error was harmless in that the court\u2019s application of the cost approach yielded results \u201cconsistent\u201d with Sorich\u2019s market approach which we validated in our earlier decision. Defendants did not attack Sorich\u2019s opinion of the cost of the homes based on their \u201cquality of construction classification\u201d not being supplied by Sorich.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">We next consider whether the Tax Court erred in \u201carbitrarily quantifying\u201d his 25% deductions without supporting basis or foundation in the record. The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201con <em>de novo </em>review, the Tax Court may determine a true value different from the original assessment, the County Board\u2019s assessment, or the taxpayer\u2019s valuation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Pantasote Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 416. But the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cright to make an independent assessment is not boundless.\u201d <em>F.M.C. Stores Co. v. Borough of Morris Plains, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>418, 430 (1985). The Tax Court\u2019s independent assessment \u201cmust be based on the evidence before it and the data that are properly at its disposal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Tax Court has \u201cthe duty to apply its own judgment to valuation data submitted by experts in order to arrive at a true value and find an assessment for the years in question.\u201d <em>New Cumberland Corp. v. Roselle, </em>3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>345, 353 (Tax Ct.1981). <em>Accord Glen Wall Associates v. Wall Tp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>265, 280 (1985). <em>See also Samuel Hird &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

Jackson Tp., </em>9 <em>N.J.Tax </em>66, 79 (Tax Ct.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">With regard to the quarry operated on the October 1, 1980 valuation date, the Tax Court Judge found that the \u201cdwelling house\u201d on each lot had been affected by the noise and dust caused by the quarry operation, and cracks had occurred in each house as a result of quarry blasting operations. The Tax Court Judge had the right to apply his own judgment in making an independent assessment of the true values. His deduction from the value of each lot\u2019s improvements to account for the adverse effect of the lot\u2019s proximity to the quarry in the absence of expert evidence to support such a deduction is sustainable because it is so clearly logical and reasonable that the value of the improvement will be affected by the adverse quarry condition. The judge reasonably articulated why a deduction must be made, although he did not reveal how he arrived at his 25% deduction for quarry impact. Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the figure is not unreasonable or arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in light of Sorich\u2019s deduction of 30% when considering the quarry\u2019s impact on the value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Defendants contend that when the Tax Court Judge concluded Sorich\u2019s appraisals and testimony were \u201cinadequate to determine the true market value\u201d of the lots, his \u201conly recourse\u201d was to affirm the county board assessments for 1981. Therefore, defendants assert, the judge \u201cwent beyond the constraints of the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s guidelines\u201d in <em>Pantasote Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>408, when he made an \u201cindependent determination of value\u201d for each lot for 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">When a municipality seeks to establish a value for the taxpayer\u2019s property which exceeds the value established by the county board\u2019s judgment, the taxpayer is \u201cfavored by the nonstatutory presumption of correctness of the county board\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Rumson Bor., </em>7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 549. <em>See also Rodwood Gardens, Inc. v. Summit, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 38 (App. Div.1982) (on appeal to the Tax Court, the county board judgment is \u201cpresumed to be correct\u201d). Therefore, the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cright to make an independent assessment\u201d is curtailed by this \u201cpresumption of validity.\u201d <em>F.M.C. Stores Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 430-31. As the Supreme Court phrased it in <em>Pantasote Co.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">We recognize that on <em>de novo </em>review, the Tax Court may determine a true value different from the original assessment, the County Board\u2019s assessment, or the taxpayer\u2019s valuation. [Citations omitted]. This does not mean that the court must make an independent finding of value based only upon evidence that is brought before it without regard to the presumptive validity of the assessment. [Citation omitted]. Rather, the Tax Court must give weight to the presumption of validity that attaches to the original [or county board] assessment. <em>Only if it finds that the presumption has been overcome by cogent evidence, </em>or there are sufficient collateral grounds, such as an assessment totally unrelated to true value or one derived from a patently arbitrary and capricious assessment methodology, <em>does it become necessary for the court independently to determine true value, </em>and, in that event, to support its own decision in departing from the presumptively valid assessment. [100 <em>N.J. </em>at 416-17, emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We noted in our earlier decision that on January 20, 1984, the Tax Court Judge concluded that Sorich\u2019s appraisal evidence for the 1976 and 1979 tax years was sufficient to overcome the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d attached to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>county board assessments for 1976 and 1979. Sorich's appraisals for the 1979 tax year by necessity established the lots' values as of the 1979 appraisals\u2019 October 1,1980 starting point. Sorich\u2019s appraisals for the 1981 tax year utilized comparable sales that preceded the October 1,1980 assessment date for the 1981 tax year. Therefore, in concluding that Sorich\u2019s appraisal evidence adequately supported the Tax Court\u2019s finding that this evidence sufficiently overcame the presumption of correctness of the county board judgments for the 1979 tax year, we also implicitly concluded this same evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption of correctness of the county board judgments for the 1981 tax year. Consequently, the Tax Court Judge could make an independent determination of value for the 1981 tax year without violating the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cguidelines\u201d in <em>Pantasote Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We affirm the Tax Court judgment fixing the assessment of the improvements as to each lot. We reverse as to its changes in the assessments of the land in each case. We remand for entry of judgment in accordance with our holding herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
