He does not, however, allege bad faith, fraud, or collusion by his attorney with any State official, nor does he allege that he complained to the court concerning his court-appointed counsel or requested the right to take the stand. <em>Habeas corpus </em>is inappropriate under the circumstances and cannot be made to serve the purpose of an appeal or a new trial on the question of innocence or guilt. <em>Sykes v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 662, 663; <em>Barker v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 662, 667; <em>Buffington v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Applicant further alleges that one of the State\u2019s witnesses committed perjury. We have held repeatedly that in the absence of facts establishing the knowing participation by State officials in the use of perjured testimony, the mere allegation that it was used is insufficient to justify the issuance of the writ. <em>Ramberg v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 631, 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The final allegation is that unfavorable publicity caused prejudice against him. Although this could have been raised on appeal, it cannot serve as a ground for <em>habeas corpus. Randall v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 667, 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
