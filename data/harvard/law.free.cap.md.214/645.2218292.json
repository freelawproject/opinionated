Petitioner contends that it was never shown that he was the third person involved in the burglary, and that there was no actual proof by witnesses or testimony that he was involved. These complaints go to the sufficiency of the evidence, which cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
