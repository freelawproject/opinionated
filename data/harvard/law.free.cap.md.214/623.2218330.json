Petitioner was tried and convicted on a narcotics charge in the Criminal Court of Baltimore and sentenced to five years in the Maryland State Penitentiary on November 13, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">The contentions of the petitioner follow: (1) that he was illegally arrested; (2) that he was afforded no preliminary hearing; (3) that he was not allowed bail; and (4) that he did not receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">The petition contains little more than a review of the facts which were submitted to the jury. <em>Habeas corpus </em>cannot be used to re-try a criminal case. <em>Canter v. Warden, </em>207 Md. 616, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">Legality of arrest and failure to grant petitioner a preliminary hearing are matters to be raised on appeal and do not constitute grounds for the issuance of <em>habeas corpus. Spence v. Warden, </em>204 Md. 661, 662; <em>Hickman v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 668, 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">Petitioner\u2019s contention concerning bail is without merit. Judge Cullen, in denying the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the lower court, states: \u201cThe records of the Criminal Court show that bail of'three thousand dollars was set for the petitioner by one of the Judges of the Supreme Bench * (* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>In any event, after conviction the denial of bail will not support the writ of <em>habeas corpus.
