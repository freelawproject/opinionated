Upon being denied a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>by Judge Allen, he now makes application to appeal from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">He sets forth three contentions in support of his application : (1) that his conviction and confinement are in violation of his constitutional rights; (2) that he was convicted solely on the testimony of a co-defendant, who was not a credible witness; and (3) that he is a pauper who lacks funds with which to seek a new trial or an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">(1) . Where, as in this case, a petitioner for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>does not set forth any <em>facts </em>showing how he has been deprived of constitutional rights, the mere allegation that he has been so deprived will not suffice as a basis for the granting of the writ. <em>Lucas v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 645, 120 A. 2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">(2) . It is well settled that attacks on the competency, admissibility or sufficiency of the evidence cannot serve as the basis for the granting of the writ. <em>Snyder v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 606, 133 A. 2d 924; <em>Thompson v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 628, 120 A. 2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">(3) . The petitioner\u2019s allegations under (3) cannot make an application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>serve as a substitute for a motion for a new trial or a direct appeal. <em>Walker v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 290, 55 A. 2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
