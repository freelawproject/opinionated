Ordinarily, any punishment authorized by a statute and imposed by a court within the statutory limits is not \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment within the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and is not subject to review by us even on appeal from the judgment. <em>Frazier v. Warden, </em>205 Md. 654, 656, 109 A. 2d 78. Therefore at least twenty years of the sentence is plainly legal. If we assume, without deciding, that the question of whether the sentences, in the aggregate, constitute cruel and unusual punishment is a proper one to be raised in <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings; clearly, the question is prematurely brought until the petitioner has served at least twenty years thereof. <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 255, 111 A. 2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This Court has repeatedly held that the allegation that counsel did .not adequately protect the rights of an accused is not a ground for the granting of a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in the absence of any allegations of fraud, collusion with State officials or objections raised in the trial court. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>213 Md. 625, 130 A. 2d 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
