The record shows that he was represented at trial by court-appointed counsel, and it fails to indicate that he was deprived of any constitutional rights or that he claimed at the trial that he was. <em>Lucas v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 645, 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Ford\u2019s complaint that his attorney caused him great harm, standing alone, likewise will not support a writ of <em>habeas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>corpus. </em>He does not allege bad faith, fraud or collusion by his counsel with any State official, nor does he allege that he complained to the trial judge concerning his court-appointed attorney. <em>Sykes v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 662, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Petitioner\u2019s claim that the Criminal Court of Baltimore had not the jurisdiction to try him, inasmuch as he was apprehended outside the State, is without merit; obviously, a court can lawfully try a defendant who commits a crime within its jurisdiction. <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U. S. 519, 96 L. Ed. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The contention 'that the applicant was unconstitutionally denied a new trial cannot serve as ground for <em>habeas corpus. </em>This Court has held repeatedly that the granting or refusal to grant a new trial is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and that we will not review, even on appeal, the rulings of the trial court on motions for new trials or the denial thereof. <em>Legrand v. Warden, </em>205 Md. 662, 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Any matters of alleged prejudice on the part of the trial judge, defects in the indictment, or sufficiency of the evidence are available for .consideration on appeal but may not be considered on <em>habeas corpus. </em>The allegations as to the prejudice show that applicant thinks the trial judge prejudiced because he said that he thought that the accused did not steal the car but did use it knowing it to be stolen, and because he would not order a mental examination before sentencing him. <em>Barker v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 662, 665; <em>Ahern v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 679, 680; <em>Whitley v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 629, 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
