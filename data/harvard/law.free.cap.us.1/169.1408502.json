Kunckel, the petitioner, set forth in his affidavit, that one of the plaintiffs, Boom, with whom he had been in partnership, had dissolved their connection, since the commencement of the action, and that the outstanding debts had been assigned to Kunckel, so as to vest in him the whole interest in the event of the action. It was also stated, that Kunckel was about to depart from the United States ; but that Boom had no such intention.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"aso-dedup-0\"><em>Rawle, </em>for the plaintiff. <em>Bradford, </em>for the defendant. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-8\">The <em>Attorney- General, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ajs-dedup-0\">objected, that, by thus assigning the interest in an action to a going foreigner, a special court, and an early judgment, might always be within reach, to the prejudice not only of the defendants but of other creditors. And upon this ground, the Court unanimously refused the prayer of the petition.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b193-19\"> See McCarty <em>v. </em>Nixon, <em>write, </em>p. 78; Ex parte Holker, 2 Dall. 111</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then moved, that he ought not to be deprived of his bail, by this application ; which, requiring a declaration to be previously filed, amounted to an acceptance of a common appearance, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">In the justice of this motion, the Court concurred, and accordingly, directed a rule to be entered, that the defendant give bail in two months, or a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b193-18\">ia) The practice is now well settled to be otherwise. It has been repeatedly determined, that filing a declaration is not a waiver of special bail. See Caton v. McCarty, 2 Dall. 141; 1 Yeates 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
