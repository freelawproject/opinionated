Defendant showed a deed for one thousand acres of land ; also a warrant to himself and two others to take up three thousand acres of land, which included the lands in controversy ; also a power of attorney to David Lloyd to take care of said land, and an account of the exj&gt;enses of survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-15\">Defendart having shown title in a third person, as he conceived, moved for a nonsuit, and as authorities, cited Bull. Nisi Prius ; Instit. Leg., title Eject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel insisted to know whether the defendant had gone through all his evidence, and said that he was not entitled to the opinion of the court until then, upon his title in a third person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-17\">But the Court determined <em>contrd ; </em>and then gave their opinion that, as the defendant\u2019s deed was a conditional deed upon the face of it, he was not entitled to a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-18\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then contended, that they had a right to demur to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the defendant\u2019s evidence. This was opposed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, who insisted, they had a right to go through their evidence, before the demurrer was allowed. Of which opinion the Court also was ; and the defendant proceeded with his evidence, among which was a letter from William Penn, the first, acknowledging this sale and grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\">The plaintiff afterwards offered a subsequent letter of William Penn\u2019s, declaring the grant to be conditional; and, as this condition was not performed, the grantees should not have the land. This the defendant\u2019s counsel opposed, on the principle that no man could create evidence for himself.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-7\">\n<em>Tilghman.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFO\">Letters are like conversation, when the whole must be given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AR0\"><em>Dickenson, </em>on the same side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aju\">offered these authorities: 12 Vin. 101.

A verdict passed for the plaintiff (defendant), by which the sense of the jury was, that the non-performance of conditions of settlement did not avoid the grant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
