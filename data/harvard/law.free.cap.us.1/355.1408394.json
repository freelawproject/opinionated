In both actions, judgment had been entered) generally, on the 28th day of April 1788, with an agreement in each, that the <em>quantum </em>should be ascertained by a reference, and a report made to nex.t term. The referees, however, were not appointed until the 8th of July 1788, six days after the commencement of the term, and they made no report until the 5th of August following ; when one report was made in favor of the plaintiffs, for one sum, including what was due in both actions. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>the 8th of August, the plaintiffs applied for writs of execution ; but, :pon the prothonotary\u2019s expressing a doubt as to the manner of issuing them, on account of this consolidation of the sums in the report, the plaintiffs prevailed on the referees, separately, and without the consent or knowledge of the defendant, to sign the following explanatory certificate : \u201c For the better explanation of our report in the actions of John Hart and Chamloss Hart against Benjamin James, we find due to the plaintiffs in the first action the sum of 325i. 19s. <em>5d., </em>and, in the second, the sum of 668i. 2s. <em>9d.\u201d </em>This certificate was filed on the 15th of August, when writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were taken out, without giving notice of the report to the defendant; who, however, accidentally heard of it, and on the 18th of August, after the executions were issued, he filed the following exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">*1.
