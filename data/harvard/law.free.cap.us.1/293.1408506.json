The three referees met, though only two of them signed the report; and now <em>Lawrence </em>moved to set it aside, on account of this variance between the rule and the agreement of the parties, offering to examine a witness, who was present at the transaction, to show that it was intended all the referees should concur.

To prove a name meant, or a fraud committed, and some other similar circumstances, were, he insisted, the only exceptions to this principle.

If this was his mistake, it certainly ought not to bear against the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-10\">The witness being examined, and having proved the defendant\u2019s allegation, the opposite counsel contended, that as the rule had been before the eferees and was inspected, not only by them, but by the parties, it' was tro te to make the objection : for, it would be unjust to allow this advantage the defendant, after the whole business had been discussed, and the report reed upon.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\n<em>*Lawrence</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADHT\">proposed reading some eases to show, that the authority given to the referees, by the act of the parties, ought to have been strictly pursued.
