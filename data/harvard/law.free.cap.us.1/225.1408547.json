Subsequently to his discharge, the defendant bought sundry goods of him, and when the price was demanded, tendered Splecit\u2019s bond in payment, an assignment of which he had purchased for that purpose. The plaintiff, refusing to accept it, brought this action, and on the trial, the defendant offered to give the bond in evidence, by way of set-off ; in consequence of which, the balance wonld have been turned in his favor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-10\"><em>Sergeant, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"asv-dedup-1\">opposed the admission of the bond in evidence, and cited Bull.

An insolvent debtor could never get forward in the world, if his old bonds, and other negotiable papers, were thus capable of being put in force against him. A debt of 501. might be bought for 50s. and the debtor, after his discharge, be liable, by such negotiations, to be defeated in every action, and baffled in every contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>But tlie law is clear, that the assignment being <em>after </em>the insolvency, the defendant can be in no better condition than the assignor, who could only come in for a dividend.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The evidence was overruled, and <em>Levy </em>tendered a bill of exceptions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
