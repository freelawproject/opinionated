The indictment being originally found at the City Court, in October sessions, 1779, was removed by <em>certiorari </em>into this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-9\">And now, Lewis, for the defendant, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2P\">that false tokens are only indictable by the stat. of 33 <em>Hen.

Tho public, indeed, could not, by common prudence, prevent the fraud, as the defendant was himself the officer of the public <em>pro hdc vice. </em>They were, therefore, of the opinion, that the offence was indictable, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> .</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b63-18\"><em> </em>See the note to Respublica v.
