Gilb. on Dist. 67, 176; 1 Bac. Abr. 207.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-16\"><em>Levy, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD3q\">stated the history, nature and duties of the sheriff\u2019s office from Robertson\u2019s Charles the Fifth, 1 Vol. p. 213, and contended, that if a sheriff discharged his duty <em>bond fide, </em>and with reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>diligence, lie was not responsible for consequences which no human foresight could penetrate or prevent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-5\">Shippen, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AqLy\">The only point for decision is, whether the sheriff is responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties at the time of taking the bond; or at the end of the suit, when the landlord has established his right to the rent for which the goods were distrained ?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The case of a bail-bond differs, I think, in one respect, at least, from a replevin-bond; for the sufficiency of the former may speedily be inquired into, but the latter must wait the event of the replevin, which may be suspended for several years, until, perhaps, by the vicissitudes of trade and fortune, the sureties have become insolvent. This, therefore, is certainly a hard part of the sheriff\u2019s duty. But there is likewise a hardship in the case of the landlord; for, by the replevin, he is divested of the immediate security of his tenant\u2019s goods, and yet has no right to interfere in the choice of the sureties that undertake to see them returned when he has established his demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">From this view, then, it certainly seems reasonable, that he, who is exclusively authorised to take and judge of the security, should rather be affected by its eventual insufficiency, than he who has no right to question its validity. The authorities, indeed, are positive, that, if the sureties do not prove sufficient, the sheriff is liable; and, although the case must frequently have happened, no contrary decisions can be produced; for in <em>Murdoch </em>v. <em>Will [ante, </em>p. 341) and <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>both lately tried here, the counsel put the eases upon the point of insufficiency of the sureties at the time of taking them; so that the present jioint never came in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">That the policy of the law in this respect bears hard upon the sheriff, may be a reason with the legislature to make some new provision for an inquiry into the sufficiency of the bail, in an earlier stage of the cause;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but cannot be a justification for our deciding, at this time, contrary to an established principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The Court are, therefore, clearly of opinion, that the verdict, on the question of law, ought to be in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">And, accordingly, the jury gave the plaintiff damages to the value of the goods at the time they were distrained, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"><em> </em>The same point was decided by the supreme court, in Pearce <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 14 S. &amp; R. 23. Judge Duncah, who delivered the opinion of the court, alluding to the alleged hardship of the rule towards the sheriff, said, \u201c with all this impression of the hardship of the case, the court, thirty-eight years ago adhered to the ancient law, which no supposed hardship would justify a departure from: the decision of Oxley v. Cowperthwaite has ever since been received as the law of the land.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\"> The acts of 10th April 1873 (P. L. 776), and 19th May 1871 (P.
