L. 412), which entitles a defendant to a stay of execution, for a certain time, upon tendering the interest and costs to the sheriff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-14\"><em>Bradford, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ard\">was prepared with an affidavit to controvert the facts advanced in support of the motion ; but he forbore reading it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>insisted that the court could not travel into a consideration of the transactions for which the bond was given.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b99-17\"> This case appears, from Mr. Rawle\u2019s MSS., to have been argued in March 1758, and not in 1784, as would seem from its place in the text. This explanation is necessary, since the question was upon the construction of an act passed on the 23d of December 1784.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-6\">By this Court.</author>\n<p id=\"afl-dedup-0\">It would occasion infinite trouble and confusion, were the defendant\u2019s doctrine to be admitted, and it is impossible to say where the mischief would end. It is true, that before a jury, proof may be made of the consideration, and of the time of delivering a bond; but this act of assembly, which, in particular cases, grants a delay of execution to the defendant, upon the tender of the interest and costs, must, surely, at the same time, recognise the written instrument as conclusive evidence of the contract; and we can inquire no further, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Wilcoolcs </em>took nothing by his motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\"> See Field v.
