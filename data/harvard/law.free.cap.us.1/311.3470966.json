The tract was .parcel of a larger tract, known as the \u201cRancho of Old and New San Jacinto.\u201d Two grants had been made of parts from this general tract; <em>the surplus embracing, in fact, about eleven leagues, </em>being that which was claimed by the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\">Having presented a petition to the Board of Commissioners, appointed by act of March 3d, 1851, to ascertain and settle private land claims in California, for a confirmation of his claim, D\u2019Aguirre\u2019s title as it appeared before the board was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-12\">His original petition to the prefect for the land, made in behalf of his wife, set forth \u201cthat there was remaining a sobrante,\u201d in the tract or rancho of San Jacinto, and that his wife, \u201c requiring the said <em>remnant, </em>. . . solicited the prefect\u2019s assistance to obtain the <em>mentioned land, </em>the extent of which was aboutjfoe leagues, more or less,\u201d within the limits of the known rancho of San Jacinto, \u201cthe general plat of which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in the office of the Secretary of State, and shown in its total extent that <em>it is bounded thus: north by the ranchos of Jurwpa and San Bernardino, south by Temecula, west by Unapia, and east by Gorgonia.\u201d </em>The petition continued: \u201cYour honor will also cause <em>previous observations </em>to be taken.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">The petition to the prefect was followed by the report of that officer to the governor upon it.

The board of commissioners considered that it only carried five, and rejected D\u2019Aguirre\u2019s claim for the entire surplus of eleven. But on appeal, the District Court was of a different opinion, and confirmed the claim: giving to D\u2019Aguirre the surplus remaining within the boundaries of the general tract, to the extent of eleven square <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Teagues, unless there was less than eleven within such boundaries, in which case of such less quantity the confirmation was limited to it. It was from this decree that the United States took the present appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-5\">\n<em>Mr. Wills, for the United States :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3p\">There has been here, to say no more, such plain misconception on the part of the Mexican government as to what it was granting \u2014 that misconception being brought about by misrepresentation <em>of facts </em>on the part of D\u2019Aguirre \u2014 that the court will withhold its aid. Certainly the <em>quantity </em>of land which the government would convey entered largely into its determination, whether it would or would not convey it all; and when D\u2019Aguirre represented that the \u201c sobrante\u201d or surplus contained <em>five </em>leagues or perhaps less, when in fact it contained more than double the amount of five, there is such error as the court will relieve against. The surplus is but the subject of the grant, and justice will be done by giving five leagues in the surplus described.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">In <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Fossat,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court decided that where there is no natural boundary or descriptive call for the termination of lines of a tract of land, and the quantity called for in the grant is \u201c one league of the larger size, <em>a little more or less,\u201d </em>the survey must include <em>only a league. </em>The words <em>ua little more or less must he rejected.\u201d </em>It is also decided, in <em>Yontz </em>v. <em>The United </em>States,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that the generality of the grant may be sustained by the words of the petition; that the petition and the concession must be taken as <em>one act, </em>and the extent of the grant limited by the prayer of the petition. In that case the grant was limited to the <em>two leagues </em>prayed for in the petition.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-7\">\n<em>Mr. Williams, contra:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6e\">The papers in the case iterate and reiterate that the grant is for the surplus. There is not in one of them, except in the petition itself, which also is for the \u201c surplus,\u201d an allusion to quantity; and the petitioner re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>quests the Mexican government to take <em>\u201c </em>observations\u201d previously to granting. Every part of the case shows also, that the government proceeded not less advisedly than it did in every ease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-5\">The cases cited do not apply. The decision in <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Fossat </em>was, that the call <em>in the grant </em>for \u201c one league, a little more or less,\u201d must be taken as \u201c one league\u201d when located and surveyed by the United States. In the ease at bar no quantity is named in the grant, and the only limitartion is that prescribed by the colonization law, namely, eleven leagues.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">In <em>Yontz </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>the petitioner confined his application to \u201c two leagues, a little more or less.\u201d The grant named no quantity, but reserved the surplus. The surplus of what? Clearly of the two leagues applied for. But there is no reservation of the surplus in the grant to D\u2019Aguirre. On the contrary, the petition was for the <em>surplus, </em>which surplus he <em>estimated </em>at five leagues, a little more or less. The distinction is plain.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> 20 Howard, 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\"> 23 Id., 498.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-7\">Mr. Justice FIELD</author>\n<p id=\"ACx\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The only question for consideration in this ease relates to the quantity embraced by the grant to the claimant. The District Court confirmed her title to lands lying within certain designated boundaries, not exceeding in extent eleven square leagues, if any surplus over that quantity existed. The United States seek to restrict the confirmation to five square leagues, and base their appeal on the language of the petition upon which the grant was made. It appears from the record that two previous grants had been issued for land situated within a tract known as the \u201cSancho of Old and New San Jacinto,\u201d and that a surplus still remained. For this surplus the petition was presented, and to the description of the land which it gives, these words are added: \u201cthe extent of which is about five leagues, more or less.\u201d It is upon these words, as showing that the petition was only for five leagues, that the counsel of the government rely. But it is evident that they constitute a mere conjectural estimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>of the extent of the surplus. The petition is for the grant of a specific tract, not for any particular quantity. The report of the prefect, to whom the petition was in the first instance presented, to be forwarded to the governor, describes the land \u201c as that remaining vacant from the Old and New San Jacinto,\u201d and does not mention its extent. The concession of the governor declares to the claimant, <em>\u201c </em>the property in fee of the land'remaining in Old and New San Jacinto,\u201d and .does not designate any quantity. The formal grant issued recites that the claimant has solicited \u201c the overplus land resulting from the rancho of Old and New San Jacinto,\u201d and the third condition annexed describes the land \u201c of which donation is made,\u201d in similar terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is clear upon the face of the papers that the original concession and formal grant were for the entire surplus remaining within the designated boundaries, subject only to the limitation imposed by the colonization law of 1824, upon the power of the governor. As he could only cede to the extent of eleven square leagues, the grant could only convey that quantity whatever the amount of the overplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The case of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Fossat,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the case of <em>Yontz </em>v. <em>The United </em>States,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> have no application. In the Fossat case the grant was in terms restricted to one league, and it provided for the measurement of the quantity granted and the reservation of the surplus. In the case at bar no quantity is named, and the only limitation is that prescribed by the law of 1824. In the Yontz case the grantee expressly confined his application <em>\u201c </em>to two leagues, more or less,\u201d ac cording to certain designated boundaries. The grant did not mention any quantity, but provided for the measurement of the tract and the reservation of the surplus. The court in deciding the case very justly observed, that if the boundaries were conclusively defined in the grant, no surplus could be thrown off by a survey, and therefore construed the grant in connection with the petition, and held that the two leagues mentioned in the petition were to be surveyed within the larger tract; in this way only was the conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>clause as to measurement and surplus made consistent with the previous language of the grant. The case at bar is entirely dissimilar. Here the grant mentions no quantity, and reserves no surplus, but on the contrary the third condition expressly requires the magistrate who gives possession to advise the government of the number of square leagues the tract may contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\"> 20 Howard, 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> 23 Id., 499.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
