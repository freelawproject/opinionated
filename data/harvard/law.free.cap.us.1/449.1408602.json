It appeared also, that the latter power of attorney was only authenticated by proof of the handwriting of the party, and of the subscribing witnesses, before the mayor of this city.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-14\"><em>Lewis </em>moved,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWR\">that the defendant might be discharged, by virtue of the release.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-15\"><em>Du Ponceau </em>objected :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN_\">1st, That the authentication of the <em>general </em>power of attorney was not agreeable to the act of assembly: and 2d, That a <em>general . </em>power is not a revocation of a <em>special, </em>one.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-16\"><em>Lewis </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai5M\">that the question was not, whether a general power is a revocation of the special one ; but whether it was a sufficient authority for granting the release. On this, he said, there could be no doubt; and with respect to the mode of authentication, he observed, that the act of assembly relates only to powers executed in a foreign country, and leaves the matter here to common-law proof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The Court</author>\n<p id=\"AH6-\">were of opinion, that the <em>general </em>power was sufficient for the purpose of the release ; and having directed the person acting under it, to enter an acknowledgment of satisfaction on the record, they ordered the defendant to be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
