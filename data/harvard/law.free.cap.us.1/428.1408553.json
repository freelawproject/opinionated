The declaration also contained a count in the nature of deceit; but by agreement of the counsel, it made no part of the argument, whether this could properly be coupled with the <em>assumpsit / </em>so that the motion for a new trial was supported only upon these grounds : 1st, That the action of <em>assumpsit </em>would not lie ; and 2d, That the deed ought not to have been given in evidence upon the trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-12\">For the <em>defendant,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdO8\">it was contended, that, as there was no suggestion o\u00ed fraud to vitiate and annul the original contract of the parties, the proper action was covenant, on the words grant, bargain, &lt;fcc.; that if there was fraud, the remedy was an action of deceit; that <em>assumpsit </em>would not lie ; that if there was any deceit in the words of the deed, still the action might have been brought upon the deed itself ; that a deed cannot be given in evidence, to support an action of <em>indebitatus assumpsit; </em>that there was no proof of a parol <em>assumpsit; </em>and that the defendant could not plead a verdict in the present suit, in bar to another action of covenant upon the deed. See Com. Dig. 145, <em>F; </em>1 Cowp. 414, 418, 818, 819; Doug. 132; 1 State Laws 79; 1 Salk. 210; Cro. Jac. 506; 1 Roll. Abr. 278; 1 Vin. Abr. 277; 2 W. Black. 1249; Gilb.

See Salk. 22; 1 Lev. 102; Bull. N. P. 31; 2 Str. 915; 1 Ld. Raym. 742; 2 Burr. 1088; Salk. 284.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The case being held for some days under advisement, the chief justice now delivered the opinion of the court to the following effect:</p>\n<author id=\"b462-6\">McKean, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak5o\">It is unnecessary at this time to determine, whether the plaintiff might have instituted an action of covenant, or deceit, in order to obtain a redress of the wrong which he has sustained ; for we think it is sufficient for his purpose, that an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received to his use, has been brought; and that, to maintain this action, he may give in evidence, that the defendant got his money by mistake, imposition or deceit. To prove the alleged mistake, imposition or dece^\u2019 *c^ee^-s or \u00b0tiber writings, which are not the immediate foundation -I of the suit, but only leading to it, may be read. We are all, therefore, of opinion, that a new trial ought not to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b462-13\"> In Weaver v. Bentley, 1 Caines 48, Judge Livingston is reported to have said, \u201c The case of D\u2019Utricht v. Melchor, 1 Dall. 428, cannot be law.\u201d The majority of the court, however, differed in opinion from Judge Livingston, upon the principle of that case, and held, that <em>assumpsit </em>would lie, to recover back the consideration paid on a sealed agreement, the defendant having failed to perform his part; and it is believed that D\u2019Utricht v. Melchor, which is said by Judge Yeates (in Ritchie v. Summers, 3 Yeates 539), to be \u201cimperfectly reported,\u201d may be supported as an authority, if the assertion of the same learned judge, in a later case (Dorsey v. Jackman, S. &amp; R. 51), be correct, viz., that it \u201cwas determined upon the ground of fraud and imposition.\u201d Chief Justice Tilguman, in the case last referred to (p. 48), instanced \u201cfraud or deception,\u201d as furnishing an exception to the rule, that money could not be recovered back, and such, according to Judge Yeates (in Steinhauer v. Witman, 1 S. &amp; R. 447), is the settled law. See also Mathers v. Pearson, 13 S. &amp; R. 258; Landis c. Urie, 10 Id. 316; Charles v. Scott, 1 Id. 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
