That the same act established the jurisdiction of the supreme court, and made it co-extensive with the state ; and that, therefore, as the legislature was silent with respect to issuing a <em>testatum </em>from this latter court, it was fairly to be inferred, they did not mean to require it. He further insisted, that the practice supported his construction, and that a deviation *from it would be attended with great delay and injustice; for, when the act was passed, although a <em>testatum </em>might issue in three months from a court of common pleas, it must have been suspended for six months in the supreme court; and thus a debtor would have it in his power to give an unfair preference to creditors in the county where he lives.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-10\">Sergeant, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"adj-dedup-1\">stated, that the supreme court has powers similar to the courts of King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas in England, and that the course of practice, with respect to a <em>testatum, </em>had always *been the same. But he contended, that unless the act of assembly had ex-[*333 pressly extended the power to the county courts, they could not have proceeded by <em>testatum, </em>to execute out of their immediate jurisdiction ; which is the true reason why the legislature takes notice of the writ in one case, and not in the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-11\">Upon a question from the court, Mr. <em>Burd, </em>the prothonotary, said, that previously to the revolution, the proceeding, in such cases, had always been by <em>testatum ; </em>though since that period, a different practice had been introduced by some of the attorneys, contrary to his opinion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>*By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ABu4\">The legislature, before the revolution, prescribed no rules for the supreme court ; but it is certainly vested with the powers of the King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas in England; and the practice has been, in general, governed by the same law. Hence, we find, that it was formerly thought necessary to proceed by <em>testatum </em>in Pennsylvania ; and although a contrary practice has lately obtained, it is without the opinion or sanction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We think, therefore, that this execution must be quashed ; and in every future case of the same kind, let a <em>fi. fa. </em>be filed in the supreme court, with a return of <em>nulla bona ; </em>and then a term must intervene, before the <em>testatum </em>issues, in order to support the fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The execution quashed, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b370-15\"> See Fulton v.
