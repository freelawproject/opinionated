The case in Davies, if wo could be bound by it at all (which we do not think we can, first, because it is not a judicial determination ; and, secondly, because it is before judges in Ireland), would be in favor of the plaintiff, if it had not been for this act of assembly. But, indeed, if this evidence were admitted, it would open a door to such a scene of litigation, that, independent of the act, the argument <em>ab inconvenienti </em>never applied in greater force.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">The evidence was accordingly overruled, and the plaintiff voluntarily suffered a nonsuit. <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aq4\"><em> </em>See the note to Morris <em>v. </em>Wharton, <em>ante, </em>p. 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b198-17\"> The same point was determined in Bond <em>v. </em>Haas\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 Hall. 133.
