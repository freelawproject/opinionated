S. could take by executory devise ? It was objected for the <em>defendant </em>\u2014 1st. That this being a present devise, it could not take effect, because to a person not <em>in esse. </em>2d. That though it might be construed a future devise, yet it was too remote ; for an executory devise must take effect within the compass of a life or lives <em>in esse, </em>or, at farthest, within nine months after : And in this case, I. S. might have had no son, but a daughter, who might have had a daughter, who might have had a son, who would have been the first heir male of I. S., which would have been too remote a contingency, and would have tended to a perpetuity. And the case must be considered as at the time of making the devise, that is, how it might be ; and not how it has actually happened. 3d. That the son of I. S. could not take ; because the limitation was to the first heir male, and <em>nemo est hmres viventis.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-12\">For the <em>plaintiff,\\</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajf\">it was answered : 1st. That this was no present devise, the testator taking notice that I. S. had no son born, by the word first heir male, and using the words <em>when </em>and <em>paying. </em>2d. That this contingency was not too remote ; because the testator by the words <em>first heir male, </em>must have meant first son ; and that such a construction must be made as to carry the intent of the testator into execution. 3d. <em>First heir male </em>are words of purchase and <em>designatio personce, </em>and the law will supply the words, of the body, in a will.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b23-17\"><em> </em>See Seattergood v.
