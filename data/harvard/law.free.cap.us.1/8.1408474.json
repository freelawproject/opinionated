The question arose on these words of a will. \u2018\u25a0\u2018\u25a0Item\u2014 My will is, that after my wife Ruth Price\u2019s decease, or if she shall alter her condition and marry, then, in such case, I devise and bequeath unto my loving friends, I. W. and M. K., or to any one of them, in case the other should die, in trust, and for the intent to sell and convey, all that messuage, &amp;c., to any person or persons that shall purchase the same, and the money arising from the sale of the premises shall be divided between my children hereinafter named, when they attain severally to the age of twenty-one years, or be married, which shall first happen.\u201d Samuel Price, one of the children, attained the age of twenty-one years and married, and afterwards died in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>testate and without issue, in the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow Ruth Price, who did never marry again. Then the widow died, and after her death, the trustees sold, and the administratrix of Samuel brings this suit for Samuel\u2019s proportionable part of the money arising from the sale of the house. And the question was, whether this was a vested legacy to Samuel, or whether it was lapsed, by Ms dying before the trustees had power to sell, to wit, in the lifetime of the testator\u2019s widow ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-6\">For the <em>plaintiff.\\</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnE\">it was urged, that land ordered to be sold and converted into money, was to be considered as personal estate. That this land was to be sold at all events, so there was no contingency. That both events to make a vesting in Samuel had happened, to wit, attaining the age of twenty-one and marrying ; and that this case was exactly similar to the case of <em>King </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>Talbot\u2019s Cas. 117. Besides which, many other cases were cited for the plaintiff, viz., 2 Vern. 536; 1 P. Wms. 109; 2 Id. 320; 2 Abr. Cas. Eq. 548; 2 Vent. 347; 2 Vern. 758, 766; 4 Bac. Abr. 308; 2 Vent. 366; 2 Vern. 72, 348, 424; 2 Abr. Cas. Eq. 654.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-7\">For the <em>defendant,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoa\">it was said, that in legacies to be raised out of land, the time of payment is the time of vesting. That in this case, the land could not he considered as personal estate, till the trustees had power to sell it, which was not until after the widow\u2019s death, and that Samuel dying before, his legacy was lapsed and would merge for the benefit of the heirs. And the ease of <em>Oads </em>v. <em>Ferry </em>was much relied on, Vin., Devise, 383. The other eases cited for the defendant, were 2 Vern. 92, 416, 208; 2 P. Wms. 276, 610, 484; 3 Id. 20.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\">But the Court were clearly of opinion, that it was a <em>vested </em>legacy, and judgment was given for the plaintiff, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b28-17\"> Patterson v.
