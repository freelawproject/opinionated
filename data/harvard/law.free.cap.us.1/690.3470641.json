The board rejected his claim, and he appealed to the District Court accordingly. The case came on to be heard in that court <em>June 5th, </em>1857, and the record proceeds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-7\">\u201c Whereupon the court being fully advised in the premises, delivered its opinion, confirming the claim to the extent called for in the transcript and papers, <em>three </em>leagues; and a <em>decree was ordered to he entered up in conformity to said opinion.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-8\">This entry is dated <em>June 5th, </em>1857, the same day the cause was heard. On the <em>1th of January, </em>1858, a decree <em>in extenso </em>was filed, making the usual recitals of form, describing the land <em>\u201c </em>confirmed\u201d as \u201c <em>three </em>leagues, more or less, situate in the county of Monterey, State of California; bounded on the north by lands of Julian Usura, on the south by the hills, on the east by the Valley of the Julares, and on the west by lands of Francisco Arias.\u201d The decree ended thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b713-9\">\u201cAnd it appearing to the court that on the 5th June, A.

Evidence w\u00e1s accordingly taken tending to show that the District Attorney of the United States himself \u2014 one P. Ord \u2014 had been a party interested in the claim.

Brady, Gillet, and Barnes, in support of the motion :</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b716-11\">1. By the Judiciary Act of 1789,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is enacted, that \u201c writs of error shall not be brought but within five years after rendering or passing the judgment or decree complained of,\u201d and by the act of 1803,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> that \u201c appeals shall be subject to the same rules, regulations, and restrictions as are prescribed by law in cases of writs of error.\u201d In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pacheco,</em><footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> it was held, that as the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1851, does not specify the time within which an appeal must be made to the Supreme Court from the District Courts of California, the subject must be regulated by .the general law respecting writs of error and appeal. An appeal, therefore, must be taken within five years from the final decree. The first inquiry, therefore, is, from when does the time begin to run? From the time the decision is pronounced and entered in the minutes, or not from until the day when the decree is formally drawn up, signed, and entered? 'In <em>Fleet </em>v. Young,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> the Court of Errors in New York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>held that the time for suing out the writ of error commences from the time of the entry of the rule for judgment, and not from the time of filing the record. The statute of New York is similar to the law of Congress. The chancellor said, in the case cited: \u201c The language of the statute, as contained in the recent revision, is that the writ of error shall be brought within two years after the rendering of the judgment or final determination of the court, and not after,\u201d &amp;c. Both the law of Congress and the statute of New York differ from the English statutes as they were when this decision was made. By the English statute, a writ of error could be brought within twenty years after the judgment record signed and filed, and judgment <em>entered; </em>by rule of the House of Lords, an appeal must be brought within five years after the enrolment of the decree. In <em>Fleet </em>v. <em>Young, </em>the chancellor discusses the difference between the New York statute and the English statute, and also says: \u201c In point of principle, it is not-very material whether one construction or the other is adopted, <em>as the plaintiff in error may himself obtain piermission to make up the reeord, if the adverse party neglects to do it within a reasonable time after the actual rendition of the </em>judgment,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and it is not necessary to wait for the filing of the record before a writ of error can be sued out. It is sufficient if the judgment be signed and filed at any time before the actual return of the writ of error, although after the return day is past.\u201d<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b717-5\">The case of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>before the Supreme Court of New York,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> is also in point. That was a motion by the defendant for leave to draw up a statement of facts from the special report made by referees, and to have such statement settled and inserted in the judgment record, to the end that he, the defendant, might bring a writ of error. It was objected that more than two years had elapsed since the decision of the motion to set aside the report, but not since judgment was perfected by filing the record, &amp;c. The court say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201c Although it does not appear upon the papers that a rule for judgment was entered at the next term after the report was made-, there can be no doubt that it was done; and, besides, if the rule was never entered, <em>it would be almost a matter of course to alloio it to be done nunc pro tunc. </em>But we think the question of limitation does not turn on the time of entering the rule for judgment, but on the time when the final determination was made on the motion to set aside the report. The rule for judgment was undoubtedly entered in May Term, 1837, and, if we date from that, the time for bringing a writ of error had expired before the motion for a rehearing was made, which was in May, 1840. The question, then, is whether the limitation dates from the final determination of the court, which was in July, 1840, or from the subsequent filing of the judgment record in January, 1841. The statute provides that \u2018 all writs of error upon any judgment or final determination rendered in any cause, shall be brought within two years after the rendering of such judgment on final determination, and not after.\u2019 The judgment on final determination in this cause was rendered, in July Term, 1840, when the motion which had been made to set aside the report of the referees was denied. The record which was afterwards filed was not the judgment, but only a written memorial of the judgment which had been previously rendered. The Court of Errors arrived at the same conclusion, on this question, in <em>Fleet </em>v. <em>Young. </em>It follows, that the time for bringing a writ of error has already expired, and we ought not to put the plain tiff to the expense and ourselves to the inconvenience of settling a ease when we see it can do no good.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-8\">In the English ease of <em>Smythe </em>v. <em>Clay,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the decree was actually enrolled within five years from the time of bringing the appeal, but more than twenty years after the decree was actually rendered. It seems to have been held that the enrolment of any decree pronounced by the Court of Chancery is deemed as being, by legal relation, the act of the same day on which the decree was pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b718-9\">Then we have the <em>nunc pro time </em>clause added, in terms, to the decree, signed, filed, and entered the 5th February,T858. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>In <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Tillotson, </em>supra, it is said such an order would have been a matter of course. The effect of the clause specially inserted is, of course, to make more specially the judgment relate back to the time when the decree should have been entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-5\">This appeal, therefore, not having been in time, the decree of the District Court must stand. The order of 21st March, 1861 \u2014 an order made near four years after the date when that which we assert was the decree was rendered \u2014 is a nullity; for, as this court has declared,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c no principle is better settled, or of more universal application, than that no court can reverse its own final decrees or judgments for errors of fact or of law, after the term in which they were rendered, unless for clerical mistakes, or reinstate a cause dismissed by mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-6\">2. If the appeal had been taken in time it is a nullity, because no citation was taken or served. In <em>Hogan </em>v. Ross,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> this court said, that where no citation had been issued or served, the cause must be dismissed. In <em>Villabolos </em>v. <em>United States,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court held that an entry of appeal in the clerk\u2019s office did not remove the cause; and that where an appeal was not taken in open court at the term at which the decree was rendered, in the absence of a citation signed by the judge allowing it, the appeal was a nullity. At the same term, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curry,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the rule was iterated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b719-7\">3. The district attorney has not certified the <em>whole </em>record. He certifies that the one hundred and twenty-seven pages are \u201c a full, true, and correct copy of all the proceedings, entries, and files in the District Court for the Southern District of California, <em>except </em>the transcript sent up from the late Board of Land Commissioners.\u201d This transcript he does not vouch for as a copy of that on the files. Hence the exemplification cannot be relied on. How much may have been omitted, how much added, cannot be ascertained. It must accordingly be rejected <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b720-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>Messrs. </em>Bates, <em>A. G., </em>Black, <em>contra:</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-6\">1. The right of appeal is a sacred right; every doubt is to enure to the benefit of the appellant. Things done <em>nunc pro tune </em>are done by leave of court only, and then only to do justice, <em>never to do injustice. </em>Until entered, there is no decree from which appeal can be taken, for it is not of record. Appeal is allowed by act Sd March, 1851, \u00a7 10, to the party \u201cagainst whom judgment is rendered.\u201d The act of 24th September, 1789, allows writ of error \u201c within five years after <em>rendering or passing </em>the judgment or decree.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-7\">Judge Ogier, being made aware of the fraud practised on him, set aside his decree, 21st March, 1861. Of course we could not appeal from the decree while that order stood. His successor set aside that order on 4th August, 1862. Five years had then elapsed from the date of <em>order </em>of entry of decree, but not from date of actual <em>entry </em>of decree. If it be law that the appeal runs from the date of the order, then the District Court has deprived the United States of a right of appeal, as wrongly as that Court was lured into entering its decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-8\">But, as might well have been, if the new judge had not been asked to set aside the order of 21st of March, 1861, until six or seven months more had elapsed, or, if he had delayed action therein until the next term, our right of appeal from the decree would have been gone forever, even counting from the date of entry of decree. No court has power thus to deprive a party of his rights. We slept securely on the action of the court rescinding its decree. If, in rescinding it after a term had elapsed, the court did wrong, it was not for <em>us </em>to try to correct an error in favor of the manifest justice of giving us a fair hearing, of which the decree had deprived us, but it was for Gomez to do so. Under that order <em>we </em>could not appeal, and <em>he </em>did not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b720-9\">Even if Judge Ogier\u2019s order of 21st March, 1861, setting aside the decree, was erroneous, as being made after the term when the decree was entered, still the same principle would protect that order from being subsequently changed, <em>unless changed at the same term. </em>For, if the rule that the decree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>one term cannot be changed at a subsequent term, oe good to avoid Judge Ogier\u2019s decree made by a fraud practised on him, it must be good to protect from change at a subsequent term his order avoiding that decree and undoing that fraud. If Judge Ogier could not correct the fraud three years after it was practised, how can his successor restore the fraud by an order nearly a year and a half after that correction ? So also we may fairly contend that the running of the five years for appeal was suspended during the existence of Judge Ogier\u2019s order of 21st March, 1861, setting aside the decree. It is a settled rule that lapse of time never bars a right which the law will not allow the party to assert during that time. Independently of all which, it would seem clear that if we were debarred from an appeal from the decree, at least we had a right to appeal from the order of 4th August, 1862, setting aside Judge Ogier\u2019s order of 21st March, 1861.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b721-5\">2. No citation was necessary, because we took the appeal at the same term at which Judge Ogier\u2019s order was set aside. The parties were then both in court. The record is not bound to be made up till the end of the term; and the party against whom the appeal is made cannot complain of want of notice if the appeal is made in the term; for if he looks at the record at the end of the term he will find the appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b721-6\">3. The transcript may or may not be certified in the best form, and contain all that it ought to contain. If it be incomplete, the remedy is the ordinary one for <em>certiorari </em>to bring the record.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-12\"> 1 Stat. at Large, 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"Ac8\"> 2 Id., 244.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"AVd\"> 20 Howard, 261.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u00a7\">\n<p id=\"b716-13\"> II Wendell, 522; and see Silsbee <em>v. </em>Foot, 20 Howard, 295.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\"> Jackson <em>v. </em>Parker, 2 Caines, 385.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"A2_R\"> Arnold <em>v. </em>Sandford, 14 Johnson, 417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\"> 4 Hill, 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\"> 1 Brawn\u2019s Parliamentary Cases, 453; Case No. 5 of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> Ex parte Sibbald v.

But the proposition cannot be sustained, as is evident from inspection of the record. Entry is that a decree was ordered to be entered up in conformity to such opinion. No decree of any kind, however, was drawn up, entered, or filed on that day. On the contrary, the record shows that on the seventh of January, L858, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>decree was filed in the case, and the decree itself, after referring to the fact that the claim had been confirmed on the fifth of June, 1857, states, that \u201c having been omitted to sign and enter a decree therefor at the date last aforesaid, it is ordered that the same be done now for then.\u201d Donee was not satisfied with the decree as thus filed, which was for three square leagues, and on the fourth of February, 1858, obtained leave to amend it by substituting another. Pursuant to that leave, on the following day he filed a new decree, enlarging the description to four square leagues, and the same was entered and signed by the district judge. Argument can add nothing to the force of this statement, as drawn from the record. Plainly there was no decree of any kind in the ease until the seventh of January, 1858, and as that was ordered to be amended by substituting another, the final decree in the case was that of the fifth of February following. Five years, therefore, had not elapsed after the decree was entered before the appeal was taken, and the first ground assumed in the motion fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">H. Want of citatiori is the second ground of the motion. Final decree was rendered on the fifth of February, 1858, but on the twenty-first day of March, 1861, the court entered a decree that all proceedings heretofore had in the cause be set aside,' and that it be put on the calendar and set for trial, <em>de novo, </em>according to law. Transcript shows that the order vacating the decree was passed upon the ground that the decree had been fraudulently obtained. [His honor here re-: ferred to the particulars as set forth in the order of Ogier, J., <em>ante, </em>p. 692, and to the proceedings in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>23 Howard, 326.] Delay ensued, and in the meantime a new appointment of district judge was made. Application was then made by the claimant to set aside the order vacating the original decree, and at the J une Term, 1862, held on the fourth of August of the same year, the court ordered that the previous order, made and entered on the twenty-first of March, 18\u00d31, setting aside all proceedings had in the cause, and placing the same on the calendar for trial <em>de novo, </em>be and the same is hereby vacated and set aside. United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>on the twenty-fifth of August, in the same year, took the appeal which is under consideration. Appeal wa? taken in open court, and at the same term in which the order was passed restoring the original decree, or rather vacating the order of the twenty-first of March, 1861, setting it aside and placing the cause on the calendar for trial.' Appeal, it is true, purports to he from the decision and decree of the court confirming the claim, hut it was taken from that decree not only after it had been vacated, but after the decree directing it to be vacated had itself been stricken out, and the original decree had been restored. Admitting that the order restoring the original decree was one of any validity, then indeed no citation was necessary, because the appeal was taken in open court, and might well be regarded as taken at the same term in which the decree was entered. But it is unnecessary to place the decision entirely upon that ground. Granting that the appeal is from the original decree, and that the question is wholly unaffected by the subsequent orders, still it is quite clear that no citation was necessary in this case. Claimant at once signified his intention to move the court to set aside the order granting the appeal, and thereupon it was stipulated and agreed between the parties that all further proceedings should be stayed until the next term of the court. Notice in writing was accordingly given by the claimant that he would submit such a motion at the next term at the opening of the court. He did submit it, and the parties were heard, and the court gave an opinion sustaining the motion. Petition for an injunction was after-wards filed to prevent the appeal, and the parties were heard upon that subject, but the injunction was denied. Object of the citation is notice, and under the circumstances of this case that purpose seems to have been fully answered, and the objection is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">HP. Third ground of the motion is that the transcript is incomplete, and that the same is not duly certified. The certificate in this case is certainly made by an officer authorized by law to make it, and we are not able to perceive that it is defective. Bemedy of appellee, if the transcript is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>incomplete, is a plain one and one of daily use. He should suggest diminution, and ask for a <em>certiorari, </em>which is readily granted when applied for in season.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In view of the whole case, our conclusion is that the motion to dismiss the appeal must be overruled. Effect of the motion, if granted, would be to leave the decree below in full force and unreversed, which is a result that at present we are not prepared to sanction. When the cause comes up upon the merits, we shall desire to hear the counsel upon the question whether there is any valid decree in the case, and if not, as to what will be the proper directions to be given in the cause. Those questions are not involved in the motion to dismiss, but they will arise when the merits of the case are examined, and will deserve very careful consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Motion refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
