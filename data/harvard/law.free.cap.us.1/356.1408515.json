There is, likewise, another reason : the <em>capias </em>on mesne process might be taken out merely on a suggestion ; but in judicial process, the debt is certain, and fixed by the judgment of the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\"><em>Chambers </em>and <em>Hartly, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"akn-dedup-1\">The protection of suitors, &amp;c., is established, to promote an equal administration of justice, and to prevent the oppression of a rich and powerful man, over a poor one who is soliciting justice. There is no express authority that extends the doctrine to this case; but in 4 Com. 575, tit. Priv., it is laid down, that an execution shall not be discharged, yet, if the party who procured it, will not consent to a discharge, ho shall himself be committed. The books cited in Comyns, Crompton, and Wood\u2019s Inst, are of little authority.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b391-18\"><em> </em>Determined at Sunbury, N.

In the case before us, the execution has regularly issued, upon a judgment regularly obtained ; and although we should certainly protect suitors, witnesses and jurors, from an arrest on mesne process, during their attendance upon the court, and for a reasonable time in coming and going, yet no case has been shown, which will justify our interference, to discharge a man taken <em>in </em>execution, on the ground of such a protection. It is, indeed, the privilege of the court that is infringed ; and it is discretionary, to grant it, on some occasions, and to refuse it, upon others, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">By the Court. \u2014 The prisoner must be remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b392-10\"><em> </em>The same point was determined in Hannum v. Askew, 1 Yeates 25, by Judges Suippen and Yeates, after argument. Judge Yeates said, \u201c I was of counsel in Starret\u2019s case, and it was then pressed, that the authorities cited by \"Wood, did not warrant his doctrine. This gave rise to the Chief Justice\u2019s remark respecting the author. Upon my return from the circuit, I examined the point very fully, and found that 2 Trials per Pais, 382; 3 Salk. 46; Crompton\u2019s Just. 162, 181, fully established the distinction, which is here contended against.\u201d Notwithstanding which, it is said, in a note to 4 Dall. 388, \u201c It was admitted by the counsel, Mr. <em>Ingersoll </em>and Mr. Rawle, on both sides, that the authority of Starret\u2019s case had been often doubted, both on the bench and at the bar, though never expressly overruled.\u201d And in Ex parte Hurst, 1 W. C. C. 186, s. c. 4 Dall. 387, the circuit court of the United States expressly decided, that a suitor in that court was privileged from arrest on a <em>ea. sa. </em>; and Hurst was discharged from custody, although the writ issued from the supreme court of the state.
