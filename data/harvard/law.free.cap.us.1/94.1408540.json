On the trial of this cause, in deducing the plaintiff\u2019s title, a sheriff\u2019s deed was produced, but no part of the record therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"axe-dedup-0\"><em>Lewis </em>and <em>Mifflin, </em>for the plaintiff. <em>Sergeant, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-14\"><em>Sergeant </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ams-dedup-0\">that if the title was set forth, it was necessary to prove every part of it; that between the parties, the <em>fi. fa. </em>and <em>vend. exp. </em>may only be shown; but that against a stranger, the pleadings, verdict and judgment, ought to be produced. Gilb. L. of Ev. 9, 10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-15\">On a question from the opposite counsel, <em>Sergeant </em>admitted, that, in New Jersey, it was not the practice to produce more than the sheriff\u2019s deed; but insisted that, of late, it had been frequently required, and that in strictness, it was indispensably necessary.

And the Chief Justice added, that within his knowledge, it had not been customary, in any case, to produce the record, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b113-19\"> After a long possession under a deed, it has been usual to dispense with proof of its due execution. In a recent case, it was said by Judge Duncan, that thirty years possession seems the fixed time, and he intimated that perhaps twenty-one years, the period of limitation, might be sufficient. McGinnis <em>v. </em>Allison, 10 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 199. See also Arnold <em>v. </em>Gorr, 1 Rawle 223. The practice, however, with respect to producing the rec- or.l, in the case of sheriff\u2019s deeds (at least, where long possession has not accompanied them), is at present different from that stated by the Chief Justice in the text. It is laid down in many cases, that a sheriff\u2019s deed cannot be given in evidence, without producing the judgment and execution under which he made the sale. See Wilson <em>v. </em>Mc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Veaugh, 2 Yeates 86; Hartshorne v. Wright, Peters C. C. 64; Weyand Tipton, 5 S. &amp; R. 332; Hampton <em>v. </em>Speckenagle, 9 Id. 212. And the rule is the same with respect to a deed of land, sold under an order of the orphan\u2019s court, which cannot be road, without producing the record. Hartshorne <em>v. </em>Wright, Hampton v. Speckenagle, <em>ut supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
