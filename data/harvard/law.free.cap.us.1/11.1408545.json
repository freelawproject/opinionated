Turner and S., his wife, for and during their joint lives; and from and after the decease of either of them, then to and for the sole and proper use and behoof of the survivor of them, and his or her heirs for ever.\u201d That the o-! said P. Turner and *S.,' his wife, appeared before W. P., Esquire, then J one of the justices of the court of common pleas, for the county of Philadelphia, and acknowledged the said indenture to be their deed, and that the said Sarah was, then and there, secretly and apart from her said husband, examined by the said W. P., and on such private examination did declare, that she did sign, seal and execute the said indenture, with her full, free and voluntary consent, which acknowledgment and examination was then indorsed by the said W. P., under his hand and seal, upon the indenture. The special verdict goes on and finds, that for fifty years and upwards, it had been the constant practice and usage of the province of Pennsylvania, in cases where <em>baron </em>and <em>feme </em>have been desirous to settle, sell and dispose of the estate of the <em>feme, </em>for the <em>baron axt&amp;feme </em>to join in a deed or deeds, and for the/me to go before sofne justice of the peace, in the county where the lands lie, out of court, and for the said justice to examine such <em>feme </em>in private and ajiart from her husband, respecting her signing and executing such deed, and to interrogate her, whether she became a party to and executed such deed, with her full and free consent, and on her declaration that she freely consented, for the justice to certify the same under his hand and seal. And that a great number of titles to valuable estates in this province, were held under, and did depend upon, deeds executed by <em>baron said, feme, </em>in manner aforesaid. And that the titles to such estates had never before been called in question, but that such deeds of <em>femes covert </em>and their husbands had always been allowed to be given in evidence in courts of justice ; that scriveners had generally conducted themselves by this usage, in transferring estates, and that only two fines had ever been levied in this province for conveying the estates of <em>femes covert. </em>The jury further found, that the said Sarah died, without having any issue born alive, and the plaintiff\u2019s wife was one of her heirs-at-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">The principal question was, whether this mode of conveyance of the estates of <em>femes covert </em>could be supported by the usage, as found by the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-10-pl-split\">On the part of the <em>plaintiff,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMx\">it was urged, that by law a <em>feme covert </em>cannot convey her estate but by fine, in which she must be examined by writ ; that the usage in this case was not sufficient to alter the law, not being from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>time immemorial, and was unreasonable, because it had no lavful commencement, a <em>feme </em>being supposed by the law to be under the coercion of her husband : and for this purpose Godb. 143, was cited. That supposing the custom good, the deed in the present case was variant from the custom as found in the special verdict; for that the usage ratified this kind of conveyance only in such cases, where the <em>feme </em>was willing and desirous to convey, and where she declared she <em>became </em>a party to the deed freely : and that it is not found the <em>feme </em>in this case was willing and desirous, and had declared she became a party thereto ; for though it is set forth, that she declared she executed the deed freely, yet it does not appear the deed was read, or the contents made known unto her, * without which she could not be said to become a party. Another variance insisted on was, L that the examination required by the custom must be by a justice of the peace, and in this case W. P. is not said to be a justice of the peace, but a justice of the court of common pleas. It was further urged, that the deed in this case was void, for two reasons : 1st. Because, though the conveyance is to trustees, yet the use is to the <em>baron </em>and his heirs, which, by the statute of uses, vests the legal estate immediately in the <em>baron, </em>and so is no other than a conveyance from the <em>feme </em>to <em>the' baron, </em>which is void. The second reason was, that the deed wanted a consideration, there being none mentioned but marriage and five shillings. That the marriage was past, and a past consideration is no consideration, and the five shillings said to be paid to the <em>feme </em>was in fact the property of the husband, so no consideration to her.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-6\">On the part of <em>the' defendant,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXK\">it was answered, that, though by the law of England, <em>a feme covert </em>cannot convey her estate, without an examination by writ, yet in this country a different manner of examination has obtained from the first settlement of the province, in substance, the same as an examination on a fine, which probably, in early days, could not be levied here for want of skill in the professors of the law ; and that now the greater part of the titles in the province depend, in some link of the chain, upon this kind of deeds, it would be highly inconvenient, and would introduce the utmost confusion, to overset them. That common recoveries have their validity from usage, and that if this be an error, it is within the maxim, <em>communis error facit jus. </em>As to the reasonableness of the usage, Brooke, <em>tit. faits, </em>\u00a7 14, 15, was cited, to show that an examination of a <em>feme covert </em>before the Lord Mayor in London was good, without a fine. And to show the force and extension of the maxim, <em>communis error facit jus, many </em>authorities were cited. Carth. 283; 4 Sid. 190; 2 Mod. 238; Jenk. 162, 250; Anderson 49; 2 Abr. Eq. Ca. 200; Hob. 83; Salk. 33; Co. Litt. 112; Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone 516; Comb. 320, 342 ; Stiles 320. As to the variance between this case and the usage, it Avas said, the <em>feme </em>had declared she executed the deed Avith her free consent, and that it must be taken, the magistrate did his duty in making her acquainted with the contents. As to the other variance, it is notorious, that a justice of the common pleas is a justice of the peace, in this province, being appointed to both offices in one commission, and the court will <em>ex officio </em>take notice of so general a practice. As to the objections against the validity of the deed, it was answered, that though a deed would be void immediately from <em>baron </em>to <em>feme, </em>yet it would be <em>good, </em>when made to trustees to the use of the <em>feme </em>: Co. Litt. 112. And the considera-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>lion of five shillings, though not a valuable one, is a good consideration in the eye of the law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b34-5\">By the Court,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">after advisement. \u2014 These deeds, and this mode of examination of <em>femes covert </em>on conveying their estates, having generally prevailed in this province, from its settlement, and undergone, from time to time, the \u201e. -, notice *o\u00a3 the courts of justice, it would he very mischievous now to *14] overturn them. The maxim <em>communis error facit jus </em>cannot operate more properly than in this case, and the court unanimously adjudge the law to be witb tbe defendant, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b34-17\"> In the case of Lloyd v. Taylor, <em>post, </em>p. 17, a deed by the wife of her lands, without any separate examination, was sustained, on the same ground of <em>communis error; </em>and these cases have been recognised, and the principle upon which they were decided, adopted by Judge Washington in Milligan v. Dickson, 1 Peters\u2019 C. C. 438. \u201cThis usage,\u201d said that learned judge, referring to the practice of acknowledging letters of attorney, \u201cforms one of the great and essential land-marks of real property in this state- and if the titles depending upon it are to be uprooted at this day, I will not be th. judge to commence the work of devastation. Never was there a case where the principle <em>communis error facit jus </em>was more strictly and necessarily applicable.\u201d In 1770, the legislature passed an act confirming titles derived from <em>femes covert, </em>where there had been no separate examination, and established a mode by which the husband and wife might thereafter convey the estate of the wife (1 Sm. L. 307). The decisions under this act have settled the principle, that the wife\u2019s acknowledgment must appear, on the <em>face of the certificate, </em>to have been made substantially as the act requires ; and parol evidence is not admissible to supply defects in the certificate. And it must appear, that the acknowledgment was made before the proper officer, in his proper county. (See 5 Binn. 296; 7 3. &amp; R. 43.) The act of 3d April 1826 (P. L. 187), provides that no <em>hond fide </em>conveyance, previously made, shall be held invalid, by reason of any informality or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgment; but the case of an aeknowdgment before an incompetent officer seems not to have been provided for.
