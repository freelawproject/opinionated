He set forth in it that he was owner of the exclusive right to make and use, and vend to others to be used, within the county of Alleghany, in Pennsylvania, the patented planing machine of Woodworth; that subsequently <em>to the 21th December, </em>1849, and about the 1st January, 1850, the respondent, Millinger, had put in operation in that county, three of these machines, and was continuing to use them without any law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ful authority. The prayer was for an account, and for an injunction against the use of these three machines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">The case, as appearing by the bill and answer, was thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-7\">On the 27th December, 1828, letters patent were granted to Woodworth for an improved planing machine for fourteen years, that is to say, up to 27th December, 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-8\">On the 16th November, 1842 (Woodworth himself being dead, but his estate being represented by an administrator), an extension of the patent was granted by the <em>Commissioner </em>or <em>Board of Commissioners of </em>Patents, for the term of <em>seven </em>years from the expiration of the original patent;

Whether, under the deeds of June 23d, 1843 (Exhibit A) , conveying to the assignor of Millinger, in such strict terms, a right to the extension of the patent for but <em>seven years, </em>and the deeds of 10th and 13th April, 1846 (Exhibit B) ,by which this right was conveyed, in such like terms, to Millinger \u2014 taken in connection with Bloomer\u2019s stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>of 13th April, 1846, and his deed of 10th January, 1848, that Millinger should use his three machines during the said term for which the patent had been extended by the commissioner \u2014Millinger could use his machines after the expiration of that term, and during the new term for which an extension had been granted by Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">2. If he could not cjp so under the deeds as set forth in the pleadings, he could introduce parol evidence to show what he alleged in his answer and offered to prove, as to the license intended to have been executed by Bloomer on the 10th January, 1848.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-7\"><em>Messrs. Seward, </em>Norton, <em>and Blatehford*, for the appellant, Bloomer :</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\">1. The intent with which the agreement was made is but a convertible term for its legal operation, and that legal operation is to be affixed by the law to the language used by the parties, irrespective of the intent with which they used such language. The inquiry never arises upon the evidence \u2014\u201c what did the parties intend to do ?\u201d \u2014 if the written agreement which they made is susceptible of legal interpretation. The conclusion is, that they intended just what the law interpreting their agreement says that they have done. If this rule be so, it excludes from the consideration of the court the parol evidence introduced by the respondent, and leaves for the adjudication of the court, the single question of law, viz.: \u201c Has the respondent, under these instruments, either by their proper interpretation or by operation of general law, the right to continue to use, <em>during the extension of the patent by Congress, </em>the three machines which he constructed and was lawfully in use of during the extension by the <em>commissioners?\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-9\"><em>2. </em>The fact that the subject of the contract is a right in or an interest under a patent, does not take the case out of the law applicable to the law of contracts generally. The owner of a patent may make any agreement with regard to its enjoyment that he may make in regard to any other species of property. It is competent, therefore, for the owner of a pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tent right to carve out of his entire monopoly such fractional interest therein, either as to absolute right, or as to territorial extent, or as to duration of right, as he may see fit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-6\">Applying this principle, it appears that the respondent never acquired, by voluntary grant from any of the owners of either the original or extended patent, any right to continue to use the thing patented during the extension of the patent <em>by Congress. </em>If there be language which can define the intent of the grantor to be, that he parts with a right under his patent for a specified number of years only, that language will be found in both of the instruments under which the respondent was rightfully in use of his three machines during the first extension of the patent. In Exhibit A, the first instrument (that of 2d June, 1843), by the administrator to William Lippincott, the respondent\u2019s assignor, the grant was of a \u201c right and license to construct, use, and vend to others to construct and use, <em>during the said extension of the aforesaid patent,\u201d </em>that extension being the one granted by the commissioners, and which expired on the 27th of December, 1849.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-7\">In the confirmatory instrument to the respondent, of the 13th of April, 1846 (known as Exhibit B), which was intended to convey the right under the amended specification attached to the reissued patent, the language is, \u201c doth license and empower . . . <em>for the term of time for which the patent was extended by the Board of Commissioners hereinbefore referred to, being for the term of seven years, and no longer, from the expiration of the original term of fourteen years.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">Probably <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>McQuewan,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided by this court, will be relied on to support an opposite view. But we sub<em>mit </em>\u2014 -first, that that case is inapplicable, and <em>second, </em>that it is not, under the circumstances of' its decision, a binding authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-9\">i. The act of Congress places the case in the position in which it would have been had the patent been originally granted for twenty-eight years. If it had been so granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>what right would the respondent have acquired by virtue o\u00ed Exhibits A and B, executed respectively in 1843 and 1846 ? Clearly, the beLeficial enjoyment of the patent for the period therein specified, expiring on the 27th of December, 1849, and nothing other or beyond. If he acquired any other or further right, he must have acquired it by virtue of some general law, and not by virtue of the contract, or of the act extending the patent. The respondent did not know, in 1848, when the first license was granted, that the patent would be extended by act of' Congress, but he knew that it might be. He did know, in 1846, when the second license was executed, that the patent had been <em>extended; </em>and he accepted an in strument on that date, which expressed, by the use of proper language, the intention of the grantor to terminate the right granted, on the 27th day of December, 1849.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-6\">The respondent never occupied, during the first term of the patent, the position of the defendant in <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>McQuewan, </em>\u2014 that is, he was not an \u201c assignee,\u201d or' \u201c grantee,\u201d during the <em>original </em>term of the patent, of the right to use the thing patented.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">By the Patent Act of 1836 (\u00a7 18), it is provided, that the benefit of the renewal by the commissioner shall extend \u201c to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective interests therein.\u201d In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rousseau,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was the opinion of a majority of this court that, without this provision, \u201c all rights of assignees or grantees, whether in a share of the patent, or to a specific portion of the territory held under it, terminate at the end of the fourteen years, and become reinvested in the patentee by the new grant.\u201d And, in construing this very act of 1845, Nelson, J., said in one case :<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> \u201c If the extension for the second term had been absolute, that is, if there had been no reservation in the general act of 1836 in favor of assignees, as there is not in the special act of 1845, the court would not have entertained a doubt that the exclusive right to the invention during the second term would have been vested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the administrator.\u201d So, also, in another case,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> where the assignments were similar to Exhibits A and B, he held that the defendant had no right to continue to use the machines under the extension by act of Congress. This view has been confirmed in other circuits. \u2020</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">ii. But it is submitted that <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>McQuewan </em>should be re-examined. The opinion of the court in that case was pronounced by the present chief justice, and was concurred in by Justices Catron, Daniel, and Crier. Justices Nelson and McLean dissented. Justices Wayne and Curtis did not sit. So that the decision was really that of less than half of the court, there having been one vacancy by the death of Justice McKinley. Justice McLean, at the close of his dissenting opinion, says : \u201c Sustained by the authority of seven justices of this court, and by an argument of the Supreme Court above cited, which I think is unanswerable, I shall deem it to be my duty to bring the same question now decided, when it arises in my circuit, for the consideration and decision of a full bench.\u201d It cannot be presumptuous to ask the court to give to the question a new investigation, in order that it may be submitted \u201c for the consideration and decision of a <em>full </em>bench.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">The counsel then examined the decision on principle and authority.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> These were the deeds of June 2, 1843 (Exhibit A), that of 10th April, 1846, and that of 13th April, 1846 (Exhibit B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\"> 14 Howard, 550.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"> 4 Howard, 646.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b365-9\"> Gibson <em>v. </em>Gifford, 1 Blatchford, 529.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\"> Gibson <em>v.

In Mason <em>v. </em>Talman (decided in Rhode Island, July, 1850), Woodbury and Pitman, JJ., followed the decision of Nelson and McLean, JJ., upon this point. The point was similarly decided by McKinley and McCaleb, JJ., in Bloomer <em>v. </em>Vaught (in Louisiana, February, 1850), by Ware, J., in Woodworth <em>v. </em>Barber (in Maine, Kpril, 1850), and by Sprague, J., in Woodworth <em>v. </em>Curtis (in Massachusetts, January, 1850).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-8\">Mr. Justice CLIFFORD,</author>\n<p id=\"A0t\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Counsel of the complainant concede that the machines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>were constructed and put in operation by tbe consent and license of the assignees of tbe patentees, and tbat tbe respondent bad tbe full right to ccntinue to use and operate tbe same throughout tbe entire period of tbe extension granted by tbe Commissioner of Patents. But they deny tbat be bad any right to continue to use or operate them under tbe second extension, which was granted by tbe act of Congress. All of those machines were constructed and put in operation before tbe act of Congress was passed, and of course under an authority founded upon tbe patent as it existed at tbe time tbe authority was conferred. Regarding the transaction in tbat point of view, tbe argument is, tbat tbe respondent could not lawfully continue to use and operate tbe machines under tbe extension granted by Congress, inasmuch as such a use of tbe invention was not in tbe contemplation of the parties when the respondent was authorized to construct them and put them in operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Two principal defences were set up by tbe respondent in tbe court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">First, be insisted tbat inasmuch as be constructed tbe machines and put them in operation under tbe authority of tbe patentee or bis assigns, with tbe right to continue to use and operate them during tbe entire term of tbe patent as it was then granted, be cannot now be deprived of tbe right to use tbe property which he was thus induced to purchase, and which be in tbat manner lawfully acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Secondly, be insisted tbat tbe complainant, at tbe time tbe respondent transferred to him tbe right be acquired' under the assignment to him of tbe 10th of April, 1846, agreed tbat be, tbe complainant, would execute to him, tbe respondent, a deed of assignment of tbe right to tbe extension in question, so far as respects tbe three machines now in controversy ; and be insisted tbat parol proofs were admissible and sufficient to establish tbe fact of such an agreement. On tbe other band, tbe complainant denies tbat any such agreement was ever made, and be also insists tbat parol proofs are not admissible to establish such a theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Confessedly, tbe latter question is one of difficulty, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the circumstances, but it is wholly unnecessary to decide it in this case, as the respondent was and is clearly entitled to judgment upon the other ground. He constructed his machines, or caused them to be constructed, under the authority of the patentee or his assigns, and consequently must be regarded in the same light as a grantee or assignee under those who had the legal control of the patent. Builders of machines under such circumstances, have the same rights as grantees or assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">When the respondent had purchased the right to construct the machines and operate them during the lifetime of the patent as then existing, and had actually constructed the machines under such authority, and put them in operation, he had then acquired full dominion over the property of the machines, and an absolute and unrestricted right to use and operate them until they were worn out.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Patentees acquire the exclusive right to make and use, and vend to others to be used, their patented inventions for the period of time specified in the patent, but when they have made and vended to others to be used one or more of the things patented, to that extent they have parted with their exclusive right. They are entitled to but one royalty for a patented machine, and consequently when a patentee has himself constructed the machine and sold it, or authorized another to construct and sell it, or to construct and use and operate it, and the consideration has been paid to him for the right, he has then to that extent parted with his monopoly, and ceased to have any interest whatever in the machine so sold or so authorized to be constructed and operated. Where such circumstances appear, the owner of the machine, whether he built it or purchased it, if he has also acquired the right to use and operate it during the lifetime of the patent, may continue to use it until it is worn out, in spite of any and every extension subsequently obtained by the patentee or his assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Provision is made by the eighteenth section of the act of the 4th of July, 1836, for the extension of patents beyond the time of their limitation. By the latter clause of that section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the benefit of such renewal is expressly extended to assignees and grantees, of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective interests therein. 5 <em>Stat, at Large, </em>125. Under that provision it has repeatedly been held by this court that a party who had purchased and was using a patented machine, during the original term for which the patent was granted, had a right to continue to use the same during the extension. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>4 How., 646. Founded as that rule is upon the distinction between the grant of the right to make and vend the machine, and the grant of the right to use it, the justice of the case will always be obvious, if that distinction is kept in view and the rule itself is properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Purchasers of the exclusive privilege of making or vending the patented machine in a specified place, hold a portion of the franchise which the patent confers, and of course the interest which they acquire terminates at the time limited for its continuance by the law which created it, unless it is expressly stipulated to the contrary. But the purchaser of the implement or machine, for the purpose of using it in the ordinary pursuits of life, stands on different ground. Such certainly were the views of this court in the case of <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>McQuewan, </em>14 How., 549, where the whole subject was very fully considered. Attention is drawn to the fact that there was considerable diversity of opinion among the judges in disposing of that case, but the circumstance is entitled to no weight in this case, because the court has since unanimously affirmed the same rule. <em>Chaffee </em>v. <em>The Boston Belting Co., </em>22 How., 223. In the case last mentioned the court say, that when the patented machine rightfully passes from the patentee to the purchaser, or from any other person by bim authorized to convey it, the machine is no longer within the limits of the monopoly. By a valid sale and purchase the patented machine becomes the private individual property of the purchaser, and is no longer specially protected by the laws of the United States, but by the laws of the State in which it is situated. Hence it is obvious, say the court, that if a person legally acquires a title to that which is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>subject of letters patent, he may continue to use it until it is worn out, or he may repair it or improve upon it as he pleases, in the same manner as if dealing with property of any other kind. <em>Webbs.
