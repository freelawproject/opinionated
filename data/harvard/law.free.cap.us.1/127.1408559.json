They contended, that, even admitting there had been an usurious contract between the parties to this suit and Anne Gibbs ; yet, as it did not appear that any part of the money had been paid, no penalty was incurred ; for the words of the- act are, that no person shall <em>receive </em>or <em>take. </em>They said, likewise, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>although the consideration of the bond was originally usurious, the act of assembly did not make it void ; but only worked a forfeiture to the value of the thing or money lent; and that, therefore, without going further, if the defendant\u2019s cross-action did not appear, from his own stating, well founded, it should not be made the instrument of delaying the plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-4\"><em>Dallas </em>asserted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKo\">that he was prepared to prove Gibbs had received a part of the money, and that, therefore, the usury was complete. He argued, that if the original agreement be corrupt between all the parties, and so within the act, no color would exempt it from the dangers of usury, 1 Brownl. 73; 2 And. 428; 4 Shep. Abr. 170. That it is not material whether the payment of the principal and the usurious interest'be secured by the same or different conveyances, for all writings whatsoever for the strengthening such a contract are void. 1 Hawk. 248; Cro. Jac. 252, 508. That a second bond, made after the forfeiture of a former, and conditioned for the receipt of interest, according to the penalty of the forfeited bond, is within the statute. 1 Hawk. 248; 3 Keb. 142. That if a bond depends on some other deed, and that deed becomes void, the bond is void also. 2 Wils. 341. And that a fine levied, or a judgment suffered for the security of money, in pursuance of an usurious contract, may be avoided, by an averment of the corrupt agreement, as well as any parol contract. 1 Hawk. 248; 3 Rol. 509. He said, that the defendant did not wish to diminish the plaintiff\u2019s security, but only to obtain a cessation of proceedings until the illegal consideration of the bond was ascertained by the event of the cross-action ; that if the consideration was illegal by statute, it was void by the common law ; and, consequently, that the defendant would then be entitled to recover from the plaintiff as much as was now taken in execution. 2 Wils. 341; Garth. 225. But\u2014</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b150-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">We cannot in this way enter into a consideration of the merits of another action. Nor ought we, upon so slight a foundation, to grant a rule to show cause ; for such rules, by the delay which they occasion, are frequently as prejudicial to the plaintiff, as if they were made absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\"><em>Dallas </em>took nothing by his motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
