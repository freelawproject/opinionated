M.

After hearing argument by Mr. Mordecai, in behalf of respondent, for the motion, and Mr. Burke, in behalf of appellants, contra, it is adjudged by the court, that the objection is well taken; and it is, therefore, ordered, that the said appeal be dismissed, without prejudice to the appellants upon final judgment to appeal from such order if the same be appealable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
