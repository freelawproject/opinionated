Claim 10 is illustrative. It reads: \u201cAn atomizer nozzle comprising a nozzle tip having a cavity in its inner end, and a discharge opening from said cavity to the outer end of said tip; a spreader element seated against the end wall of said cavity and having a number of grooves in its outer end forming passages from between said element and the wall of said cavity to said discharge opening, and a retaining device screwed in the inner end of said tip and removably abutting against said spreader element and having openings therethrough for the passage of fluid into said cavity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The reference is: Gronlind (Norwegian) 35,005,1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">Appellants\u2019 device is adapted for use in 011 burners and for other uses where finely atomized liquid is desired. The oil, or other substance, to be sprayed is caused to whirl within the tip of the nozzle by means of a \u201cspreader element.\u201d The structure in question, fully described in the quoted claim, is composed of three members\u2014a nozzle tip, inclosing a \u201cspreader element,\u201d and a retaining device screwed in the end of the nozzle tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">The patent to Gronlind discloses an atomizing nozzle for oil burners. Inclosed within the nozzle tip is a steel plate, held in place by a ring. The steel plate is separable from the nozzle, and, as stated by the Board of Appeals, appears to \u201cconstitute a wall of the cavity in the nozzle against which the spreader element is seated.\u201d The spreader . element, the steel plate, and the ring, are secured in position by a retaining device\u2014an oil supply pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">In his decision, the Primary Examiner, among other things, said: \u201cThe reference on which the claims were rejected shows a nozzle tip comprising members 1, 2 and 4 which are independent of each other but which could be made integral if desired; without involving invention since this is the well known and usual practice. This practice being of such common knowledge to those familiar with the art, the citation of reference disclosing the same has been deemed unnecessary. Moreover, even as independent members they are the full equivalent of applicants\u2019 tip. Oil pipe 6 has an extension 12 which fits into a cavity in \u2018spreader\u2019 member 5. By means of interacting screw threads on the tip and oil pipe members 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are rigidly held together. Extension 12 has canals which communicate with canals 8 in member 5, and tangential passages 10 establish communication with annular channel 9 and the outlet cavity. These passages are the full equivalent of applicants\u2019 passages. Moreover, the result obtained in the Norwegian patent is substantially identical with that obtained by applicant. Construed in this manner the device disclosed in the reference fully anticipates applicants\u2019 claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">The Board of Appeals concurred in the views expressed by the Primary Examiner, and stated that appellants\u2019 device was not patentably different from that disclosed by the reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">It is claimed by appellants that they have made a self-contained device, comprising only three elements, which can be manufactured and sold as an assembled unit at a low cost; and that the Gronlind nozzle, composed of five elements, \u201ccannot be manufactured and assembled and sold as a complete and unitary device because the parts thereof will separate and fall apart.\u201d It is further argued that the Gronlind nozzle is not operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">It is also contended by counsel for appellants that a \u201cforeign patent is to be measured as anticipatory not by what might have been made out of it, but by what is clearly and definitely expressed in it,\u201d and that, as it would be necessary to make changes in the Gronlind structure, in order to make it operative, it can not be considered as an anticipation of appellants\u2019 device.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">We may say at the outset that we agree with the views expressed by the tribunals of the Patent Office that the Gronlind device is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>not only operative, but that it performs the same function, in substantially the same way, as that of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">It is true, as argued by counsel for appellants, that, by changing the form of the nozzle tip, the steel plate and the ring for maintaining it in position, disclosed in the reference, have been omitted. However, the steel plate is referred to in the reference as exchangeable, and, it is argued by the solicitor for the Patent Office, was intended as an easy repair feature. This is undoubtedly true. Therefore, by malting the nozzle tip in one piece instead of two pieces, appellants have eliminated <em>the </em>ring and its function and, also, the repair feature inherent in the removable plate. They have, also, changed the form of the retaining element. However, all of 'the elements in appellants\u2019 device, or their equivalents, are found in the reference, where they perform the same functions in substantially the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">It is our opinion that the reference so clearly discloses appellants\u2019 alleged invention as to enable a mechanic skilled in the art to construct it without resorting to experiments, and that the modifications made by appellants are devoid of patentable novelty. This being so, the reference, although a foreign patent, is a proper one and is sufficient to negative patentability of the involved claims. Hoskins Mfg. Co. v. General Electric Co. (D. C.) 212 F. 422, 429, and cases cited; Selectasine Patents Co. v. Presto-O-Graph Co. (D. C.) 267 F. 840; Walker on Patents, vol. 1, \u00a7 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
