The side socket extends at an angle of about 45 degrees. The body of the socket is ornamented by flat panels arranged vertically, and extending from an externally threaded portion at one end to&gt; an externally threaded portion at the other end. The side socket is similarly ornamented.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Figures 131 and 102 in the Catalog reference show plural or two-way sockets, the side sockets of which extend at right angles to the main body portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Appellant\u2019s design differs from the references in contour, and has two side sockets extending at right angles from opposite sides of the middle portion-of the main body. The surface at the middle of the main body is smooth. Corrugated panels or facets of varied lengths, which extend vertically both above and below the smooth surface of the main body, are so arranged as to give the socket a very ornamental appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">The Board of Appeals, in affirming the decision of the Primary Examiner, said that the patent to Both disclosed \u201cthe character of a panel or facet surface ornamentation disclosed by the applicant.\u201d We are unable to concur in this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">As hereinbefore stated, the patent to Both shows flat panels arranged vertically and extending, without interruption, substantially the entire length of the main body and on the side socket. Appellant\u2019s electric light socket, however,\u2019 is ornamented with corrugated panels, differing in length, and extending vertically on the main body both above and below a smooth surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The Patent Office tribunals also concurred in holding that it required nothing more than the skill of the designer or artisan to so modify the references as to obtain appellant\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">That appellant\u2019s design is both novel and ornamental is not questioned by the Patent Office tribunals nor by the Solicitor of Patents. Therefore, the sole question before us is whether the exercise of the inventive faculties was required to produce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">After giving the matter careful consideration, we find ourselves out of harmony with the views expressed by the Board of Appeals. The references show electric light sockets, and appellant\u2019s design is for an article of like character, but there the similarity ends. We are of opinion that appellant\u2019s design is not suggested by the references; that it is not only substantially different from them, but produces a substantially different \u00abesthetic effect; and that, it involves invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
