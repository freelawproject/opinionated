Mahony Co. et al. (C. C. A.) 56 F.(2d) 74, decided this day, and for the additional reason that the facts in the instant suit disclose that there was no employee of the same \u201cclass\u201d who had worked \u201csubstantially the whole\u201d year, etc., whose earnings could be used as a standard for computing appellant\u2019s compensation under 33 USCA \u00a7 910 (b). Accordingly, computation under subsection (b) was clearly \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cunreasonable,\u201d if not mathematically impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The additional argument of the appellant herein, however, to the effect that the District Court erred in entering a decree for the refund of excess payments made to the applicant under the award of the deputy commissioner, is sound. There is nothing in the record, including the pleadings, to justify the court in entering that portion of the decree. We therefore hold that the last paragraph of the decree should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">With, this modification, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
