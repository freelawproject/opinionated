A. Bradley, now deceased, made and delivered to the county treasurer of Cuyahoga county, Ohio, a check of the said Bradley,,drawn on the Union Trust Company of Cleveland, in the sum of $47,383.51, in payment of certain taxes on real estate of the said taxpayer then due and payable. This cheek was accepted by the county treasurer on condition that it should be promptly paid on presentation to the drawee therein, the tax statement expressly reciting that, if cheeks received for taxes were \u201cnot paid on presentation, the taxes will be restored to duplicate without further notice, and penalty added.\u201d On the following day, and before presentation of the cheek for payment, the taxpayer died. Thereafter, on September 21, 1926, the check was presented to the institution on which it was drawn and immediately paid by it. This payment has not been challenged or questioned either by the county or by the estate of the deceased, but, on the contrary, has been recognized and approved by them as a payment, by such deceased, of the said taxes, as of the time of the'delivery and acceptance of the aforementioned cheek. The deceased kept his books on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements, and this payment was included as a deductible item in the income tax return of the deceased for the period from January 1, 1926, to June 26, 1926, as filed by the respondent executors. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed this item as a deduction from the gross income of the deceased, which disallowance, on peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>tion of the respondents for a redetermination of the matter, was set aside by the Board of Tax Appeals. The Commissioner seeks to review such decision of the Board here.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Section 214 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (chapter 27, 44 Statutes at Large, 9, 26; 26 USCA \u00a7 955 (a) (3), which was in effect at the times here involved, included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\u201cIn computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201c(3) Taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Section 200 (d) of said act (44 Statutes at Large, 10, 26 USCA \u00a7 931 (d) provided in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">\u201cThe deductions and credits provided for in this title shall be taken for the taxable year in which \u2018paid or accrued\u2019 or \u2018paid or incurred,\u2019 dependent upon the method of accounting upon the basis of which the net income is computed under section 212 or 232; unless in order to clearly reflect the income the deductions or credits should be taken as of a different period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Section 212 (b) of the said act (44 Statutes at Large, 23, 26 USCA \u00a7 953 (b), included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">\u201cThe net income shall be computed upon the basis of the taxpayer\u2019s annual accounting period * * * in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer; but if no such method of accounting has been so employed, or if the method employed does not clearly reflect the income, the computation shall be made in accordance with such method as in the opinion of the Commissioner does clearly reflect the income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">The sole question involved is whether the payment of the taxes mentioned is a proper deduction from the gross income of the deceased taxpayer, for the last taxable period of his. lifetime, as contended by the respondent executors of his estate and held by the Board of Tax Appeals, or whether such payment is deductible only from the gross income of such executors, for the taxable period subsequent to the death of the deceased, as claimed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">We think it entirely clear that the decision of the Board was correct. It cannot he doubted that the delivery and acceptance of this check as payment of the taxes in question constituted a conditional payment, by the deceased, of such taxes, as of the time of such delivery and acceptance, subject only to a condition subsequent that such check would be promptly paid on presentation thereof to the drawee. Second National Bank of Saginaw v. United States (Ct. Cl.) 42 F.(2d) 344; 21 Ruling Case Law, 70; 48 Corpus Juris, 618. When, therefore, the cheek was paid promptly on such presentation, the condition to which this payment was subject was performed, and what had been, at the time of the acceptance of the check, a conditional payment by the deceased, became an absolute payment by him as of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">The fact that the death of the drawer of the cheek before its presentation revoked the authority of the drawee to pay it did not affect the validity or effect of such check as between the drawer and the payee, at least after its payment by the drawee, but merely subjected the latter to possible liability to the estate of the deceased for such unauthorized payment. As, however, neither the estate nor the county is complaining of such payment, but both have acquiesced therein, the legal situation as between the taxpayer and the government appears to be, in all substantial respects, the same as if the check had been presented and paid during the life of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">We conclude that the Board of Tax Appeals reached the correct result, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
