Plaintiff carried on its operations during these years under a certain contract with the Director General of Railroads. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held, and the defendant here contends, that the government securities, upon which this interest was received, were purchased with money belonging to the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-27\">The second question concerns invested capital for 1921. The property of other express companies carrying on an express transportation business within the United States was paid in to the plaintiff July 1, 1918, for plaintiff\u2019s stock; its actual value being fixed and approved by the Director General of Railroads at $31,642,109.64 and the property entered upon the plaintiff\u2019s books at that figure. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held, and the defendant here contends, that this valuation was as of November 30, 1917, and, without any examination or investigation of the amount or value of the property when it was actually transferred to the plaintiff July 1, 1918, reduced the amount included in invested capital by $1,199,720.12 alleged to represent depreciation during the seven months intervening between November 30, 1917, and July 1, 1918.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-28\">The third question is with reference to the inclusion in invested capital of certain stock issued by plaintiff to the Adams Express Company, denominated qualified capital stock, in the amount of $1,594,000. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue decided that this stock was not issued for cash or property, and excluded the amount thereof from invested capital for 1921. The plaintiff claims this stock was issued for value residing in miscellaneous equipment acquired from the Adams-Southern Express Company. It charged the amount of this stock to miscellaneous equipment, and included it in invested capital at its organization, and in computing net income for 1920 and 1921 charged against income in each of those years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>$159,399.96 as exhaustion, wear, and tear of property on account of this item, representing 10 per cent, of the total amount on the basis of a ten-year life for the miscellaneous equipment acquired for such stock. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied these deductions to the extent of $53,133.38 for 1920 and in the full amount for 1921, for the same reason that he refused to include the total amount in invested capital.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-4\">Special Findings of Fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-5\">1. The plaintiff, a Delaware corporation known as the American Railway Express Company, was organized between June 21 and June 26, 1918, pursuant to an agreement between the United States, by the Director General of Railroads, and the Adams Express Company, American Express Company, Southern Express Company, and Wells-Fargo <em>&amp; </em>Co., dated June 21, 1918, Its name was changed in 1929 to Railway &amp; Express Company. For the purposes of this case, therefore, the plaintiff will hereinafter be referred to as the American Railway Express Company. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-6\">For many years prior to June 10, 1918, and until July 1, 1918, the express business in the United States was handled principally by the Adams, American, Southern, and Wells-Fargo &amp; Co. Express Companies, such companies having contracts with most of the railroads and other transportation lines for the transportation of express matter on trains, and for the use of other facilities the Great Northern, the Northern, and the Western Express Companies were operating over those railroads in the Northwest. On June 10, 1918, the Adams Express Company, for and on behalf of itself and the Southern Express Company, the American Express Company, and Wells-Fargo &amp; Co., entered into a written agreement by the terms of which it was agreed that they would form an express company to be known as the American Railway Express Company with an authorized capital stock of $40,000,000, the shares to be of a par value of $100 each, of which $33,000,000 should be fully paid. This agreement is in evidence as Exhibit F, and is made a part of this finding by reference. The purpose and object of the consolidation of these companies under the name of the American Railway Express'Company were to bring the express business completely under the management of one organization, as the result of the control of the railroads by the United States. In order to carry out this purpose, these companies on June 12, 1918, leased the. properties of the Great Northern, the Northern, and the Western Express Companies. Following this contract the plaintiff became duly organized during June, 1918, and, after July 1, 1918, carried on the express business of the United States, with its principal office at New York.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-8\">The board of directors or board of managers of the several companies duly adopted resolutions authorizing the respective presidents to transfer to the newly formed corporation all of the property and equipment of the company used in its business and the payment of a sufficient sum in cash to meet its subscription to the stock of the new company, as provided for in paragraph 2 of the joint agreement of June 10. All of the resolutions were of the same purport, and substantially similar in language. The following resolution adopted by the Adams Express Company June 6, 1918, is representative of them all:</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-9\">\u201cResolved, That the president be, and he is hereby, authorized to transfer to the corporation to be formed pursuant to said contract all of the property and equipment of this company used in the operation of its domestic express business and a sufficient sum of cash to meet its subscription to the stock of said new company in the total amount of $7,919,510 (tentative); and be it further</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-10\">\u201cResolved, That the president and secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized, upon the formation of said new company and the taking over by it of the domestic express business now conducted by this company, to cancel so far as possible the contracts now existing between this company and its railroad lines operated by the director general, and assign to said new express company all contracts with other railroads, and all contracts, leases, and other privileges, rights or benefits belonging to this company and used in the operation of its domestic express transportation business, and to make and execute good and sufficient deeds for all real estate belonging to this company and used by it in' its said business, and to execute any and all other instruments and perform any and all other acts that may be necessary to carry into effect fully the purpose of said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b736-11\">2. By the aforementioned agreement between the express companies it was contemplated and understood that qualified stock of the plaintiff of the par value of $1,594,000 should be issued to the Adams Express Company in addition to the ordinary capital stock issued to that company for its contribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>cash and tangible property. This qualified stock was not to share in the distribution of dividends until after payment of 5 per cent, on the ordinary capital stock. It was also provided that the holder thereof should not participate in any distribution of assets in the event of liquidation of the new corporation within ten years from the commencement of the business, \u201cunless and until the balance of the issued capital stock shall have received par value in such contribution.\u201d All of the properties of the old express companies were paid in to plaintiff on July 1, 1918, pursuant to the agreement mentioned and the agreement of June 26, 1918, between the Director General of Railroads and the plaintiff hereinafter mentioned in finding 3, and, thereafter, the plaintiff issued ordinary common stock to the old companies and the above qualified common stock to the Adams Express Company for the properties so paid in after the Director General of Railroads had investigated and determined the values of such properties paid in and had issued certificates authorizing plaintiff to issue stock therefor, as will be hereinafter specifically set forth. The capital stock of $1,594,000 issued to the Adams Express Company represented a part of the purchase price paid by the plaintiff for value in that amount residing in miscellaneous equipment paid in by the Adams-Southern Express Company in excess of the actual value for which ordinary common stock was issued. In 1919 this qualified stock was entered upon plaintiff\u2019s books as a charge to miscellaneous equipment account, from which the amount thereof was cleared or written off by monthly charges to operating expenses as exhaustion, wear, and tear of property over a period of ten years, being the useful life of the miscellaneous property acquired therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-4\">3. June 21, 1918, the Director General of Railroads, acting for the United States, entered into an agreement with the Adams Express Company, American Express Company, Southern Express Company, and Wells-Fargo &amp; Co., as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-5\">\u201cWhereas the President of the United States, on December 28, 1917, acting under the'powers conferred on him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including those conferred by section 1 of the act of Congress entitled \u2019An act making appropriations for the support of the Army for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917, and for other purposes,\u2019 approved August 29, 1916, took possession and assumed control of certain railroads and systems of transportation, and has since operated and controlled the same; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b737-7\">\u201cWhereas by a proclamation dated March 29, 1918, the President of the United States authorized William G.

These contracts provide, among other things: \u201cIt is agreed that the value of the entire real property and equipment and other capital hereinabove referred to was on July 1, 1918, $34,642,109.64, that being the value fixed by the Director General of Railroads.\u201d By \u201cthe entire real property and equipment and other capital hereinabove referred to\u201d is meant the entire real property and equipment and other capital of plaintiff employed in the express transportation business.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-13\">All of said stock so issued was ordinary common stock, except $1,594,000, known as qualified common stock, which, by agreement of the' plaintiff with the American, Wells-Fargo, Adams, and Southern Express companies, was issued and delivered to the Adams Express Company. This stock was issued for miscellaneous equipment, as aforesaid, and in its annual accounts the plaintiff charged to operating expenses and against income and credited to miscellaneous equipment such amounts which, if such charges were continued for ten years, would have extinguished the entire $1,594,000 included in miscellaneous equipment, as aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Afu\">8. Plaintiff carried on its operations and continued the express business of the United States over the railroads under federal control from July 1, 1918, to February 29, 1920, known as the federal control period under the contract with the Director General of Railroads. For the six months following federal control, March 1 to September 1, 1920, known as the guaranty period, plaintiff operated under the guaranty provisions of the Transportation Act of 1920, as contemplated in section 209 (i) of that act, 41 Stat. 456, 467. During the federal control and the guaranty periods the plaintiff\u2019s stockholders selected its directors and the directors selected its officers. The company\u2019s operations during federal control and the guaranty periods resulted in losses which were assumed by the Director General and the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-16\">9. Plaintiff duly filed its return for 1920 disclosing a tax of $73,172.87, which was assessed and paid as hereinafter set forth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-17\">10. June 15, 1922, it filed an amended return for 1920 showing a total tax liability for that year of $12,546.70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-18\">Upon audit of these returns subsequent to the payment of the tax shown on the original return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined an additional tax of $69,125.34, which, together with interest of $5,043.31, was duly paid by cash and a credit. The total tax of $142,298.21, and the interest above mentioned, was paid in five installments of $18,293.22 each on March 15, June 14, and September 14, 1921, $18,293.21 on December 14, 1921, and $74,168.65 on September 26, 1927.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-19\">11. Plaintiff filed its return for 1921 disclosing a tax of $265,195.06, which was assessed and paid except the amount of $60,626.17 thereof, for which plaintiff filed a claim asking that this amount be credited against an alleged overpayment for 1920. This claim for credit was rejected, and the amount was paid as set forth below, with interest of $12,428.36. The total tax and interest of $277,623.42 for this year were paid in six installments of $50,560.03, $82,037.51, $5,672.59, $66,298.76, $60,626.17, and $12,428.36 on March 15, June 15, September 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>and December 18, 1922, and on October 23, 1926, and June 6, 1927, respectively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-4\">The .defendant determined an overpayment in tax of $8,503.84 for 1921, and on May 24, 1927, credited $6,743.86 to the tax for 1920, and on November 26, 1928, refunded the balance of $1,759.98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-5\">Plaintiff filed waivers for the taxable years extending the limitation period for assessment and collection to December 31, 1927. It also duly filed claims for refund for the taxable years setting forth the grounds upon which this suit was based. These claims were disallowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, except that the claim for 1921 was partially allowed as to items not here in question. This suit was instituted within two years after the claims were disallowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-6\">12. The original return for 1920 showed a net taxable income of $1,536,635.06 and the amended return for that year a net income of $930,373.39; the difference in the net income shown on these returns being the result of additional deductions from gross income for express privilege liability of $424,149 and other expenses of $182,112.67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-7\"><em>For the </em>purpose of his final audit, the Commissioner used the net income shown in the amended return, and in computing the total tax made certain additions thereto including the items involved in this suit. He disallowed the item of express privilege liability claimed for 1920 and allowed it for 1921, permitting the additional expenses claimed in the amended return for 1920 to stand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-8\">Plaintiff included in the gross income shown in the return for 1920 interest in the amount of $45,003.07 from funded securities, and $1,592,661.32 from unfunded securities and accounts, totaling $1,637,664.39.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed this credit on the ground that the securities were purchased with funds belonging to the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-25\">There was a charge against income in each of the years 1920 and 1921 of $159,399.96, being 10 per cent, of the total amount of $1,594,000, for which the qualified common stock was issued; the amount so charged being claimed as a depreciation deduction in the return for 1920. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the deduction to the extent of $53,133.38, being that portion of such charge made in 1920 after September 1 of that year. This deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the ground that stock in that amount was issued to the Adams Express Company in <em>excess </em>of the value of the property and cash contributed, and was not, therefore, a proper deduction as an ordinary and necessary expense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-26\">13. The return for 1921 stated a net taxable income of $3,094,931.28. Plaintiff included in gross income shown by this return the interest received during <em>the </em>year in the amount of $262,275.92 from funded securities and $1,376,828.30 from unfunded securities and accounts.

His reason for this action is stated in his letter to the plaintiff, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThe amount $958,447.19 claimed by you as tax exempt interest for the year 1921 is reduced by $238,276.84, the amount which you credited to the Director General as his share of interest. Since it has been held that the tax exempt securities on which $802,906.40 was earned in 1920 were purchased with funds of, and belonged to, the Director General, and since his fund was still sufficient, it must be assumed that enough of the securities belonged to him in 1921 to produce the amount of income with which you credited his account, and that such amount should not be used to reduce your taxable income for the year.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-6\">14. During the federal control and guaranty periods plaintiff deducted certain sums from current receipts, and entered these amounts in its books as reserves to meet deferred liabilities of those periods. These reserves were merely book accounts and represented plaintiff\u2019s outstanding liabilities on account of operations during these periods. They produced no interest received by plaintiff. Said liabilities were not currently paid, and their amount was unknown and depended upon the adjudication of many claims. Plaintiff did not know to whom such liabilities were owing; if the claims against it were sustained, payment would be made to the claimants, otherwise the amount of the reserve would be credited to the Director General 'and the Treasury Department as an abatement of deficits charged to them, because said reserves were charged against income and were reflected in the deficits from operations which the Director General and the Treasury Department made good. No money or securities were set apart, or earmarked, by the company to meet these liabilities. The reserves were simply book account's evidencing the liability of the company, and there was no segregation of .the assets to meet such liabilities. The funds thus accumulated, for the reason that plaintiff did not, and necessarily could not, currently pay its liabilities represented by the reserves for injuries, .damages, and losses for which it was liable, were deposited in plaintiff\u2019s treasury and were commingled together and with all other funds of the plaintiff. Prom time to time after July 1, 1918, and during 1919, 1920, and 1921, some moneys were withdrawn from\u2019the plaintiff\u2019s treasury and invested in income-producing seeurities. Moneys not so withdrawn were deposited in banks in the name of the plaintiff and subject to its sole order, interest being received with respect to such bank deposits, as hereinbefore mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-9\">The plaintiff accounted in its books for interest received in 1920 and 1921 according to the accounting system prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, under two classifications, to wit, interest from unfunded obligations and interest from funded obligations. By the first was meant obligations with a maturity of less than one year from date of issue; by the second, obligations with a maturity of more than' one year from date of issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-10\">The net charges for depreciation from 1918 to 1921, inclusive, totaled $8,577,394.43, which were set up in reserves. The said reserves were reflected in cash and other assets to the same extent and in the same way as other reserves, there being no segregation or allocation of any assets thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-11\">All the interest received by plaintiff from all sources during the period July 1, 1918, to September 1, 1920, was included by plaintiff in its gross income when determining the amount of losses sustained from operations for the purpose of calculating the deficits which the Director General and the United States made good under the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-12\">15. During the federal control period and during the guaranty period, plaintiff sold at a profit certain of its physical assets. Such profit likewise was included in income when computing the deficits chargeable to the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-13\">16. Plaintiff credited to the Director General of Railroads for 1920 and 1921 interest computed as follows: The average rate of interest received on all its interest-bearing assets, including bonds, bank balances, mortgages and interest-bearing assets of every nature, was ascertained, and the Director General paid at the same average rate from time to time on the balances from time to time owing to the Director General after February 29, 1920. The amount of interest so credited for 1920 was $362,102.16. The debit of this amount was entered in the account, interest on unfunded debt, and said amount was charged as a deduction on the return for 1920 and allowed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b749-14\">17. There was no relation in the books between the credits resulting from interest received made to account No. 309, interest on unfunded securities and accounts, and debits resulting from interest paid on unfunded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>debt made to account No. 324, interest on unfunded debt. These accounts were in no way tied together.. The amount of interest so charged as a deduction and credited for 1921 was $238,276.84. This amount was charged as a deduction from income in the return for 1921 and was allowed by the Commissioner. All interest received or accrued during 1920 and 1921, including interest on government obligations, except that which was wholly exempt, was included as income in the returns for those years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-4\">18. The securities in which the plaintiff invested were held by its treasurer in the city of New York. Neither the Director General nor the Treasury Department of the United States had any access to the securities or the coupons on them, and they exercised no control over and received no notice of the purchase or sale by plaintiff of the securities, or withdrawals from and deposits in the bank accounts. In December, 1924, a final settlement agreement was made between the plaintiff and the Director General, at which time plaintiff paid certain amounts to the Director General and obligated itself to pay further amounts. The Director General at that time left with the plaintiff a trust fund of $700,000, being the estimated amount necessary to liquidate the remaining obligations of the plaintiff incurred during the period of federal control from July 1, 1918, to February 29, 1920. This trust fund was deposited in the bank in plaintiff\u2019s name as trustee for the Director General. Part of the fund was immediately invested in Liberty loan bonds purchased by the Director General from plaintiff at the market price on the day of the purchase. At that'time plaintiff owned more than $1,000,000 par amount of Liberty bonds which it had owned prior to March 1, 1920.</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-5\">19. The Director General of Railroads in his report for 1924 set forth the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-6\">\u201cDuring the period of this contract, July 1, 1918, to February 29, 1920, the 50.25 per cent, of the gross revenue which the express company was required to pay to the Railroad Administration amounted to $228,389,436.93. However, the express company was unable .to meet its operating expenses and taxes from the 49.75 per cent, of the gross revenue remaining. A deficit resulted, amounting to $36,047,460.14, which was deducted from the $228,389,436.93 due the Railroad Administration, so that the Railroad Administration received in cash $190,041,976.79 and an obligation for $2,300,000 from the American Railway Express Co. for the period July 1, 1918, to February 29, 1920.</p>\n<p data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-7\">\u201cAt the end of Federal control arrangements were made with the express company by Director General Hines for it to liquidate all transactions arising out of the Federal-control period, and chargeable under the agreement with it to the operations of this period.</p>\n<p data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-8\">\u201cThe accounts as between the express company and the Railroad Administration have been carefully audited by the respective comptrollers of the two organizations, and, as a result, on December 11, 1924, an agreement of final settlement was entered into between the said parties, in which an indebtedness of a balance of $4,610,000 was admitted by the express company. Of this amount $1,610,000 was paid in cash; an obligation of the express company bearing 6 per cent, interest was given in the sum of $2,300,000, this obligation being secured by assignment of whatever sum may be finally found due the express company from the Government by the Interstate Commerce Commission, under section 209 of the transportation act; and a trustee account of $700,000 was set up to enable the liquidation of the affairs of the American Railway Express Co. to be completed, provision being made to collect through this account all outstanding assets and pay all outstanding liabilities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-9\">\u201cPractically all of the liabilities consist of pending litigation. On December 31, 1924, there were pending some 2,295 cases, in which there was claimed an aggregate of $1,036,369.04. The adjustment of this litigation and the collection of outstanding assets is being prosecuted as rapidly as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b750-10\">20. In the return for 1921 plaintiff reported an invested capital of $35,069,512.40. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue in letters of May 15, 1926, and February 21, 1927, constituting his final decision in respect of plaintiff\u2019s tax liability for the taxable years in question, computed and determined an invested capital for 1921 of $33,055,343. In this determination the Commissioner excluded from invested capital $1,248,633.38 on account of the qualified common stock of $1,594,000 issued by plaintiff upon its organization to the Adams Express Company on the ground that nothing had been paid in to plaintiff for this stock. The Commissioner, however, permitted the amount of $345,366.62 to remain in invested capital for 1921 on account of this item, said amount being the total of the charges made by plaintiff during the federal control period and the guaranty period which the Director General and the Interstate Commerce Commission had allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>ed to stand in arriving at the settlements with the Director General and the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5W\">21. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue further reduced invested capital for 1921 in the amount of $1,199,720.12 on the ground, as stated in his letter to the plaintiff, that \u201cthe property with which the American Railway Express Company commenced operation was acquired from the old express companies on the basis of its depreciated book value as of November 30,1917, and payment therefor was made in capital stock. Actual transfer of the property did not take place, however, until July 1, 1918, and depreciation accrued amounting to $1,199,720.12. Apparently this was not taken into consideration when the stock was issued, inasmuch as the amount was equal to the November 30, 1917, book value of the property with no adjustment for depreciation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b751-5\">This adjustment by the Commissioner was made without investigation or examination of the property acquired by the plaintiff, or the value at the date of acquisition.

The defendant now agrees that, if it should be held that the securities in question were purchased with funds belonging to the Director General or the United States, the income received thereon should not be included in gross income. It further agrees that, if the relationship of the Director General and plaintiff was that of creditor and debtor, the plaintiff is entitled to the credits claimed, and properly treated them on its returns. The history and purpose of plaintiff\u2019s organization are shown by the agreement of June 10 of the old express companies, the contract of June 21, 1918, between the Director General of Railroads and the old express companies, and the contract of June 26, 1918, between the Director General and .the plaintiff. The legal relationship of the Director General and the plaintiff and the plaintiff\u2019s rights and responsibilities are to be determined from these agreements and the practical construction thereof by the parties concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">We are of the opinion that the obligations of the United States which produced the interest in question for 1920 and 1921 were not the property of the Director General of .Railroads or of the Treasury Department, but were plaintiff\u2019s property and that the interest therefrom was properly treated by it on its returns. The relationship of the Director General of Railroads and the plaintiff was contractual and was that of debtor and creditor, and not fiduciary. A fiduciary relationship connotes a relation of trust as the basis of obligation of the one and of security for the protection of the right of the other, rather than a basis of contractual provisions. It requires an element of confidence reposed by one in another without that limitation upon authority or accountability that contract terms impose, or without those exact limitations that are applicable in determining the rights and responsibilities of a creditor and debtor. Fiduciary relationship cannot exist in those instances where the contract provisions are mandatory, because of the. nature of the work, or where the contract is resorted to in order that the exact rights and\u2019 responsibilities may be definitely defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">There is no similarity between the operations of the plaintiff company and those of the railroads under federal control. Plaintiff took over the properties of all of the express-companies'and carried on the express business in its corporate capacity with its own properties subject to the terms of the contract with the Director General of Railroads. Although the President in November, 1918, issued a proclamation assuming control of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>system of transportation called the American Railway Express <em>Company and </em>directed that the possession, control, operation, and utilization of said express transportation system by him undertaken should be exercised by the Director General of Railroads, the Director General did not assume direction, control, and operation of the express transportation system, but by a further contract with the plaintiff of November 21, 1918, after the President\u2019s proclamation, adopted, ratified, and confirmed the contract with plaintiff of June 26, 1918, and agreed that the express transportation business was to be managed and conducted during the period of federal control, under the terms of said contract, by the board of directors, officers, and employees of the plaintiff company, and that the contract of June 26, 1918, should fix, according to law, the compensation to which the plaintiff should be entitled so long as the said agreement remained in force. The Director General had assumed direction, control, and operation of railroads, and the contract with plaintiff was for the purpose of centralizing the management and control of the express transportation business in one company and providing for certain payments by that company to the Director General in lieu of express-privilege payments formerly made to the railroads, prior to federal control, by the various express companies carrying on express business over their lines. The properties of the express companies and the express business carried on in the United States might have been taken over and directly managed and operated by the Director General, as was done in respect to the properties of the business of railroads. This however, was not done; the contractual arrangement being used instead. There was no supervision or control of the details of operations. Neither the Director General nor the Treasury Department evidenced any control ov\u00e9r or interest in the investment affairs of the plaintiff. The government assumed no responsibility for the payment of current operating expenses or claims against the corporation. For all of these matters the plaintiff was liable in its corporate capacity, and, having executed the contract which left the management of the affairs of the express companies in the hands of the plaintiff subject to the provisions covering operations, payment of expenses, claims, taxes, and disposition of profits, \u00e9tc., the respective rights and obligations with reference to the operation of the express business, as and when funds accumulated, of necessity became one of debtor and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The contract of June 26, 1918, was similar in many respects to contracts between express companies and railroads free of government control. The business was to be \u201cconducted under such rates, charges, classifications, regulations, and practices as are now or may hereafter be lawfully established.\u201d The Director General was required, as had been the railroads, to \u201cfurnish adequate and suitable space in ears properly equipped, lighted, and lettered, \u2018American Railway Express Company,\u2019 of the kind customarily furnished by railroad companies for the use of express companies on such passenger, mail, and express trains as may be designated from time to time by the Director General\u201d and to permit the use of \u201ca portion of station buildings on the lines covered by this agreement without charge therefor.\u201d The plaintiff was required to \u201cuse its teams, property, offices, and other facilities, and its agents and employees in operating an express transportation business on all the lines of railroad under Federal control.\u201d It was liable for all loss or damage to the facilities furnished by the Director General and for \u201call claims on account of loss, damage, or delay.\u201d It was precluded from making a defense in any action at law or equity \u201cthat it is by virtue of this contract an instrumentality or agency of the Federal Government,\u201d except with the approval of the Director General.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Under the revenue provisions, article 8 of the contract, the Director General was to receive 50.25 per cent, of the gross receipts from the express business over the roads under federal control for express privileges, but article 27, under which the plaintiff was protected against operating losses in any year, authorized plaintiff, in the event of such losses, to reduce the amount of 50.25 per cent, of the gross income, otherwise payable to the Director General for express privileges in a subsequent year. The balance of 49.75 per cent, plus the revenues from the express business over other railroads, after payments of the amounts due under operating contracts, plus all other income, was to be paid into a \u201cGross contract income,\u201d and from the <em>latter </em>the operating expenses' were to be paid by plaintiff. Provision was also made with reference to the use and manner of disposition of the remainder of the fund to be identified as the \u201cContract income for division,\u201d in connection with which it was provided in part that \u201cit is the understanding and agreement of the parties that the \u2018contract income for division\u2019 is not the income or property of the express company but is a fund resulting from the terms of this agreement in which the Director General and the express company have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>a mutual interest.\u201d The last-mentioned provision with reference to the \u201ccontract income for division\u201d is immaterial to a consideration of this question, since there was' no \u201ccontract income for division\u201d and no portion of such a fund produced any interest for which' plaintiff claims credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">There were other provisions in the contract with reference to the keeping of accounts, the payment of salaries, pensions, etc., made subject in some minor instances to indirect control by the Director General, but they were clearly intended to protect the interests of the government in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In our opinion, the provisions in the contract of June 26, 1918, especially those, of article 8, establish the relationship of debtor and creditor between the plaintiff and the Director General, and this we think was intended and consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The plaintiff put its own capital of almost $35,000,000 into the enterprise. The Director General furnished the transportation and received approximately one-half of plaintiff\u2019s gross income, less the sum necessary to repair plaintiff\u2019s losses, if any. It was the employment of plaintiff\u2019s capital that produced the funds and interest thereon which is -here in controversy. Notwithstanding the fact that operations were conducted at a loss, it had funds in hand, because liabilities for damages and injuries, for which plaintiff alone was liable, were not, and in the nature of things could not be, paid currently, but were deferred until the claims therefor should be determined and adjudicated. The only obligation of plaintiff to the Director General was for express privileges in an amount equal to 50.25 per cent, of the gross income, less the amount of operating losses. There was never any income for division since the plaintiff operated at a loss during that part of the federal control period from July 1, 1918, when it acquired the properties of the various express companies, to February 29, 1920, and during the guaranty period, March 1 to September 1, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The entire tenor of the contract between the plaintiff and the Director General connotes contractual obligation rather than fiducial relation, and the practical construction of the contract shows that the parties regarded their relation as debtor and creditor. In the arrangement made between the plaintiff and the Director General to liquidate all transactions arising during the period of Federal control of railroads, a trustee account of $700,000 was provided to enable the liquidation of the affairs of the plaintiff during the federal control period; i. e., collection of the outstanding assets and payment of liabilities. A part of this trust fund was immediately invested in Liberty bonds which the Director General purchased from plaintiff at the market price on the date of purchase. At that time plaintiff owned over $1,000,000, par amount of the Liberty bonds which it had owned prior to March 1, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">The term \u201csole agent of the Government\u201d appears to have been used in the contract of June 26, 1918, in the sense of independent contractor and to signify the agreement by the Director General that plaintiff should have a monopoly of the express business over the railroads under federal control. It appears that the parties to the contract of June 26, 1918, construed it, throughout the period of its existence, as creating the relation of creditor and debtor, and this is of great, if not Controlling, influence. Baltimore v. Baltimore Railroad, 10 Wall. 543, 19 L. Ed. 1043; Old Colony Trust Co. v. City of Omaha, 230 U. S. 100, 33 S. Ct. 967, 57 L. Ed. 1410.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">The next issue is whether plaintiff is entitled to include in invested capital for 1921 $2,448,353.59 on account of the value of property paid in on July 1, 1918, for stock. There was no excess-profits tax liability for 1920, and this issue does not arise as to that year. In its return for 1921 plaintiff computed its invested capital by using the value of the property as fixed by the Director General of Railroads in the amount of $31,642,109.64 on July 1, 1918, for which stock was issued, except as to $109.64. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue reduced the claimed invested capital in the amount of $2,448,353.50. This reduction was made up of two items\u2014first, a reduction of $1,199,720.12 in the amount fixed by the Director General of Railroads and entered by plaintiff upon its books and used with proper adjustments for depreciation, etc., in computing invested capital in the return, as the value of property paid in; and, second, a reduction of $1,248,633.38 of the amount of $1,594,000 entered by the plaintiff on its books as the value of the property paid in for so-called qualified stock issued to the Adams Express Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">The first item of $1,199,720.12 was excluded from invested capital by the Commissioner on the ground that the value of the property paid in to plaintiff on July 1, 1918, and for which it issued ordinary common stock, represented the depreciated cost or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>depreciated book value of such property on November 30, 1917, in the hands of the predecessor companies rather than its actual value on July 1, 1918, and that depreciation in the amount of $1,199,720.12 had accrued during the seven months intervening which operated to reduce the value for invested capital purposes in that amount. The Commissioner also held that the restrictive provisions of section 331 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1095) were applicable in determining the amount which plaintiff might include in invested capital. Counsel for the defendant, however, correctly agrees that the provisions of this section are not applicable, since an interest or control of 50 per cent, or more did not remain in any one of the predecessor owners. We are of opinion that the action of the Commissioner was erroneous. Article second of the agreement between the Director General and the predecessor express companies with reference to the organization of plaintiff and the transfer of the properties of the various express companies to plaintiff provided that \u201cthe new corporation shall be furnished cash by the Express Companies in a sufficient amount to constitute reasonable working capital. No shares of capital stock shall be issued except on payment therefor at par in <em>cash, or its equivalent in property at the fair market value thereof.\u201d </em>(Italics supplied.) And article third provided that: \u201cThe initial issue of stock of said new corporation shall not be made until such issue shall have been approved in writing by the Director General.\u201d Article 24 of the contract of June 26, 1918, between the Director General and the plaintiff provided that: \u201cThe stock issued by the express company shall be sufficient to pay at par for the property transferred to it and to provide the cash necessary for working capital,\u201d and this contract also provided that no stock might be issued without the approval in writing of the Director General. The provision that stock should be issued for property paid in \u201cat the fair market value thereof\u201d can only mean the actual market value at the time paid in, and the record clearly justifies the conclusion that the valuation of the property by the Director General was as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The plaintiff was organized to serve the convenience of the United States on account of the war, and to operate according to the contract with the United States by the Director General of Railroads. The essence of the contract of June 26, 1918, was that plaintiff, for conducting the express business, should have a limited return upon the par amount of its capital stock, that any excess of such return should be divided with the United States, and that the Railroad Administration should guarantee plaintiff against operating loss. The United States therefore had a direct and vital interest in the amount of the capital stock which plaintiff might issue. The above-quoted provisions of the contracts were strictly complied with. The property of the old express companies was paid in. The Director General designated a representative of his office, and especially directed him to make, and he did make, an investigation of the amount and value of the property paid in. This investigation was for the sole purpose of determining the actual value of the properties acquired by plaintiff upon the commencement by it of operations July 1, 1918. Although in the agreement of Juno 10, 1918, by the express companies with reference to the organization of plaintiff the value of the properties to be transferred to the plaintiff was \u201cestimated\u201d to be $28,407,000 and in the agreement of June 21, 1918, between the Director General and these express companies, in paragraph second, the value of the properties to be transferred to the plaintiff, including the supplies and materials on hand, was \u201cestimated\u201d to be $30,000,000, as of November 30, 1917, it is clear, we think, that these estimates were not intended to be the actual value at which the properties should be paid in to plaintiff or to fix November 30, 1917, as the date on which the value of the property to be paid in on July 1, 1918, for stock should be determined. Paragraph second of the agreement of June 10, 1918, provided that no stock of plaintiff should be issued except for cash or its equivalent in property at the fair market value thereof. The old express companies continued to carry on the express business of the country until July 1, 1918, and we think it clear that the Director General, in determining the amount of stock which plaintiff might issue for property acquired, valued sueh property on July 1, 1918. After the properties of the express companies had been paid in and upon completion of his investigation of the amount and the value thereof, the Director General, by written certificates, approved the issuance by plaintiff of $34,642,109.64 capital stock, and this amount was issued except $109.64, which was adjusted by payment of cash to the old companies. Cash in the amount of $3,000,000 was paid in. The question before the Director General and the plaintiff was not the book value of the properties on the hooks of the predecessor companies or whether de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>preeiation prior to July 1, 1918, was properly computed on their books, but the question was the actual value of the properties at the time paid in on July 1, 1918. The Director General therefore valued the physical properties paid in at $31,642,000 on July 1, 1918; that determination was advisedly made in order to protect the financial interests of the United States and in furtherance of the deliberate terms of the contract. The Bureau of Internal Revenue made no investigation of the quantity, amount, or value of the properties paid in to plaintiff for stock. The valuation by the Director General is not questioned by the defendant beyond the claim that it represented the depreciated cost or depreciated book value as of November 30, 1917. In this we are of opinion the defendant is in error. Sumpter Valley Ry. Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 B. T. A. 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The evidence establishes, and we have found as a fact, that the so-called qualified common stock of $1,594,000 issued to the Adams Express Company was issued for actual value residing in miscellaneous equipment paid in by the Adams-Southern Express Company to plaintiff in excess of the amount for which ordinary common stock was issued. Plaintiff therefore correctly included this item in computing invested capital, and the defendant was in error in excluding the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The foregoing conclusion that the stock of $1,594,000 was issued to the Adams Company for value in miscellaneous equipment paid in disposes of the last issue with reference to the depreciation deductions for 1920 and 1921 at an annual rate of $159,399.96. Plaintiff charged the amount of $1,594,000 to miscellaneous equipment, the property received in exchange for the issuance of qualified stock in that amount, and undertook the depreciation thereof on the basis of a ten-year life for such property. It charged against gross income in each of the years 1920 an'd 1921 10 per cent, of the total amount. The Bureau of Internal Revenue disallowed those charges to the extent of $53,-133.38 in 1920 and in the full amount for <em>1921 </em>on the ground that nothing was paid in for the stock. Similar charges against income were made by plaintiff during 1918 and 1919. As hereinafter stated, between July 1, 1918, and February 29, 1920, plaintiff operated under the contract with the Director General, and from March 1, 1920 to August 31, 1920, it operated under the contract as continued by the provisions of section 209 (i) of the Transportation Act of 1920 (41 Stat. 467). By reason of these provisions in the contract and the Transportation Act, the government was directly interested in the amount which should be charged against gross ineome in order to determine the net operating ineome or deficit. The accounts rendered to the Director General and to the Interstate Commerce Commission for the purpose of determining the operating deficits from July 1, 1918, to August 31, 1920, showed deductions from income on account of these charges for depreciation for exhaustion, wear, and tear of miscellaneous equipment. Both the Director General and the Interstate Commerce Commission first objected to .such charges, claiming that they should not be reflected in the deficits charged to the Director General under the contract and the United States under section 209 of the Transportation Act (41 Stat. 464). After full investigation and consideration, the Director General and the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed that the charges were proper and they were allowed to stand. Under the accounting according to the contracts made by plaintiff with the class I railroads of the United States September 1, 1920, the committee representing all of the railroads made substantially the same objection in respect to the annual charge for depreciation in respect of the sum of $1,594,000. After a full investigation and consideration, however, the charge was permitted to stand as a deduction in favor of plaintiff and against the railroads under those contracts. No investigation of the amount of value of the equipment acquired by plaintiff was ever made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The evidence overcomes the determination of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that nothing of value was acquired for this stock. The deductions claimed are therefore allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Plaintiff is entitled to recover $183,235.45, with interest as provided by law, for which judgment will be entered. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
