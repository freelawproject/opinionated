That said evidence and testimony to the contrary clearly shows that defendant Solberg\u2019s disability had terminated on February 22, 1931, had been prolonged by his use and excessive use of alcoholic drinks, and such unstable moments as he may from time to time have or may now have are caused solely by intoxication and the use of alcoholic drink. That said Compensation Order is further unlawful, arbitrary and erroneous because predicated upon hearsay statements of said George E. Price and a report to said George E. Price by other persons. That said examination, investigation and report by said George E. Price, upon which said Compensation Order is based, is not warranted by the Act and bars complainants of their right to cross-examine said George E. Price and those from whom he purports to have procured information in the pre\u00f1ases, and complainants\u2019 right to examine the evidence submitted to said deputy commissioner. Unless the claim of said Solberg for compensation and the issue as to the continuance of his former disability be tried de novo before this court or said Award and Compensation Order suspended, set aside and the enforcement thereof stayed and permanently enjoined, complainants will be deprived of their property without due process of law, and the enforcement of said award and the application of said Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to complainants in the premises is contrary to and in violation of the Constitution of the United States of America. That said Compensation Order and Award of Compensation will become final and conclusive as a judgment against complainants unless suspended, set aside and the enforcement thereof stayed and permanently enjoined herein, and by reason of the premises complainants will be irreparably damaged and injured and have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVd\">The transcript of testimony made a part of the complaint shows the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-4\">\u201cPursuant to Notice, this matter was heard before Wm.

Have you any way of knowing if that is about right?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-14\">\u201cMr. Holmes: I think so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-15\">\u201cMr. Marshall: It is paid up to February 22nd of this year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-16\">\u201cMr. Holmes: Yes, pretty near.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-17\">\u201cMr. Marshall: At $19.20 a week.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-18\">\u201cMr. Holmes: Yes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-19\">\u201cMr. Marshall: This leaves in issue the question of temporary and permanent disability of the claimant as a result of said injury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-20\">At the conclusion of the taking of testimony before the deputy commissioner, the transcript shows the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b656-21\">\u201cThe Deputy Commissioner: We are through. You can go any time when you want to.

The deputy commissioner had before him the injured claimant, Solberg.
