Registration was denied by both tribunals in the Patent Office upon the theory that the word \u201cLeague\u201d could not be exclusively appropriated and used as a trade-mark by any one manufacturer of bowling pins; in other words, as we understand it, that the word is descriptive as applied to these goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">In connection with his decision, the Commissioner called attention to the adopted and published rules of the American Bowling Congress, and, particularly, to rule 16 thereof, regulating the sizes and weights of official pins. Rule 29 thereof also gives certain regulations for so-called \u201cLeague Games.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">The applicant filed in the Patent Office an affidavit to the effect that the word \u201cLeague\u201d upon bowling pins, to the trade, meant only origin or source.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">We are of opinion no error was committed by the Commissioner, herein. The word \u201cLeague,\u201d as used by the' appellant here, is, ,to our mind, clearly either descriptive or misdescriptive. In either event, it ought not to be registered as a trade-mark. Every maker of bowling pins ought to be able to call his pins \u201cLeague\u201d pins, if they comply with the rules generally obtaining in league games.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-20\">The following cases illustrate the views of the courts as to similar descriptive words: In re Excelsior Shoe Co., 40 App. D. C. 480, in which the mark involved was \u201cBoy Scouts\u201d as applied to shoes for boys and men; the word \u201cNavy\u201d as applied to certain goods, In re National Candy Co., 35 App. D. C. 351; the word \u201cfashion\u201d as applied to men\u2019s clothing, Rosenberg 'Bros. <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Co., 37 F.(2d) 437, 17 C. C. P. A. 794; \u201cAutographic\u201d as applied to manifold registers, etc., In re Autographic Register Co., 39 F.(2d) 718, 17 C. C. P. A. 1644; \u201cEnsemble\u201d as applied to ladies\u2019 garments, Model Brassiere Co. v. Bromley-Shepard Co., 49 F.(2d) 482, 18 C. C. P. A. 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-23\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
