We cannot conceive on what theory this amount is to be added to another, used for the computation of another tax, and that the sum of the two is to be taken as the total foreign income, with which the dividends received by the domestic company are to be compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-26\">The decision of the District Court concerned other matters than this point, but, so far as it decided the question now on appeal, we accept the discussion as our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-27\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
