It is clear that, if this appeal is from an order in a proceeding in bankruptcy, this court acquired no jurisdiction over the matter by the allowance of an appeal by the District Court. This was decided by this court in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. Momsen-Dunnegan-Ryan Co., 51 F.(2d) 684, in conformity with the decisions of other Circuit Courts of Appeal. Quarles v. Dennison (C. C. A. 10) 45 F.(2d) 585; Broders v. Lage (C. C. A. 8) 25 F.(2d) 288, 289; Taylor v. Voss, 271 U. S. 176, 181, 46 S. Ct. 461, 70 L. Ed. 889; Gate City Clay Co. v. Dickey (C. C. A. 8) 39 F.(2d) 581, and numerous eases cited; Shoreland Co. v. Conklin, 30 F.(2d) 489 (C. C. A. 5); Stanley\u2019s Incorporated Store No. 3 v. Earl (C. C. A. 8) 25 F.(2d) 458; Schnurr v. Miller, 49 F.(2d) 109 (C. C. A. 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-23\">That the order adjudicating the appellant in contempt for a failure to obey a turnover order is a proceeding in bankruptcy was decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the first circuit in Ahlstrom v. Ferguson, 29 F.(2d) 515. We see no reason to doubt the .correctness of this conclusion, and consequently the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-24\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
