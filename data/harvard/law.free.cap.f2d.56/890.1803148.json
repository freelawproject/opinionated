The patents and applications which were involved there are not here involved. All this is stated in our original opinion, and the statement of the Examiner clearly shows that the claims of the applications which are involved, when broadly interpreted, are anticipated by the references cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">We are unable to agree that the ease should he remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
