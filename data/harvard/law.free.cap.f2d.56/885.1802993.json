C. P. A. 838, as supporting its contention that the term \u201cAvon\u201d \u00bbis not merely geographical within the meaning of the statute. It points out various dictionary and encyclopaedia definitions of the word \u201cAvon,\u201d and cites various uses of the term in standard literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-31\">As we understand appellant\u2019s position, it is that \u201cAvon\u201d is the name of various towns in at least three states of the United States, and that to this extent the term is geographical, but that it is not <em>merely </em>geographical, since it is the name also of a river in the midland country of England upon which William Shakespeare lived, and that the name suggests Shakespeare. It was also argued orally by appellant that \u201cAvon\u201d means river any river. Appellant points out that in Ex parte Manogue-Pidgeon Iron Co., 97 O. G. 2084, 1901 C. D. 214, it was held that the word \u201cdelta,\u201d although the name of counties in Michigan and Texas, as well as the name of numerous small towns, was a valid trademark for articles because its significance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>a letter of the Greek alphabet, and, as a general term applied to the mouths of some rivers, was superior to its geographical meaning. . Other authorities are cited to whieh we deem reference unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">In In re Plymouth Motor Corp., supra, this court held the words \u201cChrysler Plymouth,\u201d as applied to automobiles, to be registrable and not to be merely geographical. The conclusion in the case was reached upon the theory that, while Plymouth is the name of towns in England, Massachusetts, and elsewhere, the term as a whole is not merely geographical. In that ease it was also contended that the word \u201cPlymouth\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning suggestive of certain traits of character of the Pilgrims, such as endurance, strength, enterprise, honesty, etc. We held there that the term \u201cmerely,\u201d as used in the statute, must be given its ordinary moaning, and that, when a term acquires a secondary meaning, it is not <em>\u201cmerely </em>geographic, or solely geographic, or only geographic.\u201d (Italics quoted.) We therein cited the cases of Katschinski v. Keller et al., 49 Cal. App. 406, 193 P. 587, involving the trade-mark \u201cPhiladelphia Shoe Store,\u201d and Ex parte Jewell Belting Co., 110 O. G. 309, 1904 C. D. 150, involving the trade-mark \u201cGibraltar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Appellant has called our attention to no meaning of the woo'd \u201cAvon\u201d other than one which is merely geographical. The name of a river is geographical. \u201cGeographical\u201d is defined as \u201cof or pertaining to geography.\u201d Geography relates to towns, countries and subdivisions thereof, mountains, valleys, rivers, etc., the names of which suggest fixed locations. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (1932). If \u201cAvon\u201d were a team which described all rivers, which it is not, appellant\u2019s cited authority Manogue-Pidgeon Iron Co., supra, involving the trade-mark \u201cdelta,\u201d would be more in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">In Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 159 U. S. 469, 14 S. Ct. 151, 153, 37 L. Ed. 1144, the Supreme Court of the United States held the trade-mark \u201cColumbia\u201d to be invalid. Columbia is the name of a river and the name of a town. One of the grounds upon whieh the court held the mark to be invalid was that it did not indicate origin but indicated location only. The Supreme Court said that \u201cthe word or words, in common use as designating locality, or section of a country, cannot be appropriated by any one as his exclusive trade-mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
