HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b61-29\">The libelants were the crew! of the steam tug John E. Berwind, and filed a libel for seamen\u2019s wages against the tug, O\u2019Boyle, the registered owner, and Vredenburgh, alleging that the tug was operated by O\u2019Boyle and Vredenburgh as agent of O\u2019Boyle. Vredenburgh was not served with process. The District Court granted a decree to libelants against the tug and O\u2019Boyle, from which O\u2019Boyle now appeals. There is no doubt that libelants were entitled to recover against the tug, and the only question before us is whether they had enforceable claims against O\u2019Boyle personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-30\">The tug at one time belonged to Vredenburgh, and was offered for sale by the United States marshal. Vredenburgh arranged with O\u2019Boyle to pay him $100 more than the selling price if the latter would buy it in for him at the sale. O\u2019Boyle purchased it at the sale for $655, and Vredenburgh paid him the $100, and gave a note for the purchase price. The tug was then registered by O\u2019Boyle in his own name; the registry designating Vredenburgh as the master. \"O\u2019Boyle testified that he took title solely as security, and had never given Vredenburgh a bill of sale or received the balance of the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>After the foregoing transactions Vredenburgh took the tug and operated her about the Hudson river and Barge Canal. Some of the crew were on her on one or the other of these voyages and also in New York when she was being fitted out,' and late in the season before she was laid up. Vredenburgh fitted her out for her trips and hired the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">O\u2019Boyle acquiesced in Vredenburgh\u2019s use of the tug on the latter\u2019s statement that he could pay for the boat in two or three months, apparently in order that profits received from operations of the tug might assist him to complete his payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The foregoing facts were testified to by Vredenburgh and O\u2019Boyle. If qualified by nothing else, they would clearly indicate that there was no relation of principal and agent between O\u2019Boyle and Vredenburgh. In such circumstances Vredenburgh would be a conditional vendee in possession of the vessel under what was the practical equivalent of a demise giving Vredenburgh the rights of an owner pro hae vice and subjecting him alone to personal liability for torts committed and contractual liabilities incurred during any maritime venture entered into while the same relations continued. Undoubtedly there was ample basis for imposing a maritime lien upon the tug for libelants\u2019 wages, but libelants were not entitled to hold O\u2019Boyle personally unless the relation of principal and agent existed between him and Vredenburgh. The latter testified that he was operating the tug for himself and not for O\u2019Boyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The two principal witnesses for libelants testified that they knew O\u2019Boyle was the registered owner. But the libelant Leddiek said' that he was told by Vredenburgh when he hired him that he was the owner of the tug.. The libelant Cadro likewise said that Vredenburgh told him \u201che did not own anything, that he wouldn\u2019t have a boat in his own name,\u201d and that Cadro accordingly \u201cassumed that he owned her and put her in someone else\u2019s name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">A possible contradiction of the testimony that Vredenburgh was the conditional vendee of the tug may be found in the testimony of Cadro about an interview at O\u2019Boyle\u2019s office in December, 1930, when Cadro, Leddiek, O\u2019Boyle, the latter\u2019s manager,' Hickey, and Vredenburgh were present. Some one had offered Vredenburgh another \u201cjob for the Berwind and wanted to take her down to Pier 32,\u201d but the only way he could \u201cclose the deal\u201d was to have her registered in his own name. He accordingly sought O\u2019Boyle\u2019s permission to have this done. But Hickey said he could not see how they had let Vredenburgh take the Berwind at all, and, if he \u201cwanted the \u2018Berwind\u2019 he should come in and pay $500 or $600,\u201d and then he could have a clear bill of sale and could do as he pleased; \u201cthat they would not take any more responsibility for the \u2018Berwind\u2019; that she already had bills against her which Mr. O\u2019Boyle would probably have to pay.\u201d Inasmuch as the balance of the purchase price was not then forthcoming, Vredenburgh was not allowed to use the tug, and Hickey told him to take her to O\u2019Boyle\u2019s yard at Tottenville, Staten Island, and to see that nothing was taken off her. Thither she was taken and soon after sunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">It may be argued that Hickey\u2019s declarations indicated that O\u2019Boyle never bought in the tug at the marshal\u2019s sale as agent for Vredenburgh, but merely contracted to sell her to the latter upon payment of the agreed price; in other words, that O\u2019Boyle was not the holder of a mere security title, but was the absolute owner. Such an interpretation of Hickey\u2019s words however, disregards all the testimony of O\u2019Boyle and Vredenburgh, and is opposed to the latter\u2019s statement to'Leddiek, when he hired him, that he (Vredenburgh) owned the tug, and to his similar statement to Cadro. These utterances by Vredenburgh seem to have been made under no suspicious circumstances. They tended to show that the hiring of the crew was on his own behalf and not as O\u2019Boyle\u2019s master or agent. They were competent evidence to interpret the acts of Vredenburgh, and were properly admitted as part of the res gestee. Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company v. Mosley, 8 Wall. 397, 19 L. Ed. 437; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hillmon, 145 U. S. 285, 12 S. Ct. 909, 36 L. Ed. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The statement of Hickey -that the Berwind \u201calready had bills against her which Mr. O\u2019Boyle would probably have to pay\u201d was of little significance. Bills incurred by Vredenburgh would be presumptive liens on the tug, and consequently would impair O\u2019Boyle\u2019s security. O\u2019Boyle would have to discharge them if he wished to realize on his security. Hickey\u2019s statement, at most, involved no more than the legal opinion of a dissatisfied creditor. It is quite insufficient to overthrow the testimony of Vredenburgh and O\u2019Boyle which was nowhere directly met and bears the marks of credibility. The proof was plain that O\u2019Boyle did not fit out the tug and did not pay Vredenburgh anything as master, never had any interest in her earnings, and did not hire the crew. Both Cadro and Led-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>diet admitted that they understood that the vessel belonged to Vredenburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">It is true that the District Judge held that O\u2019Boyle was not acting as the agent of Vredenburgh, when bidding in the tug at the marshal\u2019s sale, and that he concluded that O\u2019Boyle became the real owner and was \u201ctherefore liable.\u201d But his conclusion was in the face of uneontradieted testimony that O\u2019Boyle bought in the tug for Vredenburgh and that Vredenburgh not only paid $100 on account of the transaction, but gave his <em>note </em>for the balance due. It was likewise in the face of what seems to have been the assumption of the libelants themselves that Vredenburgh was the real owner of the vessel. In such circumstances we are impelled to differ with the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">If, as we hold, O\u2019Boyle had no more than a security title, he was not personally liable for contracts affecting the tug and made by his conditional vendee when in possession of the vessel. The Boise Penrose (C. C. A.) <em>22 </em>F.(2d) 919; Morgan\u2019s Assignees v. Shinn, 15 Wall. 105, 21 L. Ed. 87; Macy v. Wheeler, <em>30 N. </em>Y. 231. Moreover, even if O\u2019Boyle were thought to have been the absolute owner of the tug, he was never in fact operating her. If he chose to allow Vredenburgh to have complete control of the vessel for an indeterminate time so that the latter might employ her in his own enterprises, the transaction amounted to a demise charter, terminable at will, and rendered Vredenburgh, as owner pro hae vice, the only one personally liable for obligations which he contracted. Everett v. United States (C. C. A.) 284 F. 203; Cox v. Lykes Brothers, 237 N. Y. 376, 143 N. E. 226. See, also, Leary v. United States, 14 Wall. 607, 20 L. Ed. 756. Vredenburgh was the owner within the meaning of Rev. St. \u00a7 4525 (46 USCA \u00a7 592).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the libel as against the respondent Anthony O\u2019Boyle.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
