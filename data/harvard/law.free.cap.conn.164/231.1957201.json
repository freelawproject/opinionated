Thus where the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>action or amount in demand shows that the court has no jurisdiction, or where the officer\u2019s return shows invalid service, and the like, a motion to erase shall be used.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 94. \u201c \u2018A motion to erase the case from the docket will be granted only when it clearly appears on the face of the record that the court is without jurisdiction. <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>141 Conn. 646, 648, 109 A.2d 260; <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Antonio Pepe Co., </em>108 Conn. 436, 443, 143 A. 568. A motion to erase admits all facts which are well pleaded, invokes the existing record and must be decided upon that alone. <em>Fairfield Lumber &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Herman, </em>139 Conn. 141, 144, 90 A.2d 884.\u2019 <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, 419, 162 A.2d 175.\u201d <em>Perrys, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury Redevelopment Agency, </em>157 Conn. 122, 123, 249 A.2d 256.

It was, accordingly, error to erase each case from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">There is error in both cases, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction to deny in each ease the motion to erase the case from the docket.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
