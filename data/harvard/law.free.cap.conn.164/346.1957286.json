A decisive issue was the question whether the proposed generator met the requirements of the contract specifications. From a judgment for the defendants the plaintiff has appealed, assigning many errors in the court\u2019s finding of facts and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">An examination of the court\u2019s lengthy finding discloses that it is incredibly inconsistent and illogical. Reference to the draft finding and counter findings discloses that the trial court copied verbatim into its finding paragraphs from each without any apparent regard to their obvious inconsistency. It found that the rejected generator did not meet the requirements specified in the contract but also that it \u201csatisfied the purpose, use and terms of the contract.\u201d It concluded that the generator was \u201cin accordance with the contract specifications\u201d but also concluded that the generator \u201cdid not meet the requirements of the specifications in the contract.\u201d It concluded, quoting from the counter finding, that the state\u2019s representatives acted \u201cproperly and pursuant to the contract\u201d and \u201ccorrectly, upon good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>reasons and in good faith\u201d in disapproving the generator hut in the very next paragraph of its finding, quoting from the draft finding, concluded that the state \u201cacted arbitrarily and/or unreasonably in refusing to accept the generator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">No further comment is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">It is the duty of the judge who has tried a case to prepare a proper finding for an appeal.
