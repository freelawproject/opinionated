Emanuele, hereinafter called the defendant, and to restrain bim from operating a restaurant serving intoxicating liquor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>on the ground that the granting of the liquor permit was in violation of an existing zoning ordinance of the town of South Windsor. The trial court denied the injunction and rendered judgment for the defendants, from which the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The unattaeked portions of the court\u2019s finding disclose that the defendant made application for a restaurant liquor permit for premises at 985 Sullivan Avenue, South Windsor, in the Sullivan Shopping Plaza; that the plaintiff George Koepper is a resident and taxpayer of the town and is the permittee of a cafe liquor outlet located 918 feet from the defendant\u2019s restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The trial court further found that an ordinance of the town of South Windsor states that the storefront leased by the town in the Sullivan Shopping Plaza is not a library and that the storefront by definition is not a library. We note that the appendices make no reference to such an ordinance and we have been unable to find such an ordinance. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-163; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>126 Conn. 614, 622, 13 A.2d 591. The evidence that may have induced this finding was the testimony of the zoning enforcement officer who testified: \u201cThe ruling by the town attorney says that it is not a library. It\u2019s just being leased as a library.\u201d Section 3.12.1 of the zoning ordinance of the town of South Windsor reads as follows: \u201cNo premises shall be used, and no building shall be designed, erected or altered to be used, for the storage for the purpose of sale or exchange of spirituous and alcoholic liquors, either at retail or wholesale, whether for consumption on the premises or otherwise, if any part of such building or premises is located: (a) Within 500 feet of any part of a lot used, or reserved to be used for a . . . library.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The finding of facts, as corrected, shows that the storefront being leased by the town in the Sullivan Shopping Plaza is presently being used as a library in the town and is approximately 100 feet from the defendant\u2019s premises. A library is a library within the meaning of the ordinance whether located in a leased storefront or in a town building. As already noted, the ordinance forbids the use of premises for the sale of alcoholic beverages within 500 feet of any part of a lot used for a library. The record compels a conclusion that the court was in error in finding that the South Windsor library is not a library. Clearly, the sale of alcoholic beverages on the defendant\u2019s premises within 500 feet of the library is in direct violation of the South Windsor zoning ordinances, and the issuance of a permit for such sale by the liquor control commission was in direct violation of \u00a7 30-44 of the General Statutes, which expressly provides that \u201c[t]he commission shall refuse permits for the sale of alcoholic liquor ... (2) where prohibited by the zoning ordinance of any city or town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Even though the court erroneously concluded that the granting of the permit was not contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 30-44 of the General Statutes, this error is not decisive in view of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to plead and prove facts which would justify the injunctive relief which he sought. See <em>Bendell </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>153 Conn. 48, 52, 212 A.2d 199; <em>Lavitt </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>152 Conn. 66, 77, 203 A.2d 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In a paragraph of the complaint the plaintiff alleged that his \u201cjusticiable interests have been injured\u201d and that he \u201cwill suffer irreparable injury for which he has no adequate remedy at law.\u201d Nevertheless, the plaintiff offered no evidence of irreparable injury either at the hearing before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>commission or before the trial court. The record here is completely devoid of any specification of fact or proof to support an allegation of irreparable injury which must be found to support injunctive relief. Special damage must be found to support injunctive relief. Equity will not grant the extraordinary remedy of injunction unless there appears to be a danger of actual and substantial damage of a nature special to the plaintiff. <em>Kammerman </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>133 Conn. 232, 237, 50 A.2d 175; see also <em>Bendell </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 58, 62; <em>Lavitt </em>v. <em>Pierre, </em>supra, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Even where the danger of irreparable injury is shown, the granting of an injunction is not mandatory but within the sound discretion of the court. Until it is shown that the court\u2019s discretion was abused, there can be no reversal of the court\u2019s action in denying the injunction. <em>Platt Bros. &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>72 Conn. 531, 554, 45 A. 154; 42 Am. Jur. 2d, Injunctions, \u00a7 24. Neither the requisite damage nor abuse of discretion has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
