On the day assigned for the trial of the case and before the trial commenced, the defendant filed a \u201cmotion to strike jury panel\u201d which was an effective challenge to the array of the jury panel. The court denied the motion, ruling that \u201cthe motion to strike the jury panel was not made seasonably, when it was made on the day of the trial.\u201d The defendant has assigned as an error this ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">While the circumstances disclosed by this appeal suggest good reason for the adoption of a rule of court which would require reasonable notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>intent to file such a motion as well as the filing of such a motion a reasonable time before the day assigned for the trial of a case, there was no such rule extant governing the filing of such a motion in this case. Accordingly, the court was in error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion solely on the basis that it was not seasonably filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
