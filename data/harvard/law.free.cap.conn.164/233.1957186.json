The defendant, the commissioner of labor for the state of Connecticut, assigns as error two conclusions reached by the court: (1) that the plaintiff Davenport Taxi, Inc., was subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060 as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. (June 25, 1938), hereinafter called the FLSA, to the exclusion of being subject to the jurisdiction of the defendant; and (2) that the plaintiff was not subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-76b\u201431-76j of the General Statutes without an express finding that the plaintiff came within at least one of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 31-76L The other assignments of error were not briefed and accordingly are treated as abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>163 Conn. 42, 43, 316 A.2d 782; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grayton, </em>163 Conn. 104, 109, 302 A.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u201cThe court made no finding although, ordinarily, one is essential to test the conclusion reached.

The absence of a finding does not necessarily preclude action by this court. We are, however, limited in our inquiry to the material facts which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>appear on the record. <em>Wooster </em>v. <em>Wm. C. A.

The record here consists only of the appeal to the Superior Court, an exhibit made part of the record, the answer and the judgment. There is a memorandum of decision but it does not establish facts and cannot take the place of a finding. <em>E. M. J. Corporation </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 667, 668, 228 A.2d 500; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 713, 714, 216 A.2d 182. We may, however, consult the memorandum for a better understanding of the basis of the court\u2019s decision. <em>Gary Excavating, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Haven, </em>164 Conn. 119, 120, 318 A.2d 84; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>143 Conn. 600, 602, 124 A.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">It appears from the record that on April 23,1969, the director of the minimum wage division of the Connecticut department of labor caused an order to be served on the plaintiff directing it to pay the sum of $3630.50 for overtime pay for certain employees who had performed services as \u201cdispatchers\u201d for the plaintiff, a Connecticut corporation operating a taxi business in the city of Stamford pursuant to the authority of the state public utilities commission. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court and on November 20, 1970, its appeal was \u201csustained for lack of jurisdiction\u201d in the defendant to issue the order in question. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision states as the basis of its decision that since \u201cthe character of the work performed by the dispatchers in interstate commerce is substantial, thereby subjecting the employer to the provisions of the . . . [FLSA],\u201d the FLSA precluded the state from applying the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>overtime wage law and the director of the minimum wage division, therefore, lacked the jurisdiction necessary to order the payment of overtime compensation. The fact that the employees in question actually were engaged in interstate commerce is conceded, but the defendant basically claims that the FLSA is not exclusive in its operation and that the state and federal governments have concurrent jurisdiction over employees subject to the Act so that the state overtime compensation provisions are applicable. The fundamental issue presented in this appeal, therefore, is whether Congress, in enacting the FLSA, intended completely to preclude the states from regulating the wages, hours and overtime pay of employees engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u201cIt is often a perplexing question whether Congress has precluded state action or by the choice of selective regulatory measures has left the police power of the States undisturbed except as the state and federal regulations collide.\u201d <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corporation, </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S. Ct. 1146, 91 L. Ed. 1447. Generally, it may be stated that \u201cacts of Congress preclude state interferences with interstate commerce when: (1) Congress has occupied or pre-empted the field; (2) there [is] a conflict or clash between the congressional and state statutes; and (3) when the local interference inhibit [s] the attainment of the policy underlying the congressional legislation.\u201d 2 Antieau, Modern Constitutional Law, p. 95 (1969). In considering whether state interference is precluded it is important to note that \u201cCongress, in producing the Act, did not make it coextensive with the limits of its powers over commerce. \u2018The history of the legislation leaves no doubt that Congress chose not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to enter areas which it might have occupied\u2019 . . . <em>[Kirschbaum Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>316 U.S. 517, 522, 62 S. Ct. 1116, 86 L. Ed. 1638]. This necessarily means that there is a remaining area which is the subject for appropriate state regulation. Congress \u2018indicated its purpose to leave local business to the protection of the states\u2019 <em>[Walling </em>v. <em>Jacksonville Paper Co., </em>317 U.S. 564, 570, 63 S. Ct. 332, 87 L. Ed. 460; <em>10 East 40th St. Bldg., Inc. </em>v. <em>Callus, </em>325 U.S. 578, 582, 65 S. Ct. 1227, 89 L. Ed. 1806]. This less-than-complete coverage is manifested and occasioned by the Act\u2019s failure to contain, with respect to interstate commerce, such words as \u2018affecting\u2019 or \u2018promoting\u2019 rather than the narrower \u2018engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\u2019 <em>[Higgins </em>v. <em>Carr Bros. Co., </em>317 U.S. 572, 574, 63 S. Ct. 337, 87 L. Ed. 468].\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Wade Lahar Construction Co., </em>290 F.2d 408, 414 (8th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Although we have not been referred to and have been unable to find a case which clearly determines this issue, we are led by the authorities to the conclusion that Congress intended the FLSA to be exclusive<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> except for those instances under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 218 and the exemptions provided by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213 which will be discussed later in this opinion. In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>H. B. Zachry Co., </em>362 U.S. 310, 320, 80 S. Ct. 739, 4 L. Ed. 2d 753, Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated that \u201c[a]lthough the . . . [FLSA] has never contained even a general definition of the relationship of an activity to commerce necessary to justify its inclusion, such a relationship has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>extrapolated by the courts in conformity with the statutory scheme, so as to <em>displace </em>state regulation \u2018throughout the farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce.\u2019 <em>Walling </em>v. <em>Jacksonville Paper Co., . . . </em>[317 U.S. 564, 567, 63 S. Ct. 332, 87 L. Ed. 460].\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the same opinion, he twice referred to \u201cdisplacement of state power.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>H. B. Zachry Co., </em>supra, 316. The defendant contends that this language was merely dicta, but in Roberts, The Court and the Constitution, at page 56, Mr. Justice Roberts, in discussing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>312 U.S. 100, 61 S. Ct. 451, 85 L. Ed. 609, which upheld the constitutionality of the FLSA, states that \u201cthe effect of sustaining the act was to place the whole matter of wages and hours of persons employed through the United States, with slight exceptions, under a single federal regulatory scheme and in this way completely to supersede state exercise of the police power in this field.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an earlier decision, <em>Kirschbaum Co. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>316 U.S. 517, 522, 62 S. Ct. 1116, 86 L. Ed. 1638, Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke of Congress not \u201coccupying\u201d areas which it might have occupied because the FLSA did not apply to employees in industries merely \u201caffecting\u201d commerce. Lower federal court decisions also lend support for the preemptive nature of the Act: \u201c[I]f the petitioner was employed in interstate commerce, the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq., controls to the exclusion of the State Legislation. Congress has occupied the field of labor relations in such commerce and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>State no longer has any power to deal with the subject.\u201d <em>Sirmon </em>v. <em>Cron &amp; Gracey Drilling Corporation, </em>44 F. Sup. 29, 30 (D. La.). Also in <em>Divine </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>36 F. Sup. 55, 58 (D. La.), the District Court stated that because the plaintiff was employed in interstate commerce \u201cthe . . . [FLSA] comes to his succor; the benefits coming to him thereunder are to the exclusion of those coming to him under a state statute. The state statute is to apply only when the unpaid and discharged laborer has been engaged in intrastate commerce.\u201d The New York Court of Appeals held similarly in a case dealing with the Hours of Service Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 61 et seq., which regulates the hours of work of certain classes of employees of carriers engaged in interstate commerce, stating that: \u201cWhere employees are engaged both in interstate and intrastate commerce, regulation of their hours of labor and their wages by congressional action shall be construed as an exclusion of the States from the same field.\u201d <em>Long Island R. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Labor, </em>256 N.Y. 498, 516, 177 N.E. 17. It is also important to note that in 1953 the Connecticut attorney general advised that the Connecticut Minimum Wage Act, Rev. 1949, \u00a7 3786 et seq., was not intended to apply to any person engaged in interstate commerce because such persons are covered by federal legislation. 28 Conn. Atty. Gen. Rep. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The defendant cites \u00a7 18 of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 218, as support for his contention that operation of the FLSA is not exclusive. In relevant part this section states: \u201cNo provision of this chapter or of any order thereunder shall excuse noncompliance with any Federal or State law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the minimum wage established under this chapter or a maximum workweek lower than the maximum workweek established under this chapter.\u201d We believe, however, that the defendant\u2019s reliance is misplaced. As we read \u00a7 218 it allows state laws to apply to that part of interstate commerce covered by the FLSA only where the state hour and wage provisions are more beneficial to the laborer than those in the federal act. Had Congress intended that the states have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce state laws respecting the domain of interstate commerce covered by the Act we believe it would not have thus specifically limited \u00a7 218 to instances where the state minimum wage is higher and the state maximum workweek is lower than wages and hours provided by the FLSA. The view that this is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 218 is supported by <em>Divine </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>supra, where the District Court held that since \u00a7 218 \u201cis silent as to penalty provisions ... we should assume that the act of Congress, through this section, by implication, supersedes the penalty provisions of the various state statutes on the relation of employer and employee. . . . Even though the penalties of both the state and federal statutes could be imposed without there being a direct conflict, we believe the penalty provision of the federal act, when invoked, becomes exclusive and the penalty provisions of the state statute may not be applied. There may be no exact conflict in actual application of the two penalties, but, nevertheless, they conflict in essence because of duplicity. The Congress measured the penalty by the exactions of the Act (minimum wage, maximum hours, etc.) and no other than the specified penalties are to be imposed.\u201d Prior to and at the time of the institution of this suit G-eneral Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>utes \u00a7 31-76c of the Overtime Wage Act did not establish a maximum workweek lower than the maximum workweek provided by \u00a7 207 of the FLSA. It is clear that the defendant, therefore, obtained no jurisdiction over the plaintiff under \u00a7 218 of the FLSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Further research into the history of the FLSA reveals several amendments which apparently were not called to the attention of the trial court, hut which serve to strengthen our conclusion that its decision was correct. As previously noted, the FLSA has exemption provisions which leave certain employees outside the coverage of the Act. Since Congress in enacting the FLSA left a domain of regulation for the states, such as businesses considered predominantly local in nature, we believe that specifically exempted employees also enter that domain. Prior to February 1, 1967, \u201cany employee of an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs\u201d was exempted from \u00a7 206 of the FLSA, the minimum wage provision, and also \u00a7 207, the maximum hours and overtime provision. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213 (a) (12) (1964 Ed.). On February 1, 1967, however, an amendment to the FLSA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> took effect which ended entirely the exemption under \u00a7 206 and left only <em>drivers </em>\u201cemployed by an employer engaged in the business of operating taxicabs\u201d exempt under \u00a7 207. 80 Stat. 833, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7213 (b) (17). Thus, nonoperating employees were brought under the overtime protection of the Act. See United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, 3006 (1966). After January 31, 1967, therefore, nonoperating employees such as dispatchers were not subject to state wage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>hour laws unless the laws were more beneficial to the laborer than the FLSA. Since on May 5, 1969, when this action was brought, state laws were not more beneficial, nonoperating employees were not subject to state wage and hour laws from January 31, 1967, onward. The net result of this is that the dates when the wages of the dispatchers were earned might have had a bearing on the trial court\u2019s decision. Nowhere, however, does the record indicate that the court was informed when the wages were earned by the dispatchers. In the absence of this information and for the reasons previously stated, we can find no error in the ruling of the court that the plaintiff, with respect to the employees involved here, was not subject to the jurisdiction of the defendant. In view of the foregoing conclusions we find the second assignment of error to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> There are two cases which indicate a contrary position.
