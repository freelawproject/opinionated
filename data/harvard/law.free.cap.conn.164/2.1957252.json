J.</author>\n<p id=\"An8\">The plaintiff brought this action praying that damages be appraised pursuant to \u00a7 7-248 of the G-eneral Statutes for the taking of certain land lying in the town of Colchester for a sewerage disposal plant. The complaint alleged that the defendants owned certain described land, that the plaintiff has determined that that land should be fixed upon as a site for a sewerage disposal plant, that the use of that land was necessary for that purpose, that it \u201chas determined\u201d to take such steps as might be necessary to purchase the property or, if it were unable to agree with the owner, then to condemn it, that they were unable to agree with the owners as to the purchase price and, therefore, prayed that a committee of three disinterested persons be appointed to assess just damages for the taking and that on the payment of such damages the court order that title to the land vest in the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The defendants by their answer admitted ownership of the land in question but denied that the plaintiff had determined that the land should be fixed upon as a site for a sewerage disposal plant, that acquisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion of the land was necessary for such purposes and that the plaintiff had determined to take such steps as might be necessary to purchase the land if agreement could be reached with the owners and otherwise to condemn it. By way of special defense, the defendants pleaded that the land, although located in the town of Colchester, was outside the limits of the borough of Colchester and that the plaintiff is without authority to condemn land lying outside the municipal limits of the borough. By its reply, the plaintiff admitted the factual allegations of the special defense but denied that it was without authority to condemn land outside the limits of the borough.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">In this state of the pleadings the plaintiff moved \u201cfor judgment on the pleadings with respect to the special def ense filed by the defendants\u201d and the court ordered that \u201cthe foregoing motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.\u201d As rendered, the judgment \u201cadjudged that judgment may enter for the plaintiff on the pleadings.\u201d The defendants thereupon appealed to this court \u201cfrom the decision that judgment may enter for the plaintiff on the pleadings as respects the defendants\u2019 special defense rendered therein.\u201d They have assigned as error the action of the court in overruling their claim of law that the plaintiff is restricted from and cannot condemn the land of the defendants which lies outside the plaintiff\u2019s municipal boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">While on its face the judgment as rendered, i.e., \u201cfor the plaintiff on the pleadings,\u201d would appear to be a final judgment on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action, it obviously was not so intended. On this appeal, the parties have not treated the judgment as final, it is not responsive to the relief claimed in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and it was rendered in response to the plaintiff\u2019s motion \u201cfor judgment on the plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ings with respect to the special defense filed by the defendants.\u201d Clearly, the judgment did not adjudicate the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. There remain the contested issues as to whether the plaintiff has in fact fixed upon the land of the defendants as a site for a sewerage disposal plant, whether the taking is necessary, and the determination of damages if a committee is appointed pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for relief. The only issue decided by the court was that the defendants\u2019 special defense was without merit. The merits of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action have yet to be adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">A motion for judgment on the pleadings \u201c \u2018is of limited utility, for it requires a situation where the parties are willing to admit the facts and place their entire case on the legal issues raised, waiving the right to replead if the legal issue is decided against them. It operates much in the way of a common law demurrer.\u2019 2 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 120; <em>DelVecchio </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>146 Conn. 188, 148 A.2d 554.\u201d <em>Boucher Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>160 Conn. 404, 409, 279 A.2d 540. Even assuming that as the pleadings stood, the court properly undertook to decide the motion for judgment on the pleadings, since the judgment determined only that the special defense did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s action and the merits of that action remain undecided, the judgment was interlocutory only and not a final judgment from which an appeal lies. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 10, 13. As this court observed in <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Research Associates, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 118, 120, 214 A.2d 375: \u201cThe test of finality is whether the rights of the parties are concluded so that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahey, </em>146 Conn. 55, 57, 147 A.2d 476; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Howard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>138 Conn. 464, 467, 86 A.2d 67; <em>Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>138 Conn. 370, 372, 84 A.2d 681; 30A Am. Jur., Judgments, \u00a7 121. Since the lack of any final judgment is a jurisdictional defect, we must dismiss the appeal. <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Darrow, </em>148 Conn. 109, 112, 167 A.2d 852; <em>Hoberman </em>v. <em>Lake of Isles, Inc., </em>138 Conn. 573, 574, 87 A.2d 137.\u201d See also <em>Branford Sewer Authority </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>159 Conn. 421, 426-27, 270 A.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
