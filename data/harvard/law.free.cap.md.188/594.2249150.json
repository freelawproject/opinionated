The trial took the form of a hypothetical specific performance case between defendants (appellees) as vendors and Frank Pollick as vendee. Plaintiff alleges that he procured a purchaser (Pol-lick) who entered into a valid, binding and enforceable written contract with defendants, which was signed by defendants, for sale by defendants to Pollick of certain real estate in St. Mary\u2019s County at a price of \u00a778,750, plaintiff to receive a commission of \u00a73,750 for his services. Defendants, virtually admitting plaintiff\u2019s other allegations, contend that the written contract of sale with Pollick was not valid, binding and enforceable because the description of the property was not sufficiently definite. The case was tried before the court without a jury. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the court granted a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d which it treated as equivalent to a motion for a directed verdict. From judgment for defendants for costs, plaintiff appeals. We shall deal with the case on the same basis as the lower court did, considering only the legal sufficiency, not the weight, of the evidence. <em>Cf. Helmik v. Pratt, </em>153 Md. 685, 696, 139 A. 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">If the written contract could have been specifically enforced by defendants, plaintiff is entitled to his commission. Code, 1939, Art. 2, sec. 17. The converse does not necessarily follow. If plaintiff, pursuant to his employment, procured a purchaser who was able, willing and ready to buy upon defendants\u2019 terms, plaintiff would be entitled to his commission, notwithstanding defendants refused to sell and plaintiff could not bind them or the purchaser compel them to sell. <em>Singer Construction Co. v. Goldsborough, </em>147 Md. 628, 128 A. 754. Plaintiff is not suing on the written contract, but for services in procuring the contract or the purchaser. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>If he had procured a purchaser who made an oral and hence unenforceable agreement to buy but was able and willing to perform the agreement, he would have been entitled to his commission. <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>sec. 445, comment d. In the instant case, if plaintiff and defendants were restricted by the \u201cparol evidence rule\u201d to the written contracts between defendants and Pollick, there is at least color for argument that these writings show performance by plaintiff and breach by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Defendants own a triangular tract of land in St. Mary\u2019s County, containing 31 acres, bounded on two sides by Three Notch Road and Great Mills Road (which meet at an acute angle) and extending west from the junction of these roads at the United States Navy Reservation. Part of defendants\u2019 property, at the cross roads, is used by them as a restaurant. By an agreement dated August 1, 1945, defendants gave Pollick, \u201chis heirs and assigns, the privilege of purchasing\u201d on or before January 7, 1946, an area of 12% acres \u201cto be selected from the entire Millison tract\u201d of 31 acres, on which it was proposed to erect \u201ca suitable commercial center including a hotel and apartment buildings, but said purchase is not to include that portion of the property now being used as Millison\u2019s Restaurant.\u201d The sellers were to \u201cinclude site of the present gas station in the property to be conveyed\u201d and the purchasers were to agree \u201cnot to erect any gasoline station or garage or restaurant except in Hotel\u201d on the 12% acre tract. Defendants were to \u201cretain and operate that portion of the property\u201d then \u201cbeing used as a restaurant,\u201d but were to \u201cremodel the exterior of the restaurant building to conform with the architecture of the other commercial buildings in the entire tract\u201d and were not to \u201cerect any commercial buildings\u201d on any part of the 31 acre tract outside of that covered by the option \u201cwhich would be similar in character or used for the same purposes as those proposed to be built\u201d on the 12% acre tract. It was not to be the obligation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>defendants \u201cto see to it that the trailers are removed by the Government.\u201d If \u201cGovernment lease on trailer site\u201d could not be cancelled, the option was \u201cto be null and void.\u201d The price was to be $78,750, payment of $10,000 cash on or before January 7, 1946, balance of $68,750 at the time of settlement, on or before April 1, 1946, plaintiff \u201cto receive a commission of $3,750 in payment for his services,\u201d to be deducted from the proceeds of sale in making settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">By an agreement dated January 7, 1946, defendants sold to Pollick, and Pollick purchased from defendants, the tract containing 12 ^ acres, \u201cto be selected from the entire\u201d Millison tract, \u201cthis purchase, however, not to include that portion of said property now being used as Millison\u2019s Restaurant, but to include the site of the present gas station,\u201d at the price of $78,750, of which $10,000 had been paid, $15,000 was to be paid on or before April 1, 1946, and defendants were to \u201caccept as balance\u201d $50,000 \u201cin capital stock\u201d of the Lexington Park Commercial Center, Inc., to be incorporated in Maryland \u201cto hold title to and develop\u201d the tract sold, which stock \u201cwill be one-fourth of total capital stock of said corporation.\u201d \u201cBalance,\u201d $3,750, was to be paid to plaintiff \u201cas a commission in payment for his services.\u201d The contract contained covenants similar to other above-mentioned provisions of the option.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">By an agreement dated March 29, 1946, between Pol-lick and defendants, reciting the option agreement of August 1, 1945, and the contract of sale of January 7, 1946, and that the parties \u201care now desirous of vacating and cancelling said agreement,\u201d the parties, in consideration of $12,500 [including the $10,000 paid under the contract] paid by Hiram Millison to Pollick, agreed \u201cto vacate and cancel\u201d the option agreement and the contract of sale and \u201cthe same are hereby vacated and cancelled.\u201d If these three written contracts between defendants and Pollick were the only evidence, or the controlling evidence, in the instant case it might well be argued that the third contract suggests no question as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>to enforceability of the second, but rather affirms enforceability by \u201cvacating and cancelling\u201d it for a consideration of $2,500 paid by Millison. However, these contracts were not an integration of the contract between plaintiff and defendants\u2014or of the <em>reasons </em>of defendants and Pollick for the third contract.' <em>Cf. Wigmore on Evidence, </em>3d Ed., sec. 2445. Hence they are not conclusive. Pollick says defendants paid the $2,500 \u201cto pay some of our. expenses so we would not sue them for specific performance.\u201d \u201cI asked for $17,000 and we compromised at twelve-five.\u201d The question therefore remains whether before the compromise the contract of sale was enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In August, 1945, Pollick had a plat prepared by an architect, John M. Walton, showing the excluded restaurant property and the proposed commercial center on the adjoining 12% acres. The excluded property was shown as a sector bounded by the two roads, as <em>radii </em>from their junction, and a connecting arc. The 12% acres was the remainder of a larger sector bounded by the same roads and an arc from the same center. Between the restaurant property and the commercial center was shown a road proposed by some St. Mary\u2019s County planning unit. Pollick says he showed the plat to Millison. Walton says it was prepared, after showing Millison a preliminary sketch and \u201cgetting his reaction,\u201d to conform with his \u201creaction.\u201d Pollick told Millison, when \u201cwe made the option, that we would have to employ an engineer to determine the lines.\u201d Pollick and Millison each, on or about September 17, 1945, had a plat prepared by an engineer, Pierre M. Ghent, Pollick\u2019s showing the 12% acres, after exclusion of the restaurant property, Millison\u2019s showing the western remainder of the 31 acres. In December, 1945, Ghent surveyed the property for Pollick and in January, 1946, prepared a plat from his survey, showing the 12% acres (and the excluded restaurant property). The Walton plat and the plat of the Ghent survey were offered in evidence. Pollick testified, without objection, that Ghent told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Millison was satisfied with the boundary shown by the survey. Pollick says the outlines shown on the Walton and Ghent plats are \u201capproximately\u201d the same, \u201conly they might not be right to the inch, you know; an architect made the other one; this was made by a surveyor.\u201d Walton says the two plats show \u201csomewhat the same boundaries.\u201d To the inexpert eye they look substantially the same, except that the Ghent survey is not a perfect sector, because both roads bend inward at the western end of the 121/2 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The option was drafted by plaintiff, the contract of sale by Pollick\u2019s lawyer, Mr. John H. T. Briscoe. Mr. Briscoe was asked, \u201cWas there any discussion as to the description of the land?\u201d Objection to this question was sustained on the ground that \u201cthe contract must speak for itself and cannot be varied.\u201d As the question was not followed up by a question, or proffer to show, what (if anything) was said, plaintiff was not injured by the ruling, whether the answer would have been \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Ghent on his survey saw a fence or \u201cstockade\u201d running across the property, from road to road, about 60 or 70 feet west of the centre of his eastern (curved) boundary of the 12i/2 acres. Mr. Briscoe says the \u201cstockade\u201d was 200 or 300 feet west of the Ghent boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">No question arose as to the description or boundary of the 121/2 acres until the day before March 29, 1946, which apparently had been agreed upon for final settlement. Pollick contended that the eastern boundary was that shown on the survey; Millison insisted upon the \u201cstockade.\u201d Pollick was disposed to yield, but an associate of his, one McGinnis, refused to do so. They \u201cargued all day\u201d and finally compromised by cancelling the contract on the terms above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Ghent, while testifying, had with him the plat dated September 17,1945, that he prepared for Millison. Plaintiff asked that he produce it. On objection the request was denied. In requesting production of the plat counsel said, \u201cWe are trying to show that Millison actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>knew at the time he entered into the contract of sale what land was intended to be conveyed by the contract of sale. We understand that the plat shows the 12% acres of land which are identical to the [January] plat that you see, of 12% acres.\u201d The court\u2019s exclusion of the September plat seems to be based upon failure of plaintiff to take advantage of the opportunities to get pre-trial information\u2014and partly upon the view that therefore plaintiff has \u201cno right to obtain access to Mr. Millison\u2019s work.\u201d We think relevant evidence from a witness at the trial cannot properly be excluded because of failure to get it before trial. As a matter of trial tactics, pre-trial examination is preferable to taking chances with a hostile or reluctant witness. But if a party neglects the former opportunity, he is not thereby precluded from taking the latter chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">If defendants in September had a plat prepared by Ghent which showed the same boundaries as the plat prepared by Ghent for Pollick in January, this would be some evidence that the parties before March (if not before January) had agreed upon the boundaries as contended by Pollick. Ghent testified that the September plat prepared for Millison did not include the 12% acres but only the portion of the 31 acres west of the 12% acres. But the eastern boundary of the western property would be the western boundary of the 12% acres and would necessarily determine the eastern extent (if not the exact boundary) of the 12% acres, <em>e. g., </em>whether the 12% acres could extend only to the \u201cstockade\u201d or to the boundary on the January plat. Indeed we think the evidence regarding the Walton plat, together with defendants\u2019 failure to question either the Walton boundary or the January plat until the day before final settlement, might be some evidence of agreement upon location of boundaries of the 12% acres and the restaurant property.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In the main the material facts and the applicable legal principles are clearly and succinctly stated in the opinion of the lower court. We think, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the rulings on admissibility and legal sufficiency of evidence reflect too broad application of the \u201cparol evidence rule\u201d and of the analogy to a specific performance case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The lower court says, \u201cThe crux of the case very plainly is whether the description which is contained in the contract is sufficiently definite and specific to be enforceable.\u201d Although the language of the written contract may suggest, and the lower court mentions, possible uncertainty as to other details, it seems clear that defendants and Pollick were actually in agreement in all respects except as to the boundary of the restaurant property. The corporation had been incorporated and the stock was ready for issue. Whether the western boundary of the 12^ acres should be an arc or a straight line was not important and was not in controversy. Millison, in answer to an interrogatory, construed the contract as giving Pollick 12!/2 acres \u201cto be selected by him\u201d but not to include any portion of the restaurant property. <em>Cf. Huntt &amp; Parks v. Gist, 2 </em>Har. <em>&amp; </em>J. 498, 505; <em>Thomas\u2019 Lessee v. Turvey, </em>1 Har. &amp; G. 435, 438. Pollick contended that the boundary of the restaurant property had been determined by mutual assent to the Ghent survey; defendants contended that the \u201cstockade\u201d was the existing physical boundary when the contract was made. It is immaterial which contention was correct. If either was correct, and the contract could have been enforced by defendants accordingly, plaintiff is entitled to his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Regarding defendant\u2019s contention as to the boundary the lower court said: \u201cWe thought perhaps the contract might have been cured by oral evidence as to just what did constitute the restaurant property; but there is no satisfactory evidence before the Court as to any clearly accepted area that was recognized by both parties as being part and parcel of the restaurant site. A suggestion was made that Mr. Millison claimed that the restaurant site extended back towards the west to a stockade across the property. That would seem to be a not unreasonable contention, in view of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the trailers were on the west side of that, and the fact that that apparently was the only thing that would, so far as evidence here is concerned, indicate an enclosure for the restaurant property.\u201d Regarding this contention we do not wish, and we do not feel able, to express an opinion as to the weight of the evidence. The record contains testimony as to the approximate location of the gasoline station on the January plat, but from the testimony and the plat we are not able to identify the relative location of the gasoline station and the \u201cstockade.\u201d If the gasoline station, as well as the trailers, were west of the stockade, and for the reasons stated the lower court considers defendants\u2019 contention \u201ca not unreasonable contention,\u201d we think these facts (at least if supplemented by testimony as to actual use of the restaurant property or the purpose of the \u201cstockade\u201d) might be sufficient to identify on the ground the \u201crestaurant property\u201d mentioned in the contract. In order to obtain specific performance, \u201cthe description must be such as to enable the court to determine with certainty, with the aid of such extrinsic evidence as is admissible under the rules of evidence, what property was intended by the parties to be covered thereby. The description need not be given with such particularity as to make a resort to extrinsic evidence unnecessary. Reasonable certainty .is all that is required.\u201d <em>Powell v. Moody, </em>153 Md. 62, 66, 137 A. 477, 478. <em>Cf. Helmik v. Pratt, supra. </em>A description may be sufficient although the contract necessarily contemplates a survey to prepare a more complete description. <em>Powell v. Moody, supra, </em>153 Md. 67, 137 A. 477. If all the property east of the \u201cstockade\u201d was actually used in connection with the restaurant, that fact might perhaps sufficiently identify the \u201crestaurant property\u201d without specifically showing that the property east of the \u201cstockade\u201d was \u201cclearly accepted\u201d and \u201crecognized by both parties as being part and parcel of the restaurant site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">On the other hand, if before or after the date of the contract of sale defendants and Pollick orally agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>upon or tacitly accepted, the January plat (or similar plats prepared before January) as showing the boundaries of the restaurant property and the 12% acres, such facts, together with the evidence that Pollick was willing and able to carry out such an agreement, would be legally sufficient to show performance by plaintiff, whether the plat varied or merely \u201cimplemented\u201d the written contract of sale. <em>Singer Construction Co. v. Goldsborough, supra; Restatement, Agency, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Defendants (appellees) are Millison, his wife and his mother. He and his mother own the property as joint tenants. Defendants suggest that there is no evidence that Millison was agent for his mother in having plats prepared or agreeing upon boundaries. This point does not seem to have been raised below, and we do not deem it necessary to pass upon it on the present record. On a new trial perhaps direct evidence will be offered. In any event the option, and the contract of sale of 12% acres \u201cto be selected from the entire\u201d Millison tract, necessarily contemplated \u201cselection\u201d of the 12% acres, a survey and a more complete description, and negotiations between sellers and buyer for these purposes. Millison and Pol-lick did frequently confer with each other and with the engineer and the architect. If authority of Millison as agent for his mother is disputed, the questions will arise, whether she held him out as her agent by permitting him to conduct these necessary negotiations, whether he represented himself as authorized to act for her, and whether he or she or both are therefore liable to plaintiff for his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Defendants also contend that plantiff did not procure in good faith a purchaser accepted by them, because he failed to disclose that McGinnis was associated with Pollick in the purchase. <em>Coppage v. Howard, </em>127 Md. 512, 96 A. 642. This contention is without merit. There is no evidence that plaintiff refused, or was asked to disclose any associate of Pollick. Defendants should have known or supposed that Pollick was not acting alone in the purchase. The option was given to Pollick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>\u201chis heirs and assigns,\u201d and the contract of sale provided that the property was to be conveyed to a corporation. McGinnis was present on the day fixed for final settlement and participated in the \u201cargument\u201d which culminated in compromise by cancellation of the contract of sale and payment of $2,500 by defendants to Pollick. Nothing was concealed from defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs, and case remanded for new or further trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
