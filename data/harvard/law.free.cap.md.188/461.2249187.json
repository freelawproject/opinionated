Wyse, who died in 1893, by will left \u201cthe farm known as Deer Park, now in my possession, being a part of the undivided Estate of the late William Wyse,\u201d to his wife for life and after her death to his five children, in equal interests, expressing an \u201cearnest wish that this property shall be kept in the family forever, if possible.\u201d It had been in the family for generations. It continued in the possession of his widow until her death in 1925, and thereafter of his son Dr. William P. E. Wyse, and his wife, until the death of Dr. and Mrs. Wyse by an automobile accident on March 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>1945. At the time of Dr. Wyse\u2019s death he owned a three-tenths interest, he and his brother John having acquired by deed in 1902 the interest of a sister; Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse, John\u2019s widow, owned three-tenths; James D. Murray, trustee under the will of another sister, two-tenths; and Mrs. Mary Augusta Wyse Benson, another sister, the remaining two-tenths. Mr. Murray and Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse are not residents of Maryland. On April 20, 1944, in a proceeding under Art. 16, sec. 125 in Anne Arundel County, Mrs. Benson had been adjudged incompetent and her daughter, Mrs. Mary Benson Kraft, appointed committee of her person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Dr. Wyse by will left his estate to his two sons, Wickliffe B. Wyse (plaintiff, appellee) and Coleman B. Wyse. Coleman died intestate on July 4, 1945, leaving his widow and Wickliffe his only heirs. In 1944 Coleman and his wife had executed an agreement releasing all rights in each other\u2019s estates; after his death she claimed that the agreement was void as against her and she was entitled to her share in his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u201cDeer Park\u201d is in Baltimore County, on both sides of Smith Avenue, about 52 acres, unimproved, on the south side and 112 acres, with improvements, on the north side. On April 6, 1941 Dr. Wyse had \u201clisted\u201d for sale with Albert P. Strobel, Jr., (defendant, appellant), a real estate broker, the property on the south side at $800 per acre. It was not sold, and later was withdrawn from the market. On February 18, 1945 Dr. Wyse again listed this property with Mr. Strobel at $600 per acre; he signed the \u201clisting contract\u201d \u201cPart Owner, W. P. E. Wyse, Agent.\u201d On March 5, 1945 Dr. Wyse for $250 gave Harry D. Myerberg an option for 60 days to purchase the property at $500 per acre, Strobel to get a five per cent, commission, it being agreed that \u201cas there are a number of interests in this estate, * * * if all interests do not accept these terms * * *, the deal will then be null and void with no liability on either party \u00e1nd the option money of $250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>shall be returned.\u201d None of the other interests did accept the terms of the option. In May, 1946 another broker, J. Kearsley Kearney, sold the property for $40,000, subject to the approval of the court. The decree in the instant case declared the Myerberg option \u201cnull and void,\u201d and Myerberg has not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On March 15, 1945 Mr. Strobel wrote Wickliffe that Myerberg was \u201cready to go through with the deal\u201d for the south side property and had said he would probably be interested in the north side property, and that Strobel thought Myerberg would pay the same price for the north side property, <em>viz., </em>$500 an acre. In this letter ho said, \u201cYour father explained to me that there will be certain complications as I believe there were ten heirs to this property and that some of them may be in the armed forces. What I will need at once will be the information as to who will control your family affairs; whether the various members of the family are ready to go through with this deal; if so, I will need a title reference and all information that you can give me as to who the heirs are and what interest each would have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On April 19, 1945 Wickliffe listed with Mr. Strobel the north side property at $55,000. Before this formal \u201clisting\u201d Strobel had already been working on the sale of the property. On April 25, 1945 a contract was executed by which \u201cWickliffe B. Wyse Agent Vendor\u201d sold the property to Dr. Wallace W. Walker (defendant, appellant), vendee, for $42,500, of which $2,000 had been paid (to Strobel) at the signing of the contract and the balance was to be paid \u201cin cash on date of settlement which shall be within ninety days from the signing hereof. It may be necessary to extend settlement date pending settlement of estate and title search. * * * Title to be good and merchantable, otherwise sale shall be void and the payment made at the signing hereof returned to the Vendee.\u201d Upon execution and delivery of the contract there was to be due by the vendor to Strobel \u201cthe regular brokerage commission.\u201d The contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>was signed at Strobel\u2019s office, first by Wickliffe, later by Dr. Walker. As Wickliffe and Mrs. Kraft left the office, Dr. Walker came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Mr. Strobel says Wickliffe had explained to him that there were four or five owners, all of whom had to be satisfied, and he had told Wickliffe that before Wickliffe could sign they must get the consent of all of those members of the family. Wickliffe and Mrs. Kraft went to Strobel\u2019s office and Wickliffe there telephoned Mr. Murray and Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse. On the evening of April 24th Mrs. Wyse telegraphed Strobel, in response to a telegram from him, giving authority to sell \u201cfor $42,500 cash, $2,000 deposit, settlement ninety days.\u201d The next afternoon Mr. Murray telegraphed Strobel \u201cAcceptance offer $42,500 cash\u201d for the property. \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d The same day Mrs. Wyse wrote confirming her telegram. On April 26th Mrs. Kraft, \u201cCommittee for Estate of Mary A. Benson,\u201d wrote Strobel, \u201cconfirming what I told you yesterday,\u201d agreeing to the sale for $42,500, _\u201c$2,000 to be paid now and the balance in ninety days.\u201d On July 23, 1945 Mr. Murray, and on July 24th Mrs. Wyse, wrote Mr. Strobel, refusing to \u201cratify\u201d the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Dr. Walker employed the Maryland Title Guarantee Company to examine the title. Mr. Knapp, of the title company, is counsel for Dr. Walker. On July 6, 1945 counsel for Mrs. Kraft, committee, wrote to the title company, \u201cAttention\u2014Mr. Knapp,\u201d to be advised \u201cas to what you require from Mrs. Kraft incident to the transfer.\u201d The title company\u2019s report on the title, dated October 30, 1945, addressed to Mr. Knapp, found the title vested in Mrs. Benson and others, but did not mention the adjudication of her incompetency or the appointment of her committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Mr. Strobel cannot say that he did or did not explain to Dr. Walker who the several owners of the property were. \u201cIt is usual and customary for me to explain everything. * * * I might * * * have shown him the letters and the telegrams which I had received from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>various parties in interest.\u201d Dr. Walker left that to Strobel. Dr. Walker says he did not ask Strobel who the other interested parties were. \u201cI thought that was his business. He was selling the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">On January 8, 1946 the bill of complaint in the instant case was filed by Wickliffe, individually and as administrator <em>c. t. a. </em>of Dr. Wyse and administrator of Coleman, against Mrs. Benson, Mr. Murray, trustee, Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse, Coleman\u2019s widow, Dr. Walker, Mr. Strobel and others, alleging that \u201cDeer Park\u201d is not susceptible to partition without material loss and injury and it is to the benefit and advantage of all persons interested in the property that it be sold and the proceeds brought into court to be divided among those entitled thereto. This particular allegation is admitted in Dr. Walker\u2019s answer, filed February 14, 1946, and the other answers. The bill does not mention the fact or the adjudication of Mrs. Benson\u2019s incompetency or the appointment of her committee. Mrs. Benson was not summoned. Mrs. Kraft, as committee, obtained in Anne Arundel County an order purporting to authorize her to file an answer as committee, which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The bill also alleged that: On April 25, 1945 plaintiff, \u201cas Agent and as Co-tenant with others interested therein and on his own and their behalf, \u201cexecuted the contract of sale with Dr. Walker, which was filed as an exhibit; \u201csaid sale was made upon the express understanding that it was subject to the approval of this Court\u201d; the title search was not completed until October 30, 1945; at the time of entering into the contract, plaintiff believed that the sale was \u201cto the best interest and advantage of all parties interested\u201d in the property, but \u201cdue to the delays which have been occasioned in part by\u201d Coleman\u2019s death and \u201cthe time consumed in searching the title to the property\u201d and \u201cthe time which will necessarily elapse before title can be conveyed,\u201d plaintiff \u201cis not certain whether or not it is now, or will be at the time of the consummation of said sale, to the advantage of all persons interested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>said Estate that said sale be made at said price of $42,500\u201d; at the time plaintiff entered into the contract \u201che was of the opinion that said sale was advantageous to all parties interested and he accordingly submits said sale for the consideration\u201d of the court. The bill prays that \u201cDeer Park\u201d (both north and south of Smith Avenue) be sold and also that the contract of April 25, 1945 \u201cbe ratified and confirmed if the same be found advantageous to all parties in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Dr. Walker in his answer alleges that: \u201cHe has been ready, willing and able to consummate the purchase of \u2022 the property since the signing of the Contract\u201d; the delays are in no way due to any fault on his part but \u201care caused solely by the complicated status of the title\u201d; the price \u201cis a fair price and was the highest price obtainable\u201d; at the time of signing the contract \u201cit was not known to him that a proceedings [sic]' would be necessary to consummate the sale, nor was any such information disclosed to him by the Contract of Sale, or otherwise, but * * * he believes that said sale was and is to the best interest and advantage of all parties interested in the property,\u201d and should therefore be approved by the court. Mr. Murray, trustee, and Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse in their answers allege that the contract \u201chas no binding effect and is now void\u201d so far as they are concerned. Mrs. Kraft, committee, in her answer alleges that she \u201chad no authority to delegate anyone to contract for the incompetent,\u201d Mrs. Benson.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On September 9, 1946, at the beginning of the hearing, Dr. Walker amended his answer so as to allege that \u201cthe party owners, having obligated themselves by the absolute terms of a fair and reasonable contract, are precluded in these proceedings from asking for any sale otherwise than in consummation of the contract made with\u201d him \u201cby the duly authorized agent of all of them.\u201d On the same day he petitioned the court, under Art. 16, sec. 226, to determine \u201cin advance of the trial of the whole case\u201d two \u201cquestions of law,\u201d <em>(a) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>whether plaintiff, \u201cat least to the extent of his ownership\u201d in the property, is not bound by the contract if the court finds that the contract \u201cwas never revealed\u201d to Dr. Walker as being subject to the approval of the court, and <em>(b) </em>whether, in such event, plaintiff, in his own right or in either of his representative capacities, has such an interest in the property as entitles him to file a bill for sale for partition under Art. 16, sec. 159. On account of the lateness of this application the court deferred determination of these questions until the decision of the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Soon after the contract of April 25, 1945 was executed, Dr. Walker employed Mr. Strobel to effect \u201cresales\u201d of parts of the property contracted for. Through Strobel\u2019s negotiations Dr. Walker on May 28, 1945 made a contract of sale to Albert Meid, Jr., of the residence and 4% acres for $13,500, about the same time sold a tenant house and three or four acres to one Shaneybrook for $6,500, and in July arranged, without a formal contract, to sell to Arundel Corporation 27 acres for $6,750, <em>i.e., </em>$250 an acre. There is testimony that Meid spent about $2,800 on the house on the strength of oral permission from Wickliffe through Strobel. There is conflicting testimony as to the scope of Wiekliffe\u2019s permission and whether these expenditures were made for \u201cimprovement,\u201d \u201cmutilation\u201d or \u201cdemolition\u201d of the property. On June 23, 1945 Wickliffe, after finding himself locked out of the house, wrote Meid notifying him \u201cto cease all demolition, all activity and trespass on this property.\u201d Meid is not a party to this case. Our disposition of the instant appeals will be without prejudice to any claims against the property or against any of the owners or Dr. Walker or Meid for benefits or damages respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">At the hearing four real estate experts testified as to the value of the property. Mr. Strobel testified that he considered $42,500 a fair price at the time the contract was entered into, but the property \u201cis worth more money today.\u201d \u201cI thought that it was worth more even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>at that time but I could not get it.\u201d Mr. Ferguson testified that then and now it was worth $42,500; Colonel Harvey, $55,000; and Mr. Kearney, $65,000. The lower court was \u201cnot convinced that it is for the interest and advantage of the incompetent that the contract of sale be confirmed\u201d; it held that it had jurisdiction under Art. 16, sec. 159, to decree a sale for partition. By its decree, dated October 29, 1946, the court \u201cdisaffirmed\u201d the contract of April 25, 1945 and ordered Mr. Strobel to return to Dr. Walker the $2,000 paid, without prejudice to any rights of Walker or Strobel against the owners of the property, except the incompetent; the court also decreed that the property be sold and appointed trustees to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">From this decree Dr. Walker and Mr. Strobel have appealed. They raise the same questions raised in Dr. Walker\u2019s petition of September 9, 1946, and also contend (presumably in the alternative), (1) that the evidence warranted confirmation of the contract and (2) that the court had no jurisdiction to decree a sale, because the incompetent was never summoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We think the last contention is sound. Art. 16, sec. 159 is applicable \u201cto cases where some or all of the parties are <em>non compos mentis\u201d </em>or are infants. \u201cUpon return of process as served, * * * the court shall * * * by order, either require the legal guardian or committee of the infant, or non-sane defendant * * * to appear, answer and defend for such party, or appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>to answer and defend the suit for such party.\u201d Art. 16, sec. 168; Rule 14. Without service of process the court acquired no jurisdiction over the incompetent defendant. In <em>Roche v. Waters, </em>72 Md. 264, 269-272, 19 A. 535, 7 L. R. A. 533, it was so held, with respect to infants, under the Act of 1816, ch. 154; Art. 16, sec. 64, and a retroactive curative statute was held unconstitutional. The committee had no power to contract for the incompetent and neither the incompetent, the committee, the lower court nor the court in Anne Arundel County had power to waive or dispense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>service of process. Nor has this court. In the 'instant case this result may seem an unfortunate \u201ctechnicality,\u201d but notice is a fundamental of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In view of the full hearing on the question of value, we may say, without laboring the question, that (if the incompetent were properly before the court) we should affirm the conclusion that it was not shown to be for the interest and advantage of the incompetent that the contract of April 25, 1945 be confirmed. Not the number of experts, but the nature of Mr. Strobel\u2019s testimony, the sales subsequent to April 25, 1945, and the self-interest of all parties in respectively advocating or opposing confirmation, lead to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Appellants contend that the contract of April 25, 1945 was a judicial sale and, if it was fairly made and was then for the interest and advantage of the incompetent, should now be confirmed, though not now for her interest and advantage, citing <em>Cook v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>172 Md. 398, 191 A. 713; <em>Blank v. Frey, </em>165 Md. 647, 170 A. 156; and <em>Leary\u2019s Case, </em>50 N. J. Eq. 383, 25 A. 197. The first case cited was a sale made under a testamentary power; by statute only, judicial confirmation, not authorization, was required. The other two cases were sales made under <em>previous </em>judicial decrees and subsequently confirmed. A \u201ccontract\u201d made \u201cfor or on behalf of any infant * * * or person <em>non compos mentis,\u201d </em>within the meaning of Art. 16, sec. 159, is only a proposal, not a judicial sale, until it is found to be \u201cfor the interest and advantages, both of such infant * * * or person <em>non compos mentis, </em>and of the other person or persons interested therein,\u201d and is confirmed by the court. The provisions as to such a \u201ccontract\u201d in section 159 originated in the Act of 1785, ch. 72, sec. 12, were omitted in the Code of 1860 and were reenacted by the Act of 1886, ch. 232. <em>Miller, Equity Procedure, </em>sec. 397. In the Act of 1785 the required findings as to \u201cinterest and advantage\u201d were the same with respect to such a \u201ccontract\u201d as with respect to sale for partition. They relate to the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ent. A \u201ccontract\u201d is not for the interest and advantage of the parties, if it is now against their interest but might have been for their interest eighteen months ago \u2014eight months before the bill was filed and the \u201ccontract\u201d submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">If the contract of April 25, 1945 is binding upon the plaintiff, Wickliffe, to the extent of his interest in the property, the court is not for that reason without jurisdiction. Under section 159 confirmation of a contract is (and in 1785 was) an alternative for (or a method of) sale for partition. Any \u201ctenant in common\u201d may file a bill for partition, sale for partition, or confirmation of a \u201ccontract\u201d; one bound by such a \u201ccontract\u201d is not excepted. Indeed, it seems natural that the bill for confirmation of the \u201ccontract\u201d be filed by a party to the \u201ccontract.\u201d The instant bill of complaint states a case for sale for partition, but fails to allege, or ask confirmation of, a contract made \u201cfor or on behalf of any person <em>non compos mentis.\u201d </em>To give jurisdiction it is sufficient that the bill would be good on demurrer, even if plaintiff\u2019s right were denied in the answer. <em>Barron v. Zimmerman, </em>117 Md. 296, 305, 83 A. 258, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">No question as to specific performance is presented on the record, though questions as to partial specific performance have been argued orally and in the briefs. Dr. Walker has filed no bill or cross-bill for specific performance <em>(Rickard v. Neff, </em>130 Md. 89, 99 A. 940), complete or partial. He has not even formally expressed willingness to buy separately Wickliffe\u2019s undivided interest. Specific performance is not a spontaneous remedy, obtained without asking.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We do not regard <em>Morris v. Wilson, </em>187 Md. 217, 49 A. 2d 458, as narrowing the proper scope of partial specific performance, but as illustrating some of the limitations of the far from rigid principles of specific performance. Assuming, without deciding or suggesting, that consistently with due diligence Dr. Walker might now ask partial specific performance, it is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that he would not be entitled to this remedy against Mr. Murray, trustee, or Mrs. Rachel Thayer Wyse, and it is not clear that he would be entitled to it even against Wiekliffe. The contract of April 25, 1945 was an entire contract for the sale of the property, not of undivided interests in it. Mr. Murray and Mrs. Wyse agreed to unite in such a sale, not to sell their interests separately. They neither warranted nor represented that Wiekliffe had authority to bind Mrs. Benson or any one except themselves respectively. If an agent contracts to sell property of A and B, and B is an infant, the purchaser cannot specifically enforce sale of A\u2019s half interest. <em>Lumley v. Ravenscroft, </em>[1895] 1 Q. B. 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Dr. Walker argues, from a note in 154 A. L. R. 767, that, in order to be entitled to partial specific performance, a purchaser need not be \u201cunaware\u201d of his vendor\u2019s lack of title, if he is \u201cunaware\u201d of lack of means of furnishing the title contracted for. Assuming, without deciding, that some such contention might be sound, it would not necessarily follow that Dr. Walker would be entitled to partial specific performance against Wickliffe merely because he failed to ask Strobel who the owners were and to ascertain that one was an incompetent. The provisions of the contract, <em>e.g., </em>for extension beyond ninety days \u201cpending settlement of estate and title search,\u201d and for failure to furnish a merchantable title would not suggest to Dr. Walker that Wickliffe had power to bind all interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">If the court had acquired jurisdiction over Mrs. Benson, it would properly have refused to \u201cconfirm\u201d the contract. We think, that on the issues presented, it should not have \u201cdisaffirmed\u201d the contract and ordered Mr. Strobel to return to Dr. Walker the $2,000 paid, even with express reservation of any rights of Walker or Strobel against any of the owners other than Mrs. Benson.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Mr. Strobel on his appeal asks allowance of commissions against all or any of the owners. His rights, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>if any, to commissions were not properly an issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, costs above and below to be paid by the owners other than Mrs. Benson.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
