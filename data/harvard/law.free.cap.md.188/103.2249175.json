A sufficient answer to appellant\u2019s contention is that he was not convicted of common-law burglary, but of violation of the statute above quoted. <em>Bowser v. State, </em>136 Md. 342, 110 A. 854. The charge of intent \u201cfeloniously to steal\u201d certain goods is equivalent to the charge of \u201cintent to steal property of sufficient value to make the larceny a felony, because if * * * he intended to steal property to the value of less than $25, it could not have been felonious.\u201d <em>State v. Wiley, </em>173 Md. 119, 122, 194 A. 629, 630, 113 A. L. R. 1267. Thus the indictment charged, in the words of the statute or the equivalent, all the elements of the crime of \u201cstatutory burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In thus disposing of this case, we do not intimate that if the indictment had been found defective, the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>after conviction and sentence, could serve the purpose of a demurrer to the indictment. <em>Dimmick v. Tompkins, </em>194 U. S. 540, 552, 24 S. Ct. 780, 48 L. Ed. 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
