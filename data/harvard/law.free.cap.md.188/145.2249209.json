Section 3 divides the area.'into four districts which are specifically defined in that section. The first district is called \u201cCalvert Hills District\u201d; the second, \u201cCollege Park .District\u201d; the third, \u201cLakeland District\u201d; and the fourth, \u201cBerwyn District.\u201d At the end of the second section of the Act it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">\u201cIn addition to the above area the following area shall be included in the corporate limits of the Town of College Park, and shall constitute the Fifth District, and one (1) District Councilman shall be elected from said District in accordance with the qualifications and conditions for election of Councilmen herein provided:\u201d The area of the Fifth District immediately follows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">Section 4 sets up the form of government for the \u201cTown of College Park\u201d\u2014that it shall have a Mayor, Treasurer, a Councilman from each ditrict, and two Councilmen at Large, and provides for the election of these officials. This section contains provisions usually found in char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ters of this character. The Act contained a referendum, and the people, at an election held under the Act, voted to adopt the charter. A government under the charter was organized and proceeded to function.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Thereafter the appellees in this case filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, in Equity, a bill of complaint against the appellants, who are the officials of the \u201cTown of College Park\u201d created by the aforesaid Act. All of the appellees are residents of the Fifth District and their bill is for an injunction to restrain the appellants from exercising any of the powers contained in the Act and from levying under it taxes on their properties situate in the Fifth District. The reason advanced for this relief is that the title to the aforesaid Act is misleading and in violation of Article 3, Section 29 of the Constitution of the State, which is, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u201c* * * every law enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">There are other allegations in the bill which we need not refer to.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The answer of appellants denied this contention and the material allegations of the bill, and makes the affirmative averment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201cthat the properties allegedly owned by plaintiffs in what is now the Fifth District of the Town of College Park form part of a large area with indefinite boundaries frequently and generally known, referred to, and described as the town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, within the meaning and intent of the word \u2018described\u2019 as used in Article 3, Section 29 of the Constitution of the State of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The answer also avers that properties allegedly owned by appellees were included within the limits of the town of Berwyn which the General Assembly attempted to incorporate by Chapter 678, Acts of 1941, and which had substantially the same boundaries as the Fourth and Fifth Districts of the present \u201cTown of College Park.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>It also averred that prior to the passage of Chapter 1051, Acts of 1945, much publicity by newspapers, handbills, public hearings and other means was given to the contemplated incorporation of the Fifth District in the proposed \u201cTown of College Park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Testimony was taken before the chancellor to determine what area was embraced by the phrase \u201cthe adjacent town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.\u201d After argument the chancellor filed a full and careful opinion, in which he held that the title to Chapter 1051 of the Acts of 1945 was misleading and in violation of the constitutional provision referred to. He declared the Act unconstitutional and granted the relief prayed for by appellees. From this decree the case comes here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">That part of the title to the Act in question with which we are concerned is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201cAn Act to incorporate the town of \u2018College Park\u2019 and the adjacent communities of \u2018Calvert Hills,\u2019 \u2018Lakeland\u2019 and the adjacent town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, as a municipal corporation to be known as \u2018Town of College Park,\u2019 and to define its boundaries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">What is meant by the \u201ctown of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 \u201d in the title is important to the decision of this case. That there is an unincorporated place called \u201cBerwyn\u201d is without question. What area \u201cBerwyn,\u201d prior to the Act, embraced is a matter upon which the parties to the case differ. Appellees contend that the Fifth District cannot be considered within the town of \u201cBerwyn,\u201d while the appellants affirm that that District falls within the meaning of the appellation \u201ctown of \u2018Berwyn\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Testimony was taken to show what the people living in the Fifth District and territory adjacent thereto considered the area embraced within the meaning of \u201ctown of \u2018Berwyn\u2019;\u201d Most of these witnesses lived for years in what they thought was the town of Berwyn. Some had their places of business there and carried on their business with the people living in that community. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>testimony in this case may be said to establish the following facts: Many years ago there was a little place called \u201cBranchville\u201d in the area in question. The territory adjacent thereto, at that time, was probably open country. If there were any houses at all in this open country they were very few. There was a station maintained by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad at Branchville. This little place, containing about fifty houses, has a post office, with no delivery, and its residents call at the post office for their mail. There is a small amount of business carried on at that place now. This town did not grow. The territory around it, comprising District Five, was from time to time developed, and at the present time there are twenty-five or more real estate developments in this area. Berwyn was one of the developments within the area to be incorporated in the \u201cTown of College Park.\u201d Calvert Hills, Lakeland, and College Park were also included within that area. These developments grew, and the result was that Branchville was encircled. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad abandoned its station at Branchville in 1908, and its station for the area in question is now located at Berwyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Fifth District is bounded on the east by the tracks of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, and on the west generally by a stream known as \u201cPaint Branch.\u201d The main part of what is known as Berwyn lies between the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard on the west and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad tracks on the east. All of the real estate developments in District Five are located east of the boulevard, with the exception of \u201cAutoville\u201d and \u201cCherry Hill,\u201d .sub-divisions. The business section developed on the boulevard, and as the population grew it gradually extended to the development known as \u201cHollywood,\u201d which is located in the northern section of the Fifth District. These sub-divisions were built up to such an extent that the area of the Fifth District presented the appearance of one entire community.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Residents ordering goods from Baltimore or Washington directed that delivery be made to their street ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>dress in \u201cBerwyn.\u201d In some instances they would give their addresses as a certain number in \u201cHollywood, Berwyn.\u201d The school which children in this district attended was called \u201cBerwyn.\u201d Merchants advertised their places of business as located in \u201cBerwyn.\u201d Until a year ago the telephone exchange that served this area was called \u201cBerwyn.\u201d One of the appellants stated that she lived in the sub-division called \u201cAutoville\u201d and that this section has been known as \u201cAutoville\u201d since 1923. She owns and operates a tavern called \u201cKnotty Pine Tavern,\u201d which is located on the boulevard in the \u201cAutoville\u201d subdivision. Her address, before the name of the exchange of the telephone was changed, was given by her as \u201cBerwyn,\u201d Maryland. She receives her mail through the \u201cBerwyn\u201d post office, and she tells merchants to deliver goods to her at 9078 Baltimore Boulevard, Post Office \u201cBerwyn,\u201d Maryland, and most of her deliveries by truck are marked \u201cBerwyn.\u201d In going to her home on the Greyhound bus she buys a ticket to \u201cBerwyn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The operators of a night club called \u201cClub Rayburn,\u201d formerly known as \u201cDude Ranch,\u201d located in the northern part of the \u201cAutoville\u201d sub-division, advertised' in the Washington newspapers for the purpose of inducing patrons to come to their place of business. This enterprise, in August, 1946, advertised in the Washington Post its location: \u201cLocated six miles from Washington, on the Washington-Baltimore Boulevard, Berwyn, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">A real estate broker advertised houses and lots for sale in some of these sub-divisions as being located in \u201cBerwyn.\u201d Stress was made by appellee that these real estate sub-divisions which were started from time to time were given their respective names which appeared on plats recorded among the Land Records of the County. It is contended that they are different places and each place has a different name. That being so, they could not be included within what is known as \u201cBerwyn.\u201d The names shown on recorded plats of these sub-divisions have become lost to the memory, if ever known, of most of the people residing in the Berwyn area.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>One of the witnesses did not know that there was such a place called \u201cAutoville,\u201d although he had lived in \u201cBerwyn\u201d for years. It appears that the post office at Berwyn only delivers mail within a restricted area, and beyond this area is rural free delivery. It is said that the area of Berwyn should be restricted to the area within which mail is delivered, and hence could not include the Fifth District. We do not think this contention can be adopted as controlling what the people thought Berwyn, embraced in area.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Without further commenting upon the evidence (and excluding the proffered testimony of appellant rejected by the chancellor), we are clearly of the opinion that the appellees failed to prove that these sub-divisions were regarded as separate communities, but on the contrary a heavy preponderance of the evidence shows that the entire area covered by the Fifth District was known and regarded generally by the people living therein as the \u201ctown of \u2018Berwyn\u2019.\u201d The old place of Branchville, by the development of these sub-divisions, has been absorbed by the town of Berwyn, and the whole community of which these sub-divisions constitute a part, is now generally known and called \u201cBerwyn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We shall not again explore the purpose that the framers of the Constitution had in mind to be accomplished when they adopted as a part of that instrument the 29th section of Article 3. In the case of <em>Painter v. Mattfeldt, </em>119 Md. 466, 87 A. 413, the late Judge Burke fully discussed this section, and in the very late case of <em>Neuenschwander v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>187 Md. 67, 48 A. 2d 593, Judge Delaplaine again thoroughly reviewed the subject. In these two cases former opinions of this Court were quoted and cited. It would serve no purpose for us to comment on this section, which was so fully and ably treated in those two opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">In <em>Prince George\u2019s County Com\u2019rs v. Com\u2019rs of Laurel, </em>51 Md. 457, the title under attack was: \u201cAn Act to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>corporate the Town of Laurel in Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d Laws 1870, c. 260. This Act was held good.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In <em>Johnson v. Luers, </em>129 Md. 521, 528, 99 A. 710, the title to the Act was: \u201cAn Act for the incorporation of the town of Bowie, in Prince George\u2019s County, and for the submission of this charter to the qualified voters of said town for their adoption or rejection, and for the repeal of all acts or parts of acts inconsistent therewith.\u201d This title apparently was not questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">If the title to the present Act had been: \u201cAn Act to incorporate \u2018College Park\u2019 in Prince George\u2019s County,\u201d it would have complied with the constitutional provision as to titles. In the present case the title clearly indicates that the adjacent communities of \u201cCollege Park,\u201d \u201cCalvert Hills,\u201d \u201cLakeland\u201d and \u201cthe adjacent town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 \u201d were to. be incorporated in and known as \u201cTown of College Park,\u201d and its boundaries defined. This title gave notice to the members of the Legislature and to the residents of the communities specified therein, and to the residents of \u201cthe adjacent town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019.\u201d District Five was known and considered by its residents as a part of the town of Berwyn. It is clear, therefore, that the people residing in the adjacent communities of \u201cCollege Park,\u201d \u201cCalvert Hills,\u201d \u201cLakeland\u201d and the \u201cadjacent town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019 \u201d were notified by the title that the Legislature was considering the Act for the purpose of incorporating these communities and towns into a municipal corporation to be known as \u201cTown of College Park,\u201d and to define the boundaries thereof. . When it is considered that all of the sub-divisions in the territory of District Five have been built upon and that the building in one sub-division has met up with the building in another sub-division, and the whole consolidated with what is known and considered as \u201cthe town of \u2018Berwyn\u2019,\u201d it is clear that the people residing in the Fifth District were given, by the title to the Act, full notice that this territory might be included within the limits of the new \u201cTown of College Park.\u201d This- was all that was required by Article 8, Section 29 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>It was argued because Section 3 of the Act in question provided that the town was to be divided into four districts and that none of these four districts included District Five, that this renders the title of the Act defective. But the title points to the body of the Act for the boundaries of the town, and the boundaries of the \u201cTown of College Park\u201d set out in Section 2 of the Act include the Fifth District. A person interested in the boundaries of the town, upon reading the title to the Act, would be directed to the body of the Act to find out definitely what the boundaries of the proposed town embraced. This was all the notice that was required, and it cannot be said that the title to this Act was misleading. It is true that the boundaries of District Five did not follow after the boundaries of District Four, but because the boundaries of District Five did not follow immediately after District Four would not render the title to the Act bad. See <em>McGlaughlin v. Warfield, </em>180 Md. 75, 23 A. 2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Holding, as we do, that the title to this Act conforms to the constitutional provision, it will not be necessary for us to comment upon the ruling of the chancellor excluding certain evidence offered by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed, bill of complaint dismissed, with costs to appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
