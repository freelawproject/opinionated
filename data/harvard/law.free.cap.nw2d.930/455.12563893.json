After appellant gave the child to C.R.G., another individual named J.L.T., the child, and C.R.G. entered C.R.G.'s vehicle. A fifth individual, C.L.G., stood outside, next to the vehicle. Appellant and C.L.G. started arguing. Appellant pulled out a handgun and attempted to fire a shot in C.L.G.'s direction, but the bullet struck the vehicle with C.R.G., J.L.T., and the child inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state charged appellant with one count of drive-by shooting in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n    Minn.

Stat. \u00a7 609.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1a(a)(3) (2016). The complaint named C.R.G., an occupant of the vehicle, as the victim of the second-degree-assault charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant pleaded guilty to all three counts with no agreement on sentencing. The district court sentenced appellant to 48 months in prison for the drive-by-shooting offense (count one) and 36 months for the second-degree-assault offense (count two). The district court did not impose a sentence on the offense of reckless discharge of a firearm. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Did the district court err by imposing multiple sentences for drive-by-shooting and second-degree-assault offenses when both convictions arose out of a single behavioral incident and when the multiple-victim rule of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n    Minn.

(quotations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court relied on this rule to uphold the imposition of multiple sentences for eight counts of aiding and abetting second-degree assault and one count of drive-by shooting, after the defendant had committed a drive-by shooting of a building with eight occupants.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070809\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/808/586/#p590\">\n    808 N.W.2d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellant argues that\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from his case because, (1) the supreme court specifically limited its decision in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   to drive-by shootings of occupied buildings, and excluded drive-by shootings of motor vehicles; (2)\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   involved multiple assault victims, while appellant's case involves only one;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , vacating appellant's sentence for second-degree assault would not unfairly depreciate the seriousness of his offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to appellant's first argument, the\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   court \"express[ed] no opinion about who could be victims of a drive-by shooting at a person or an occupied vehicle\" because that issue was not before the court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7070809\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/808/586/#p590\">\n    808 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   590 n. 1. But that issue is before us now, and we will address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   based its decision on a close reading of the language of the drive-by-shooting statute, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) [w]hoever, while in or having just exited from a motor vehicle,\n   <em>\n    recklessly discharges a firearm at or toward another motor vehicle or a building\n   </em>\n   is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years or to payment of a fine of not more than $ 6,000, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) Any person who violates this subdivision by firing at or toward a person, or\n   <em>\n    an occupied building or motor vehicle\n   </em>\n   , may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than ten years or to payment of a fine of not more than $ 20,000, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1e(a)-(b) (emphasis added). The\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   court noted that the drive-by-shooting statute requires only a reckless discharge of a firearm at or toward an occupied building and that nothing in the statute requires that the shooter know that the building is occupied by the victims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n    at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, unlike for the crime of assault, the drive-by-shooting statute does not require that the occupants of the building \"be injured, put in fear, or even be aware of the shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the statute's plain language, the supreme court reasoned that \"a single count of drive-by shooting at an occupied building does not constitute a crime against each building occupant,\" and that \"the imposition of sentences on the eight assault convictions plus a sentence on the drive-by-shooting conviction did not violate the 'one sentence per victim' component of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.035\">\n    at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The same reasoning applies here. The statutory elements are identical for both a drive-by shooting at an occupied building and a drive-by shooting at an occupied motor vehicle.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1e (a)-(b). And the statute describes drive-by shooting at an occupied building and drive-by shooting at an occupied motor vehicle in the very same clause. Under a plain reading of the statute, there is no distinction between the two offenses; both are premised on the object of the shooting - an occupied building or motor vehicle,\n   rather than the building or vehicle occupants.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20609.66\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (providing that drive-by-shooting offenses include \"recklessly discharges a firearm at or toward another motor vehicle or a building\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   to the facts here, we hold that the offense of drive-by shooting at an occupied motor vehicle does not constitute an offense against each of the vehicle's occupants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the district court did not err by imposing sentences for drive-by shooting and second-degree assault, even if both convictions arose out of a single behavioral incident involving the same victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We need not address appellant's remaining two reasons for why\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   does not apply because our holding resolves the question of whether the logic of\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   applies to occupied motor vehicles. Additionally, following\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   precludes the need to address appellant's first argument as to why the district court must vacate his sentence for second-degree assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   , we hold that a single count of drive-by shooting at an occupied motor vehicle does not constitute an offense against each of the vehicle's occupants. Accordingly, the district court did not err by imposing sentences for drive-by shooting and second-degree assault, even if both convictions arose out of a single behavioral incident involving the same victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Affirmed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Appellant's brief identifies C.L.G. as the only victim.
