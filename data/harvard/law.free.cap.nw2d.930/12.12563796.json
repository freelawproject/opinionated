Although we reject most of relators' assertions of error, we agree that the FEIS is inadequate because it does not address the potential impact of an oil spill into the Lake Superior watershed. Accordingly, we reverse the commission's adequacy determination and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In April 2015, Enbridge filed applications for a certificate of need (CN) and routing permit (RP) to allow the installation of 337 miles of 36-inch diameter pipe, and associated facilities, from the North Dakota-Minnesota border to the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. The proposed pipeline would replace the existing Line 3, which is part of Enbridge's Mainline System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Existing Line 3 crosses into northwestern Minnesota from North Dakota, connects to a terminal at Clearbrook (the Clearbrook terminal), and continues east across northern Minnesota, through Carlton, and into Wisconsin, where it connects with a terminal in Superior, Wisconsin (the\n   Superior terminal). Existing Line 3 crosses through the Leech Lake and Fond du Lac Reservations pursuant to leases that will expire in 2029. In its CN and RP applications, Enbridge proposed a route for the replacement Line 3 that would follow the existing Line 3 corridor from North Dakota to Clearbrook and Carlton to Superior, but would take a more southerly route between Clearbrook and Carlton, which would avoid crossing the reservations. Figure 2.1-1 from the EIS, reproduced in color below, illustrates the location of the existing mainline corridor (which houses Line 3 and other pipelines) and Enbridge's proposed new route (Applicant's Preferred Route, or APR).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After initially setting the CN and RP applications for separate contested-case proceedings and initiating environmental review in the RP docket, the commission combined the CN and RP dockets and ordered that a joint EIS be prepared. The commission, as the RGU, authorized the Minnesota Department of Commerce's Energy Environmental Review and Analysis division (DOC-EERA) to prepare the EIS, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) were brought in as assisting agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The project proceeded through scoping, a process that determines the range of issues to be addressed in an EIS. A final scoping decision document was issued on December 5, 2016, and a draft EIS (DEIS) was released on May 15, 2017. Following a public-comment period, during which DOC-EERA received approximately 2,860 public comments, an FEIS was released on August 17, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving the FEIS, the commission issued an order extending the statutory deadline for determining the adequacy of the FEIS and referring the matter to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) for development of the record and a recommendation on the adequacy of the FEIS. On November 1, 2017, an administrative-law judge (ALJ) issued proposed findings and conclusions and a recommendation that the commission determine the FEIS adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 14, 2017, the commission issued an order determining the FEIS inadequate and identifying four deficiencies to be remedied before the FEIS could be determined adequate. On February 12, 2018, DOC-EERA issued a revised FEIS,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the commission met to discuss on March 15, 2018. On May 1, 2018, the commission issued an order adopting the ALJ report as revised and determining the FEIS adequate. The commission issued an order denying reconsideration on July 3, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Relators Friends of the Headwaters (FOH), Honor the Earth (HTE), and Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and White Earth Band of Ojibwe (the Bands), filed three certiorari appeals, which this court consolidated for consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Is the commission's decision determining the FEIS adequate based on errors of law, unsupported by substantial evidence, or arbitrary or capricious?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Minnesota Environmental Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Environmental review in Minnesota is governed by the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), Minn.

The commission responds that there is no evidence in the record of any upgrades that would meet the capacity provided by the project. The commission's explanation is reasonable on the basis of the record. The investor slides on which HTE relies support no more than speculation about Enbridge's expansion plans.

HTE bases this argument on expert testimony presented by Enbridge during the CN proceedings, indicating the rail routes that would most likely be used if the Line 3 replacement were not built. HTE argues that the FEIS analysis of a rail alternative is flawed because it relies on different routes, and thus analyzes different environmental impacts than would be analyzed for the routes identified by Enbridge's experts. The commission responds that the FEIS rail analysis was based on \"information the DOC-EERA had in hand, which included assumptions about oil being transported from Gretna at the Canadian border to Superior, WI via Clearbrook, MN to mirror the delivery capabilities of the Project to transport oil between those two end points.\" The commission's explanation is reasonable on the basis of the record, and HTE has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate error in this regard as well.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

Potential impacts of an oil spill on Lake Superior\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    As the FEIS acknowledges, a potential environmental impact of this pipeline project is an accidental release of crude oil-an oil spill. Chapter 10 of the FEIS is devoted to analyzing the potential impacts of an oil spill for the APR and each of the project, route, and route-segment alternatives. In addition to providing a baseline spill-risk analysis based on past spills, analyzing the behavior of crude oil in a spill, assessing the potential resource impacts of an oil spill on resources along the APR and alternatives, and addressing spill prevention and mitigation, the FEIS incorporates a study modeling the potential spread of oil from spills at seven sites along the APR and alternative routes. The seven spill-modeling sites were chosen to represent a diversity of environmental conditions. Three of the sites are at separate locations on the Mississippi River; none of the sites are in the Lake Superior watershed.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    HTE argues that the FEIS is inadequate because it fails to address the impact of an oil spill into the Lake Superior watershed. Throughout the environmental-review process, environmental organizations and members of the public raised concerns about the impact of an oil spill on Lake Superior and its watershed, including the St. Louis River Estuary. The final scoping decision document (FSDD) addressed this concern, stating:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    <em>\n     Impacts to Lake Superior and Great Lakes\n    </em>\n    : The EIS will consider potential impacts to the Lake Superior watershed including potential impacts of oil spills along the proposed Project. Potential impacts to the Great Lakes from incidents involving transportation of crude oil by ship, rail, or other pipelines are existing potential effects and not changed by the construction or operation of the proposed pipeline.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Notwithstanding this language in the FSDD, the DEIS did not address the potential impacts of an oil spill in the Lake Superior watershed. Concerns about Lake Superior were renewed in public comments on the DEIS. But, in spite of these persistent concerns, neither the FEIS nor the responses to comments directly address the failure to analyze potential impacts of an oil spill on Lake Superior and its watershed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The responses to comments generically addressed concerns over the modeling approach used. While those responses may support the reasonableness of a decision to model spills at a limited number of locations, they do not explain why none of those locations were situated within the Lake Superior watershed, or otherwise address the very specific concerns raised about Lake Superior and its watershed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    During a hearing on the adequacy of the FEIS, one member of the commission asked why the spill analysis did not include a location in the Lake Superior watershed. A representative for DOC-EERA explained\n    that the sites were chosen for their environmental diversity, and identified a site that would provide the closest comparison to a spill in the Lake Superior watershed. The representative asserted that modeling in the Lake Superior watershed would not be particularly helpful, in light of multiple existing pipelines and the fact that all route alternatives would cross through the area. And the representative asserted that a spill at a potential modeling site within the watershed would be unlikely to reach Lake Superior. There would be little point in compiling an FSDD if the requirements of the document-that the identified potential impacts be evaluated and analyzed in the FEIS-could be ignored and replaced by cursory oral assertions during the adequacy hearing before the commission. The determination of whether the FEIS is adequate necessarily focuses on the contents of the FEIS itself.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 116D.04, subd. 2b(3) ;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%204410\">\n     Minn.

Thus, even had DOC-EERA presented more substantiated analysis at the adequacy hearing, it would not have cured deficiency of the FEIS itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Notwithstanding its expressed concerns about the lack of analysis in the FEIS of the impact of an oil spill on Lake Superior and its watershed, the commission determined that the FEIS was adequate. We agree with HTE that the commission's decision is, in this regard, arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence. As we note above, an RGU shall determine an EIS adequate if it addresses the potentially significant issues raised in scoping and responds to substantive comments received on the DEIS.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%204410\">\n     Minn.

With respect to Lake Superior and its watershed, this FEIS does neither.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In determining the FEIS adequate, the commission acted in a manner arbitrary and capricious because it failed to consider a critical aspect of the analysis, as directed in the FSDD, and it acted contrary to the substantial evidence because the record reflects that neither the FEIS, nor the responses to comments, addressed the impact of an oil spill on the Lake Superior watershed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     CARD\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8428805\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/713/817/#p826\">\n     713 N.W.2d at 833\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Even considering the deferential standard of review, the failure to specifically address the potential impacts to the Lake Superior watershed renders the finding of adequacy arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence.

As the FEIS explains, however, the impact of any particular spill will depend on multiple variables, many of which are subject to chance. Rather than attempting to predict the consequences of an oil spill from a particular location, the FEIS focuses on analyzing the potential resource impacts of a spill at all locations along the APR and alternatives.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn.

A Section 106 consultation was undertaken for the Line 3 project, but was not complete at the time that the commission determined the FEIS adequate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Relying on federal caselaw, the Bands assert that the FEIS could not be considered adequate until the Section 106 consultation was complete for the APR and all alternative routes considered by the FEIS. But the NHPA does not govern a decision determining the FEIS adequate under MEPA. And, as we note above, MEPA does not require any particular approach to analyzing potential impacts to historic and cultural impacts. Accordingly, we conclude that an EIS may be determined adequate before a federal Section 106 TCP survey is complete if the discussion of potential impacts to historic and cultural impacts is otherwise sufficient.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The FEIS addresses historic and cultural resources in several chapters. Chapter 5 discusses the comparative effects of the project and alternatives on resources, including historic and cultural resources. And Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the comparative effects of route alternatives and route-segment alternatives on resources,\n    including historic and cultural resources. Chapters 5 and 6 cross-reference Chapter 9, which is devoted to \"an alternative, qualitative measure of the impacts of Enbridge's proposed Line 3 Project ... on American Indian Tribes.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The FEIS describes the efforts undertaken to determine impacts to historic and cultural resources of the APR and alternatives, which included obtaining existing data on historic places from the Minnesota Historical Society and reviewing cemetery data from available Geographic Information Systems data. The FEIS also considers archaeological surveys completed by Enbridge for the APR. The FEIS acknowledges the limitations of available data with respect to TCPs, particularly with respect to sacred tribal places, and notes that, although no specific studies of TCPs were complete, \"information gathered from the consultation with American Indian tribes with an interest within the [region of interest] have indicated that TCPs are present.\" The FEIS discusses historic and cultural resources, based on available information, with respect to the APR and each of the project, route, and route-segment alternatives.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In Chapter 9, the FEIS summarizes the tribal consultation undertaken by DOC-EERA in connection with preparing the FEIS, which included community meetings and interviews with tribal elders and historians, through which \"Commerce Department Staff collected information about traditionally important cultural and spiritual sites across Northern Minnesota.\" The FEIS also discusses the spiritual nature of the tribes' relationship with the land, which extends to both reservation land owned by or held in trust for the tribes, and to territory ceded by the tribes pursuant to treaties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Chapter 9 expresses the challenge presented by any attempt to comparatively analyze the potential impacts to the tribes of the APR and alternatives. The FEIS notes that \"[a]ll of the proposed routes and route alternatives cross ceded lands\" and that \"[p]otential impacts to tribal resources associated with the CN alternatives would be similar for those areas that cross reservation or ceded lands.\" On the issue of impacts, Chapter 9 states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    The CN alternatives would have varying levels of quantifiable impacts to tribal resources dependent on their geographic proximity and the construction activities necessary for operation (see Chapters 5 and 10 for a discussion of potential impacts to CN alternatives and those related to releases). The qualitative discussion of impacts to tribal resources, however, would be similar to that presented within Chapter 9 regardless of the CN alternative.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In summarizing overall impacts, Chapter 9 states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    For American Indians, cultural resources cannot be separated from natural resources; therefore, the conclusion is that any pipeline route would affect cultural and natural resources. The degree to which these resources are affected would vary; if quantitative values are assigned, the impacts are direct and localized. If a holistic tribal perspective is used to determine impacts, any pipeline would have direct and permanent effects.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In support of this reasoning, the FEIS recounts an interview with one elder, who, when informed that DOC-EERA was trying to analyze the impacts of each route, \"responded that it could not be done, and the impact could not be isolated or measured-any impact is harmful and equally concerning.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Bands assert that the FEIS is inadequate because it fails to sufficiently analyze the comparative impacts to tribal properties and resources, as required by MEPA. In support of this argument, the Bands rely on a federal district court decision addressing the State Department's issuance of a presidential permit for the Keystone pipeline despite an acknowledgement in the SEIS that 1,038 acres of the pipeline route had not yet been surveyed for cultural resources.\n    <em>\n     Indigenous Envtl.

The Bands argue that the analysis of alternatives is inadequate because it fails to account for existing conditions in the analysis of the impacts of each alternative. In particular, the Bands assert that a table in the executive summary of the FEIS inaccurately represents the risk of exposure of resources along the APR and alternative routes because it does not reflect the extent to which the routes are co-located with existing pipelines-such that there is already some oil-spill risk.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    This argument by the Bands formed the basis for one of the modifications directed by the commission in its order determining the FEIS inadequate as originally submitted. The commission ordered that the FEIS \"need[ed] to clearly identify the extent to which resource impacts of route alternatives in the existing Line 3 corridor\n    are or are not additive-i.e., the extent to which that route alternative would introduce new or additional impacts beyond the impacts of the existing pipelines in that corridor.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    In response to the commission's order, Chapters 5 and 6 were amended to include additional information on co-location of the various routes and to clarify that impacts discussed were incremental. In addition, footnotes were added to tables summarizing comparative impacts, stating that: \"Impacts reported in this EIS are the incremental impacts of the [specified route]\" and that \"[w]here the fact that [that route] is in an existing corridor influences the extent of the incremental impacts, relevant discussion is included in the text of the impacts assessment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Chapter 10 of the EIS was amended to explain that, because the proposed project \"includes both the construction of a new pipeline and the abandonment of an old one,\" the \"extent and type of resources at risk due to an accidental release could change in the old corridor as well as in the new corridor, depending on the route alternative selected.\" The FEIS further explains that, regardless of the route selected, construction of a new pipeline would cause an incremental decrease in risk based on existing Line 3 being removed from service, and an incremental increase in risk based on the new pipeline. If built in the existing Line 3 corridor, the increased incremental risk \"would not cause any notable change in the existing type, number, or geographic distribution of resources exposed, [but] it would perpetuate the existing exposure of these resources.\" If built in a different corridor, it would change \"the type, number, [and/or] geographic distribution of resources exposed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    In its order determining the FEIS adequate, the commission found the added language regarding incremental effects fulfilled the commission's directive for clarification of whether impacts were additive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    On appeal, the Bands assert that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously by reversing its position and failing to respond to comments from other agencies regarding the revisions to the initial FEIS. We find both arguments unpersuasive. As to the first argument, the commission does not appear to have changed its position. It sought clarification on whether impacts being assessed were additive, and it subsequently was satisfied that it had received that clarification. As to the second argument, it ultimately was the commission's responsibility to determine whether the revised FEIS was adequate. The MPCA and DNR expressed reservations about whether the revisions were sufficient to fulfill the commission's directive in requiring supplementation. The commission-which issued the directive-determined that the revisions were sufficient. Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from those in which an agency has acted arbitrarily by failing to consider the opinions of sister agencies.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Trout Unlimited, Inc. v.

As the FEIS explains, the impact of any particular spill will depend on many variables, including \"weather, time of year, water levels, human error, and even what type of wildlife is present.\" Considering these unpredictable factors, the FEIS does not present an encyclopedic report on the impact of every conceivable oil spill that could occur. Instead, it \"provides a general assessment of the probability of a spill occurring, a general evaluation of the behavior of crude oil in the environment, a general evaluation of how spilled oil affects the environment, and an assessment of the type and quantity of resources that are exposed along each alternative.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    During oral argument, when asked how the FEIS was inadequate in addressing the Lake Superior watershed, relator Friends of the Headwaters (FOH) responded that there was no information projecting the quantity of oil that could reach Lake Superior or the specific impact on the natural resources. The fact remains that it is impossible to model every possible impact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    As the DOC-EERA explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    The specific impacts of large oil releases are highly dependent on incident-specific factors that are impossible to predict with certainty. For example, as the commenter notes, the largest ever inland spill in Grand Rapids did not produce the damages a model may have suggested from a spill of its magnitude because incident-specific conditions happened\n    to include ice cover on the Prairie River.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n    One purpose of the EIS is to provide decision makers with relevant information for their decision. Detailed modeling of site/situation specific environmental damages is so incident-specific, it does not provide decision makers with particularly actionable information about which alternative is environmentally preferable.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n    In fact, this sort of impact modeling is likely to provide a false level of precision that is counterproductive. The modeling approach used in the EIS is intended to provide information relevant to a reasoned choice among the alternatives by focusing on several components of spill risk that can be considered to develop a broader understanding of the risks and tradeoffs of different routes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Forecasting impacts at any particular location would require the FEIS to predict each of these unpredictable variables, or to analyze all of the potential permutations. I would conclude, and the record supports, that the FEIS reasonably took another approach.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Minn.

The ALJ stated,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n    Enbridge commissioned a modeling analysis of hypothetical crude oil releases on behalf of, and with input from, DOC-EERA, DNR, and MPCA. The analysis modeled the impacts following seven different hypothetical crude oil releases.

The oil spill scenarios were set at different locations along the Applicant's Preferred Route and route alternatives.

Further the DOC-EERA commissioned a study from a private consulting firm, Ecology and Environment, Inc., to conduct an analysis of previous oil spills. In an effort to \"quantify the incremental risk for the Line 3 Project,\" the report provided \"an overview of pipeline spill rates and trends in the inland [United States] as a whole, as well as an analysis of historical data for existing crude oil pipelines in Minnesota.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    ... Drawing upon these materials, and other items, the FEIS analyzed the\n    relationship between the volume of oil that would be transported by the project in relation to the risk of later spills and still broader \"cumulative potential effects.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    ... Among the findings made in the FEIS were:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    (a) The average volume of pipeline spills has decreased significantly since the late 1960s, and particularly in the last dozen years. The average spill volume (all oil types) is now less than 50 percent of the average volume 10 years ago, and 12 percent of the volume in the late 1960s.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    (b) Overall, half of the pipeline spills that do occur would be expected to involve 1 barrel of oil or less. About 90 percent would involve 100 barrels or less. Only 5 percent would be expected to be 400 barrels or more, and only 1 percent would be expected to be 2,500 barrels or more.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n    (c) The rate of spillage in Minnesota has been lower than that in the U.S. as a whole, accounting for pipeline mileage and amount transmitted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n    (d) DOC-EERA estimated that the volumes of spillage in the seven hypothetical Line 3 spill scenarios-ranging from 8,625 barrels to 16,239 barrels-might be expected once in 26 to 99 years somewhere in the state of Minnesota.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    ... [FOH] maintains that the FEIS is inadequate because the spill analyses did not include an assessment of a hypothetical discharge of oil into the headwaters of the Mississippi, or other [High Consequence Areas] in Itasca and Hubbard counties. It argues:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    Before approving or rejecting this pipeline proposal, the public and the [commission] reasonably want to know what would happen if a Kalamazoo-type spill occurred near the Mississippi headwaters, in the wetlands and wild rice habitat north of Itasca State Park, in the central sands area with its vulnerable aquifers and already-compromised drinking water supplies, into the Straight River, a nationally recognized trout stream, and in other sensitive areas along the route.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n    ... The Administrative Law Judge does not agree that the FEIS is inadequate without the specific modeling sought by [FOH]. The regulatory guidance in this area suggests that if the agency's assessments are broadly representative of the spill impacts likely to be encountered along the pipeline route those evaluations are adequate;\n    <em>\n     even if interested persons would have preferred other, particular areas to have been studied by the government.\n    </em>\n    Measured by this standard, the pyramiding analyses undertaken by the DOC-EERA and its consultants are adequate to inform the [c]ommission of the potential impacts from an accidental discharge of crude oil.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Specifically, the FEIS devotes significant attention to analyzing the potential resource impacts of a spill at locations along the Applicant's Preferred Route (APR) and alternatives. Section 10.3.4 explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    The representative sites were selected to favor circumstances that would tend to exacerbate potential impacts and effects of the hypothetical spills along the Line 3 pipeline. In all likelihood, a spill of equivalent volume as the hypothetical scenarios that occurred at another location and time would have an outcome that would be of lesser consequences, or, at most similar consequences to one of the representative scenarios.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Section 10.4.2 of the FEIS discusses resources subject to exposure for the APR and alternatives. The FEIS states that, \"For this analysis, ROIs [regions of interest] for potential releases were identified ... to reflect the potential extent of a large-volume incident that could occur\n    <em>\n     at any point along each route.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.) Thus, although the FEIS does not model the expected spread of a spill at all locations, it does assess the resources that potentially would be impacted by a spill along the entire APR and alternatives. This discussion encompasses the Lake Superior watershed because the Superior terminal is the endpoint for existing Line 3 and all but one of the alternatives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Additionally, during the commission hearing, there was discussion about why Lake Superior was not modeled. When asked by a commissioner why the modeling did not include the Lake Superior watershed as one of the representative sites, a representative for DOC-EERA, which drafted the FEIS, explained that the interagency team chose those seven sites to get a \"full range of different kinds of conditions.\" These seven sites were selected to encompass \"things like stream morphology and eco region and flow\" so that they could be \"vignettes\" for what a spill may look like at other locations including Lake Superior. DOC-EERA also explained that conducting a model in Duluth would not provide much information \"in terms of informing a decision about what the commission can effect\" or how the decision would \"change the risk profile\" because of the six pipelines that currently cross there. Although this explanation did not appear in the FEIS, it is in the record, which we must review in its entirety.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014.69\">\n     Minn.

Specifically, in section II.B., the majority concluded that it was reasonable for the FEIS to focus \"on analyzing the potential resource impacts of a spill\n    <em>\n     at all locations along the APR and alternatives\n    </em>\n    \", \"[r]ather than attempting to predict the consequences of an oil spill at a particular location\" because \"the impact of any particular spill will depend on multiple variables, many of which are subject to chance.\" (Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, in section II.A., the majority still concluded that the FEIS needed to \"address[ ] the impact of an oil spill\n    <em>\n     on the Lake Superior watershed\n    </em>\n    \" because the scoping document committed the EIS to \"consider potential impacts to the Lake Superior watershed.\" (Emphasis added.) I am at a loss to understand this distinction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    But as the majority concedes, the modeling approach used in the FEIS considered the impact of a spill at all locations along the APR and alternatives, and the Lake Superior watershed\n    <em>\n     is\n    </em>\n    a location along the APR. And yet still the majority holds it was arbitrary and capricious for the commission to approve the FEIS because it does not specifically analyze issues raised in scoping and does not respond to comments received. But\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20R.%204410\">\n     Minn. R. 4410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .2800 does not state that issues must be addressed \"specifically\" and the FEIS did address the concerns about the Lake Superior watershed. The FEIS simply addressed\n    it in a manner different from how HTE wanted. But as an appellate court, we cannot substitute our own judgment for the judgment of the DOC-EERA, DNR, MPCA, the experts tasked with drafting the FEIS, and finally the commission when that judgment is reasonable and supported by the record. This is not was our standard of review dictates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    I also have concerns that our decision today will have the further unintended consequence of delaying the replacement of Line 3, which could pose a serious threat to our environment including Lake Superior. Existing Line 3 has been in operation since the 1960s, has suffered a high amount of corrosion and long-seam cracking, and must be replaced under a consent decree between Enbridge and the Environmental Protection Agency and Coast Guard.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    In conclusion, by according substantial deference to the commission's decision as required by precedent, I would affirm the commission's decision that the FEIS is adequate because the representative-modeling approach sufficiently considers \"potential impacts to the Lake Superior watershed\" as required by the FSDD and the record reflects a reasoned determination of why that approach was used. Therefore, the commission's decision is not arbitrary or capricious and is supported by the record. Consequently, I must dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-188\">\n     This specific finding was modified by the commission.
