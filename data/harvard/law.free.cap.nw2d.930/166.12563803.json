The case was remanded for additional findings of fact on whether T.A.G. was likely to re-offend and had serious difficulty controlling behavior based on the following language from the initial order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Dr. Fox's report and testimony indicate that the Respondent has serious difficulty in controlling his behavior while at the State Hospital. The Respondent has had behavioral issues while in the State Hospital. The Respondent has not completed all levels of treatment as he has a cyclical pattern of making progress in treatment and then slipping backwards in the program. Dr. Fox indicated that based on the Respondent's\n   history of sexual predatory conduct and non-sexual offenses, his history of psychopathy, drug dependence, and his sexual preoccupation make it likely that the Respondent would have serious difficulty controlling his behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The Respondent testified that he had completed treatment and one of the behavioral write-ups noted by Dr. Fox, which included a statement about 'cream pie' that was interpreted as a sexual comment, was in accurate [sic]. He testified that he did not say what was reported and there was no sexual innuendo in what he did say. However, the Court noted that there were approximately thirty (30) pages of Dr. Fox's report that included behavior issues noted of the Respondent at the State Hospital. The behavior write-ups and treatment notes show the Respondent has serious difficulty controlling his sexual and other behaviors in a controlled setting at the State Hospital.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] On remand, the district court made additional findings that met the third prong that T.A.G. is likely to re-offend. Evidence supports the finding T.A.G.'s diagnosis impairs his ability to appreciate the consequences of his criminal behavior and he fails to recognize the harm he causes to his victims. The findings addressed specific risk factors on T.A.G.'s likelihood to re-offend, including the number of sexual offenses, the diversity and escalation of his offenses including both non-contact and contact type, and the attitude towards his offenses, including T.A.G.'s belief it is natural for thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls to have sex based on information he read in the Bible. The additional findings analyzed the test scores provided by the psychologist and compared the results with similar inmates with the same characteristics. The district court did not clearly err in finding T.A.G. is likely to re-offend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] Regarding the\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   due process requirement and T.A.G.'s difficulty controlling his behavior, the additional findings of fact address testimony and reports of the psychologist that while T.A.G. engages in treatment to a higher degree in recent months, he has not excelled and continues to have problems in his progress over the review period:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"While progress in treatment can be a protective factor that may impact risk of sexual recidivism, [the psychologist] indicated that due to [T.A.G.'s] diagnosis and risk factors, a longer and sustained period of time is needed for him to develop and sustain the skills necessary to control his behavior in the community. The court finds that the progress is insufficient to effectively reduce his risk below 'likely to reoffend.' [The psychologist] noted that the progress in treatment by [T.A.G.] is tempered by his failure to accept responsibility for his actions; and his lack of impulse control, along with inappropriate statements and actions to staff in the highly restricted environment of the State Hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[T.A.G.] continues to have behavioral issues, has not completed all levels of treatment and he has a cyclical pattern of making progress and then slipping backwards in the program. [The psychologist's] [e]valuation [u]pdate indicated [T.A.G.] was back on Level 1, the lowest level at the State Hospital. As such, [T.A.G.] has not progressed in treatment to lessen his degree of risk and has demonstrated he continues to have difficulty following the rules. Combined with his history of predatory conduct and other offenses, his history of psychopathy, drug dependence, and his sexual preoccupation, this causes the [c]ourt to find him to have serious difficulty controlling his behavior if he were released from the State Hospital.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b610] The original and additional findings provide insufficient evidence to support a finding T.A.G. has serious difficulty controlling his behavior in a way that distinguishes him from a \"dangerous but typical recidivist in the ordinary criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20ND%2067\">\n    2019 ND 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12560790\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/924/112/\">\n    924 N.W.2d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lack of progress within treatment may indicate serious difficulty controlling behavior, but one does not equal the other.\n   <em>\n    In re Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817183\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/25/\">\n    2016 ND 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817183\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/25/\">\n    876 N.W.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lack of progress in treatment alone is insufficient to determine an individual has serious difficulty controlling personal behavior, and specific findings are required to meet the\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817183\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/876/25/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b611] Both the original and additional findings address \"behavioral issues\" but specific findings do not exist beyond one statement regarding a \"cream pie.\" The additional findings rely on T.A.G.'s lack of progress within treatment as evidence of serious difficulty controlling behavior; however, T.A.G.'s cyclical pattern of making progress and slipping backward was included as a factor in the original order. The additional findings of fact reference a March 2018 update to the June 2017 annual evaluation, but only regarding T.A.G.'s progress in treatment. The additional findings did not include further findings of fact supporting T.A.G.'s serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The status in treatment and one statement regarding \"cream pie\" do not establish a serious difficulty controlling behavior sufficient to satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   due process requirement. Therefore, the finding that T.A.G. is a sexually dangerous individual is clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b612] The order denying T.A.G.'s petition for discharge is reversed and T.A.G. shall be released from civil commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Daniel J.
