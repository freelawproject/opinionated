Introduction.\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-6\">\n  This appeal of a conviction for aiding and abetting a bank robbery requires us to consider the defendant's rights to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 under the Iowa Constitution, as well as the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the defendant's conviction. The defendant, an African-American, was convicted following a jury trial in North Lee County. His jury contained no African-Americans. Nor were there any African-Americans in the jury venire that reported that day. The defendant, relying on our recent decision in\n  <em>\n   State v. Plain\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12336388\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/898/801/\">\n   898 N.W.2d 801\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (Iowa 2017), attempted to establish a violation of his constitutional rights by presenting documentary evidence and testimony regarding jury pools in North Lee County and jury management practices followed in North Lee County and the Iowa Judicial Branch as a whole. The district court concluded that his effort fell short.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  On our review, we reject the defendant's challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. However, because we have made further elaboration and refinement of our analysis in\n  <em>\n   Plain\n  </em>\n  , we conditionally affirm and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts and Procedural Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At approximately 10:11 a.m. on June 29, 2016, the Fort Madison Police Department received a 911 call reporting an apparent robbery in progress at the Fort Madison Bank and Trust. The caller, Joseph Hardin, had been waiting to cash a check at the bank's drive-through window. A man exited from the car in front of him and entered the bank with a mask pulled over his face. Hardin then heard what sounded like a gunshot, and a bank employee waved at Hardin to drive away. While on the phone with the police, Hardin recounted details about the passenger who had stepped out of the car and entered the bank, but he could neither identify the car's driver nor remember any specifics about the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Within minutes, police arrived at the bank. The robber, later identified as Lafayette Antonio Evans, spotted one of the police cars. He ran out of the bank through the back exit with a haul of cash in a zip-tie bag. Following a police chase and an exchange of gunfire, Evans was fatally shot. Investigators found a mask, a semiautomatic handgun, and a hand-held radio on Evans's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant, Lilly, was the uncle of Evans's wife. Before the robbery, Lilly's wife had received a money order from Evans's mother. According to a witness present at the bank, a Suburban-type vehicle had dropped off Evans at the bank. This witness noticed a black fan had been\n   clipped to the rear-view mirror of the Suburban. She also observed that the driver was a large African-American man, a general description that fit Lilly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After seeing a Suburban parked outside of Lilly's home, the police executed a search warrant on the vehicle on July 7. A black fan was found in Lilly's Suburban along with a citizens band (CB) radio capable of communicating with the hand-held radio recovered from Evans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When investigators interviewed Lilly, he stated that Evans had been staying with him until leaving his residence the night before the robbery. Lilly also claimed to have slept until about 10:30 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. the morning of the robbery on June 29, and then run some errands by himself and driven to Rockford, Illinois. Lilly added that Evans had free use of Lilly's vehicle while staying with Lilly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Video surveillance from local businesses disproved Lilly's account of his whereabouts on June 29. It established that Lilly had been at a convenience store in town at 8:39 a.m., at a hardware store in town at 9:23 a.m., and at a McDonald's near the bank at 10:14 a.m., just minutes after the 911 call reporting the robbery. Lilly also had on his person a receipt for buying a drink at the McDonald's with a 10:15 a.m. imprint. In addition, the convenience store video showed a passenger in the Suburban who was wearing a white shirt, the same color as the shirt that Evans wore when he committed the robbery later that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Lilly was arrested on October 26 and charged in the North Lee County District Court with aiding and abetting first-degree robbery under Iowa Code sections 703.1, 711.1, and 711.2. He entered a plea of not guilty on November 18. On September 14, 2017, Lilly, an African-American, filed a motion challenging the jury pool as not a fair cross section of the community. He pointed out that no one who answered a jury questionnaire for that pool identified himself or herself as African-American. All but three who disclosed their race responded that they were \"White\" or \"Caucasian,\" and of those three, one self-identified as \"Asian,\" one as \"Other,\" and the third as \"White/Black.\" Lilly also noted that according to the 2013 United States census, 3.2% of the Lee County population was African-American. The court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Lilly's challenge, receiving testimony from Dawn Willson, a judicial specialist responsible for picking the names for jury service in North Lee County, and Mark Headlee, the information technology director for the Iowa Judicial Branch. The court also received exhibits, including the last five years of \"race reports\" from North Lee County jury pools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 25, the court denied Lilly's motion. It concluded that \"the defendant has failed to establish ... that any underrepresentation of African-Americans on the list is due to a systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.\" Jury selection began the following day, and no African-American jurors were seated in the jury of six men and six women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its initial jury instructions before opening statements, the district court gave the following instruction on implicit bias:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Reach your verdict without discrimination. In reaching your verdict, you must not consider the defendant's race, color, religious beliefs, national origin or sex. You are not to return a verdict for or against the defendant unless you would return the same verdict without regard to his race, color, religious beliefs, national origin or sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the State finished its case-in-chief, Lilly moved for a judgment of acquittal. The court denied the motion. Lilly renewed his motion for acquittal at the close of evidence, which the court again denied. The court gave the same implicit-bias instruction in its final instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 29, the jury found Lilly guilty of robbery in the first-degree. On November 22, the court denied Lilly's motion for new trial and sentenced him to twenty-five years in prison subject to a 70% mandatory minimum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20902.9\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 902.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ), .12(1)(\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   ) (2016). Lilly appealed, and we retained the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, Lilly contends the racial composition of the jury pool violated his rights to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution. He contends the evidence was insufficient that he aided and abetted Evans in the robbery of the bank. He also contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to move for a judgment of acquittal as to first-degree robbery based on the lack of evidence that he knew a firearm would be used in the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Analysis.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Composition of the Jury Pool.\n   </strong>\n   Lilly, an African-American, challenges the composition of the jury pool in North Lee County from which his jury was selected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the jurors who heard his case was\n   African-American. Of the pool from which his jury was selected, one person marked \"Other\" on the questionnaire, one marked \"Asian,\" and one marked \"White/Black.\" None of them, however, were part of the venire from which Lilly's jury was chosen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before trial, a hearing was held in which Lilly was given the opportunity to show that African-Americans were being systematically underrepresented in North Lee County jury pools. Lilly presented \"race reports\" for the last five years of jury pools from late 2012 to late 2017 in North Lee County. The reports showed that on the approximately 2789 questionnaires returned during the last five years, only fourteen potential jurors self-reported as being African-American. Approximately 30% of respondents did not disclose their race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2013, Lee County had a 3.2% African-American population; in 2016, that figure was 3%. No statistics were presented regarding North Lee County. The State noted below, and reiterates here, that the African-American population in Iowa is, on average, younger than the overall population. It estimates that 75.83% of Iowans are eighteen years or older, and thus eligible to be jurors, whereas only 65.4% of African-American Iowans are eighteen or older.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Duren/Plain framework.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, if absolute disparity is set at 10% and the minority group is less than 10% of the relevant population, the defendant would never be able to meet the absolute disparity test, even if the system for selection of jury pools were biased against that minority group.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Comparative disparity is calculated by dividing the absolute disparity by the percentage of the population represented by the group in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We criticized that test because \"it can overstate underrepresentation for groups with a small population percentage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, if\n   a pool of 100 jurors contains two members of a minority group but the percentage of members of that minority group in the relevant community is 3%, this translates into a comparative disparity of 33 1/3%, even though this result would be a relatively common outcome of a random process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The final test, standard deviation, uses accepted statistical methods to determine the likelihood that a disparity between the minority percentage in the pool and in the population is the result of something\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   chance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   These statistical methods are commonly used in employment discrimination cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pippen v.

The evidence at the hearing disclosed that jury managers for all jury panels chosen in the state of Iowa use a system created by the judicial branch under the direction of the State Court Administrator. The decision has been made by the State Court Administrator that those jury managers are only able to access lists created from voter registration lists supplied by the Iowa Secretary of State and driver's license and DOT identification lists supplied by the Iowa Department of Transportation.

Given that 79.1% of the population is Mexican-American, the expected number of Mexican-Americans among the 870 persons summoned to serve as grand jurors over the 11-year period is approximately 688. The observed number is 339. Of course, in any given drawing some fluctuation from the expected number is predicted. The important point, however, is that the statistical model shows that the results of a random drawing are likely to fall in the vicinity of the expected value. The measure of the predicted fluctuations from the expected value is the standard deviation, defined for the binomial distribution as the square root of the product of the total number in the sample (here 870) times the probability of selecting a Mexican-American (0.791) times the\n   probability of selecting a non-Mexican-American (0.209). Thus, in this case the standard deviation is approximately 12. As a general rule for such large samples, if the difference between the expected value and the observed number is greater than two or three standard deviations, then the hypothesis that the jury drawing was random would be suspect to a social scientist. The 11-year data here reflect a difference between the expected and observed number of Mexican-Americans of approximately 29 standard deviations.

On our review, we conclude the threshold should be one standard deviation-in other words, the percentage of the group in the jury pool must be one standard deviation or more below its percentage in the overall population of eligible jurors. As we understand it, when the variance is one standard deviation, there remains a 32% probability that we are seeing a random event. But if we are looking in only one direction, as we are in these cases, the probability would be 16% that the departure is a random event and 84% that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although one standard deviation is less than the two standard deviations customarily employed to measure statistical significance, we think this lower threshold can be justified.

We agree with this concept as well, while sharing the NAACP's view that this \"is not a matter for hasty determination\" but for \"carefully developed\" proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This proof can be developed on remand. For example, although we know that the Iowa State Penitentiary is located in Fort Madison, we do not know how the presence of the prison affects the baseline percentage of African-Americans in the eligible juror population. Rather than engage in our own research, we should allow the parties to present evidence.

We are not persuaded. It is unfair to restrict the defendant to the current jury pool that may have as few as seventy-five persons, and then at the same time require the defendant to furnish results that have a certain degree of statistical significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Evans had been staying with Lilly. An eyewitness at the bank said the driver was \"a larger black man who kind of filled the seat.\" Lilly is six feet, six inches tall and weighs 285 pounds. The car was identified as a Suburban-type vehicle, the same type of car as Lilly's, and it had a black fan, as did Lilly's. It is true that the color of Lilly's vehicle did not match that in either of the eyewitness descriptions (which in turn differed from each other in their recollection of the vehicle's color). Yet video shows Lilly in his vehicle purchasing a soda at a nearby McDonald's shortly after the robbery. Furthermore, Lilly initially told investigators that he had been asleep at home when the robbery occurred. This was false. Video later showed that he had been driving in his vehicle to a convenience store and a hardware store prior to the robbery and that he had a passenger with him. Lilly also had a CB radio in his Suburban capable of communicating with Evans's hand-held radio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Substantial evidence that Lilly knew Evans intended to rob the bank.\n   </em>\n   We also believe there is substantial evidence that Lilly was aware Evans intended to rob the bank. Evans had a mask around his neck before entering the bank. Hardin's wife, who was in the car with him, remarked that Evans was \"probably going to rob the bank.\" Evans pulled the mask over his face upon entering the bank. Evans was also wearing gloves and tape on his hands to cover distinguishing tattoos. There is no evidence showing Evans putting on the\n   gloves or applying the tape inside or outside the bank. Thus, a jury could infer he was wearing them while still in the vehicle, even though it was late June. Moreover, Evans used a zip-tie bag to carry the stolen money from the robbery. Witnesses testified to seeing Evans carrying a cinch-bag when he exited the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\n   </strong>\n   Lilly argues his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for acquittal specifically on\n   <em>\n    first-degree\n   </em>\n   robbery because there was insufficient evidence Lilly knew Evans was going to use a dangerous weapon during the robbery. We have said that \"no reasonable trial strategy could permit a jury to consider a crime not supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

That is not the case here. The older cases are different in kind, not in degree. The extraction of a mathematical proportionality principle from the older cases misses the larger context in which the cases were decided and elevates logic over experience. As former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   The legal profession, like many another, tends to become over-professionalized. We forget that law is the rule for simple and untaught people to live by. We complicate and over-refine it as a weapon in legal combat until we take it off the ground where people live and into the thin atmosphere of sheer fiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Robert H. Jackson,\n   <em>\n    The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy: A Study of a Crisis in American Power Politics\n   </em>\n   292 (1949).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Justice Jackson's constitutional fiction is demonstrated on the facts of this case. Here, the majority notes the African-American population for Lee County was 3% at the relevant time. Assume there was a jury pool of one hundred persons and three African-Americans were in the jury pool. In that case, the majority concedes that \"[a] defendant whose jury pool has a percentage of the distinctive group at least as large as the percentage of that group in the jury-eligible population has not had his or her right to a fair cross section infringed.\" In other words, the claim fails as a matter of law. However, if only two African-Americans were in the same jury pool, under the majority's rule, the defendant would be entitled to significant discovery regarding the history of jury pools in the county. It seems wholly arbitrary to conclude the constitutional right to an impartial jury turns on whether a single additional member of a distinctive group out of one hundred potential jurors appears for jury service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The constitutional text, the relevant history, and the context in which the relevant precedents were decided all militate against the majority's rule. In my view, to the extent we are going to go down this constitutional road, an appreciation of the prior evils our precedents sought to address counsels in favor of maintaining the absolute disparity test as a threshold test to differentiate cases presenting stark, palpable, and easily observed exclusion from cases that raise only questions about the limits of our analysis and the limits of our data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The defendant's proposed constitutional calculus suffers from another complication. While mathematical precision sounds promising in theory, it is problematic in practice. The constitutional calculus assumes the existence of reliable data that can be plugged into the legal equation. However, there is no such data. The lack of reliable data makes this constitutional endeavor largely guesswork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The record in this case demonstrates the unworkability of the rule in application. The majority cites no census data regarding the jury-eligible population in Lee County. The majority cites no census data regarding the African-American jury-eligible population in Lee County. Instead of relying on census data, the majority relies on the State's estimate that 75.83% of Iowans are eighteen years or older and the State's estimate that 65.4% of African-American Iowans are eighteen or older. The State's estimate is based on a dubious assumption regarding the flat distribution of the population across the relevant age ranges. The State's estimate is based on a further dubious assumption that state-level data regarding the age distribution for the population of Iowa as a whole is uniform from county to county. It is patently obvious the assumptions do not hold. In this particular case, the data is especially suspect. As the majority acknowledges, it is working with county-level data for Lee County. Unfortunately, Lee County is divided into two districts-North Lee County and South Lee County. There is no census information in the record regarding the jury-eligible population of North Lee County. The majority assumes an equal distribution of races between the two districts. There is no evidence of this. Quite simply, the defendant requests, and the majority adopts, a rule that requires proportionality to a largely indeterminate comparison population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In addition to the problems inherent in determining the jury-eligible population in all cases, there is an additional problem in the data presented in this case. There is no record establishing the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool. The record reflects 125 jury questionnaires were sent out, but there is no evidence in this record showing how many of those were returned. Of those returned, one juror identified herself as African-American, but many others did not identify any race. Without knowing the number of people in the pool and the races of the persons who failed to identify, it is simply guesswork to determine whether this particular pool was even underrepresentative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It was the defendant's burden to establish a prima facie case, and he failed to do so. There is thus no reason to remand the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The majority's rule is also impractical and burdensome.

No large group of people can be conscripted to serve on juries nationwide, any more than in armies, without the use of broad general classifications which may not fit in every case the purpose for which the classification was designed.

Of particular note, the majority's approach will increase the pressure to transfer venue of criminal cases with African-American defendants to urban counties to find more jury-eligible minorities. Such transfers burden already overcrowded city dockets and increase the inconvenience to the parties, victims, other witnesses, and community members who want to observe the trial. These out-of-district transfers also increase costs for the judicial branch by requiring additional travel for judges and court reporters. For the protection of the defendant, criminal cases should be tried in the county where the alleged crimes occurred, unless pretrial publicity requires a change in venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is the judicial branch's obligation to interpret and apply the constitution to the facts of a particular case. It is also our special charge to continuously work to improve the administration of justice in this state. Where, as here, however, the constitutional rule is of dubious provenance and without any identifiable benefit to the fair and impartial administration of justice, the administrative burden is and should be a consideration when extending a rule that will have significant impact in the day-to-day operation of the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Finally, remand is not necessary because Lilly's claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   First, the representation of the distinctive group in the jury pool (to the extent that can be determined) was fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. The census data shows approximately 34,000 people resided in Lee County during the relevant time. Of those, 3%, or approximately 1020 were African-American, meaning the non-African-American population was 32,980. Using the majority's estimates of eligible jurors (75.83% for all Iowans and 65.4% of African-American Iowans), there were approximately 25,008 non-African-American eligible jurors and 667 African-American eligible jurors. However, of those African-Americans eighteen years of age or older, approximately 300 were incarcerated at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison. This is consistent with historical census information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rose Heyer &amp; Peter Wagner,\n   <em>\n    Too Big to Ignore: How Counting People in Prisons Distorted Census 2000\n   </em>\n   , Prison Policy Initiative (April 2004) [hereinafter Heyer &amp; Wagner], https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/toobig/datasearch.php?field=GEO_NAME\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   &amp; operator=LIKE &amp; q=lee &amp; Submit=Search &amp; field1=Inc_Pop_Black &amp; operator1= &amp; q1= &amp; sortby= &amp; sortorder= [https://perma.cc/7DGC-CT3Y] (containing data set showing 27.67% of the African-American population in Lee County in 2000 was incarcerated). The parties agree the census counts prisoners in its census data and the prisoners should be excluded from determining the jury-eligible population. Removing incarcerated persons from the calculation, using the State's and majority's assumed statistics regarding the number of eligible jurors, shows the number of jury-eligible African-Americans in the county was actually only 367, or 1.4%. At least one of the jurors identified as African-American. In my opinion, when the jury-eligible population is adjusted for the incarcerated persons at Fort Madison, the jury pool here was \"fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Duren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n    439 U.S. at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n    99 S.

On this, everyone agrees. The other branches of the government have already enacted legislation to that effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Iowa Code \u00a7 607A.1 (2017) (\"It is the policy of this state that all persons be selected at random from a fair cross section of the population of the area served by the court, and that a person shall have both the opportunity in accordance with the provisions of law to be considered for jury service in this state\n   and the obligation to serve as a juror when selected.\"). In my experience, our state court administration, district court judges, district court clerks, and jury managers have acted in good faith to implement the statutory command for full civic participation in jury service. Justice Wiggins recently chaired a commission tasked with identifying ways to increase minority representation in jury pools. Such efforts can and should continue. Ultimately, however, there is a legal distinction between constitutional command and best practices; the constitution does not require we micromanage the significant advances already made in jury representation and those yet to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   For these reasons, and for the reasons stated in my separate opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.
