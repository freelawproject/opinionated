Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   This double homicide case presents important questions concerning a defendant's right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community, as well as a number of other trial-related issues. The defendant, an African-American, was charged with committing two murders in Cerro Gordo County and attempting to commit a third. Because of pretrial publicity he asked for a change of venue, and the trial was moved to Webster County. Although the Webster County jury venire contained five African-Americans, no African-American was seated on the jury that actually heard the defendant's case. The State exercised a peremptory strike on the last remaining African-American on the panel because the State's lead prosecutor in this case had also prosecuted her father successfully for murder. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   On appeal, we affirm the district court's ruling that there was no\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation in the striking of the juror.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also reject the defendant's claims of a speedy trial violation, prosecutorial error, evidentiary error, lack of competence to stand trial, and insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions. However, we believe further consideration of the defendant's fair-cross-section claim is warranted in light of the decision we are filing today in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12563868\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/930/293/\">\n    930 N.W.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202236099\">\n    2019 WL 2236099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Iowa 2019). Therefore, we conditionally affirm while remanding for further proceedings consistent with\n   <em>\n    Lilly\n   </em>\n   and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At about 2:00 a.m. on November 17, 2016, Mason City police officer Jennifer Barr was on patrol when she received a call from the dispatcher. An individual named Ron Willis, calling from outside Caleb Christensen's house, reported that Peter Veal had shot Willis's cousin and hit Willis on the head with a pistol. While en route to the location identified by the dispatcher, Officer Barr saw Veal walking in her direction. Veal was wearing a \"light green coat,\" jeans, and a hat. Veal stopped when Officer Barr began to pull her patrol vehicle over. As soon as Officer Barr directed her spotlight toward Veal and made eye contact with him, he took off running. Officer Barr tried to pursue Veal but was unable to locate him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When Veal was subsequently apprehended, he was shirtless and hatless, and it was apparent that his hands and jeans were very bloody. Veal also had mist drops of blood on his face. Veal had a cut on his hand, which he claimed to have received from jumping a fence, although the cut was on the top-not the bottom-of his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meanwhile, at Christensen's house, two people were dead. Melinda Kavars, Willis's cousin, was dead from a single gunshot wound. Christensen had been stabbed to death as a result of multiple knife wounds. The semiautomatic handgun used to kill Kavars was found at the scene with a jammed cartridge inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The police spotted Willis outside Christensen's house. He was shaking, sobbing, and crying. He informed police that Veal had shot Kavars and had tried to shoot him but the gun had malfunctioned. Willis explained that he had run out of the house. He expressed concern for the fate of Christensen. Willis had a cut on the top of his head where he said Veal had struck him with the gun.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-337\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Batson v. Kentucky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     476 U.S. 79\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n     106 S.

Along the trail, police found several items discarded by Veal-a hat, a cellphone, a green jacket, a shirt, and a folding knife.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    A footprint analysis confirmed that the bloody footprints in the house matched the shoes Veal had been wearing. There was no trace or trail of blood out the door where Willis had exited.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    DNA analysis confirmed the presence of Christensen's blood on Veal's discarded knife and shirt. Christensen's blood was also found on the jeans and shoes Veal was still wearing when apprehended. Veal's shirt, jeans, and shoes also contained evidence of his own blood.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    An analysis of the gun determined that Willis's skin tissue was on the back of the slide. This was consistent with Willis's claim that Veal had struck Willis with the gun after it jammed when Veal tried to shoot Willis. The gun also had DNA from an unknown contributor on the textured portion of the pistol grip, but the sample was too weak to determine the source of the DNA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Willis knew both Veal and Christensen. Willis later testified that on November 16, at around 7:00 p.m., Willis received a call from Veal, who wanted to hang out. Willis picked up Veal and bought beer from a liquor store before the two of them arrived at Christensen's home at around 8:00 or 8:30 p.m. Willis introduced Veal to Christensen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Later, Willis and Veal left and went over to Kavars's home. As noted, Kavars was Willis's cousin. She had invited Willis over for an early Thanksgiving dinner. Willis introduced Veal to Kavars. While at Kavars's house, Veal cut two lines of methamphetamine with a pocket knife. Kavars and Veal inhaled methamphetamine through a straw, and Willis smoked marijuana. After about forty minutes, the three of them went over to Christensen's house. They likely arrived after midnight.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    At Christensen's house, the four of them socialized in the living room. Willis and Veal drank beer, Kavars drank Vodka, and Christensen drank whiskey. Veal indicated at some point that he was not feeling well. Willis told him to go outside and get some fresh air. Veal left for about ten or fifteen minutes. When he came back in, he sat down briefly, but then he got back up and went to the bathroom.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Shortly thereafter, Veal returned from the bathroom and sat down. Willis and Kavars were talking and laughing when suddenly Willis saw Veal abruptly rise from his seat and shoot Kavars in the throat with a pistol. Willis could not see the location from which Veal had obtained the gun. Willis observed blood coming from Kavars's throat, and he watched her take her final breaths.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Veal then turned the pistol on Willis. Willis pled with him not to shoot. \"I got kids, Peter,\" he told him. Veal attempted to fire but the gun jammed. Veal hit Willis on the right side of the head with the pistol.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    As this was happening, Christensen was frozen on the couch. Willis saw Veal trying to get the jammed round out of the pistol, and Willis started running, believing Christensen would be following him. By the time Willis reached the side exterior door in the kitchen, the place was dark because the only lamp being used in the house had gone out. Willis managed to unlock the door in the dark and exit the house. The last thing he heard Christensen say as he was departing was, \"What the f___ are you doing?\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Once out of the home, Willis ran across the street and called 911. Willis later saw\n    Veal leave the house and run south. Willis remained across the street and called some friends who arrived and helped calm him down. When the police came, Willis remained at the scene. He gave the police permission to search his vehicle, and he agreed to go to the police station to make a statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    On November 23, the State filed a trial information in the Iowa District Court for Cerro Gordo County charging Veal with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Kavars and Christensen and one count of attempted murder with respect to Willis.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20707.1\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7\u00a7 707.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , .2(1)(\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    ), .11 (2017). Because of the publicity surrounding the case, Veal sought a change of venue, and the trial was moved to Webster County.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The parties appeared for trial on Monday, July 10, 2017. Of the Webster County jury pool of 100 people who had returned juror surveys, eighty-seven of them checked in at the courthouse that morning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Veal is African-American. However, of those in the jury pool who reported their ethnicity, only one juror had self-identified as African-American, and she did not appear on July 10. Webster County is approximately 4.6% African-American.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Before voir dire began, Veal objected to the jury venire. He alleged a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial based on underrepresentation and systematic exclusion of African-Americans from the jury selection process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The court initially gave the defense until later that day to investigate its claim of underrepresentation and systematic exclusion. Further discussions took place on the record during the course of the day, and the court ultimately agreed to conduct a hearing on July 11. Because July 10 was the ninetieth day for speedy trial purposes, the court found good cause to extend the speedy trial deadline to July 11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In an attempt to increase the number of African-Americans in the venire, the court summoned an additional jury pool to appear on the 11th. The court also instructed the sheriff to contact the jurors who had been summoned but had not appeared on the 10th.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    With the extra jury pool, there were 153 potential jurors available at the courthouse on July 11.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Five were African-American.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Meanwhile, defense counsel had completed a historical review of jury questionnaires in Webster County for all of 2016. They reported to the court that the overall African-American percentage of Webster County jury pools that year was approximately 1.3%. Veal moved to strike the jury panel and dismiss the case, arguing the State had systematically excluded and underrepresented African-Americans in its jury pools in violation of the Sixth Amendment\n    and that it was too late to fix the problem given the speedy trial deadline.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The district court denied the motions, noting that the additional pool had redressed to some extent the lack of African-American jurors in the original pool. As the court explained in its subsequent written ruling,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    The Court denied Defendant's motion [to strike the jury panel] based on both the second and third part of the\n    <em>\n     Duren\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     v.

The Court found that with the addition of Pool 2 and the availability of additional jurors who self-identified as African-American, at least in part, that the representation of African-Americans was fair and reasonable. As to the third part of the\n    <em>\n     Duren\n    </em>\n    test, the Court found that there was insufficient evidence that there was systematic exclusion of African-Americans in the jury selection process.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Jury selection then took place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The initial voir dire panel of thirty-four potential jurors included three African-Americans. One had a prior felony conviction in Iowa, was still on parole, and had been prosecuted by the State's lead prosecutor. He was excused for cause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Iowa R. Crim. P. 2.18(5)(\n    <em>\n     a\n    </em>\n    ) (allowing a challenge for cause based on \"[a] previous conviction of the juror of a felony\"). A second potential juror also had a felony conviction, although from another state. His civil rights had not been restored, and he was excused for cause.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330305\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/357/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The final African-American potential juror was S.H. The State's lead attorney had prosecuted S.H.'s father in a prior case resulting in three class A felony convictions. During voir dire, S.H. acknowledged that she had attended part of the trial. The State exercised a peremptory challenge on her. Although the defense lodged a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge to the strike, the district court overruled the challenge finding that the State had offered \"a sufficient nondiscriminatory reason for striking that juror.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Following four days of presentation of evidence, a jury found Veal guilty on all charges. On September 12, Veal was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life without parole on the first-degree murder charges and twenty-five years on the attempted murder charge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20901.5\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 901.5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20901.5\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 902.1, .3, .9.

The trial information was filed November 23, 2016. Trial was originally scheduled for January 24, 2017. Veal never waived speedy trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    On December 30, 2016, Veal applied for a psychiatric evaluation of himself at state expense. On January 4, the court suspended proceedings and ordered such an evaluation. The evaluation was filed on February 28. The evaluator recommended that Veal be referred to the forensic psychiatric hospital for restoration of competency. On March 3, the court approved the referral and continued the suspension of proceedings. On May 15, the reports of two professionals were filed concluding Veal was now competent to stand trial. On May 23, the court found that Veal's competency had been restored and vacated the suspension of proceedings. The court reset trial for June 26.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Veal's counsel shortly thereafter moved to continue trial from June 26 to July 10 based on counsel's unavailability. The State did not oppose this request, and the court granted it. Everyone agreed that July 10 was the last available date within the ninety-day speedy trial window, taking into account the date the trial information was filed and excluding the time spent addressing Veal's competency.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    On the morning of July 10, the court convened proceedings intending to begin the trial. Veal's counsel observed there were no minorities and sought until the afternoon to explore racial disparity and systematic exclusion in the jury venire. Further discussions occurred later that morning and Veal's counsel asked for additional time past the 10th to investigate systematic exclusion. The State resisted the request. It noted that Veal had been in possession of the list of potential jurors earlier and could have raised the fair-cross-section claim before the day of trial. The State also asked the court to find good cause for extending the ninety-day deadline if it granted more time.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The court decided to give Veal's counsel until the following day, i.e., the 11th, to conduct research and discovery on the fair-cross-section claim. On the question of speedy trial, the court ruled,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    THE COURT: To grant the motion to -- to allow time to do discovery and make a further record regarding whether an under-representation is due to the systematic exclusion of a group in the jury selection process necessarily requires trial to begin after the 90 days. I think there has to be a conscious choice of that or at least be aware of that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    So given those situations, that they're really in conflict, counsel for the defendant, I just want to, you know, understand for the record, knowing that you're at the 90th day, you are asking for additional time to do further discovery or present further arguments on this matter to extend -- and that would extend this case past 90 days. Is that your position? MR. KLOBERDANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    THE COURT: All right. And you've discussed that with your client also? MR.

I find, however, that there is good cause shown for extending the time to present this case for trial:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    As Mr. Brown has said about four times, the State is ready to proceed here today. The jury panel was here. We were ready to begin the case. The jury panel is coming back at 1:00, so we could continue the case yet today;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    That the circumstances where Defendant's motion was first raised on Friday of last week [July 7], frankly, without any time for any of us to do anything about it, and then raised today, makes the situation where it would have been impossible to deal with this matter before the conclusion of the 90 days;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    That this is the defendant's motion with full knowledge that this would require trial to begin after 90 days.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    And in light of that, the defendant has chosen to seek the additional time to exercise his rights under the\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    case to do some further discovery; and, therefore, I think that the -- any delay in the case would -- would be attributable to the defendant and there'd be good cause for -- for not getting this case tried within 90 days.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The next day, July 11, a second pool of potential jurors had been summoned to add to the first pool. Veal, meanwhile, provided additional data based on jury pools in Webster County for all of 2016 and formally moved that his jury venire be stricken as not reflecting a fair cross section of the community. In addition, Veal moved for dismissal of the case based on violation of his speedy trial rights, reasoning that it was the State's duty to provide a jury panel representing a cross section of community within the ninety-day deadline. The court denied both motions, reiterating\n    on the speedy trial issue that \"there was good cause to go past the 90 days.\" At this point, the parties proceeded with jury selection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 2.33(2)(\n    <em>\n     b\n    </em>\n    ) provides,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n    If a defendant indicted for a public offense has not waived the defendant's right to a speedy trial the defendant must be brought to trial within 90 days after indictment is found or the court must order the indictment to be dismissed unless good cause to the contrary be shown.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The good cause determination focuses on \"the reason for the delay.\"\n    <em>\n     McNeal\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12334098\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/897/697/#p703\">\n     897 N.W.2d at 704\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     State v.

Treating the judicial branch and the county attorney's office collectively as \"the State,\" Veal maintains it was the State's obligation not just to be ready to try the case on July 10, but also to have a jury pool meeting constitutional standards available that day. Thus, Veal's argument would effectively transform\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    fair-cross-section violation not remedied before the ninety-day deadline into a speedy trial violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Veal cites no authority for his effort to conflate substantive legal claims with speedy trial violations. We are not persuaded. By Veal's logic, any time we find on appeal that a defendant is entitled to a new trial, we should also find that \"the State\" violated the defendant's speedy trial rights by committing a legal error that resulted in a new trial beyond the ninety-day deadline.

It was a very high-profile case, a very brutal killing ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    At the time of the -- the crime -- I can't tell you the year or the date. I do lose dates -- but Ms. [H.], I believe, was right around the age of 17 years old. I vaguely remember her being present at least at part of the -- if it wasn't the trial, it would have been part of the pretrial proceedings. She was with her mother ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    I mean, I can't keep a juror on whose father I prosecuted for a class A felony. I mean, there -- there -- she may have latent hostility towards me personally because of what I did. Her expressions that she made on the -- on the record, she said that his sentence was fair. She doesn't appear to have a whole lot of contact with him; but that's not a risk I can take, particularly under the circumstances of this case.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    We have -- The allegation is that Mr. Veal killed two people.

H.], whenever she said somebody else might have been involved.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    I can tell you right now, in the [S. H.] case, no one else was involved. We had strong physical evidence against him that he was the sole perpetrator of those three crimes. That's what concerns me about Ms. [H.]. I think those are race-neutral reasons to strike her.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    If she were white, I would make the exact same objection to having her -- or make the same exact strike that I would. And it -- this has nothing to do with her race; it has everything to do with her background and who her father is and the fact that I was directly involved in that case and that prosecution. So for those reasons, that's why we exercised our preemptory challenge.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    One other thing I would tell you is we did wait to the end to strike her with No. 10 because I thought the defense might actually challenge her for the same reason; that she had, you know, had this -- this connection to a previous high-profile violent crime here in the county. I could see actually how that they could maybe justify a preemptory strike on that basis, as well. I thought that would alleviate this problem of having to articulate why we're doing it; but apparently that didn't happen, so that's why we took her with No. 10.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n    Just don't want you to read anything else into that. That's why we waited till the end. So those are our reasons, and we would ask that our strike be upheld.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defense counsel did not question the State's motive for striking this juror, but argued that her voir dire responses gave no indication of bias. Because this juror was the last available African-American juror, defense counsel \"ask[ed] the Court to hold the State to a very high standard given the circumstances here.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The district court overruled Veal's\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge, stating,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    Prosecution of a potential juror's father in a -- in an apparently class A case by the same attorney as is in this case, I think, is a sufficient nondiscriminatory reason for striking that juror; and that's\n    why I'm going to overrule your objection.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Here and below, Veal insists that a nondiscriminatory reason for striking the last African-American juror is insufficient and that we should adopt something like a cause requirement in those circumstances.

Minihan,\n    <em>\n     Measuring Prosecutorial Actions: An Analysis of Misconduct Versus Error\n    </em>\n    , Prosecutor, Dec. 2014, at 25). We will treat Veal's claim as one of prosecutorial misconduct\n    <em>\n     or error\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Veal first takes issue with the following exchange during voir dire:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    MR. BROWN: ... Ms. [M.], I'll come back to you. I've mentioned multiple times here that this is a murder case and an attempted murder; right? Okay. And I think with Ms. [P.], she talked about a case that she was on that dealt with a -- serving a minor; correct? Okay. So obviously when you compare the two, that's, you know, certainly minor compared\n    to -- to a murder. Would you agree? MS. [M.]: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    MR. BROWN: Okay. So looking at comparing those two, would you say that we would have to have more evidence in a murder case than we would in someone who sells alcohol to a minor? MS. [M.]: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    MR. BROWN: Okay. I get that answer a lot too. Do you realize that the burden in those two cases is exactly the same, the definition would be the same? Do you follow me? MS. [M.]: Uh-huh.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    MR. BROWN: So it'd be beyond a reasonable doubt as it's defined by the judge here. The same instruction would be given in the case like what Ms. [P.] had talked about. So the burden is the same in the sense that it's defined the same. Do you follow me? MS. [M.]: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    MR. BROWN: Okay. So would you hold us to the burden as the Judge gives it to you -- MS. [M.]: Yes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    MR. BROWN: -- and not think that we have to have something more than that? MS. [M.]: Correct.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Veal's counsel shortly thereafter moved for a mistrial based on this exchange. He said, \"I don't know if that went over the line but want to bring it to the court's attention. ... It was a comparison of selling alcohol to minors and -- and murder ....\" He then added that when a prosecutor compares two crimes it is \"at least arguably a comment on potential punishment; and certainly that's not appropriate or proper.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The court denied the motion for mistrial. It recalled the reference as an effort to equate the burden of proof for both crimes. It did say that the comment could be viewed as one on possible punishment, and counsel should \"avoid that sort of discussion in the future.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    We find no abuse of discretion in the denial of a mistrial. Jurors didn't fall off the turnip truck and into the courtroom. Inevitably, a prospective juror is going to regard murder as a more serious crime than selling alcohol to minors and assume it has a more severe punishment. The point of the prosecutor's voir dire questioning was not to comment on punishment but to make sure jurors would be willing to accept the proposition that all criminal cases are subject to the same \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" burden of proof. That was a legitimate purpose.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    On appeal, Veal argues that the prosecutor's contrast between murder and selling alcohol to minors \"[p]lanted in the jurors' mind the anchor of a minor punishment ....\" This seems unlikely to us. No one referred to the actual punishment for either crime.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Veal also complains that during trial, one of the prosecutors incorrectly told the jury that the defense had seen a particular diagram before. The defense immediately disputed that statement in front of the jury. The diagram was not admitted at that time. During the next break, outside the presence of the jury, it was established that both sides were partly right: the diagram had been provided to defense counsel, but some additions had been made. Over objection, the court received the diagram into evidence and rejected any argument that the changes to the diagram had prejudiced the defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Notably, defense counsel did not then assert prosecutorial misconduct or error. Defense counsel did not seek any relief from the prosecutor's previous statement about the diagram, such as a curative instruction. And on appeal, defense counsel is not even appealing the decision to admit the diagram. We find no reversible error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Veal also complains about comments made by the lead prosecutor during his rebuttal closing argument. Over objection, the prosecutor engaged in some sharp criticism of defense counsel's closing argument. These included analogizing the defense argument to the times when the prosecutor's daughter would say, \"Really, Dad? Really?\" to her father without having any \"substance.\" The prosecutor also argued as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n    Mr. Kloberdanz characterized this as a horrible tragedy. Well, I would disagree with this. You know what a horrible tragedy is? When an infant dies in its crib for no reason. When a father of three, driving home from work, his car slides off the highway and is killed in a crash for no reason.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n    This is not a horrible tragedy, this is a cold-blooded killing. It is a brutal, senseless murder and a near-miss on Ron Willis. That's the proper way to characterize what occurred.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n    At the end of Mr. Kloberdanz's statement -- at his closing argument to you, he told quite a story. Wow. What was all of that based on? Nothing. What -- You would have thought Mr. Kloberdanz was there, the way he told that story.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n    That Ron Willis got hit in the head with the lamp, that he switched clothes with Peter Veal, that he did all those things. Holy cow. Wow.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The district court overruled defense counsel's objections to this line of argument but told the prosecutor he \"may be pushing\" the line of what is proper. At that point, the prosecutor shifted into a detailed discussion of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    We have indicated that a prosecutor may attack the defense's \"theory of the case\" so long as he or she does not make \"denigrating or inflammatory comments of a personal nature aimed at defense counsel.\"\n    <em>\n     Coleman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12336116\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/907/124/#p134\">\n     907 N.W.2d at 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Firearm Demonstration.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    During trial, the State's firearms expert Victor Murillo used a .380 semiautomatic pistol from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation's (DCI) reference collection for demonstrative purposes. This was done because the actual murder weapon had carcinogenic dye on it. The demonstration\n    weapon was the same make and model as the murder weapon, although with some design changes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Murillo testified that the murder weapon had jammed after it was used to kill Kavars because a faulty cartridge became stuck inside of the chamber. To help illustrate his testimony, the State asked Murillo to display the operation of a semiautomatic .380 using the sample weapon from DCI's lab.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    At trial and on appeal, Veal claims the demonstration should not have been permitted because the demonstration weapon differed from the murder weapon in certain respects. However, we find no abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

The Defendant's Competency Hearing.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    On May 15, 2017, two examining professionals reported that Veal was properly oriented as to time, place, and current events and could perform mental tracking tasks and a memory test without difficulty. According to the reports, Veal also was able to list the charges against him and identify the range of potential sentences; he could confirm that he had met with his defense attorney five or six times and that he was able to work with him; he understood the roles of his defense attorney, the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury; he understood what a plea bargain would entail; and he realized that he should advise his defense attorney if a witness wasn't telling the truth. Veal's scores on tests of basic legal concepts and skills to assist defense were described as \"somewhat higher than average compared to the general population.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    These evaluations concluded that Veal had a factual and a rational understanding of the legal proceedings and could assist his defense counsel. Thus, they opined he was competent to stand trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20812.3\">\n     Iowa Code \u00a7 812.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2) ;\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20812.3\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 812.5 (defining the issue as whether \"the defendant is suffering from a mental disorder which prevents the defendant from appreciating the charge, understanding the proceedings, or assisting effectively in the defense\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Following the receipt of both evaluations, a competency hearing took place on May 23. The evaluations were admitted into evidence. For the defense, Veal's mother testified that she had visited her son twice recently for brief periods of time. The first time, Veal was rocking and looking behind him. His mother got \"the feeling he was paranoid.\" The second time, Veal did not behave like that. However, during this second visit, Veal asked Veal's mother about how his sister was doing just a few minutes after Veal's mother had already spoken to Veal about his sister.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Defense counsel also represented that in their encounters with their client, Veal had not asked questions of his own and often had not responded to their inquiries. Defense\n    counsel urged that there was a serious question whether Veal was listening to his attorneys-rather than listening to voices-and that Veal was having a hard time paying attention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    After considering the evidence, the district court concluded that Veal was competent to stand trial. On our de novo review, we agree. The two expert evaluations on which the district court relied were detailed and thorough. As the district court observed, the testimony of Veal's mother was based on only two fifteen-minute visits with her son. Even accepting the professional statement of Veal's counsel that they were having trouble interacting with their client, the examining psychiatrist and the examining psychologist covered this same subject in considerable detail in their evaluations. Based on their objective testing and personal observations, they found Veal would be able to work with his counsel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    In sum, the State carried its burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that Veal's competency had been restored.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%20812.3\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 812.8(5).

Excluded Evidence.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Veal challenges the district court's exclusion of evidence pertaining to Willis. The limited evidence essentially fell into two categories: (1) Willis's criminal history and (2) information that a defense witness, M.B., had concerning Willis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Willis's Criminal History.\n    </strong>\n    We begin with the admitted evidence. The defense was allowed to impeach Willis with the fact that he had been convicted in 2009 on a felony drug charge. The defense was also allowed to argue that Willis had been found by the police to have a small amount of marijuana in his car on November 17, 2016, and was not prosecuted. Similarly, the defense was able to argue that Willis had not been prosecuted as a felon in possession of a firearm.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    However, the defense was not allowed to bring out Willis's drug charges in Minnesota that were pending at the time of trial. Likewise, evidence of Willis's early June 2017 misdemeanor drug possession conviction was excluded. Also excluded was the fact that Willis did not serve the mandatory minimum two days in jail on the June 2017 conviction and the possibility that the charge could have been (but was not) enhanced to a felony. The court reasoned that misdemeanors and unproved charges are not normally admissible, and there was no basis for concluding that Willis was the beneficiary of some kind of deal to receive favorable treatment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    We see no abuse of discretion here. Allowing the defense to present this additional evidence of Willis's criminal history could have led to an unneeded and time-consuming sideshow. Willis made a 911 call to police voluntarily on November 17, 2016, to report that Veal had shot Kavars. Willis's\n    version of events never changed. While defense counsel should have broad leeway to question prosecution witnesses facing criminal exposure, this record contains no suggestion that any sort of deal was made with Willis. There would have been no need for a deal: Willis had reported the criminal episode of his own volition. Moreover, Veal's defense theory was that Willis had shot Kavars and stabbed Christensen to death. If that were true, Willis had plenty of motive to pin the crimes on Veal and did not need a \"deal\" as motivation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    <strong>\n     B. M.B.'s Testimony.\n    </strong>\n    Again, we begin with the admitted evidence. M.B. was Christensen's live-in girlfriend during the last few months before his death. She testified that she witnessed Willis delivering drugs to Christensen. She testified that Christensen was spending a lot of money on drugs and his financial situation was deteriorating. She also testified that about two weeks before November 17, 2016, Willis had date-raped her and she reported this to Christensen. M.B. further testified that Christensen was upset and mad at Willis upon hearing this. And M.B. testified that Willis kept drugs and a handgun in his car.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    M.B. was not allowed to testify that Christensen had \"a significant drug problem,\" how much Christensen was spending on drugs, or that she was \"scared of\" Willis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Veal claims that these limits on M.B.'s testimony significantly interfered with his ability to present his case. In particular, Veal contends that the jury got to hear of a \"rift\" between Willis and Christensen but did not get to hear \"what the rift was about.\" We disagree. Veal was able to demonstrate that Willis had a motive to kill Kavars and Christensen. We find no abuse of discretion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    <strong>\n     XI. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Veal argues the district court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for the first-degree murder of Christensen and Kavars and for the attempted murder of Willis. Alternatively, Veal urges that his motion for new trial should have been granted on the ground that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence. We disagree with both contentions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Willis testified that Veal shot Kavars in the throat before turning the gun on Willis and attempting to shoot Willis. When the pistol jammed, according to Willis, Veal struck Willis in the head and then attempted to free the lodged round. The pistol recovered at the scene by police had a jammed round in the firing chamber. Willis's skin tissue was also found on the pistol's slide consistent with his being struck on the head with it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    After Willis fled the scene, Veal was the only person remaining in the house with Christensen. Christensen's dead body was later found in a pool of blood with twenty-five stab wounds. Christensen's blood was all over Veal's jeans and shoes. The bloody footprints in the house matched Veal's shoes. A trail of Christensen's blood followed Veal's path out of the house. Along the path were Veal's discarded bloody shirt and bloody knife. Again, Christensen's blood was on these items.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Veal's improbable defense theory was that Willis had both shot Kavars and stabbed Christensen, then forced Veal to put on Willis's bloody clothes, then cleaned himself up so he would have no trace of Christensen's blood, and then left the house and called 911. The jury was entitled to reject this theory which was not supported by the weight of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <strong>\n     XII. Conclusion.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, we conditionally affirm Veal's conviction and sentence, but remand this case for further consideration of Veal's claim that his jury was not drawn from a fair cross section of the community in violation of the Sixth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED ON CONDITION AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Cady, C.J., concurs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Wiggins and Appel, JJ., concur as to divisions IV, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI, and dissent as to division VI.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Waterman, Christensen, and McDonald, JJ., concur as to divisions V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI, and dissent as to division IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    CADY, Chief Justice (concurring specially).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    I join in each division of the majority opinion by Justice Mansfield.

Thus, I am not in favor of trying to modify our governing rules to better detect bias in discretionary decision-making so much as I am in eliminating discretionary practices altogether that allow implicit bias to exist undetected.

According to defense counsel, Willis sent Veal outside Christensen's house wearing Willis's clothing and carrying the knife used to murder Christensen so Veal could be a \"fall guy.\" According to this theory, Willis managed to clean himself up to eliminate all traces of blood on his body and his whereabouts before calling 911 to contact police.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-347\">\n     In addition to its overall implausibility, this theory fails to explain why the bloody footprints in the house matched Veal's shoes, how Veal ended up with a cut on his hand, why Veal ran away from the police whereas Willis cooperated, and how Willis's skin tissue ended up on the slide of the gun.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11\">\n    <p id=\"p-348\">\n     Veal frames the issue on appeal as whether a \"new\" competency evaluation should have been ordered.

Even after\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    , I see the same problem in Iowa. In the majority of the cases, the reasons given by prosecutors in response to a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge appear to be pretexual. Washington General Rule 37, cited by Justice Appel in his opinion, helps but does not solve the problem. The only way to stop the misuse of peremptory challenges is to abolish them in Iowa and require judges to enforce rigorously challenges for cause. If our judges would enforce our rules on challenges for cause, the district court can be confident that it sat an impartial jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The practice of allowing peremptory challenges started in England in the 1300s.

We must recognize that although overt racial bias is, in most quarters, in retreat, the problem of implicit bias poses a major challenge and must be addressed.

(\"It is wise for counsel to avoid asking questions of prospective jurors during voir dire which can be answered either yes or no.\"). Instead, we should permit attorneys to engage in individual, open-ended examination of jurors designed to allow the juror to speak about his or her cultural attitudes.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Chi.-Kent%20L.%20Rev.%201179\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 23 (\"An open-ended question permits each juror to explain his answer in his own words through his own thoughts.\").

This remedy, however, has been very narrowly crafted. It amounts to a last ditch backstop for the worst of cases that come to the attention of the court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    In short, because of the limited number of African-American jurors who will make it to the jury pool, the possibility that\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    strikes will eliminate them from the petit jury, and the helpful but limited effectiveness of voir dire as an antibias tool, the court's instructions to the jury may be the last, best line of defense against racial bias in our jury system. This is particularly true with respect to implicit bias. Studies show that identifying and discussing the possibility of unconscious racial bias can be effective in minimizing or eliminating it. Cynthia Lee,\n    <em>\n     A New Approach to Voir Dire on Racial Bias\n    </em>\n    , 5 U.C. Irvine L. Rev. 843, 872 (2015). An implicit-bias instruction, therefore, should play a part in our effort to ensure that equality before the law is a reality for African-Americans and other minorities in our jury system. I further discuss these issues in\n    <em>\n     State v. Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12563749\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/929/621/#p641\">\n     929 N.W.2d 621\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 641 (Iowa 2019) (Appel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Role for State Courts.\n    </strong>\n    Finally, I want to emphasize the important role of state courts in addressing the continuing challenge of bringing us closer to the goal of racial equality in our courts. Obviously, the Iowa Constitution and our supervisory authority over Iowa courts provides an independent basis for addressing fundamental issues such as the rights to an impartial jury and to equality before the law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Iowa Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6, 9, 10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    But it is also important to note the vibrant constitutional dialogue that arises when state courts engage in independent constitutional analysis. Throughout our constitutional history, state court decisions have been precursors to later developments in federal law. We all know about how the Iowa Civil Rights cases provided an example for later federal constitutional adjudication.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Lovell, 67 Drake L. Rev. at 189. There are other, more recent examples of state courts leading the way. For instance, in 1948, the California Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Perez v. Lippold\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4393893\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/32/711/\">\n     32 Cal.2d 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20P.2d%2017\">\n     198 P.2d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 29 (1948) (en banc), struck down a state statute invalidating interracial marriages.\n    <em>\n     Perez\n    </em>\n    laid the groundwork for the pivotal United States Supreme Court case, twenty years later, of\n    <em>\n     Loving v.

The potential juror, however, stated that she was not close to her father, that the situation would have no effect on her ability to be an impartial juror, that her father was treated fairly by the state, that she would not hold the prosecution of her father against the state, that she did not recognize the prosecutor as someone involved in the prosecution until the prosecutor brought it up, and that she had no relationship with her father in any event.

He generally noted that the prosecution used its peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of the eligible African-American venire members from the jury pool.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 240-41, 125 S.

Ct. at 2325-31. For example, Justice Souter noted that one African-American potential juror was struck because the prosecutor inaccurately characterized his views on the death penalty and religion, even as white potential jurors who expressed reservations about imposing the death penalty were not struck.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 243-45, 125 S. Ct. at 2327-28. With respect to another potential juror, Justice Souter also noted shifting explanations by the state to defend one of its peremptory strikes which, according to Justice Souter, \"reeks of afterthought.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 246, 125 S. Ct. at 2328. With respect to a third juror, Justice Souter found that while the purported reason for striking the\n    African-American juror for her views on the death penalty seemed reasonable on its face, the purported reason was severely undercut by the prosecution's failure to object to other jurors who gave similar answers.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 248, 125 S. Ct. at 2329-30.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    In addition, Justice Souter noted that the prosecution engaged in a jury shuffle-literally a shuffling of cards representing jurors-whenever African-American jurors tended to be in the front rows of the venire panel and thus more likely to be picked for the jury than those seated at back.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 253-54, 125 S. Ct. at 2332-33. Further, Justice Souter noted that graphic scripts related to the death penalty were read to African-American venire members, while bland descriptions were read to white prospective jurors.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 255-56, 125 S.

Ct. at 2338-39. That history showed prosecutors marked the race of each potential juror on their juror cards and a manual, written in 1968 yet available to one of the prosecutors in\n    <em>\n     Miller-El\n    </em>\n    , outlined the reasons for striking African-American jurors.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 264, 125 S.

Ct. at 2344 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Among other things, the dissent emphasized that Justice Souter relied on evidence such as juror questionnaires and juror cards that were not provided to the Texas courts.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 279, 125 S. Ct. at 2347. Justice Thomas further found, among other things, that the majority misread the voir dire transcripts, utilized claims of disparate questioning that did not fit the facts, and engaged in pure speculation about the jury shuffles.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 286, 296, 304, 125 S.

But he took up the mantle of Justice Marshall in his\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    dissent.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 266-67, 125 S. Ct. at 2340. Justice Breyer noted that in this case, twenty-three judges reviewed the matter, with six finding a violation of\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    and sixteen to the contrary.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 267, 125 S. Ct. at 2340. He noted that judges are put in the awkward, and sometimes hopeless, task of second guessing a prosecutor's judgments.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 267, 125 S. Ct. at 2341. According to Justice Breyer, it becomes impossible for a judge to distinguish between a \" 'seat-of-the-pants' peremptory challenge\" and \" 'seat-of-the-pants' racial stereotype.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 268, 125 S. Ct. at 2341. Justice Breyer extensively cited studies tending to show that\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    had not been successful in rooting out racial stereotyping in the use of peremptory challenges.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 268-69, 125 S. Ct. at 2341-42. Justice Breyer also observed that \"the law's antidiscrimination command and a peremptory jury-selection system that permits or encourages the use of stereotypes work at cross-purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 271-72, 125 S. Ct. at 2343. Justice Breyer concluded that the case demonstrated the need to reconsider\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    's test and the peremptory challenge system as a whole.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 272-73, 125 S.

Discussion.\n    </strong>\n    It seems to me beyond clear that our system's approach to achieving a fair cross section of the community in the jury pool and in ensuring African-Americans receive a fair trial is in need of an overhaul. We have made a good first step in our revisions of the fair-cross-section jurisprudence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lilly\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12563868\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/930/293/\">\n     930 N.W.2d at 313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Appel, J., concurring specially). But it is critically important that the gains made today are not eliminated by a\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    framework that permits the elimination of African-American petit jurors through the back door of peremptory challenges.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-261\">\n    It seems to me the experience of over thirty years demonstrates not that\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    is worthless, but rather that it is very ineffective. The reasons are well known.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-262\">\n    First, just like in the fair-cross-section question, Iowa constitutional law must recognize that African-Americans and other minorities make up a relatively small proportion of the state's population.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Plain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12336388\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/898/801/#p810\">\n     898 N.W.2d at 830\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that black people comprise a small percentage of Iowa's population). Because of this salient fact, the absolute disparity approach to fair cross section required revision. Likewise, the relatively small proportion of minorities in Iowa means that it will be relatively easy for all minority jurors to be eliminated through the exercise of peremptory challenges. Leonard L. Cavise,\n    <em>\n     The\n    </em>\n    Batson\n    <em>\n     Doctrine: The Supreme Court's Utter Failure to Meet the Challenge of Discrimination in Jury Selection\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20Wis.%20L.%20Rev.%20501\">\n     1999 Wis. L. Rev. 501\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 527 (noting that minorities in low population jurisdictions can be completely eliminated from jury pool through peremptory challenges). A toothless\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    review in Iowa courts could eliminate the fair-cross-section gains achieved in today's cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-263\">\n    Second, the state's justification offered in\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    's step two need not be persuasive and can even be frivolous or utterly nonsensical.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Purkett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340390\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/765/#p769\">\n     514 U.S. at 768-69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340390\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/765/#p769\">\n     115 S.

Burke,\n    <em>\n     Prosecutors and Peremptories\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Iowa%20L.%20Rev.%201467\">\n     97 Iowa L. Rev. 1467\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1470 (2012). Any reasonably imaginative prosecutor can come up with a facially neutral justification.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Bellin &amp; Semitsu, 96 Cornell L. Rev. at 1090-99 (providing list of cases upholding peremptory strikes for racially neutral but apparently insubstantial reasons).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    Third, once the low threshold of articulating a facially neutral justification has been crossed, the burden shifts to the defendant to show pretext and what amounts to purposeful discrimination. Purposeful discrimination is very difficult to prove. If a prosecutor asserts vague but racially neutral demeanor observations of a potential\n    juror such as lack of eye contact, tone of voice, or body language, how does a district court evaluate such claims? And even in very compelling cases like\n    <em>\n     Miller-El\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Foster\n    </em>\n    , the fractured decisions of the United States Supreme Court on the factual issue of purposeful discrimination illustrate the problem.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-265\">\n    Fourth, requiring a district court judge to, in effect, charge the local prosecutor with lying and racial motivation from the bench in the course of voir dire is unrealistic.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coombs v.

Thus, the voir dire of these ten African-Americans, along with voir dire of other jurors, provided a mountain of comparative evidence.

In Iowa, however, there will likely never be a jury pool with ten African-Americans in the juror panel and an eleven volume voir dire transcript. Even with the proposed reforms embraced today, only a few African-Americans are likely to be in most Iowa jury pools. In these cases, there will be no body of comparative evidence similar to that developed by Justice Souter in\n    <em>\n     Miller-El\n    </em>\n    . In Iowa\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Miller-El\n    </em>\n    is likely a mirage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-270\">\n    It remains to be seen whether any\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    reform can be successful in Iowa. It is certainly true that without engaging in a robust review of a prosecutor's stated reasons for exclusion,\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    will likely be largely ineffective in eliminating racial discrimination in jury selection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Anna Roberts,\n    <em>\n     Disparately Seeking Jurors: Disparate Impact and the (Mis)use of\n    </em>\n    Batson,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.C.%20Davis%20L.%20Rev.%201359\">\n     45 U.C.

What Veal does ask for, however, is a revision of our approach when the last African-American is removed from the jury with a peremptory strike.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-273\">\n    I agree. When the last African-American member of the jury is subject to a peremptory challenge, the interest in achieving a fair cross section of the community on the jury is at its highest point. I think we should be giving the elimination of the last minority juror through a peremptory challenge greater scrutiny than other\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenges ordinarily require. For last minority jurors, I think we should require at this stage that the prosecutor provide a specific challenge related to the facts of the case. That amounts to\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    with teeth on step two of the traditional analysis. Then, in step three, as under the Washington approach, the district court should objectively determine whether the\n    asserted reason was in fact race neutral or whether race may have played a role in the strike.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Wash. Gen. R. 37(e) ;\n    <em>\n     Jefferson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571212\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/429/467/#p470\">\n     429 P.3d at 480\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . If the district court objectively determines that the reason asserted for the strike is race neutral, the district court should then objectively weigh the prosecution's racially neutral interest in eliminating the juror against the defendant's interest in a jury composed of a fair cross section of the community.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tania Tetlow,\n    <em>\n     Solving\n    </em>\n    Batson,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Wm.%20%26%20Mary%20L.%20Rev.%201859\">\n     56 Wm. &amp; Mary L.

Based on my review of the record, I would credit the prosecution's reason for the strike as race neutral based on objective analysis of the facts. I would then proceed to the balancing test. While the prosecution may have had an interest in exclusion of the juror, the juror appeared to have very little contact with her father and little if any bitterness arising out of his past prosecution. More importantly, she was the last African-American member of the venire pool. On balance, I would conclude that Veal's interest in a fair cross section outweighed the prosecution's interest in disqualifying the juror. Because an error in jury selection persists through the entire course of the proceeding, I would reverse Veal's conviction and remand for a new trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tankleff v.

The purpose of this rule is to eliminate the unfair exclusion of potential jurors based on race or ethnicity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-281\">\n    (b) Scope. This rule applies in all jury trials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-282\">\n    (c) Objection. A party may object to the use of a peremptory challenge to raise the issue of improper bias. The court may also raise this objection on its own. The objection shall be made by simple citation to this rule, and any further discussion shall be conducted outside the presence of the panel. The objection must be made before the potential juror is excused, unless new information is discovered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-283\">\n    (d) Response. Upon objection to the exercise of a peremptory challenge pursuant to this rule, the party exercising the peremptory challenge shall articulate the reasons the peremptory challenge has been exercised.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-284\">\n    (e) Determination. The court shall then evaluate the reasons given to justify the peremptory challenge in light of the totality of circumstances. If the court determines that an objective observer could view race or ethnicity as a factor in the use of the peremptory challenge, then the peremptory challenge shall be denied. The court need not find purposeful discrimination to deny the peremptory challenge. The court should explain its ruling on the record.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-285\">\n    (f) Nature of Observer. For purposes of this rule, an objective observer is aware that implicit, institutional, and unconscious biases, in addition to purposeful discrimination, have resulted in the unfair exclusion of potential jurors in Washington State.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-286\">\n    (g) Circumstances Considered. In making its determination, the circumstances the court should consider include, but are not limited to, the following:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-287\">\n    (i) the number and types of questions posed to the prospective juror, which may include consideration of whether the party exercising the peremptory challenge failed to question the prospective juror about the alleged concern or the types of questions asked about it;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-288\">\n    (ii) whether the party exercising the peremptory challenge asked significantly more questions or different questions of the potential juror against whom the peremptory challenge was used in contrast to other jurors;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-289\">\n    (iii) whether other prospective jurors provided similar answers but were not the subject of a peremptory challenge by that party;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-290\">\n    (iv) whether a reason might be disproportionately associated with a race or ethnicity; and\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-291\">\n    (v) whether the party has used peremptory challenges disproportionately against a given race or ethnicity, in the present case or in past cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-292\">\n    (h) Reasons Presumptively Invalid. Because historically the following reasons for peremptory challenges have been associated with improper discrimination in jury selection in Washington State, the following are presumptively invalid reasons for a peremptory challenge:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-293\">\n    (i) having prior contact with law enforcement officers;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-294\">\n    (ii) expressing a distrust of law enforcement or a belief that law enforcement officers engage in racial profiling;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-295\">\n    (iii) having a close relationship with people who have been stopped, arrested, or convicted of a crime;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-296\">\n    (iv) living in a high-crime neighborhood;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-297\">\n    (v) having a child outside of marriage;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-298\">\n    (vi) receiving state benefits; and\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-299\">\n    (vii) not being a native English speaker.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-300\">\n    <strong>\n     (i)\n    </strong>\n    Reliance on Conduct. The following reasons for peremptory challenges also have historically been associated with improper discrimination in jury selection in Washington State: allegations that the prospective juror was sleeping, inattentive, or staring or failing to make eye contact; exhibited a problematic attitude, body language, or demeanor; or provided unintelligent or confused answers. If any party intends to offer one of these reasons or a similar reason as the justification for a peremptory challenge, that party must provide reasonable notice to the court and the other parties so the behavior can be verified and addressed in a timely manner. A lack of corroboration by the judge or opposing counsel verifying the behavior shall invalidate the given reason for the peremptory challenge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-301\">\n    [Adopted effective April 24, 2018.]\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-302\">\n    McDONALD, Justice (concurring in part, dissenting in part).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-303\">\n    I concur in the following divisions of Justice Mansfield's opinion: divisions V (speedy trial), VI (\n    <em>\n     Batson\n    </em>\n    challenge), VII (prosecutorial error), VIII (firearm demonstration), IX (competency hearing), X (excluded evidence), and XI (sufficiency of the evidence).

It was Veal's burden to establish a prima facie case, and the failure to present reliable evidence to support his claim defeats the claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    Second, even assuming the data was reliable, the data shows this jury pool was actually overrepresentative. During the relevant time period, the population of Webster County was approximately 36,000. Of those, 4.6%, or 1656, were African-American, and 34,344 persons were not African-American. As I noted in\n    <em>\n     Lilly\n    </em>\n    , there is no reliable information regarding how many persons in the county were jury-eligible. Setting aside that particular criticism, using the majority's assumptions, the number of eligible African-American jurors was approximately 1100 while the number of jury-eligible others was 26,685. Approximately 700 white persons and 400 African-Americans were incarcerated at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility located in Webster County. This is consistent with historical census information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rose Heyer &amp; Peter Wagner, Prison Policy Initiative,\n    <em>\n     Too Big to Ignore: How Counting People in Prisons Distorted\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Census 2000\n    </em>\n    (2004) [hereinafter Heyer &amp; Wagner], https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/toobig/datasearch.php?field=GEO_NAME &amp; operator=LIKE &amp; q=webster &amp; Submit=Search &amp; field1= &amp; operator1= &amp; q1= &amp; sortby= &amp; sortorder= [https://perma.cc/7DGC-CT3Y] (containing data set showing 26.47% of the African-American population in Webster County in 2000 was incarcerated).

Although incarcerated people are not a part of the prison town, they are a part of the community's statistics.\"). If one removes incarcerated persons from the calculation (assuming all or almost all are 18 or older), there were 26,285 non-African-American eligible jurors and only 700 African-American eligible jurors, or 2.6% of all eligible jurors. The majority concludes the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool was 3.27%. Thus, when adjusted for the unique demographics of this county, the jury pool here was actually overrepresentative of the African-American community.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Lilly\n    </em>\n    , the majority concluded that \"[a] defendant whose jury pool has a percentage of the distinctive group at least as large as the percentage of that group in the jury-eligible population has not had his or her right to a fair cross section infringed.\" --- N.W.2d at ----.
