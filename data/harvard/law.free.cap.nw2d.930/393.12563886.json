On appeal, Blue Harvest raises multiple allegations of error originating from the trial court's denial of Blue Harvest's motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) and from its motion for a new trial, JNOV, and remittitur. We conclude that the trial court erred when it allowed\n   plaintiff to proceed to trial on both a premises liability and an ordinary negligence theory. However, it was permissible to proceed on the premises liability theory, the jury instructions on res ipsa loquitur and spoliation as to premises liability were proper, and it was appropriate for the jury to find Blue Harvest liable on the premises liability claim. Therefore, a new trial is not merited. In all other respects, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by Air Components, Inc., as an air-compressor technician\n   and salesperson. Blue Harvest is a family-owned blueberry farm and packaging facility located in West Olive, Michigan. On October 28, 2014, plaintiff met with Blue Harvest's owner, Adam LaLone, to inspect a malfunctioning air compressor on Blue Harvest's premises. As plaintiff and LaLone walked through the warehouse where packaging materials were stored, they passed a stack of three pallets of unassembled cardboard boxes near the walkway. The top two bundles unexpectedly fell on them. Plaintiff suffered multiple injuries, including a broken hip that required emergency hip replacement surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Blue Harvest did not preserve the pallets or cardboard boxes that fell, nor were there any photographs taken. According to LaLone, each pallet of stacked cardboard was four feet long and four feet high. Each stack of cardboard was bound to a wooden pallet with nylon straps and was delivered to Blue Harvest by an outside vendor. A week before the incident, LaLone used a forklift to move the bound pallets of cardboard in the warehouse and stacked them three bundles high. Together, the tower of cardboard weighed 1,000 pounds and reached a height of 14 feet. LaLone testified at his deposition that stacking cardboard in this\n   manner was normal in the industry. He had worked on farms that had used that method of storage for 50 years without incident. Importantly, he admitted that if the cardboard was properly stacked, it should not \"go anywhere,\" but he did not know what happened to cause the cardboard to fall. After the incident, LaLone noted that one of the pallets that fell was cracked. However, he was unsure whether the crack was on the back side or the front side of the pallet because \"[e]verything was flipped over.\" LaLone opined that the incident may have been caused by a damaged pallet; however, there was no indication whether the pallet was cracked before the incident because the cardboard obscured the view of the pallet. Unfortunately, LaLone used the remaining undamaged boxes after the incident and threw away the cracked pallet before plaintiff could inspect it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against Blue Harvest on June 20, 2016, alleging negligence and loss of consortium. Blue Harvest moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that the lawsuit sounded in premises liability and that because plaintiff failed to show that Blue Harvest had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged hazardous condition, summary disposition was appropriate. The trial court entered an order denying Blue Harvest's motion for summary disposition without the benefit of oral argument, holding that plaintiff's complaint sounded only in ordinary negligence and that \"[d]efendant's motion argues against a legal theory which has not been pled.\" Blue Harvest moved for reconsideration, arguing that the trial court committed palpable error because plaintiff's claim was based exclusively on\n   premises liability-not ordinary negligence. The trial court denied Blue Harvest's motion, citing its earlier order denying the motion for summary disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At a later proceeding, plaintiff's attorney surprised the court when he informed it that plaintiff was pursuing his negligence claim on both a premises liability and an ordinary negligence theory. The trial court decided to rehear Blue Harvest's request for summary disposition on plaintiff's premises liability claim. At the hearing, Blue Harvest argued that summary disposition was proper because there was no genuine issue of material fact that Blue Harvest did not have actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition. Blue\n   Harvest further argued that there was no evidence of negligence at all because plaintiff presented no evidence explaining why the pallet fell, e.g., LaLone stacking the pallets improperly, a pallet cracking under the weight of the cardboard, or the vibrations of forklift activity nearby causing the pallets to shift off balance. Plaintiff's attorney referred to the theory of res ipsa loquitur, explaining that such an instruction was needed for the very reason that there was no evidence as to why the pallets fell. Plaintiff's attorney also addressed the fact that he was alleging two separate negligence theories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Attorney\n   </em>\n   ]: But in terms of the premises liability claim, we have to separate conduct, which is negligence, from what is your duty as a landowner? And we cited the law that says you can have both claims. We have the conduct. [LaLone] clearly stacked it. There's no dispute on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : Why have you made your complaint so, I guess, simple yet complicated because you're alleging a couple theories on a simple complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Attorney\n   </em>\n   ]: I-\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : This is difficult.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Attorney\n   </em>\n   ]: And I can tell you why. Because we didn't even know. Because we knew it fell over. We didn't know about the cracked pallets. My client was in the hospital when all this was cleaned up. So, we're coming in saying we know something happened here, something went wrong, and now I need to discover it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Court\n   </em>\n   : What you need to do is to file an amended complaint putting forth your theories, and then once we get that, we'll determine if they're prepared to go to trial on your amended complaint or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's attorney filed an amended complaint a few days later, alleging premises liability and ordinary negligence. Blue Harvest did not file another motion for summary disposition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the trial court never addressed whether plaintiff could continue on both negligence theories. Before trial, Blue Harvest filed an emergency motion for an adjournment, claiming that plaintiff was no longer calling his treating medical doctor to testify and, therefore, Blue Harvest needed time to subpoena and depose him. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that Blue Harvest failed to file any witness list and therefore would not be prejudiced by the fact that the doctor was not going to testify at trial. Trial commenced on June 14, 2017. Before closing arguments, the trial court overruled Blue Harvest's objections to plaintiff's request for jury instructions on res ipsa loquitur and spoliation. The trial court also denied Blue Harvest's request for two other specific jury instructions. The jury returned a verdict finding Blue Harvest liable on both negligence\n   theories. Blue Harvest then moved for a new trial, JNOV, and remittitur, claiming that the trial court failed to grant its emergency motion for an adjournment, that it erred when it allowed the instructions on res ipsa loquitur and spoliation, that it erred when it denied Blue Harvest's request for specific jury instructions, and that remittitur was necessary because the jury failed to account for the fact that plaintiff was cleared to go back to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Blue Harvest first argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion for\n   summary disposition because plaintiff's claim sounded exclusively in premises liability, there was no genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide the premises liability issue, and the trial court should not have allowed the claim to proceed on the basis of res ipsa loquitur because the doctrine is inapplicable to premises liability claims. While we agree that plaintiff's claim sounded exclusively in premises liability, we are unpersuaded by Blue Harvest's remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An issue is preserved for appellate review when it is raised in and decided by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Fast Air, Inc. v. Knight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"840030\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/235/541/#p549\">\n    235 Mich. App. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20N.W.2d%20489\">\n    599 N.W.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). In this case, Blue Harvest moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that plaintiff's claim was based on premises liability and that plaintiff failed to produce any evidence that Blue Harvest was negligent. The trial court denied Blue Harvest's motion as it pertained to premises liability, concluding that Blue Harvest was not entitled to summary disposition for an apparent lack of actual or constructive notice\n   because LaLone created the hazardous condition and notice was imputed to Blue Harvest. Therefore, Blue Harvest's argument that it is entitled to summary disposition in relation to plaintiff's premises liability claim is preserved. However, it is less clear whether Blue Harvest has preserved its argument that plaintiff's ordinary negligence theory should have been summarily dismissed. While Blue Harvest alleged in its motion for summary disposition that plaintiff's claim sounds in premises liability, it did not argue in its brief or at the hearing that the ordinary negligence claim should be dismissed because plaintiff's lawsuit sounds\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   in premises liability. On the other hand, Blue Harvest did raise this argument in its motion for reconsideration, and the trial court denied the motion without holding a hearing. Regardless, \"this Court may overlook preservation requirements if the failure to consider the issue would result in manifest injustice, if consideration is necessary for a proper determination of the case, or if the issue involves a question of law and the facts necessary for its resolution have been presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

On review of the original and amended complaints, it is clear that the duties alleged sound exclusively in premises liability. In the original complaint, plaintiff claimed that Blue Harvest, as the owner of the premises, owed him the \"highest level of protection\": to warn of any dangers it should have known about, to make the premises safe for plaintiff, to maintain the premises in a safe manner, and to ensure that it employed methods to store pallets safely to protect plaintiff from falling objects. According to plaintiff, Blue Harvest breached its duty by failing to properly stack the pallets and boxes, failing to warn of the dangers associated with the\n   pallets and boxes, failing to make the premises safe, failing to inspect and maintain the premises to ensure that heavy boxes would not fall, and failing to otherwise protect plaintiff. In the amended complaint filed weeks before trial, plaintiff included both negligence theories. Under the count for ordinary negligence, plaintiff alleged that Blue Harvest failed to properly stack the pallets and keep them from falling, failed to ensure that the stack would not fall over, and stacked the pallets to an unsafe height using defective pallets. All of plaintiff's allegations focus on the hazardous condition, Blue Harvest's duty to protect plaintiff from the hazardous condition, or how Blue Harvest created the condition.\n   These allegations relate to the condition of the premises, i.e., the stack of pallets, and the complaint sounds in premises liability only. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred when it allowed plaintiff to proceed to trial on both theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That is not to say a plaintiff can never proceed on both negligence theories. However, in this case, plaintiff has not pleaded-nor do the facts provide-a basis that would maintain a theory of ordinary negligence. This Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In a negligence case, the theory of liability determines the nature of the duty owed.... In a premises liability claim, liability emanates merely from the defendant's duty as an owner, possessor, or occupier of land. However, that does not preclude a separate claim grounded on an independent theory of liability based on the defendant's conduct, as in this case. [\n   <em>\n    Laier v.

Plaintiff provided photographic evidence that Blue Harvest's storage practices included stacking pallets three or four high. Blue Harvest's owner, LaLone, admitted in his deposition that properly stacked pallets would not fall-implying pallets that fall could be improperly stacked. There was evidence that LaLone led plaintiff in close proximity of the pallets as they walked through the warehouse. And importantly, Blue Harvest failed to preserve the pallets of cardboard that had fallen. As provided in more detail later, plaintiff was entitled to an inference in his favor because of the spoliation of evidence. Thus, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, plaintiff presented sufficient evidence, albeit circumstantial, to prove that Blue Harvest failed to protect and warn plaintiff from an unreasonable risk of harm on the\n   premises. On the other hand, LaLone claimed that the incident was simply an accident likely caused by a cracked pallet, and Blue Harvest was in no way negligent.

Importantly, the Restatement does not expressly preclude the use of a res ipsa loquitur theory with premises liability claims as it does for gross negligence claims. Instead, the Restatement provides examples of when res ipsa loquitur applies to premises liability-type cases, such as when plaster unexpectedly falls from the ceiling, when a sign falls from a building, or when a chandelier falls from its fixture. See generally Restatement, \u00a7 328D, illustrations. Ultimately, res ipsa loquitur is \"merely one kind of case of circumstantial evidence, in which the jury may reasonably infer both negligence and causation from the mere occurrence of the event and the defendant's relation to it.\" Restatement, \u00a7 328D, comment\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   , p. 157. Premises liability is a theory of negligence, and therefore, we conclude that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may apply to premises liability claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Turning to the first element of res ipsa loquitur, we must ask whether \"the event [is] of a kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone's negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573356\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/473/1/#p7\">\n    473 Mich. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=702%20N.W.2d%20522\">\n    702 N.W.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Second Restatement of Torts provides the following guidance on this element:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    e. Permissible conclusion\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff's burden of proof (see \u00a7 328A) requires him to produce evidence which will permit the conclusion that it is more likely than not that his injuries were caused by the defendant's negligence. Where the probabilities are at best evenly divided between negligence and its absence, it becomes the duty of the\n   court to direct the jury that there is no sufficient proof.\n   The plaintiff need not, however, conclusively exclude all other possible explanations, and so prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Such proof is not required in civil actions, in contrast to criminal cases. It is enough that the facts proved reasonably permit the conclusion that negligence is the more probable explanation. This conclusion is not for the court to draw, or to refuse to draw, in any case where either conclusion is reasonable; and even though the court would not itself find negligence, it must still leave the question to the jury if reasonable men might do so. [ Restatement, \u00a7 328D, comment\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   , p. 159.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The evidence is clear that Blue Harvest's owner, LaLone, stacked the pallets of cardboard. Plaintiff and the trial court both rely on LaLone's testimony that a properly stacked pallet should not fall, leading to the reasonable inference that a falling pallet does so because it was improperly stacked. Moreover, the trial testimony is clear that Blue Harvest did not implement any safety precautions that could have prevented this type of accident. According to plaintiff's expert engineer who testified at trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the higher pallets are stacked, the more likely they are to fall over and injure someone. In this case, plaintiff's expert concluded that Blue Harvest's storage procedures, including stacking cardboard pallets three high, fell below the industry standard. Most importantly, Blue Harvest failed to preserve the one piece of evidence-the wooden pallets-that could have provided an answer to the ultimate question of why the pallets fell. Given the spoliation instruction provided, the jury could reasonably determine, beyond mere speculation, that the improper stacking and storing of the pallets was the likely cause of the injury. Thus, in consideration of this evidence, a jury could conclude that the event here would not be\n   something that occurs absent someone's negligence. That said, Blue Harvest has posited another viable theory-one that does not involve negligence at all. It claims that the pallets were properly stacked, but one pallet was cracked and therefore was the likely cause of the incident. We acknowledge that this is a plausible theory. The pallet could have been compromised when it was delivered to the warehouse or at the time it was stacked. Alternatively, the weight of the cardboard could have caused the defect in the pallet and shifted the stack off balance. However, when \"the facts proved reasonably permit the conclusion that negligence is the more probable explanation,\" this decision must be left to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The trial court did not err, particularly given the spoliation of evidence, when it allowed the jury to determine whether the falling pallets were an event that ordinarily does not happen in the absence of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The last three elements of res ipsa loquitur are also established. The evidence shows that Blue Harvest was in exclusive control of the premises, that plaintiff was in no way responsible for the event, and that Blue Harvest had ready access to any evidence of the true explanation of the event's happening.\n   <em>\n    Woodard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573356\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/473/1/#p7\">\n    473 Mich. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=702%20N.W.2d%20522\">\n    702 N.W.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Blue Harvest claims that the vendors also had control of the pallets, but LaLone testified that the pallets had been at the warehouse for almost a week before the event occurred. Therefore, this argument is without merit. Under the unique circumstances of this case,\n   the trial court did not err when it provided the jury instruction on res ipsa loquitur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, as intimated earlier, we must determine whether the trial court's spoliation instruction was\n   appropriate as a sanction because Blue Harvest disposed of the pallets and boxes that fell on plaintiff.

Blue Harvest's failure to preserve the pallets deprived plaintiff of the opportunity to inspect a possible cause of the collapse. As a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by providing the spoliation instruction because it merely permitted the jury to infer that the evidence would have been adverse to Blue Harvest if the jury did not believe that Blue Harvest's excuse for disposing of the pallets was reasonable. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 159-160,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.W.2d%2065\">\n    573 N.W.2d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did not err when it provided the spoliation instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Blue Harvest also contends that the trial court erred by not providing two supplemental instructions for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, Blue Harvest asked the trial court to provide the following instruction: \"[T]he happening of an accident in and of itself is not evidence of negligence.\" The trial court declined to do so, stating that the res ipsa loquitur instruction already covered that information. The instruction provided that the jury could infer\n   negligence on the part of Blue Harvest if it found that Blue Harvest had control over the pallets, that the falling of the pallets was the kind of event that does not ordinarily occur in the absence of someone's negligence, that the falling of the pallets was not due to any voluntary action on the part of plaintiff, and that the evidence of the true explanation of the event was more accessible to Blue Harvest than plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    Woodard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573356\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/473/1/#p7\">\n    473 Mich. at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=702%20N.W.2d%20522\">\n    702 N.W.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the jury had to find that the four elements of res ipsa loquitur were met before inferring negligence in this case. Accordingly, the instruction that Blue Harvest asked the trial court to provide-\"the happening of an accident in and of itself is not evidence of negligence\"-was properly covered by the res ipsa loquitur instruction.

Civ. JI 50.01. In addition, the trial court provided: \"Your determination of the facts in this case must be based only upon the evidence admitted during the trial. Evidence consists of the sworn testimony of the witnesses. It also includes exhibits, which are documents or other things introduced into evidence.\" See M. Civ. JI 2.04 (1).

In addition, Blue Harvest had access to the doctor's medical records, and it could have subpoenaed the doctor to appear at trial. The trial court concluded that Blue Harvest could not claim prejudice for not having the opportunity to cross-examine a witness who was not testifying at trial (because plaintiff no longer planned to have him testify\n   and Blue Harvest did not submit a witness list). Ultimately, the trial court determined that Blue Harvest created its own problem by not preparing a witness list and that there were other means by which the evidence could be presented (medical records). Therefore, the trial court denied Blue Harvest's motion for an adjournment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Blue Harvest's motion for an adjournment.
