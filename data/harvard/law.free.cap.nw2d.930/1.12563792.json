Minnesota Medical Solutions LLC (MMS) is one of two companies in Minnesota that is allowed to manufacture and distribute medical marijuana. MMS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vireo Health LLC (VH). VH also wholly owns another subsidiary, Vireo Health of New York LLC (VHNY), which produces and distributes medical marijuana in the state of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the time of the events alleged in the complaint, defendant Ronald Dale Owens was the Chief Security Officer for MMS. Defendant Laura Lynn Bultman, M.D., was the Chief Medical Officer of MMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December of 2015, defendants discovered that VHNY could not produce a sufficient amount of medical marijuana to satisfy the requirements set by the state of New York. To supply this need in New York, defendants personally transferred 5.6 kilograms of concentrated cannabis oil, a derivative of marijuana containing its active ingredient, from MMS to VHNY in an armored truck. To effectuate this transfer, defendants falsified inventory records for both MMS and VHNY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state charged defendants with intentionally transferring medical cannabis to a person other than allowed by law, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn.

The statutes prohibit the transfer of medical marijuana from one company to another.

It is well settled that a corporation possesses a legal existence separate from its stockholders.\"). Even if MMS had transferred the medical marijuana to its parent corporation-where the companies are only one step removed-that would still violate section 152.33. Thus, the transfer of medical marijuana from one sister subsidiary to another-where the companies are two steps removed-is a transfer to a separate \"person\" under the statute. There is no justification for us to consider the intent of the legislature or underlying legal principles because the application of the statute to the instant facts is clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Additionally, this is not a case in which the application of the plain language of the statute produces an absurd result such that we would be free to look beyond the plain language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anker v.

Feb. 9, 1996). The statutes involved prohibit the physical transfer of medical marijuana from one corporation to another, and defendants violated this prohibition. Given the heavily regulated nature of medical marijuana and the fact that it is still illegal under federal law, we cannot say that imposing criminal sanctions for impermissibly transferring medical marijuana from one subsidiary to another creates an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We therefore hold that the term \"person\" in the context of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn.

They frame the issue as, \"could two related corporate entities be separate enough to reach an agreement to conspire with each other, or are they one in the same for criminal liability?\" This issue statement represents a misapprehension of both the law and the facts of this case.

In short, while defendants seek to analogize to\n   <em>\n    Fogie\n   </em>\n   , the case is simply inapposite. We therefore reject defendants' invitation to apply antitrust principles to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Other arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants also argue that this court should reverse the district court based on the rule of lenity. Defendants have failed to cite to caselaw that applies this rule. The first case defendants cite to in this section,\n   <em>\n    State v. Mauer\n   </em>\n   , addressed the constitutionality and interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362988\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/741/107/#p110\">\n    741 N.W.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110-13 (Minn. 2007). The second case,\n   <em>\n    State v. Olson\n   </em>\n   , involved a claim that a statute unconstitutionally violated the separation of powers doctrine.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10671833\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/325/13/#p16\">\n    325 N.W.2d 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (Minn. 1982). Neither of these cases involve the rule of lenity, nor does either opinion even contain the word \"lenity.\"\n   <em>\n    Mauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362988\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/741/107/#p110\">\n    741 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   107-116 ;\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10671833\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/325/13/#p16\">\n    325 N.W.2d at 13-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And further, the rule of lenity only applies after a statute has been found to be ambiguous-something that defendants do not even explicitly allege, much less argue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Thonesavanh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338046\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/904/432/#p440\">\n    904 N.W.2d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (Minn. 2017) (\"[T]he overwhelming weight of authority is that the rule of lenity is a canon of last resort, applicable 'only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p429\">\n    555 U.S. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679422\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/415/#p429\">\n    129 S.

We therefore hold that the rule of lenity does not apply here because defendants have failed to meet their threshold burden of establishing that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants also argue that their transfer of medical marijuana to New York state is not a crime there based on their reading of a New York statute that \"can be read as a companion to ours.\" They argue that the Minnesota statute therefore \"has a gap\" because it does not \"specifically prohibit ... the intra-transfer between commonly held sister corporations.\" But\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1, plainly prohibits\n   that activity, and the fact that New York has different laws and/or exercises its prosecutorial discretion differently is not relevant to our analysis. This argument also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, defendants raise a new argument in their reply brief about\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1a, which only became effective in May of 2017. They argue that because subdivision 1a specifically prohibits the interstate transfer of medical marijuana, convicting defendants under subdivision 1 for their actions in December 2015 is essentially an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   application of subdivision 1a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This argument fails for three reasons. First, defendants did not raise it in their initial brief and so it goes beyond the permissible scope of a reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. R. Civ. App. P 128.02, subd. 4 (\"The reply brief must be confined to new matter raised in the brief of the respondent.\"). Second, while subdivision 1a contemplates revocation of registration and a fine, it does not provide for criminal penalties and does not preclude the application of a criminal statute that arguably creates some overlap of prohibited behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1a (allowing for penalties up to a $ 250,000 fine and the initiation of proceedings to revoke registration). And third, both subdivisions 1 and 1a begin by stating, \"In addition to any other applicable penalty in law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , subds. 1, 1a. Neither subdivision mandates that it is an exclusive sanction. We therefore hold that defendants' argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We hold that sister wholly owned subsidiaries of the same parent corporation are separate \"persons\" under the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20152.33\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 152.33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , subd. 1. And defendants' other arguments do not provide a basis for us to look beyond the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Certified question answered in the negative.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
