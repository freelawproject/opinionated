Respondent, the Board of Pensions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, d/b/a Portico Benefit Services (Portico), manages retirement accounts for employees of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (the church) and employees of organizations affiliated with the church. The plan is a defined-contribution plan, and the participants' retirement benefits are determined by the performance of the investments in the plan. There are over 39,000 participants in the plan nationally. Portico manages over $4 billion in assets for the plan, which are held in a trust with Portico as the trustee. The plan states that fiduciaries \"shall discharge [their] duties with respect to the Retirement Plan solely in the interests of [appellant] members.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     The plan consists of two separate plans: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Retirement Plan (ELCA plan), and the ELCA Retirement Plan for Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society (GSS plan). The plan includes 20 different investment funds from which plan participants can pick and choose to invest. Portico designs, manages, and controls these funds. Portico charges two types of fees for management: investment fees and administrative fees. The investment fees are determined by varying assignments of basis points and are determined the same way for both plans. The administrative fees are different for each plan. For the ELCA plan, the administrative fees are calculated based on the percentage share of assets within each ELCA fund and can change based on fluctuating expenses and total assets. GSS fees consist of a flat basis-point fee and an annual account fee.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     Appellant plan members Pastor David Bacon, Pastor Timothy Hepner, Ruth Dold, and Sharon Hvam (members) filed suit against Portico in March 2015. Members seek recovery of monetary losses to\n     the plan and seek equitable relief, such as removal of Portico as trustee, injunctive relief, restitution, accounting, and the creation of a constructive trust.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     Portico moved to dismiss the action, and the district court granted the motion under the excessive-entanglement doctrine. This court reversed the district court's dismissal and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n     <em>\n      Bacon v.

The district court certified an opt-out class under Minn. R. Civ. P. 23.02(c) with respect to members' claims that Portico charged excessive fees (excessive-fees claims) and denied certification with respect to members' claims that Portico mismanaged funds (underperformance claims). The district court denied members' request to certify the class under Minn. R. Civ. P. 23.02(a) as a mandatory class for both claims. Members filed a petition for discretionary review, asking this court to review the district court's denial of certification under Minn. R. Civ. P. 23.02(a) with respect to the excessive-fees claim. This court granted discretionary review.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     <strong>\n      ISSUE\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     Did the district court abuse its discretion by denying class certification under Minn.

Members further contend that claims seeking monetary recovery and equitable relief for a trust can be certified under rule 23.02(a) and that the district court misinterpreted\n     <em>\n      Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Minn. R. Civ. P. 23.01(a)-(d). The district court determined, and the parties do not dispute, that members' claim for excessive fees met the requirements of rule 23.01.

R. Civ. P. 23.02(c), relying on\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     . It characterized members' claims as individualized monetary claims because any relief would be payable into members' individual accounts. As a result, the district court stated that it \"declines to hold that the action is maintainable under Minnesota's parallel Rule 23.02(a)\" based on\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     Here, members seek to recover losses to the plan assets as a result of Portico's breach of fiduciary duty that it owed to the plan as a whole. Because these are not individualized claims for monetary relief,\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     is not controlling.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Jones\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4244905\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/257/181/#p193\">\n      257 F.R.D. at 194\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"questions concerning whether the fiduciaries breached their duties to the plan are not individual\"). Moreover,\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     did not even address the rule at issue in this case. It addressed federal rule 23(b)(2), not federal\n     rule 23(b)(1). The\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     court simply made a broad statement regarding class certification of individualized monetary claims with respect to federal rule 23(b)(2) claims. Therefore, we hold that a class action may be certified as a mandatory class under rule 23.02(a) when the class seeks monetary recovery and equitable relief on behalf of a retirement plan, rather than on behalf of individual participants, for excessive fees charged by the plan's trustee.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-32\">\n     In the class-certification context, a district court abuses its discretion if it adopts an incorrect legal rule or misapplies the rule 23 factors.\n     <em>\n      Whitaker\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121976\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/764/631/#p635\">\n      764 N.W.2d at 636\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . However, because members' claims involve both equitable and monetary relief sought on behalf of the plan as a whole,\n     <em>\n      Dukes\n     </em>\n     is not dispositive here. And when a class is eligible for certification under rules 23.02(a) and (c), rule 23.02(a) controls.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Leber\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%20145\">\n      323 F.R.D. at 165\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (applying federal counterparts to rules 23.02(a) and (c) ).

Because members seek monetary and equitable relief on behalf of the plan as a whole, rather than asserting individualized monetary claims, the district court abused its discretion in denying rule 23.02(a) certification by relying on\n     <em>\n      Dukes.\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     <strong>\n      Reversed and remanded.\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p label=\"1\">\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-38\">\n     Nonetheless, some courts have declined to certify similar classes under federal rule 23(b)(1).\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      In re First Am.
