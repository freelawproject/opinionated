Relator's claim arose from the early termination of relator's lease of a bowling alley due to the construction of a soccer stadium and related infrastructure in St. Paul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The city denied relator's claim for relocation benefits on the ground that a private party, rather than the city, acquired the property at issue. On March 7, 2018, the city initiated a contested-case proceeding in the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). In a January 18, 2019 order, the ALJ granted the city's motion for summary disposition and affirmed the city's denial of relator's claim for relocation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 7, 2019, relator filed with the clerk of the appellate courts a petition for writ of certiorari, a proposed writ, a statement of the case, and proof of service of the petition for the writ of certiorari, and served the other appeal documents on counsel for the city. The clerk of the appellate courts issued the writ of certiorari that same day. Relator served both the petition for the writ of certiorari and the issued writ on counsel for the city by certified mail on February 9, 2019. Relator served the issued writ of certiorari on the OAH by first-class mail on February 9, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The city filed a motion to discharge the writ of certiorari on the grounds that relator failed to timely serve the petition for the writ on the OAH and the writ of certiorari was directed improperly to the city rather than to the OAH. Relator filed a response opposing the motion. On February 27, 2019, relator served the petition for the writ of certiorari on the OAH by certified mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a certiorari appeal, the appeal period and the acts required to invoke appellate jurisdiction are governed by the applicable statute.
