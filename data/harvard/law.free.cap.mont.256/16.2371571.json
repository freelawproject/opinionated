The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">Before hearing the application, the Defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, hut also to increase it if such is possible. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">After careful consideration, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to ten (10) years, all of which shall be suspended. Plus the following conditions shall be imposed:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">(1) That the defendant be placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections subject to any and all rules of that Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">(2) That the defendant not consume any alcoholic beverages nor will he consume any drug that is not prescribed by his physician in the quantities prescribed. In the event that he is prescribed medication by a physician, he shall report this to his probation officer within 72 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">(3) That he not be allowed to drive a motor vehicle without having liability insurance and without being licensed by the Montana authorities or any other jurisdiction while on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-20\">(4) That he must enroll and successfully complete the Faith Works Treatment Program in Kalispell, Montana, under the direction of Mr. Bill Davison.
