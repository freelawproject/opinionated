All other conditions are affirmed including the provision that the defendant shall successfully complete the sex offender program and the chemical dependency treatment at Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">The reason for the decision is the defendant has no history of violence and no prior criminal record when he committed the offense of sexual assault in 1989.</p>\n<judges id=\"b492-18\">Hon.
