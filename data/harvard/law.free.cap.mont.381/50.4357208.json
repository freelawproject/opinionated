Clark and Nancy R. Clark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon appeals, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in ordering Gordon to make an equalization payment within 120 days or be forced to sell or transfer the ranch.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in failing to consider tax liabilities associated with selling the ranch.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in its valuation of the ranch.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_N\">\u00b62 We affirm on the first and third issues, but reverse and remand on the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">\u00b63 Gordon and Nancy married in 1996 and separated in 2012 with no children bom to the marriage. Nancy entered the marriage with property on the Stillwater River near Absarokee, Montana (\u201cthe river house\u201d) and Gordon entered the marriage with property near Acton, Montana (\u201cthe ranch\u201d). The parties put both properties under joint title upon their marriage. Both parties are currently in their sixties and Nancy has a number of health issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">\u00b64 After the parties separated, Nancy filed a motion for temporary maintenance. The District Court ordered Gordon to pay $2,800 in temporary maintenance per month beginning in November 2012 and continuing until final resolution unless the river house sold first. Gordon made payments from November 2012 through February 2013 but then stopped. Gordon also stopped making mortgage payments on the ranch in early 2012, sending that property into foreclosure. The parties sold 160 acres of the ranch to a neighbor for $800 per acre and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>used the proceeds to bring the mortgage current in early 2013. Gordon again stopped making mortgage payments on the ranch, however, sending it into foreclosure for a second time in July 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b65 The river house was sold in early 2013. After Gordon stopped paying temporary maintenance, the District Court allowed Nancy to draw her temporary maintenance from the river house proceeds. At the time of the final decree, the District Court estimated that $289,681.23 remained in proceeds from the river house\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b66 The ranch\u2019s value was a major issue at trial. The parties each employed experts to testify about the property\u2019s value. Gordon\u2019s expert valued the ranch at $1,172,513. Nancy\u2019s expert valued the property at $2,667,940. Gordon also indicated at trial that he would not sell the ranch for $1,172,513, but would consider selling it for $2.4 million. Neither party presented evidence on the tax implications of selling the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b67 The District Court valued the ranch at $2.45 million and valued the totality of the marital estate at approximately $2.6 million. In its distribution of the marital estate, the court awarded the ranch and its associated debt to Gordon. The District Court found that the ranch \u201cdoes not provide a substantial amount of income to [Gordon].\u201d The Court awarded $955,297.96 or approximately 37% of the estate to Nancy, including requiring Gordon to make an equalization payment of $650,000 to Nancy within 120 days from the date of the order. The court specified that if Gordon did not make such a payment in the allotted time, the ranch was to be sold \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d and the equalization payment drawn from proceeds of the sale. The court also specified that if Gordon did not cooperate with the sale of the ranch, the property would transfer solely into Nancy\u2019s name so that she could handle its sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">\u00b68 After the dissolution decree was entered, Gordon filed a motion under M. R. Civ, P. 52 for the District Court to amend its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and under M. R. Civ. P. 59 for amendment of judgment and a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>without explanation. Gordon appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b69 We generally review a district court\u2019s valuation and distribution of a marital estate for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Thorner, </em>2008 MT 270, \u00b6 21, 345 Mont. 194, 190 P.3d 1063. Although the parties dispute the standard of review to apply to Gordon\u2019s appeal considering he provided notice of appeal only from the District Court\u2019s denial of post-trial motions, we consistently have applied an abuse of discretion standard to post-trial motions on discretionary dissolution matters. <em>In re Marriage of Anderson, </em>2013 MT 238, \u00b6 13, 371 Mont. 321, 307 P.3d 313; <em>In re Marriage of Johnson, </em>2011 MT 255, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 236, 262 P.3d 1105; <em>In re Marriage of Schoenthal, </em>2005 MT 24, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 15, 106 P.3d 1162. Further, we review findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); <em>In re Marriage of Patton, </em>2015 MT 7, \u00b6 18, 378 Mont. 22, 340 P.3d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in ordering Gordon to make an equalization payment within 120 days or be forced to sell or transfer the ranch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b611 The District Court ordered Gordon to make an equalization payment of $650,000 to Nancy within 120 days of its June 17, 2014 dissolution order or else have the marital ranch placed on the market and sold \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d with the net proceeds of the sale applied toward the equalization payment. Gordon argues that this was an abuse of discretion,</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b612 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, requires a district court to \u201cequitably apportion\u201d a marital estate upon dissolution. A district court has broad discretion in apportioning the estate, <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 46, but the discretion has limits. For instance, a district court abuses its discretion when it apportions more property to a party than is found in the marital estate. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>2006 MT 56, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 315, 132 P.3d 535. Relatedly, we have expressed concern about a monetary distribution award that is larger than the liquid assets of the party ordered to pay and that requires immediate payment. Such an award may be an abuse of discretion depending on the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>circumstances of a case. <em>Compare In re Marriage of Schwartz, </em>2013 MT 145, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 370 Mont. 294, 308 P.3d 949 (remanding for the district court to enter a deferred payment plan where an up-front equalization payment would require the husband to sell his business and would undermine his future ability to earn an income), with <em>In re Marriage of Westland, </em>257 Mont. 169, 172, 848 P.2d 492, 494 (1993) (upholding a district court\u2019s order requiring an up-front payment from the husband where future payments were not assured or secured and the husband potentially could transfer assets or enter bankruptcy to the wife\u2019s detriment). As we explained in Schwartz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">It is not error per se to make an award greater than the payor\u2019s liquid assets, if the payor can sell or refinance property to meet the obligation. Such an award is not ideal, however, for there are various disadvantages to compelling sale in the divorce case. Most importantly, sale requires payment of capital gains costs, commissions, and other expenses, and property often fails to earn full value when sold under the pressure of divorce. Because of these disadvantages, an immediate monetary award which exceeds the value of the payor\u2019s liquid assets is a remedy of last rather than first resort. A better option would be division in kind (if division can be accomplished without violating the rule against co-ownership), or a monetary award deferred over sufficient time for liquid fimds to be accumulated without sale. If the payor cannot reasonably sell assets or borrow liquid funds to pay an immediate monetary award, the making of such an award is error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axf\"><em>Schwartz, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting Brett R. Turner, 3 <em>Equitable Distribution of Property </em>\u00a7 9.9, 31-33 (3d ed. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b613 Gordon employs the above quote to argue that the District Court\u2019s order requiring an immediate equalization payment or sale of the ranch was error. What <em>Schwartz </em>makes clear, however, is that whether the structure of an equalization payment is error depends on the particular circumstances of a case. <em>Schwartz, </em>\u00b6 34 (\u201cIn the right circumstances, a deferred monetary award may be preferable to an ordered sale of asset....\u201d). To that end, Nancy argues that the District Court\u2019s order specifying a 120-day timeline for the equalization payment and consequences of failing to comply was justified in this case because of Gordon\u2019s lack of cooperation throughout the dissolution proceedings. We agree that the District Court\u2019s equalization order was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b614  As mentioned, Gordon ceased temporary maintenance payments while this case was pending and twice allowed the ranch to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>slip into foreclosure. Additionally, Nancy is without work and suffering medical issues, and Gordon already has attempted to discharge debts through bankruptcy once in recent years. Further, the evidence showed that a partial sale of the ranch property had occurred previously to satisfy debt. Given these facts, the District Court acted within its sound discretion to order an up-front equalization payment and to incentivize Gordon\u2019s cooperation by specifying consequences for failing to make the payment within the specified time, including the forced sale of the ranch or its transfer to Nancy for sale. <em>See Westland, </em>257 Mont. at 172, 848 P.2d at 494,</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b615 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in failing to consider tax liabilities associated with selling the ranch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b616 Under \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, a district court equitably apportioning an estate must take into account \u201cliabilities,\u201d among other factors. In <em>In re Marriage of Beck, </em>193 Mont. 166, 631 P.2d 282 (1981), we held that where a property distribution ordered by a court includes a taxable event precipitating a concrete and immediate tax liability, such tax liability should be considered by the court before entering its final judgment. <em>Beck, </em>193 Mont. at 172, 631 P.2d at 285. The failure to consider the tax consequences of such a \u201cconcrete and immediate\u201d event is an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Thorner, </em>2008 MT 270, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47, 345 Mont. 194, 190 P.3d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b617 Gordon argues that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the tax consequences of selling the ranch. The District Court\u2019s dissolution decree does not reference any liabilities associated with selling the ranch. Nancy argues, however, that no such consideration was necessary in this case because the consequences were speculative rather than concrete and immediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b618 Determining whether a tax event is the concrete and immediate result of a distribution order requires examining the context around the distribution order. To find that a taxable event is concrete and immediate, we have not demanded that the distribution order specifically direct the very event that triggers taxation. <em>See Thorner, </em>\u00b6 45 (\u201cWe note that the decree does not require that $31,595 be withdrawn from Julie\u2019s retirement account. Still there is no doubt that the District Court\u2019s decree required a distribution to Ron of this amount as a part of the parties\u2019 retirement assets.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Lee, </em>249 Mont. 516, 517-19, 816 P.2d 1076, 1076-78 (tracing the necessity of liquidating assets constituting a taxable event to the District Court\u2019s distribution order). But, viewing the surrounding circumstances, we have demanded that the distribution order at least reasonably appear to trigger a taxable event. <em>See In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Haberkern, </em>2004 MT 29, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 319 Mont. 393, 85 P.3d 743 (concluding that a husband\u2019s testimony that assets he was distributed may eventually be taxed did not establish a concrete and immediate tax liability); <em>In re Marriage of DeBuff, </em>2002 MT 159, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, 310 Mont. 382, 50 P.3d 1070 (concluding that a concrete and immediate tax liability was not triggered by order where husband agreed he had \u201ca variety of other [non-taxed] options available\u201d to provide funds necessary to satisfy equalization payment obligation); <em>In re Marriage of Turbes, </em>234 Mont. 152, 159-60, 762 P.2d 237, 241-42 (1988) (concluding that the event triggering any tax Lability, which itself was theoretical, was an accord and satisfaction that occurred before the District Court\u2019s order).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b619 In this case, both the surrounding circumstances and the order itself implicate a significant taxable event. The District Court ordered Gordon to make a $650,000 equalization payment to Nancy. The only asset worth that amount in Gordon\u2019s possession is the ranch. The District Court ordered that, if the equalization payment was not made within 120 days, the ranch be sold \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to satisfy Gordon\u2019s equalization obligation. Although Nancy argues that Gordon could find funds to pay his obligation by refinancing or mortgaging instead of selling the ranch, she does not suggest how Gordon would be able to obtain quickly such a substantial loan in light of his undisputed lack of substantial income and the recent foreclosure actions. Nancy also argues that a portion of the ranch \u2014 instead of the entire ranch \u2014 could be sold to finance the equalization payment, but a taxable event presumably will occur with any sale of the property sufficient to raise $650,000. The District Court\u2019s order makes a substantial sale of ranch property concrete and immediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b620 Nancy further argues that, even if a tax event is a concrete and immediate result of the District Court\u2019s order, Gordon failed to present evidence of the tax that would befall him upon selling the ranch and thus waived the argument. Nancy cites <em>In re Marriage of Taylor, </em>257 Mont. 122, 848 P.2d 478 (1993), and <em>Turbes </em>as support. In <em>Taylor, </em>we rejected a husband\u2019s argument that a district court erred by not taking into account all of his company\u2019s liabilities because (1) \u201cno evidence was introduced at trial relating to a concrete and immediate tax liability,\u201d (2) the husband introduced no evidence that he would \u201chave to sell his stock in order to pay any cash award,\u201d and (3) the court did not order him to sell his stock. <em>Taylor, </em>257 Mont. at 127, 848 P.2d at 481. In <em>Turbes, </em>we stated that a wife \u201cfailed to produce adequate evidence at the hearing upon which the court could make a determination of the existence of tax consequences,\u201d where the wife offered only an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cunsubstantiated belief\u2019 \u2014 conflicting with other evidence \u2014 that she \u201ctheoretical[ly]\u201d would incur a tax liability. <em>Turbes, </em>234 Mont. at 159-60, 762 P.2d at 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b621  In contrast to <em>Turbes </em>and <em>Taylor, </em>there is a concrete and immediate tax event contemplated on the face of the District Court\u2019s order in this case. The District Court\u2019s short timeline for the equalization payment effectively renders selling the ranch the only reasonable option to make the payment. Further, the District Court specifically ordered that the ranch be sold if the payment is not made within the timeline. Finally, the record suggests that the first mention of a possible sale of the ranch appeared the day before trial in Nancy\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions. The 120-day deadline was imposed sua sponte by the court in its final decree. After the District Court ordered the ranch sold if Gordon did not make the equalization payment within that time period, Gordon filed a post-trial motion bringing his liabilities argument to the District Court\u2019s attention. In the unusual and particular circumstances of this case, we hold that Gordon did not waive his right to raise his tax argument on appeal. Once raised in Gordon\u2019s post-trial motion, the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the tax liabilities associated with selling the ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b622 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in its valuation of the ranch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ArM\">\u00b623 Gordon argues that the District Court\u2019s valuation of the ranch at $2.45 million is not supported by the record. A District Court may adopt any valuation of marital property that is reasonable in light of the evidence. <em>In re Marriage of Meeks, </em>276 Mont. 237, 242-43, 915 P.3d 831, 834-35 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b624  The District Court chose a valuation that was between Gordon\u2019s proposed $1,172,513 valuation and Nancy\u2019s proposed $2,667,940 valuation. The court justified its choice by \u201cconsidering comparable properties as well as the whole Ranch property and all of the improvements made thereon,\u201d and Gordon\u2019s testimony that he would consider selling the property for $2.4 million. The court reduced N anejas proposed valuation by approximately $217,000because of \u201cthe insufficient support in the record and the speculation that dividing the ranch parcels would increase the value.\u201d Gordon takes issue with this explanation, arguing that the amount of the reduction does not match the court\u2019s rejection of the view of Nancy\u2019s expert on the potential for subdividing the ranch. However, based on the record on appeal \u2014 including the bases for the proposed valuations, the price at which the parties sold a portion of the ranch during dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>proceedings, and Gordon\u2019s admission about the price at which he would consider selling the property \u2014 the District Court\u2019s valuation is supported by substantial evidence. Because there is conflicting evidence, it was within the District Court\u2019s province to weigh the evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses, and value the ranch accordingly. <em>See Koppen v. </em>Bolich, 2003 MT 313, \u00b6 42, 318 Mont. 240, 79 P.3d 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b625 We affirm the District Court\u2019s valuation of the ranch and the structure of its equalization payment order. We reverse the final property distribution because it fails to consider tax liabilities associated with selling the ranch and those liabilities potentially affect an equitable apportionment of the estate. We remand for further consideration of such tax liabilities and entry of an amended property distribution order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-15\"> As part of the dissolution, Nancy was restored to her former name, Nancy R.
