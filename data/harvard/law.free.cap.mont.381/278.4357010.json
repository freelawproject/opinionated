Hala appealed to the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, and filed a motion to suppress the results of two separate blood alcohol concentration (BAC) tests. Following the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion, Hala entered a guilty plea and reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">\u00b62 Hala raises two issues on appeal that we state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\n<em>1. Was a blood test, drawn over 8 hours after the act of driving, taken within a reasonable time under the circumstances ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by holding that certain evidence was admissible under the \u201cinevitable discovery rule\u201d when the State made that argument for the first time at the hearing on Hala\u2019s motion to suppress?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b63 Because we affirm the judgment based upon resolution of the first issue, we decline to reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b64 Hala was driving along Highway 191, between Lewistown and Roy, Montana, on November 16, 2013, when his Chevy pickup truck drifted off the road and crashed at approximately 12:30 a.m. Hala was injured and unable to call for assistance; the single-car accident went unreported until about 5:00 a.m. when passing hunters saw Hala\u2019s truck and called authorities. Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Joseph DeJong was dispatched to the scene and arrived shortly after 6:30 a.m. At roughly this same time, emergency personnel had also arrived, and they transported Hala to the nearby Central Montana Medical Center (CMMC) via ambulance. Trooper DeJong did not see or speak to Hala at the scene of the accident. When Hala arrived at CMMC at about 6:45 a.m., his blood was drawn for medical purposes. This test (6:45 a.m. test), a blood plasma test, indicated a BAC of 0.17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkDE\">\u00b65 After determining that \u201cthe tracks from the crash were consistent with someone falling asleep or passing out,\u201d Trooper DeJong arrived at CMMC at approximately 8:10 a.m. to interview Hala. When questioned, Hala admitted to DeJong that he had been drinking in Lewistown before starting to drive home, and also admitted to taking Oxycodone and OxyContin for neck pain. DeJong could smell the odor of alcohol around Hala, and additionally noted that his eyes appeared bloodshot and glassy. DeJong performed a horizontal gaze nystagmus test on Hala, whose score indicated that he was under the influence. At this point, DeJong requested a blood sample from Hala, who verbally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>agreed after DeJong read the implied consent advisory. A CMMC registered nurse drew a second blood sample from Hala at approximately 8:30 a.m. This test (8:30 a.m. test) was a whole blood test. This test was later sent to the Montana Crime Lab and indicated a BAG of 0.122.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b66 DeJong asked if Hala would also release the results of the 6:45 a.m. test to him. Hala agreed, and a nurse wrote \u201cverbal consent given\u201d on the hospital\u2019s authorization form. Two people witnessed Hala\u2019s authorization but Hala did not sign the form himself. Hala was then \u201clife-flighted\u201d to a Billings hospital due to his neck injuries, and afterwards, DeJong received the results of the 6:45 a.m. test from CMMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b67 Hala was charged with DUI \u201cper se\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-406(l)(a), MCA, and was found guilty following a bench trial in Justice Court in Fergus County, which is not a court of record. He appealed to the Tenth Judicial District Court for a trial de novo. Before trial, Hala filed a motion to suppress the results of both the 6:45 a.m. and the 8:30 a.m. BAG tests, arguing that the 8:30 a.m. test should be suppressed because it was not taken within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(4), MCA. Hala argued the 6:45 a.m. test should be suppressed because the release of this test result to DeJong violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). After holding an evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Hala\u2019s motion to suppress, holding the 8:30 a.m. test was taken within a reasonable time. The District Court also held there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the release of the 6:45 a.m. test violated HIPAA, but concluded that \u201cany defect in the authorization would constitute harmless error\u201d under the inevitable discovery doctrine. Hala then entered a guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b68 \u201cWe review the denial of a motion to suppress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether it correctly applied those findings as a matter of law.\u201d <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Missoula v. Iosefo, </em>2014 MT 209, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 161, 330 P.3d 1180 (citation omitted) (reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress in an aggravated DUI case).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b69 <em>1. Was a blood test, drawn over 8 hours after the act of driving, taken within a reasonable time under the circumstances?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b610 Hala argues that the 8:30 a.m. BAG test, taken more them eight hours after the estimated time of the driving and crashing of his pickup, \u201cis just not reasonable.\u201d We disagree and affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b611 Section 61-8-406(l)(a), MCA, the DUI \u201cper se\u201d statute, prohibits a person from driving or being in control of a noncommercial motor vehicle on a public roadway while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. Section 61-8-401(4), MCA, the DUI statute, provides that the concentration of alcohol from a test \u201ctaken within a reasonable time after the alleged act\u201d gives rise to certain evidentiary inferences at trial. As we have noted, \u201c[t]he DUI statute therefore explicitly allows for law enforcement to determine a person\u2019s alcohol concentration a reasonable time after the alleged act, while the DUI Per Se statute refers only to a person\u2019s alcohol concentration <em>while they are driving.\u201d State v. McGowan, </em>2006 MT 163, \u00b6 10, 332 Mont. 490, 139 P.3d 841 (emphasis added). Nonetheless, in <em>McGowan, </em>we interpreted the DUI \u201cper se\u201d statute \u201cto allow for the admissibility of... tests administered within a reasonable amount of time after the alleged act of driving while under the influence ... .\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 17. This holding made it unnecessary to \u201cprove evidence of a person\u2019s alcohol concentration at the time that they were driving through retrograde extrapolation evidence.\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 18. \u201cRetrograde extrapolation represents the technique through which experts estimate alcohol concentration at some earlier time based on the test results at some later time.\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 18. Therefore, we apply the requirement of taking an alcohol concentration test \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d \u00a7 61-8-401(4), MCA, to DUI \u201cper se\u201d prosecutions. <em>McGowan, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2002 MT 263, 312 Mont. 249, 59 P.3d 387, this Court considered a similar DUI case and addressed the issue of taking alcohol concentration tests \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Hamilton similarly was involved in a single-car crash in the early hours of the morning; the county sheriff arrived at the scene at approximately 1:30 a.m., and observed the smell of alcohol on the defendant. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-6. After emergency crews removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Hamilton from the car with \u201cJaws of Life\u201d equipment, he was taken to the hospital for treatment, arriving around 3:10 a.m., where he was met by a Montana Highway Patrol trooper who noted that Hamilton smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot and glassy eyes. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 7. The hospital drew a blood sample at 3:54 a.m., over three hours after the accident had been initially reported. The blood draw indicated a BAC result of 0.26. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b613 Hamilton argued the three hours that had elapsed between the time he was in physical control of his truck and the time his blood was drawn violated the requirement that a blood sample be taken within a reasonable time of the alleged act. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 12. We held that \u201cthe statute requires a court to look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a blood test was taken within a reasonable time of the alleged act,\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 17, and upheld the test, reasoning that \u201cthe test was not unreasonably delayed by the investigating officers, under the circumstances in this case.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b614  Hala was involved in a single-car accident and sustained serious enough injuries that he was unable to call for emergency assistance, and later was \u201clife-flighted\u201d to another medical facility. Because the accident occurred during night hours and Hala was unable to obtain assistance, the accident went undiscovered for four to five horn\u2019s, until hunters fortuitously passed by and reported the accident. Emergency personnel arrived on the scene and transported Hala to CMMC, arriving approximately six horns after the accident. Trooper DeJong arrived at the scene as Hala was being taken to CMMC, and began his investigation without seeing or speaking to Hala. After an initial investigation, DeJong proceeded to CMMC and interviewed Hala, noting that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that he smelled of alcohol. DeJong requested a blood draw within twenty minutes of arriving at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b615 We conclude that the test requested by DeJong was taken within a reasonable time. As in <em>Hamilton, </em>the officer did not unreasonably delay initiation of the test, given the circumstances of the accident. <em>Hamilton, </em>\u00b6 21. The District Court did not err by denying Hala\u2019s motion to suppress on this ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u00b616 <em>2. Did the District Court err by holding that certain evidence was admissible under the \u201cinevitable discovery rule\u201d when the State made that argument for the first time at the hearing on Hala\u2019s motion to suppress?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b617 Hala next contends that the District Court erred when it considered the \u201cinevitable discovery rule\u201d argument raised by the State for the first time at the evidentiary hearing, and by ignoring his claim that the release of the 6:45 a.m. test results violated HIPAA. However, because we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on the first issue, and thereby affirm the use of the 8:30 a.m. test result, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> As explained at the evidentiary hearing, plasma blood tests are performed on the liquid portion of a drawn blood sample, after the solid cellular components have been removed. This is in contrast to tests performed on whole blood, or blood that has not been broken down into solid and liquid components. The distinction becomes important when considering the reported BAC results; typically a plasma test will produce a result approximately 10-15% higher than a whole blood test drawn at the same time. The expert witness from the Montana Crime Lab testified that Hala\u2019s 0.17 plasma BAC would equate to approximately 0.14 whole blood BAC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\"> The State argues that this case is more properly described as a \u201cdenial of a motion in limine based on an objection to evidence as irrelevant,\u201d and not the denial of a motion to suppress. However, the parties briefed and argued the issue as a motion to suppress, the District Court ruled on it as a motion to suppress, and we will continue in the same vein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> Hala also briefly argues that \u201cthe District Court erred by refusing to limit the purpose for the admission of the BAC result even though this was specifically requested\u201d (internal citations omitted). At the evidentiary hearing, Hala argued that, under <em>Hamilton, </em>the state\u2019s expert witness would be limited to testifying that the BAC results inferred that Hala had ingested a great deal of alcohol in order to have had the resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>high BAC level at the time the test was taken. At the hearing, the expert, just as in <em>Hamilton, </em>did not attempt to extrapolate backwards to calculate Hala\u2019s precise BAC at the time of the crash, but instead stated that Hala would have had a higher BAC at the time of the crash than at the time of testing. In any event, Hala pled guilty and did not proceed to trial, so the District Court was not called upon to make a trial ruling on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
