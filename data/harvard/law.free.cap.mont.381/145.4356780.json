We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\"><em>Did the District Court err when it held that the county superintendent abused his discretion by receiving unsworn statements as evidence in the territory transfer </em>hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b63 On March 4, 2013, Froid\u2019s Board of Trustees and a group of registered electors in Roosevelt County petitioned the Roosevelt County Superintendent of Schools to transfer territory from the Poplar school district to the Froid school district. Poplar opposed the transfer. Pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-105(5), MCA, the county superintendent of schools was required to hold a hearing on the petition. Patricia Stennes, the Roosevelt County Superintendent, appointed Paul Huber to act as deputy superintendent for the purpose of hearing and deciding the petition. Poplar and Froid retained counsel for the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u00b64 Huber scheduled a hearing on the petition for April 4, 2013. Attorneys for Poplar and Froid objected to that date as being too soon. After conferring with the attorneys, Huber vacated the April 4th hearing date and reset the hearing for April 23, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b65 On April 18,2013, Huber wrote to counsel for Poplar and Froid to confirm the procedure to be followed during the hearing. The procedure provided for, among other things, the opportunity for district representatives, taxpayers, and other interested parties to speak at the hearing, opening and closing statements by counsel, and the opportunity to cross-examine those who spoke at the hearing. The procedure did not require those who spoke to be placed under oath. Poplar did not object to the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\u00b66 The hearing was conducted on April 23, 2013. A court reporter was present to transcribe the proceedings. Huber received testimony from twenty-one individuals, some of whom were cross-examined by Poplar and Froid, but none of whom were placed under oath. Poplar did not object to the unsworn testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">\u00b67 After the hearing concluded, Huber left the administrative record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>open for one week, at Poplar\u2019s request. Poplar and Froid then submitted proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and orders. Poplar raised no objection to the unsworn testimony in its post-hearing submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u00b68 On June 11, 2013, Huber issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order approving the territory transfer. Poplar appealed the decision to the District Court and, upon agreement by the parties, the matter was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment and briefing. Poplar contended (1) the territory transfer statute, \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority; (2) the Roosevelt County Superintendent violated Poplar\u2019s due process rights by appointing Huber as deputy; (3) Huber violated Poplar\u2019s due process rights by not allowing time for discovery, subpoena of witnesses, cross-examination of witnesses, and by admitting unsworn statements; and (4) Huber\u2019s decision to transfer territory from Poplar to Froid was an abuse of discretion. Froid argued that (1) the territory transfer statute, \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, is constitutional; (2) the Roosevelt County Superintendent did not violate Poplar\u2019s due process rights by appointing Huber as deputy; (3) the parties were allowed to cross-examine witnesses, and Poplar had not preserved its claims regarding discovery, subpoena of witnesses, and admitting unsworn statements because it had made no objection at the administrative hearing; and (4) Huber\u2019s decision to transfer territory from Poplar to Froid did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b69 The District Court adopted Froid\u2019s positions on these issues, including that Poplar had waived many of its due process arguments. However, the court held that the territory transfer statute required statements to be made under oath and that Huber\u2019s failure to administer oaths was an abuse of discretion that could not be waived by Poplar, reasoning that \"Waiver is not a defense to reversal for abuse of discretion. A party cannot waive a tribunal\u2019s obligation to act within bounds of reason and employ conscientious judgment.\u201d The District Court awarded summary judgment to Poplar and vacated Huber\u2019s findings of facts, conclusions of law, and order transferring territory to Froid. Because the District Court remanded for a new hearing, it did not reach the merits of the territory transfer issue. Froid appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b610 We review an order from a district court acting in an appellate capacity to determine whether the district court reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review. <em>Credit Service </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Co., Inc. v. Crasco, </em>2011 MT 211, \u00b6 11, 361 Mont. 487, 264 P.3d 1061. The district court reviews the decision of the county superintendent to grant or deny a territory transfer petition for an abuse of discretion. Section 20-6-105(9), MCA. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when a tribunal acts \u2018arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reasont,] resulting in substantial injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Petition to Transfer From Dutton, </em>2011 MT 152, \u00b6 7, 361 Mont. 103, 259 P.3d 751 (citing In. <em>re Marriage of Guffin, </em>2010 MT 100, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 218, 232 P.3d 888). \u201cA decision is arbitrary if it appears to be \u2018random, unreasonable, or seemingly unmotivated, based on the existing record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutton, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Silva v. City of Columbia Falls, </em>258 Mont. 329, 335, 852 P.2d 671, 675 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err when it held that the county superintendent abused his discretion by receiving unsworn statements as evidence in the territory transfer hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b612 The basis for the District Court\u2019s holding was that \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, requires statements given during a territory transfer hearing to be under oath, and that Huber\u2019s failure to administer oaths was an abuse of discretion. It is undisputed that Poplar failed to object to the unsworn statements prior to, during, or after the hearing. However, the District Court reasoned that \u201c[wjaiver is not a defense to reversal for abuse of discretion\u201d because \u201c[a] party cannot waive a tribunal\u2019s obligation to act within bounds of reason and employ conscientious judgment.\u201d No authority was cited for this conclusion, but even if it was correct, it fails to properly distinguish the defense of waiver from a litigant\u2019s burden to preserve an issue for review. Although courts commonly use the two terms interchangeably \u2014 this court included \u2014 the questions of waiver and preservation for review require two different inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b613 The initial inquiry is whether an issue has been properly preserved for review. An issue can be preserved in different ways, reflecting different kinds of proceedings. <em>See Hunt v. K-Mart Corp., </em>1999 MT 125, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 444, 981 P.2d 275 (timely and specific objection); <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Division, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 46, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75 (motion in limine); <em>McDermott v. Carie, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 24, 329 Mont. 295, 124 P.3d 168 (motion for a new trial); <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2009 MT 62, \u00b6 22, 349 Mont. 371, 204 P.3d 1192 (motion to suppress). Unless a statutorily provided exception exists, or plain error is established, a reviewing court can consider only those issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that are properly preserved for its review. <em>In re </em>T.E., 2002 MT 195, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 148, 54 P.3d 38 (\u201cIn order to preserve a claim or objection for appeal, an appellant must first raise that specific claim or objection in the [lower court]\u201d). Otherwise, not only is it \u201cfundamentally unfair to fault the [lower court] for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider,\u201d but it also permits a litigant, after receiving an undesirable result from the tribunal, to re-try his or her case on appeal. <em>In re D.H., </em>2001 MT 200, \u00b6 41, 306 Mont. 278, 33 P.3d 616; <em>Rasmussen v. Sibert, </em>153 Mont. 286, 295, 456 P.2d 835, 840 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b614 If a reviewing court concludes an issue is properly preserved for its review, it must then consider the preserved issue, including whether the opponent\u2019s defense of waiver has been established. \u201c[Wlaiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right, claim or privilege, which may be proved by express declarations or by a course of acts and conduct which induces the belief that the intent and purpose was waiver.\u201d <em>Hurly v. Lake Cabin Dev., LLC, </em>2012 MT 77, \u00b6 27, 364 Mont. 425, 276 P.3d 854 (internal citations and quotations omitted). While a claim may be properly preserved for judicial review, the claim may nonetheless have been waived by the party asserting error. <em>See El Dorado Heights Homeowners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. DeWitt, </em>2008 MT 199, \u00b6 16, 344 Mont. 77, 186 P.3d 1249 (where issue of lack of personal jurisdiction was preserved by motion for relief from a previous court order, but Court found defendant had waived claim of lack of personal jurisdiction by appearing multiple times in front of district court); <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; </em>Co,, 2002 MT 129, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 123, 54 P.3d 1 (where issue of whether plaintiff had right to jury trial was preserved by motion to compel arbitration, and Court then examined whether plaintiff had waived right to jury trial). We previously noted the distinction between failing to preserve an issue, or \u201cforfeiture,\u201d and \u201cwaiver\u201d of an issue, in <em>Miller v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct. </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 46, n. 5, 337 Mont. 488, 162 P.3d 121 (\u201c \u2018Forfeiture,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018waiver,\u2019 is the correct term in this context, since \u2018forfeiture\u2019 refers to \u2018the failure to make the timely assertion of a right,\u2019 whereas \u2018waiver\u2019 concerns \u2018the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b615 Here, the District Court, as the reviewing court, first had to determine whether Poplar\u2019s claim \u2014 that \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, requires sworn testimony \u2014 was properly preserved for review before it could take up the question of whether a party can \u201cwaive a tribunal\u2019s obligation to act within bounds of reason and employ conscientious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>judgment.\u201d The preservation question, in turn, required the District Court to determine whether this statutory proceeding was governed by the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) or by the common law, because each of those provides different standards to determine whether a claim has been properly preserved for review. Under MAPA, a party cannot raise an issue for judicial review that was not raised before the agency (except for the validity of the statute that gave rise to the administrative proceeding), unless good cause for failure to raise the issue is shown. Section2-4-702(l)(b), MCA. Under the common law, a party cannot raise an issue for the first time on appeal unless the court accepts plain error review. <em>Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 40, 321 Mont. 364, 91 P.3d 569. Thus, if Poplar did not properly preserve its issue, then, under MAPA, the District Court could review the issue only if Poplar showed good cause, while, under the common law, only if Poplar established plain error and the District Court exercised discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">\u00b616 MAPA governs procedure, rules, and judicial review of final \u201cagency\u201d decisions in \u201ccontested cases.\u201d Section 2-4-101 et seq., MCA. \u201cAgency\u201d means an agency as defined in \u00a7 2-3-102, MCA, of the Montana Public Participation in Governmental Operations Act (\u201cPublic Participation Act\u201d). Section 2-4-102(2)(a), MCA. In turn, the Public Participation Act defines \u201cagency\u201d as \u201cany board, bureau, commission, department, authority, or officer of the state or local government authorized by law to malee rules, determine contested cases, or enter into contracts ... .\u201d Section 2-3-102, MCA. However, \u00a7 2-4-102(2)(b), MCA, explicitly excludes from the definition of \u201cagency\u201d a \u201cschool district, a unit of local government, or any other political subdivision of the state.\u201d County superintendents are local, not state, government officials. Section 7-4-3005, MCA. Thus, proceedings before county superintendents are excluded from MAPA as a \u201cunit of local government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b617 The legislative history of MAPA confirms this was the intent of the Montana Legislature. The Legislature enacted the local government exclusion in the 1985 session in response to our decision in <em>Yanzick v. Sch. Dist., </em>196 Mont. 375, 383, 641 P.2d 431, 436 (1982), where we held that a county superintendent was an \u201cagency\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>MAPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See State Administration Committee Deliberation on SB 13, </em>Ch. 671 2-3 (Jan. 8, 1985); <em>State Administration Committee Deliberation on SB 13, </em>Ch. 6712-3 (March 7, 1985); <em>see also </em>William L. Corbett, <em>Montana Administrative Law Practice: 41 Years After the Enactment of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, </em>73 Mont. L. Rev. 339, 341 (2012). Specifically, regarding the statutory proceeding at issue, the Legislature had previously provided that judicial review of territory transfers would be governed by MAPA, but removed that provision in 1997. <em>See </em>1997 Mont. Laws 403; <em>compare </em>\u00a7 20-6-320(7), MCA (1993) <em>with </em>\u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA (1997). In 2003, the Legislature enacted a new territory transfer statute but used nearly identical language with regard to the judicial review provision of the new statute. <em>See </em>2003 Mont. Laws 151. The only addition to the judicial review provision was an articulation of the standard of review to be applied by district courts, which would be superfluous if MAPA, with its own standard of review, applied to territory transfers. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(i-vi), MCA. Therefore, without any specific statutory language so providing, which is entirely consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history, we conclude that the exclusion in \u00a7 2-4-102(2)(b), MCA, removes actions of county superintendents from MAPA\u2019s purview. The common law thus governs whether Poplar\u2019s claim \u2014 that \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, requires sworn testimony \u2014 was properly preserved for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b618 Under the common law, it is well settled that issues raised for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>first time on appeal will not be reviewed. <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 53, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002. The exception under the common law is plain error review. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 40. A reviewing court may discretionarily review a claimed error not previously raised below which affects fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review it may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 40. A court\u2019s inherent power of plain error review should be used sparingly and only in exceptional cases meeting one of the criteria. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 40. We previously exercised plain error review in a school territory transfer case on the ground that the then-current territory transfer statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the legislature had failed to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of power delegated to the superintendent. <em>In the Petition to Transfer Territory from High Sch. Dist. No. 6, </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 11, 303 Mont. 204, 15 P.3d 447 <em>(\u201cLame Deer\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">\u00b619  Here, the District Court erred when it decided the waiver issue (concluding that waiver was not possible as a matter of law), and then reached the merits of the statutory question (concluding that \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, required sworn testimony) without first determining the primary issue of whether Poplar\u2019s claim had been preserved and, if not, whether plain error review could be exercised. Even giving the benefit of the doubt that the District Court\u2019s decision to reach the waiver issue and then the merits was an implied exercise of plain error review, we conclude that it erred in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b620 First, given the lack of any objection to or questioning of the procedure, it is clear that Poplar failed to preserve its statutory issue concerning the necessity of sworn testimony. Clearly, Huber was never given the opportunity to consider the question and, if necessary, correct the course of the proceeding. Thus, plain error review was necessary to review this unpreserved issue. Although we exercised plain error review in <em>Lame Deer, </em>Poplar\u2019s claim does not merit similar treatment. The constitutionality of the territory transfer statute was at issue in <em>Lame Deer, </em>while the issue here is a procedural question under the statute, and nothing in our review of the record indicates that a miscarriage of justice, a fundamental unfairness, or a threat to the integrity of the process resulted from the procedure employed. And, as a reason bearing on the exercise of plain error review, we find no authority, and Poplar has cited none, for the District Court\u2019s holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>that a \u201cparty cannot waive a tribunal\u2019s obligation to act within bounds of reason and employ conscientious judgment.\u201d In sum, Poplar\u2019s claim does not warrant plain error review. Therefore, Poplar\u2019s statutory claim was not properly raised before the District Court and it was error for the District Court to reach the merits of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b621 We reverse and remand to the District Court for further proceedings in review of the county superintendent\u2019s decision, in accordance herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-5\"> The preamble to SB 13, introduced in the 1985 session, provided: \u201cWhereas, the Montana Supreme Court has held in recent opinions that the Montana Administrative Procedure Act applies to school districts; and whereas, it is clear <em>from </em>the language of section 2-4-102(2), MCA, as originally enacted, and from the 1971 official comments of the Administrative Procedures Subcommittee recommending the enactment of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act that the Act was never intended to apply to units of local government, school districts, or any other political subdivisions; and whereas, substantial confusion could result if the provisions of the Act are continued to be applied to any government entity other than state agencies; and whereas, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Act be applied only to those agencies of state government provided for in the Act and the belief of the Legislature that the Act was never intended to apply to units of local government, school districts, or any other political subdivisions of the state.

However, I would nevertheless affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Poplar and against Froid and setting aside Huber\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on the grounds that Superintendent Stennes had no authority to recuse herself and appoint Huber in her stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b623 Section 20-6-105, MCA, sets forth very specific criteria for conducting a territory transfer hearing. In pertinent part, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">(6) <em>The county superintendent shall </em>conduct a hearing as scheduled ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory transfer... <em>the county superintendent shall, </em>within 30 days after the hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, <em>the county superintendent determines </em>that the evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, <em>the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. </em>If <em>the county superintendent determines </em>that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, <em>the county superintendent shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>deny the territory transfer.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-3\">(9) <em>The decision of the county superintendent </em>is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the petitioned territory transfer. <em>The county superintendent\u2019s decision </em>must be upheld unless the court finds that <em>the county superintendent\u2019s decision </em>constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Section 20-6-105(6) to (9), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b624 Section 20-6-105, MCA, vests in the county superintendent the exclusive authority to conduct a territory transfer hearing, after which the county superintendent shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law, and an order either granting or denying the territory transfer. In this case, the individual in whom that exclusive authority was vested was Superintendent Stennes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b625 As required by \u00a7 20-3-201(1), MCA, Superintendent Stennes was the duly elected Roosevelt County Superintendent of Schools. The only statutory provision allowing a duly elected county superintendent to appoint another individual to hear and decide a matter in controversy is when the county superintendent is disqualified pursuant to \u00a7 20-3-211, MCA. In those specific and limited circumstances, the disqualified county superintendent \u201cmust appoint another county superintendent.\u201d Section 20-3-212(1), MCA. There is no statutory authority for a county superintendent to recuse herself and appoint a deputy superintendent for the limited purpose of hearing and ruling on a territory transfer petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b626 In <em>Pinnow v.

Although the Administrative Rules of Montana provided for the WCC Judge\u2019s recusal and the District Court Judge\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, we held that an administrative rule could not \u201ccreate authority not otherwise provided for by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 23. In the absence of such authority, we concluded that the District Court Judge who had assumed jurisdiction \u201chad no more authority than any other member of the general public over this case,\u201d and we vacated all orders entered by the District Court Judge. <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b627 In <em>Lame Deer, </em>we recognized that territory transfers involve substantial rights of the litigants with constitutional implications. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Lame Deer, </em>\u00b6 11. Indeed, we held the territory transfer statute at issue in <em>Lame Deer </em>to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because of the statute\u2019s \u201cbroad grant of discretion to a county superintendent of schools, unchecked by any standard, policy or rule of decision.\u201d <em>Lame Deer, </em>\u00b6 19. In this case, it seems beyond dispute that Superintendent Stennes lacked the statutory authority or discretion to appoint Huber to hear and rule on Poplar\u2019s territory transfer petition. In other words, Huber \u201chad no more authority than any other member of the general public over [Poplar\u2019s petition].\u201d <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 25. Both parties in this case had a due process right to have this petition heard and decided by the duly elected county superintendent, as expressly prescribed by \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA. It seems to me incongruous that we would hold, as we did in <em>Lame Deer, </em>that it was unconstitutional for a county superintendent to act within the authority granted by statute because that authority was overly broad, yet we would excuse a county superintendent recusing herself and making an ad hoc appointment of a deputy superintendent in contravention of the statute\u2019s narrowly prescribed process.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\">\u00b628 Relevant to the majority\u2019s dispositive issue in this case \u2014 the District Court\u2019s error in reaching the merits of Poplar\u2019s statutory claim because it was not properly raised \u2014 it bears noting that although Poplar did not object to Huber\u2019s appointment during the territory transfer hearing, Poplar did raise the issue in its summary judgment motion before the District Court and again on appeal, In <em>Pinnow, </em>neither party objected to the District Court Judge assuming jurisdiction over the case, nor did either party raise the issue on appeal. <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 15. Nevertheless, we deemed it necessary to address the issue, sua sponte, because we determined that a lack of statutory authority for the District Court Judge\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction would render any rulings made by him void. <em>Pinnow, </em>\u00b6 17.1 submit we have a similar obligation to address this issue in the present case, and resolve it consistent with our established precedent. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
