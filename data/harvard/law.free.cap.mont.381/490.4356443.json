Reis later claimed neck, back, and hand injuries. The Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, conducted a jury trial in December 2014 and the jury held that Luckett\u2019s negligence in causing the accident was not the cause of Reis\u2019s claimed injuries. On January 9, 2015, Reis filed a Motion to Vacate Jury Verdict and Grant New Trial. Luckett opposed the motion. On March 3, 2015, the court granted Reis\u2019s motion. Luckett appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting Reis\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b63 On February 16, 2010, Reis was traveling eastbound on U.S. highway 87/89 between Belt and Great Falls, Montana. Luckett was driving south on State Road 228 approaching the controlled intersection with Highway 87/89. The roads were \u201cextremely icy\u201d and the weather conditions were poor with dense fog. Despite his attempts to slow or stop his car, Luckett entered the intersection striking at least two vehicles, one of which was driven by Reis. While Reis did not report injuries to the responding police or Luckett immediately after the accident, he claimed that later the same day he began to experience neck and back pain as well as pain in his left hand, specifically his fifth metacarpal, <em>i.e., </em>his little finger.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u00b64 Over the next several months, Reis sought treatment from LaDonna Maxwell, a family nurse practitioner who owns and operates her own medical practice in Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Maxwell also referred Ries to a chiropractor, a pain specialist, and an orthopedist, all of whom Reis saw on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\u00b65 In January 2013, Reis filed a complaint alleging that Luckett\u2019s negligence caused the injuries for which he was seeking compensatory damages. Luckett acknowledged liability but disputed the extent to which the accident was the cause of Reis\u2019s injuries. The District Court held a jury trial in December 2014 and the parties stipulated to a special verdict form that contained two questions, the first of which was: (1) Was Austin Luckett\u2019s negligence a cause of injury to Scott Reis? The jury answered this question \u201cNo\u201d and consequently did not respond to the second question pertaining to the appropriate amount of compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">\u00b66 In January 2015, Reis filed a Motion to Vacate Jury Verdict and Grant New Trial. He claimed the verdict was not supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>evidence and that it was based on irregularities and misconduct of the jury because the jury discussed the issue of automobile insurance in the course of its deliberations. Luckett opposed the motion arguing that the jury reached a correct verdict based upon its determination that Reis was not a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b67 On March 3,2015, the District Court granted Reis\u2019s motion for a new trial. The court held that while conflicting evidence was presented to the jury as to causation of Reis\u2019s claimed back and neck injuries, \u201cthe uncontroverted evidence proves Luckett\u2019s negligence caused injury to Reis\u2019s hand.\u201d The court continued that \u201c[bjecause the verdict form did not differentiate causation of the two distinct injuries, the [cjourt concludes the jury verdict must be vacated and a new trial ordered because the verdict contravenes the evidence on the hand injury and has materially affected Reis\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d The District Court rejected the argument that an irregularity or misconduct by the jury warranted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b68 Luckett appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b69 Where a motion for a new trial under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, is based on sufficiency of the evidence, we review the grant or denial of the motion de novo. <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 19, 345 Mont. 469, 191 P.3d 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\u00b610 Where a jury fails to award any damages when the only evidence of record supports an award, that verdict is not supported by substantial evidence and may be set aside. <em>Thompson v. City of Bozeman, </em>284 Mont. 440, 446, 945 P.2d 48, 52 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Reis\u2019s motion for anew trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"At4\">\u00b612 In granting Reis\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court concluded that the jury\u2019s finding that Luckett\u2019s negligence was not a cause of injury to Reis could not be reconciled with the evidence concerning Reis\u2019s hand injury. The court noted that only two witnesses provided evidence regarding the hand injury. Maxwell diagnosed a \u201cboxer\u2019s fracture\u201d after reviewing x-rays of his hand. While she conceded on cross-examination that the x-ray report described the hand fracture as \u201cpossibly remote,\u201d she as Reis\u2019s primary care provider unequivocally attributed the fracture to the car accident. Reis himself testified that his hand was broken when the airbag went off as a result of the accident, after which he had trouble opening and closing his hand and picking up objects. While it acknowledged there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>conflicting evidence on causation with respect to the back and neck injuries claimed by Reis, the court concluded there was no conflicting evidence presented to the jury with respect to Reis\u2019s fractured hand. The court therefore ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b613 Luckett argues on appeal that Reis gave inconsistent testimony that undermined his credibility, and thus it was within the province of the jury to conclude that he failed to prove that <em>any </em>of his claimed injuries were related to the accident. Luckett relies on <em>Ele v. Ehnes, </em>2003 MT 131, 316 Mont. 69, 68 P.3d 835, in which defendant Ehnes admitted to rear-ending the car in which plaintiff Ele was a passenger. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 5. The collision was at low speed with no visible damage to Ehnes\u2019 vehicle and no structural damage to the car in which Ele was riding. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 5. Ele sought damages for multiple injuries he claimed he sustained in the low-speed collision. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Ele testified that his injuries prevented him from \u201crough housing\u201d with his children, bowling, jet skiing, dancing, roller skating, camping, and taking out the garbage. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 9. His treating physician stated that the accident \u201chad the potential\u201d of making Ele\u2019s preexisting conditions symptomatic, but also stated that when Ele is distracted, he has greater movement abilities than he claims. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. Moreover, Ele\u2019s co-workers testified that since the accident they had seen Ele jet skiing, bowling, bending and twisting whilst setting up a tent, carrying a heavy cooler, and placing heavy garbage into the large alley garbage can \u2014 all without apparent difficulty. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b614 The jury <em>in Ele </em>returned a defense verdict. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 16. We affirmed on appeal, observing that the jury almost certainly deemed Ele\u2019s evidence that the minor accident caused his purported injuries not credible. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6 32. We found that the jury could have been swayed by the testimony of his co-workers, and by the fact that after Ele\u2019s physician testified that he had no reason to question the cause of Ele\u2019s claimed injuries, he admitted to being unaware that his patient had a pre-accident history of chronic back pain. <em>Ele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30 and 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b615 In the case before us, by contrast, the undisputed testimony was that this was a serious three-car accident with substantial damage to all vehicles. Notably, there was no evidence offered to counter Reis\u2019s testimony that his hand was broken when his airbag inflated, nor was any evidence offered to counter the testimony of his care provider that the accident directly caused Reis\u2019s hand fracture. <em>Ele </em>is therefore readily distinguishable. For the same reason, we reject Luckett\u2019s reliance on <em>Moore v. Beye, </em>2005 MT 266, 329 Mont. 109, 122 P.3d 1212, <em>overruled on other grounds by Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, 338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134, in which we affirmed a defense verdict because the jury had been presented with considerable conflicting evidence pertaining to Moore\u2019s claim of a back injury. There was no conflicting evidence presented to the jury concerning Reis\u2019s hand injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b616  Luckett argues that Reis gave conflicting statements about why he dropped out of high school and why he was fired from employment among other things, and that the jury was thus free to find on the basis of this testimony that Reis was not credible. He maintains that we should not consider the evidence regarding Reis\u2019s broken hand in isolation from the other evidence presented in the case. While we agree that it is within the jury\u2019s province to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses, \u201ca jury is not free to disregard uncontradicted, credible, nonopinion evidence.\u201d <em>Renville v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 217, \u00b6 26, 301 Mont. 99, 7 P.3d 400. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in granting Reis\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b617 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting Reis a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b520-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A_r\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b618 The issue on appeal is whether substantial evidence supported the verdict that Reis failed to prove his damages to his right hand were caused by the accident. The jury concluded that Ries failed to prove damages related to his neck and back were caused by the accident. I would find that there was conflicting evidence presented to the jury regarding the hand injury \u2014 primarily by the radiology report noting a remote fracture \u2014 and that, on this basis alone, Reis failed to meet his burden of proof. I would also conclude that the evidence relating to the boxer\u2019s fracture should not be considered in isolation from all the evidence presented in the case and that such an approach is inconsistent with our instruction to juries that they are to determine the weight to be given a witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u00b619 The evidence presented to the jury regarding Reis\u2019s hand injury and the boxer\u2019s fracture came from the expert opinion of LaDonna Maxwell. Maxwell\u2019s assessment of Reis\u2019s injuries was that he had sustained a boxer\u2019s fracture. In contrast to basing her opinion on medical history provided by Reis, Maxwell testified that an x-ray can show whether the fracture was an acute fracture or a long-term fracture. The x-ray report admitted into evidence made the following findings: \u201cThere are no prior studies available for comparison. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>oblique fracture is in the right fifth metacarpal neck. This may be due to a remote fracture, however. There is mild volar angulation. Soft tissue swelling is present.\u201d The conclusion, as set forth in the x-ray report, was a \u201cboxer\u2019s fracture, possible remote. Clinically correlate.\u201d \u00b620 Here, the only testimony regarding Reis\u2019s right hand injury was conflicting since Maxwell testified she relied upon the report indicating the fracture was \u201cpossibly remote\u201d to assess Reis\u2019s hand injury. Maxwell\u2019s testimony is far from clear when she explains what \u201cclinical correlation\u201d means. While she testifies, \u201cYes, and I say clinically it correlates,\u201d it is in response to counsel\u2019s question that, \u201cThis may be due to a remote fracture, however; correct?\u201d Reis never solicited any testimony from Maxwell of observable clinical findings (bruising, abrasions, etc.) from which a correlation could be made which negated a remote fracture. Reis failed to ask any follow-up questions to establish for the jury that Maxwell\u2019s opinion had merit beyond the unclear and conclusory assertion that, \u201cI say clinically it correlates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">\u00b621 The only objective evidence before the jury was the x-ray report indicating that the fracture was possibly remote. In light of Maxwell\u2019s conflicting testimony, I would conclude that the x-ray report constituted substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict of no causation relating to Reis\u2019s hand injury. In the context of the remaining evidence that was produced at trial, which I would conclude should be considered, it is my view that we have displaced the jury\u2019s function, which is to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and decide what weight to attribute to the evidence. \u201cIt is not this Court\u2019s function to agree or disagree with [a jury\u2019s] verdict.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 8 (citation omitted). If \u201cconflicting evidence exists, [a court does] not retry a case because the jury chose to believe one party over another.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 14. \u201cEven inherently weak and conflicted evidence may still be considered substantial.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b622 I would reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
