Letica and McGee raise several issues on appeal that we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">2. <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the record, taken as a whole, established that Anaconda-Deer Lodge County statutorily created Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch terminating in Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the public holds a prescriptive easement across Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">\u00b62 We affirm on Issue 1, reverse on Issue 2, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">\u00b63 The disputed portions of Modesty Creek Road<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pass through properties owned by Letica Emd McGee. The road includes Em upper Emd lower branch and is located near the boundary between Anaconda-Deer Lodge County (County) and Powell County in the Flint Creek Range foothills approximately ten miles north of Anaconda, Montana. \u00b64 Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch begins at an intersection with Spring Gulch Road \u2014 an undisputed county road \u2014 in Section 19, Township 6 North, Range 10 West. There is an orEmge gate on the lower branch at that branch\u2019s intersection with Spring Gulch Road. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The road travels northwest through McGee\u2019s property along Modesty Creek\u2019s north side and exits the property in Section 24, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. There is a green gate where the road exits McGee\u2019s property and enters Letica\u2019s property. The road passes a short distance over Letica\u2019s property before entering what the parties refer to as the Launderville parcel \u2014 an inholding surrounded entirely by Letica\u2019s property and now owned by nonparties Thomas and Patricia Donich. The District Court concluded that the lower branch reenters Letica\u2019s property in Section 23, Township 6 North, Range 11 West, and continues west before ending in the eastern portion of Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b65 The upper branch splits from the lower branch near the western Launderville/Letica property boundary in Section 23, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. The upper branch travels west/northwest across Letica\u2019s property through Sections 23, 22, and 15, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. The road enters Powell County in Section 15. It continues into the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest where it becomes a United States Forest Service road that accesses a number of lakes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b66 In March 1889, the Deer Lodge County Commission<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> considered a petition to establish Modesty Creek Road as a county road. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>minutes from the meeting describe the petition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">Upon the petition of John N. Nelson, et al. and proof of the posting of notices as required by law having been filed with the Clerk, Frank Stephens, Geo Jacques and Joseph Marshall were appointed viewers to meet April 11, 1889 to view out, locate and report upon the following road to wit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">Beginning at the S.E. Cortner] of Sec[tion] 22, T9NR10W,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Deer Lodge Co. MT and running thence due west two miles along the section lines. Thence up Modesty Creek along the old road as near as practicable to the mouth of Dry Gulch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Deer Lodge County Commissioners Records, <em>Deer Lodge County Commission Meeting Minutes, March 21,1889, </em>Book 6, 373. The Commission met again in June 1889 and the minutes from that meeting contain the following declaration regarding Modesty Creek Road:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">Report of Frank Stephens, Joseph Marshall, and Geo Jacques - viewers appointed on March 21st and 1889 to view out, locate and report upon a road petitioned for by John N. Nelson, et al. met and accepted and the same is hereby accepted declared a public highway with the provision that all parties interested or benefited by said road bear all expense connected with the opening and building of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">Deer Lodge County Commissioners Records, <em>Deer Lodge County Commission Meeting Minutes, June 3,1889, </em>Book 6,396. An 1896 County road map shows Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch generally following the route described above and ending near a gulch labeled \u201cDry Gulch\u201d in an \u201cunsurveyed\u201d portion of Township 6 North, Range 11 West.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b67 The road traversed only federal public land until the federal government conveyed the land to the Anaconda Company in 1937. During the Anaconda Company\u2019s ownership, testimony at trial indicated that the public regularly accessed both branches of Modesty Creek Road. In 1965, the Anaconda Company sold the land. A number of private interests have owned various parcels ever since. Testimony at trial indicated that the public continued to regularly access both branches until the early 1980s. Hija Letica purchased the property in 1989 and transferred the property to Letica in 1997. McGee also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>purchased his property in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b68 In the mid-1960s, the Launderville parcel\u2019s prior owner, Joe Launderville, fenced the parcel and placed a gate across the upper branch. Launderville testified at trial that he locked the gate sporadically in the early 1980s. At around the same time, Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s predecessors in interest installed and locked the orange and green gates across the lower branch. In the mid-1980s, Shawn DeMers, an area landowner, removed a culvert at the orange gate at Launderville\u2019s request. The culvert allowed road users to cross Modesty Creek. The locked gates on the lower branch and the culvert\u2019s removal restricted public use of both branches. As such, both Letica and McGee maintain that they were unaware of any claim of public right of access over either branch of Modesty Creek Road at the time they purchased their respective properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b69 Following a confrontation with Hija Letica, DeMers and another County resident asked the County Commission in early 2012 to reaffirm both branches of Modesty Creek Road as county roads and reopen them to the public. The County Commission retained an attorney to research the road\u2019s history and, on March 6,2012, voted to reaffirm both branches as county roads based in part on her opinion and supporting documentation. Two days later, Letica filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. Following a hearing, the District Court issued an order in July 2012 denying Letica\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to close Modesty Creek Road.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> McGee joined as a plaintiff in an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b610 Prior to trial, the County initially contended that both branches of Modesty Creek Road were statutorily created. After discovery closed, however, the County located a road record book that established that the upper branch was not in fact a statutorily created road. The County thereafter asserted that a public prescriptive easement established the upper branch as a public road.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b611 In a December 2013 order, the District Court denied the parties\u2019 motions for partial summary judgment. The court also denied Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s motion to alter or amend the July 2012 order to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>gates to be placed on the upper branch based on the newly-discovered evidence that the upper branch was not a statutorily created road. The court did, however, allow Letica and McGee to amend their complaint to add a constitutional takings claim based on the same evidence regarding the upper branch. The court then bifurcated the takings claims from the public right-of-way claims <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b612 The court commenced a five-day bench trial on May 12,2014. The parties presented extensive evidence regarding whether the County created the lower branch by petition and whether there is a public prescriptive easement on the upper branch. The evidence included: the 1889 Commission meeting minutes quoted above; 1896 Commission meeting minutes; various maps that either show or do not show Modesty Creek Road; lay witness testimony concerning the County\u2019s level of exercise of jurisdiction over the road; lay witness testimony regarding the road\u2019s use by the public; testimony from Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s expert, Ken Jenkins, a licensed surveyor; historical documents relating to mining activity in the area; and a site visit with the court, counsel, and representatives for each party. Following the trial, the District Court issued a thorough 74-page findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order in October 2014.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court concluded that Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch was a statutorily created road ending along the eastern edge of Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. The court also concluded that a public prescriptive easement established Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch as a public road and that the prescriptive easement had not been extinguished by reverse adverse possession. The court entered its order as a final judgment; in mid-November 2014, the court issued an order awarding costs and finding that \u201cthe takings issue is not ripe for ruling or further hearing until after the appeal is heard.\u201d Letica and McGee appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); <em>Galassi v. Lincoln Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>2003 MT 319, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 288, 80 P.3d 84 (citation omitted). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 7 (citations omitted). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b614 2. <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the record, taken as a whole, established that the County statutorily created Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch terminating in Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b615 In 1889, the statutory procedures for establishing a county road required, in part: residents to submit a petition regarding the proposed road to the board of county commissioners; the posting of public notice of the petition; the board to appoint road viewers to mark out the road and report back to the board; and the board to approve or reject the road viewers\u2019 report and provide notice of the road\u2019s opening. Compiled Statutes of Mont., 5th Div. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 1809-1818 (1887); <em>Oates v. Knutson, </em>182 Mont. 195, 199, 595 P.2d 1181, 1183 (1979) (summarizing the 1887 statutory procedures for establishing a county road). The standard for determining the existence of a public road, however, is not proof of strict adherence to these statutory procedures; rather, it is whether \u201cthe record taken as a whole shows that a public road was created.\u201dReid <em>v. Park Cnty., </em>192 Mont. 231, 236, 627 P.2d 1210, 1213 (1981). We adopted the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard in <em>Reid </em>because \u201cstrict compliance with the jurisdictional requirements to establish a road by petition would pose an unjustifiable burden on the public to prove a public road created nearly 100 years earlier.\u201d <em>Sayers v. Chouteau Cnty., </em>2013 MT 45, \u00b6 26, 369 Mont. 98, 297 P.3d 312 (citing Reid, 192 Mont. at 234, 627 P.2d at 1212).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b616 As an initial matter, Letica and McGee contend that \u201c[ujnder the circumstances of this case ... the \u2018finding5 that a county road exists is actually the declaration of a significant legal right that implicates [Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s] fundamental and constitutionally protected property interests.\u201d Accordingly, they assert that the determination whether Modesty Creek Road is a public road is a conclusion of law that must be reviewed for correctness. Although we have not addressed this issue directly, we have concluded that under the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard, there must be \u201csubstantial credible evidence\u201d to support a district court\u2019s determination that a road is public. <em>Jefferson Cnty. v. McCauley Ranches, Ltd. Liab. P\u2019ship, </em>1999 MT 333, \u00b6 35, 297 Mont. 392, 994 P.2d 11 (holding that \u201csubstantial credible evidence supported the District Court\u2019s determination that McCarty Creek Road is a county road\u201d); <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 16 (concluding \u201cthat there was substantial evidence presented to the District Court to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>finding that RP 81 is a public roadway\u201d). As stated above, the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard allows for less than strict compliance with the statutory requirements for establishing a public road. <em>Reid, </em>192 Mont. at 235-36, 627 P.2d at 1213. Consequently, the determination whether a road was created by petition requires a district court to make factual findings \u2014 that we review for clear error \u2014 and then apply the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d legal standard to those findings \u2014 a conclusion of law that we review for correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b617 Letica and McGee generally contend that the court failed to consider adequately the record as a whole in determining that the lower branch of Modesty Creek Road is a public road created by petition. They first argue that the June 1889 Commission declaration contains a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to the road\u2019s creation because of its \u201cprovision that all parties interested or benefited by said road bear all expense connected with the opening and building of the same.\u201d Deer Lodge County Commissioners Records, <em>Deer Lodge County Commission Meeting Minutes, June 3,1889, </em>Book 6, 396. Letica and McGee assert that the court erred by concluding that the lower branch is a county road created by petition without finding that the county satisfied the condition. They next contend that under the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard, \u201cthe record\u201d must focus on county records. Therefore, they claim that the District Court failed to consider adequately the whole record because the \u201ccounty-created evidence\u201d alone is insufficient to show the creation of a county road. Moreover, they contend that the \u201ccounty-created evidence\u201d shows that the County did not recognize the lower branch as a county road for nearly 100 years. Finally, Letica and McGee assert that even if Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch isa county road, the record as a whole establishes that it must end on the Launderville parcel in the eastern portion of Section 23, Township 6 North, Range 11 West.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b618 Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s assertion that the court had to find the June 1889 Commission declaration\u2019s \u201ccondition precedent\u201d satisfied in order to conclude that a county road exists on the lower branch is misplaced. Letica and McGee correctly point out that the road-creation statutes in effect at the time authorized a county to require the payment of \u201cexpense and damages\u201d by the road\u2019s petitioners. Compiled Statutes of Mont., 5th Div. Gen. Laws \u00a7 1819 (1887). Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s argument, however, does not properly apply the standard we set forth in <em>Reid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b619 <em>Reid </em>rejected a standard of strict compliance with statutory procedures where the applicable documentation might be over 100 years old due to the potential burden on the public to produce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>jurisdictional record. <em>Reid, </em>192 Mont. at 236, 627 P.2d at 1213. Here, requiring proof of strict compliance with the declaration\u2019s claimed \u201ccondition precedent\u201d would allow Letica and McGee \u201cto keep the public from going through land because the public\u2019s records of a road no longer support a determination that the public had originally acquired jurisdiction to create the road.\u201d Reid, 192 Mont. at 236, 627 P.2d at 1213. Such a requirement \u201cmay well be unsurmountable\u201d and is therefore not required under the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard. <em>Reid, </em>192 Mont. at 236, 627 P.2d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b620 We have considered in prior cases numerous statutory conditions of road creation for which evidence was lacking, and have not found the failure to satisfy one or more particular conditions to be determinative. <em>E.g., Reid, </em>192 Mont. at 233, 627 P.2d at 1210 (noting that the record undisputedly lacked copies of the petition showing a description of the road, that the petition was signed by ten qualified petitioners, and that the commissioners gave notice to the affected landowners); <em>Lee v. Musselshell Cnty., </em>2004 MT 64, \u00b6 16, 320 Mont. 294, 87 P.3d 423 (no records available, other than corrected survey notes, demonstrating that the statutory procedures necessary to alter a road were followed); <em>Jefferson Cnty., </em>\u00b6 29 (county conceded that a road\u2019s creation was procedurally deficient). Additionally, but for evidence of the \u201cexpense and damages\u201d payment, the record demonstrates that the lower branch was created in substantial compliance with the statutory procedures for establishing a county road. Statutes of Mont., 5th Div. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 1809-1818 (1887). The provision requiring payment of \u201cexpense and damages\u201d is not qualitatively different from the conditions lacking in those cases, and we conclude that it too is not determinative. Finally, the lack of proof showing payment of expenses could just as well be evidence that the road declaration did not result in any expenses, particularly because there was evidence that the road already existed.</p>\n<p id=\"A13\">\u00b621 Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s contention that the record, taken asa whole, cannot establish the creation of a county road on the lower branch due to the lack of \u201ccounty-created evidence\u201d is unpersuasive because the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d is not limited to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the public record. <em>Sayers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24,28. In neither <em>Reid </em>nor its progeny have we required that a district court consider only county records under the \u201crecord taken as whole\u201d standard. <em>E.g., Galassi, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 19 (relying in part on the testimony of three witnesses regarding the road\u2019s location and its use by the public to conclude that the record taken as a whole established a public road); <em>Jefferson Cnty., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35 (relying in part on a private deed of sale, a non-county map, and testimony of witnesses to conclude that the record taken as a whole established a public road); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Lee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15,17 (relying in part on non-county maps to conclude that the record taken as a whole established a public road). Moreover, applying Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s \u201ccounty-created evidence\u201d standard goes directly against our decision in <em>Reid </em>because it would \u201cimposeD an unrealistic burden on the public to prove <em>on the face of the record </em>that its public officials had jurisdiction to create a public road.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>192 Mont. at 234, 627 P.2d at 1212 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b622 Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s parallel assertion that the court erred by failing to consider that the County did not recognize the lower branch as a <em>county </em>road in county records likewise is unpersuasive. Letica and McGee concede that the County recognized Modesty Creek Road as a county road on the 1896 County road map, but claim that a 1913 County road map showing no county road in the area proves that the County did not recognize Modesty Creek Road as a county road.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Letica and McGee have offered no legal authority suggesting that a county\u2019s failure to depict a road as a public road on county road maps means the road is not public. In fact, we rejected a similar argument in <em>Galassi. Galassi, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 19 (concluding that the road in question was a public road even though the road did not appear in the county tract book depicting county roads). Moreover, Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s own expert testified at trial that there could be county roads that are not shown on county maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b623 Additionally, if recognizing a road on county maps was determinative of whether a county established a road by petition, the County\u2019s recognition of the lower branch on the 1896 map would end the discussion because \u201conce a road is established as a public roadway ... a county must take affirmative steps to indicate intention to abandon such road.\u201d <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>McCauley v. Thompson Nistler, </em>2000 MT 215, \u00b6 31, 301 Mont. 81, 10 P.3d 794). Later county maps that do not depict Modesty Creek Road do not amount to conduct \u201cso decisive and conclusive as to indicate a clear intent to abandon.\u201d <em>Baertsch v. Cnty. of Lewis &amp; Clark, </em>256 Mont. 114, 122, 845 P.2d 106, 111 (1992) (citation omitted) (concluding that the conduct necessary to demonstrate an intent to abandon \u201cmust be some affirmative official act, and not mere implication\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b624 We conclude, after reviewing the record, that the District Court properly considered all of the evidence in determining the make-up of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the record as a whole. Therefore, Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s contentions that the court failed to consider adequately the record as a whole are unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b625 After reviewing the record, we farther conclude that the District Court appropriately relied on <em>Reid </em>and its progeny in determining that the record in this case, taken as a whole, establishes that the County created Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch by petition. The March and June 1889 Commission meeting minutes establish that the statutory requirements for creating a road by petition largely were met. The minutes demonstrate that residents submitted a petition to the County Commission; the petitioners posted public notice of the petition; the Commission appointed road viewers to mark out the road; the viewers reported back to the Commission; the Commission accepted the road viewers\u2019 report; and the Commission accepted and declared the road as public, thereby providing notice of the road\u2019s opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b626 Moreover, the rest of the record contains a wide range of evidence that is sufficient to support the court\u2019s determination. The record includes other historical county records such as the 1896 County road map showing the lower branch as a county road, January 1896 Commission meeting minutes approving the map\u2019s creation, and an historical undated map found in the County\u2019s road record book showing a portion of Modesty Creek Road. The record also includes other maps and surveys showing Modesty Creek Road, including: mining survey maps, homestead entry maps, U.S. Government Land Office maps, Forest Service maps, and County maps. A number of disinterested witnesses testified concerning the County\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the lower branch and the public\u2019s regular use of the road. Finally, the record contains additional documents describing mining activity in the area that would have necessitated a road running along Modesty Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b627 Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s assertion that the court did not adequately consider maps that do not depict Modesty Creek Road does not render the findings clearly erroneous because our review of the record indicates that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence or make a clear mistake. The court specifically found that Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s own expert \u201cagreed that just because a road is not on a county map does not mean that there is no county road in that location.\u201d Moreover, even when there is contradictory evidence, \u201cwe will uphold the district court if there is substantial credible evidence to support its findings.\u201d <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Jefferson Cnty., </em>\u00b6 31). The District Court recounted the evidence in detail, and we hold that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>is substantial credible evidence to support its findings. In light of the facts as found by the District Court, the court correctly applied the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard in concluding that Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch is a county road created by petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b628 Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s remaining contention is that even if the lower branch is a statutorily created county road, the record as a whole demonstrates that it must terminate in the eastern portion of Section 23, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. Pursuant to the March 1889 Commission meeting minutes, the lower branch ends \u201cas near as practicable to the mouth of Dry Gulch.\u201d Deer Lodge County Commissioners Records, <em>Deer Lodge County Commission Meeting Minutes, March 21, 1889, </em>Book 6,373. The parties disagree about Dry Gulch\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b629 Letica and McGee again assert that there is not any \u201ccounty-created evidence\u201d showing that the lower branch extends beyond the eastern edge of Section 23 \u2014 relying in particular on the 1896 County road map. Their reliance on the 1896 County road map is misplaced because, as the District Court found, Township 6 North, Range 11 West on the map is \u201cunsurveyed\u201d and therefore does not depict the particular section(s) where Dry Gulch is located.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b630 In determining Dry Gulch\u2019s location, and consequently the lower branch\u2019s terminus, the District Court considered testimony from longtime area residents regarding their understanding of Dry Gulch\u2019s location, historical maps depicting Dry Gulch, and historical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>documents describing Dry Gulch. Moreover, the court conducted a judicial site visit that confirmed historical placer digging in the gulch found by the court to be Dry Gulch in Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West. This historical placer digging evidence corresponds to Dry Gulch\u2019s description in the historical documents the court analyzed. The court further found that Ken Jenkins\u2019 testimony regarding Dry Gulch\u2019s location lacked \u201creliability and credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b631  After reviewing the record, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings establishing Dry Gulch\u2019s location along the eastern portion of Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West, are supported by substantial credible evidence. The court therefore correctly applied the \u201crecord taken as a whole\u201d standard in concluding that the lower branch terminates along the eastern edge of Section 22, Township 6 North, Range 11 West.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b632 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusions as to Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b633 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that the public holds a prescriptive easement across Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b634 The District Court determined that there is a public prescriptive easement on Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch. Letica and McGee argue that this holding was in error and that, even if the County proved a prescriptive easement on the upper branch, it was extinguished by reverse adverse possession. Because we find the latter argument dispositive, we assume for purposes of analysis that the District Court correctly found that a public prescriptive easement had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b635  Reverse adverse possession may extinguish a public prescriptive easement on a private road. <em>Pub.

Acts that are inconsistent with the public\u2019s claim by prescription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>are assertions of hostile rights that \u201cmust be brought to the attention of the owner [the public] and the use must continue for the fiill prescriptive period.\u201d <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 290, 856 P.2d at 531 (citation omitted).

Based on the lower branch\u2019s status as a statutorily created road, the court determined that it would be against public policy to allow Letica and McGee to extinguish the public prescriptive easement on the upper branch by blocking the lower branch. Applying our precedent to the historic record of Modesty Creek Road, we conclude that the status of the lower branch is not relevant to the analysis of whether reverse adverse possession extinguished the public prescriptive easement on the upper branch and we therefore disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"AL4\">\u00b637 In <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>a landowner closed the road in question to through traffic by installing locked gates. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 288, 856 P.2d at 530. The landowner subsequently created a walk-in program allowing public access to public land beyond his property. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 289-90, 856 P.2d at 530-31. Anyone who wanted to drive the road beyond the walk-in point had to get landowner permission. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 288-89, 856 P.2d at 530-31. We concluded that these actions \u201cevidenced a \u2018distinct and positive assertion of a hostile right\u2019 \u201d to the public\u2019s claimed prescriptive easement. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 290, 856 P.2d at 531 (quoting <em>Taylor v. Petranek, </em>173 Mont. 433, 438, 568 P.2d 120, 123 (1977)). The landowner, we reasoned, \u201cestablished reverse adverse possession because the state and local government, as well as the publie[,] cooperated and adhered to the walk-in policy which had been in existence for approximately 17 years.\u201d <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 290, 856 P.2d at 532. We held that such compliance with the road access restrictions \u201cwas inconsistent with the claim of a public prescriptive easement. Accordingly, any prescriptive easement the public may have acquired in the road was lost.\u201d <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 291, 856 P.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b638 In <em>Dome Mountain Ranch, </em>the Park County Commissioners declared the subject road a public road for the first time in 1994 after the public requested that the road be opened as a county road. <em>Dome </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 8. A previous landowner, however, had placed gates across the road in 1965 that often were locked. <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 6. The locked gates remained until 1998. <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 24. The record further established that \u201calthough members of the public occasionally used the road ... after gates and no trespassing signs were erected, such use was for recreational purposes.\u201d <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 24. We concluded that \u201cPark County and the public\u2019s acquiescence of locked gates being place[d] thereon for approximately 30 years extinguished Park County\u2019s public prescriptive easement, if one existed, on the subject road.\u201d <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b639 Here, similar to <em>Boone &amp; Crockett </em>and <em>Dome Mountain Ranch, </em>the record includes substantial evidence that locked gates on the lower branch blocked public access to the upper branch from 1980 until 2012. At trial, Letica\u2019s predecessor in interest, Cal Christian, testified that he installed and locked the green gate on the lower branch in 1980 after witnessing a number of vehicles on the property during hunting season. He also testified that the orange gate was installed and locked in the early 1980s. Cal\u2019s son Clayton Christian, who worked at the property, testified that the family placed ads in the paper to let the public know that they were restricting access to the property. Moreover, Cal Christian testified that the County never complained to him about the gates\u2019 placement and that the gates remained locked when he sold the property to Letica in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b640 Launderville, whom Letica employed from 1994 to approximately 2004, testified that the orange and green gates were installed and locked in the early 1980s and remained locked during the time he worked for Letica. He also testified that in the early to mid-1980s, DeMers removed a culvert at the orange gate, further hindering road access because the culvert allowed road users to cross Modesty Creek. The culvert was not replaced until 2002. Launderville testified that during those approximately twenty years he was unaware of anyone traveling that route beyond the orange gate. Ilija Letica testified that both the orange and green gates were locked continuously from the time he bought his property in 1989 until 2012 when the County declared both branches of Modesty Creek Road county roads. He further testified that no one, including the County, requested that the locks on the gates be removed during his ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">\u00b641 Additionally, the vast majority of testimony concerning the public accessing the upper branch came from witnesses who traveled the road prior to the gates\u2019 installation in the 1980s. Jim Heaphy, a longtime area resident, testified that he traveled the upper branch to access the lakes on the National Forest beginning in the late 1950s but that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>stopped using the road once the gates were locked on the lower branch because he considered it trespassing. Other members of the Heaphy family similarly testified to not traveling the upper branch once the gates were installed but said that they accessed the lakes by Forest Service trails instead. Charles Fudge, a district ranger for the Deer Lodge Ranger District, testified to using the upper branch to inspect dams on the lakes until 1976. Thomas Radonich, a longtime area resident, testified to traveling the upper branch to access the lakes in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b642 Connie Temes-Daniels, a County Commissioner from 1987 to 1990, testified that she traveled the upper branch in the late 1960s and did not travel up there again until the gates\u2019 removal. She further testified that she knew about the gates on the lower branch during her tenure as Commissioner. John Thomson, the County Road Department foreman from 1971 to 1989, testified that he knew about the locked gates but did not take any action to open them. He testified that the issue of the locked gates was \u201cturned over\u201d to the County Commission and that, as far as he knew, no action was taken. He further testified that the gates remained locked when he retired in 1989. Larry Sturm, the County Road Shop supervisor from 1993 to 2014, testified that he knew of the locked gates on Modesty Creek Road but did not take any action to remove them until the County reaffirmed the road as a county road in 2012. In contrast, he testified that he cut a lock off of a cable that McGee put across Spring Gulch Road \u2014 an undisputed county road \u2014 \u201cas soon as we found out about it.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He further testified that he promptly cut locks off of a gate installed by DeMers on Spring Gulch Road when he was \u201cmade aware of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b643 Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch provides access to the upper branch. Therefore, the installation and locking of the green and orange gates on the lower branch, plus the culvert\u2019s removal, restricted public access to the upper branch. Such acts by the various landowners evidence a \u201cdistinct and positive assertion of a hostile right\u201d to the public\u2019s claimed prescriptive easement on the upper branch. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 290, 856 P.2d at 531. Additionally, the testimony of the various witnesses demonstrates that the County and the public \u201cacquiesce[ed to] locked gates being place[d] thereon for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>approximately 30 years.\u201d <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b644 Like in <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>the public had to get permission to access the upper branch once the landowners installed the gates. At trial, Cal Christian testified that as far as he was aware, the public never came through the green gate without his permission during his ownership of the property. Hija Letica testified that during his ownership the public did not travel either branch of Modesty Creek Road and that the Forest Service asked for permission to travel the upper branch onto the National Forest. Other witness testimony evidences permissive use of the upper branch by the public following the gates\u2019installation in the 1980s. Dave Beck, whose family had water rights in a lake accessed by the upper branch, testified that his family had a key to the gates in the 1980s to access their water rights. Dan Kelley, who leased the Launderville parcel for grazing, testified that he had a key to the gates and had permission to go through the gates. Gerald Wendt, a former County employee, testified that he got permission from Cal Christian to access the area for trapping and had keys to the gates. Leo Nicholes, a longtime area resident who also had water rights in the lakes, testified that he had a key to the gates in order to access his water rights by way of the upper branch.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record demonstrates that for the most part, \u201cthe public cooperated and adhered\u201d to the permissive use policy following the gates\u2019 installation. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 290, 856 P.2d at 532. The public\u2019s asking for permission to use the upper branch and not regularly traveling beyond the locked gates to the upper branch without landowner permission is \u201cinconsistent with the claim of a public prescriptive easement\u201d over the upper branch. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 291, 856 P.2d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b645 Although Launderville testified that people sometimes cut fences in order to access the upper branch, occasional public use is not sufficient to conclude that reverse adverse possession did not extinguish the claimed prescriptive easement. <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-25. Moreover, on cross-examination, Launderville testified that when he worked for Letica he made an effort to prevent people from getting around the gates and accessing the upper branch. He further testified that a few specific individuals \u2014 DeMers and Rich Bowbent \u2014 were the principal offenders and that they traveled a route different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>upper branch after cutting the fence in order to access their pasture land on a neighboring section.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b646 The District Court is correct that a person may not obtain title to a statutorily created road by adverse possession. But Letica\u2019s and McGee\u2019s claim to Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch \u2014 which now has been determined to be a statutory road \u2014 does not determine as a matter of law the status of the upper branch \u2014 which is not a statutory road\u2014 on the basis of the record in this case. The District Court premised its conclusion that the prescriptive easement \u201cwas not extinguished by reverse adverse possession\u201d on an erroneous determination that \u201caccess to the road was never restricted in an adverse way to the public for the statutory period.\u201d Installing locked gates that blocked access to the upper branch well in excess of the statutory period, removing the culvert at the orange gate, and requiring permission to access the road beyond the gates all are acts that are incompatible with the nature or exercise of the public\u2019s claimed prescriptive easement over the upper branch. Although it ultimately turns out that the gates on the lower branch were blocking a public road, the record demonstrates that for thirty years everyone acquiesced in the understanding that these were private roads, and the owners of the subsequently claimed public prescriptive easement \u2014 the public \u2014 assented to these assertions of hostile rights by the landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b647 By declaring the upper branch a county road for the first time in 2012, the County recognized that the landowners had asserted hostile rights for the previous thirty years. In this case, such a declaration \u201c30 years after the ... gates ... were in place\u201d is irreconcilable with the County\u2019s public prescriptive easement claim. <em>Dome Mt. Ranch, LLC, </em>\u00b6 25 (noting that the public did not request, and the county did not declare, that the road be opened as a public road until approximately thirty years after gates and \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs were in place). The evidence illustrates that, given the historic understanding of the road\u2019s ownership since the Anaconda Company days, this case is not about a landowner intentionally and illegally blocking a public road and then trying to gain reverse adverse possession.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is not dispositive that the gates were installed on the lower branch. The public policy concern to which the District Court and the Dissent refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>is not \u201cat stake in the present case,\u201d Dissent \u00b6 55, because the Modesty Creek gates were \u201cknown to[] and acquiesced in by\u201d the County. <em>Boone &amp; Crockett, </em>259 Mont. at 283, 856 P.2d at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b648 Moreover, Montana statute provides that a prescriptive easement may be extinguished \u201cby disuse of the servitude by the owner of the servitude for the period prescribed for acquiring title by enjoyment.\u201d Section 70-17-lll(l)(d), MCA. The period prescribed for acquiring title by enjoyment is five years. Section 70-19-404, MCA. The record establishes that the general public essentially abandoned the upper branch for thirty years by not using it.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b649  We conclude that the District Court erred in its application of the law regarding reverse adverse possession to the facts existing on the upper branch. The court\u2019s conclusions of law therefore are incorrect. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court as to Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b650 We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Modesty Creek Road\u2019s lower branch is a statutorily created public road. We also affirm the court\u2019s findings as to the lower branch\u2019s terminus. We reverse its conclusion that the public prescriptive easement it found on Modesty Creek Road\u2019s upper branch was not extinguished by reverse adverse possession.

Because it was a county road, the landowners were not able to establish prescriptive rights over the road as a matter of law. <em>McCauley v. Thompson-Nistler, </em>2000 MT 215, \u00b6 33, 301 Mont. 81, 10 P.3d 794. The District Court further determined that there was no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>landowners in this case \u201ctook any legal steps before locking the orange gate and blocking access\u201d to the lower branch road and had no legal right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b654 Under these circumstances the District Court determined that it would violate public policy to allow Letica to extinguish a public prescriptive easement over the upper branch road by illegally closing the lower branch road. As the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">Thus, it would be improper for this Court to adopt a policy that allows an individual to illegally block a public statutorily created road (the lower branch road) and <em>claim </em>that the public prescriptive easement (over the upper branch road that branches off the lower branch road nearly a mile down from the orange gate) is extinguished by reverse adverse possession. Such a holding would be against public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b655 The majority disagrees with the District Court, citing <em>Boone and Crockett </em>and <em>Dome Mountain Ranch. </em>Those cases hold that a public prescriptive right to travel a road (as opposed to a road established and owned by a public entity) may be taken by reverse adverse possession. However, neither case considers the public policy issue at stake in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b656 The majority concludes that \u201cthe status of the lower branch is not relevant to the analysis of whether reverse adverse possession extinguished the public prescriptive easement on the upper branch. ....\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36.
