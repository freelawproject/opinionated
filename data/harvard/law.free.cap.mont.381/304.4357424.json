Cruson appeals the decision of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, affirming the Board of Labor Appeals\u2019 (Board) denial of unemployment benefits to him. We restate the issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred when it affirmed the Board\u2019s conclusion that Cruson was disqualified for unemployment benefits because his voluntary termination did not constitute \u201cgood cause attributable to the employer.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b63 Missoula Electric Cooperative, Inc. (MEC) employed Cruson as a master electrician from October 1,2001, until May 20, 2013. In 2009, Mark Hayden began working as the general manager for MEC. Shortly thereafter, Cruson complained to Hayden and members of MEC\u2019s management and board of directors that unqualified employees were performing work that only an electrician could perform. Cruson complained that having unqualified servicemen and linemen performing electrical work jeopardized his Master Electrician\u2019s License.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b64 In response to Cruson\u2019s complaints, Hayden implemented a computer system in late 2010 or early 2011 that allowed employees like Cruson to review whether work orders were being assigned properly. Hayden also advised supervisors to remind employees that they were not allowed to perform work beyond their capabilities and licensure. \u00b65 Also in response to Cruson\u2019s concerns, MEC contacted the Montana State Electrical Board in June 2012 for guidance regarding the scope of practice of a lineman versus an electrician. In February 2013, Anne O\u2019Leary, attorney for the Electrical Board, sent an email to MEC confirming that certain electrical work is outside the scope of a lineman\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">\u00b66 On or about August 4,2012, MEC posted a vacancy announcement for an apprentice lineman position. Cruson submitted his application for the position, which paid an hourly wage approximately 40% less than his master electrician\u2019s wage. In September 2012, MEC announced that it would not hire any of the applicants for the apprentice lineman position.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\u00b67 Cruson continued working as a master electrician for MEC after learning that he had not been hired for the apprentice lineman position. He did, however, file an age discrimination claim against MEC with the Montana Human Rights Bureau (Bureau). The Bureau issued a cause finding in Cruson\u2019s favor on April 13,2013. Four weeks later, MEC sent an e-mail to the Bureau making an unconditional offer of the apprentice lineman position to Cruson. Cruson rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"Ang\">\u00b68 In the meantime, Cruson did not encounter any other issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>regarding unqualified work until March 2013, when \u2014 using Hayden\u2019s computer system \u2014 he discovered three additional instances where work had been performed by unqualified employees ten years earlier, in March 2003. In April 2013, an MEC Operations Specialist advised Cruson of another work order showing impermissible work by a serviceman in the fall of 2012. Hayden claims that he did not learn of these instances until after Cruson quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b69 Cruson resigned from his position on or about May 19,2013. After leaving MEC, Cruson filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry\u2019s Unemployment Insurance Division (Department). The Department initially determined that Cruson was disqualified from receiving benefits, stating that his separation from MEC was without good cause attributable to his employment as required by \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA. Cruson filed a Request for Redetermination with the Department. In November 2013, the Department overturned its original finding and granted Cruson unemployment insurance benefits beginning on the date of his resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b610 Following the Redetermination, MEC filed a request for appeal with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry, Hearings Bureau (Hearings Bureau). The Hearings Bureau conducted a hearing on December 9,2013, at which Cruson and MEC were represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b611 At the hearing, Cruson testified that he quit, in part, due to the stress and anxiety he felt knowing that MEC employees were being directed to or allowed to perform work beyond their capabilities, and that jeopardized his Master Electrician\u2019s License. Cruson acknowledged that he had not received any disciplinary threats against his license for such unauthorized work. Cruson testified that MEC had done little or nothing to address his concerns. Cruson stated that he quit after being offered the apprentice lineman position because the hourly wage was 40% less than his wage as a master electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u00b612 Hayden testified that he addressed all of Cruson\u2019s concerns. He testified that supervisors and other members of management were instructed that they could not allow or encourage MEC employees to perform work beyond their capabilities and licensure. Hayden testified that he implemented a computer system to track work orders in an attempt to correct the problems. Hayden testified that he and other supervisors discussed various scenarios in which employees may be asked to perform work beyond their capabilities and thought that MEC was operating within the confines of the law. Hayden denied being aware of the issues Cruson discovered in March and April 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00b613 The hearing officer found that MEC attempted to address Cruson\u2019s concerns as they arose and concluded that \u201cthe evidence shows [the] reason offered for quitting does not constitute good cause attributable to the employment.\u201d The Hearings Bureau reversed the Department\u2019s Redetermination and concluded that Cruson was disqualified from receiving benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b614 Cruson appealed to the Board in December 2013. On February 11, 2014, the Board adopted and affirmed the decision of the Hearings Bureau. The Board\u2019s written decision concluded that \u201cwhile both parties made compelling arguments ... substantial evidence supports that there was no unreasonable action(s) by the employer.\u201d The Board noted that \u201cwhile Cruson may have had good personal reasons for leaving his employment, substantial evidence supports that he did not show he left work for good cause attributable to his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOo\">\u00b615 Cruson petitioned the District Court for judicial review, arguing that the Board erred by misapplying the legal standard regarding good cause attributable to the employer. Cruson also argued that the Hearings Bureau and Board improperly considered MEC\u2019s offer of the lower paying apprentice lineman position when weighing Cruson\u2019s eligibility for unemployment benefits, or in the alternative, that he should not be disqualified for benefits when required to accept a 40% reduction in wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b616 The District Court denied Cruson\u2019s appeal. It concluded that the Board \u201ccorrectly applied the law to the underlying facts when it determined that [Cruson] did not voluntarily leave his employment with good cause attributable to the employer.\u201d Cruson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b617 When a district court reviews a decision by the Board, the court reviews conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Sayler v. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>2014 MT 255A, \u00b6 13, 376 Mont. 369, 336 P.3d 358 (citation omitted). If supported by substantial evidence, the Board\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive, even if the court finds a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. <em>Johnson v. </em>W. <em>Transp., LLC, </em>2011 MT 13, \u00b6 17, 359 Mont. 145, 247 P.3d 1094 (citations omitted). The same standards apply to this Court\u2019s later review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Sayler, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it affirmed the Board\u2019s conclusion that Cruson was disqualified for unemployment benefits </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>because his voluntary termination did not constitute \u201cgood cause attributable to the employer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b619 A claimant \u201cmust be disqualified for benefits if the individual has left work without good cause attributable to the individual\u2019s employment.\u201d Section 39-51-2302(1), MCA. A claimant has left work with good cause attributable to employment if the claimant: (1) had compelling reasons arising from the work environment that caused the claimant to leave; (2) attempted to correct the problem in the work environment; and (3) informed the employer of the problem and gave the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct it. Section 39-51-1214(2)(a), MCA; Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(1)(a). \u201cCompelling reasons\u201d as used in Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(2), in pertinent part, include but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">(a) undue risk, as compared to work in similar occupations or industries, of injury, illness, physical impairment, or reasonably foreseeable risks to the claimant\u2019s morals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">(b) unreasonable actions by the employer concerning hours, wages, terms of employment or working conditions, including, but not limited to, reductions of 20 percent or more in the claimant\u2019s customary wages or hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b620 According to Cruson, the Board\u2019s findings of fact support all the elements of the \u201cgood cause attributable to the employer\u201d standard. Cruson argues that the \u201ccompelling reason\u201d element is met because 1) he faced an undue risk of losing his \u201clicense and livelihood\u201d when MEC linemen performed improper work, and 2) the offered apprentice position paid significantly less than his current master electrician position. Cruson stresses that the Montana State Electrical Board can punish any licensed electrician who allows his license to be violated. Cruson asserts that MEC, as the power supplier utilizing Cruson\u2019s license, had a duty to prevent employees from violating that license. Cruson contends that if he allowed improper work to occur at MEC, he \u201cwould be complicit in allowing unsafe conditions to exist on his watch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b621 Cruson argues that \u201cnothing in the \u2018good cause attributable to the employer\u2019 standard requires an employee to accept a lower-paying position in order to remedy the employer\u2019s violation of the law.\u201d Cruson cites to Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(2)(b) defining a compelling reason to include \u201creductions of 20% or more in the claimant\u2019s customary wages or hours.\u201d Cruson claims that he would have incurred a 40% decrease in wages had he accepted the apprentice lineman offer \u2014 thereby giving him a compelling reason to reject the offer and terminate his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u00b622 Cruson next argues that the Board\u2019s factual findings support the second element of the statutory good cause standard because he \u201cdid everything he possibly could\u201d to fix the problems at MEC. Cruson asserts that he voiced his concerns to \u201cmultiple\u201d MEC managers. Cruson points out that Hayden acknowledged receiving complaints from Cruson on a quarterly basis. Cruson also states that he shared his concerns with the lead inspector for the Missoula County Buildings Department and the head of the State of Montana Electrical Division.</p>\n<p id=\"AU3\">\u00b623 Cruson argues that the Board\u2019s findings support the third element of the \u201cgood cause attributable to the employer\u201d standard because he reported the improper work to management, giving MEC a reasonable opportunity to correct the problem. Cruson points out that Hayden acknowledged the problem and accepted that it was his responsibility to fix it. Cruson asserts that Hayden nonetheless never disciplined any MEC managers or linemen and that the problems persisted up until \u201cjust days before h\u00e9 quit\u201d \u2014 when he discovered three instances of work having been performed by unqualified employees. Cruson contends that he provided MEC management \u201cnearly three full years to do something about linemen violating his license to no avail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b624 MEC argues that Cruson did not have a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d to leave work because he had not been disciplined for the issues he complained of while working for MEC and thus his license was never at risk. Further, MEC rejects Cruson\u2019s contention that the lower paying lineman position gave him a compelling reason to quit because MEC never requested Cruson to take a pay cut; Cruson applied for the job on his own volition; and Cruson indicated he was financially able to absorb the loss and was willing to take the position despite the pay cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b625 MEC asserts that it had corrected, or was working to correct, all of Cruson\u2019s concerns. MEC claims that \u201cHayden took Cruson\u2019s concerns seriously and attempted to correct the issues as they arose.\u201d MEC emphasizes that Hayden implemented a computer system to review work orders and advised supervisors to instruct linemen that they were not permitted to perform electrical work. MEC underscores the fact that Hayden and MEC contacted both a Missoula County employee and the Montana State Electrical Board regarding the scope of practice for linemen versus electricians to ensure that MEC\u2019s employees were performing their work consistent with laws and regulations. MEC claims that subsequent incidents, where employees performed work beyond their qualifications, were never brought to Hayden\u2019s attention until after Cruson quit. It contends that MEC \u201ccannot be faulted for not correcting problems that Cruson did not bring to [its] attention and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of which it had no knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b626 The hearing officer entered findings of fact and ultimately concluded that Hayden and MEC took Cruson\u2019s concerns seriously and attempted to address his concerns as they arose. The hearing officer noted that Hayden\u2019s testimony was \u201cclear, direct, and sounded sincere.\u201d The hearing officer also found that because the apprentice lineman position was governed by a collective bargaining agreement and joint apprenticeship training agreement, it was unreasonable for Cruson to believe that he would continue receiving the same hourly wage as a master electrician. Finally, the hearing officer noted that, even after Cruson refused the lineman position, he could have continued his employment working as a master electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Board\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b627 In a judicial proceeding to review the Board\u2019s determination of a claim for unemployment benefits, \u201cthe findings of the board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive and jurisdiction of [the] court shall be confined to questions of law.\u201d Section 39-51-2410(5), MCA. When reviewing a final agency decision, substantial evidence requires \u201cmore than a scintilla of evidence, but less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Somont Oil Co. v. King, </em>2012 MT 207, \u00b6 19, 366 Mont. 251, 286 P.3d 585 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 17). Applying this standard, we have reversed the Board\u2019s findings of fact when they were \u201cplainly not supported by the record or where the Board failed to review the record in making its decision.\u201d <em>Somont, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Mont. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. State Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>2006 MT 298, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 334 Mont. 425, 148 P.3d 619 (reversing the Board\u2019s decision where the Board reversed the hearing officer without reviewing the record)). Judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision should not involve reconsideration of the evidence. <em>Somont, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 18). \u201cIt is not our job to weigh conflicting evidence presented to the Board.\u201d <em>Gypsy Highview Gathering Sys., Inc. v. Stokes </em>221 Mont. 11, 15, 716 P.2d 620, 623 (1986). Rather, we determine only \u201cwhether there is evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Gypsy Highview, </em>221 Mont. at 15, 716 P.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b628 Here, the Board reasonably concluded that the findings, as made by the hearing officer, were supported by the evidence. The Board based its decision on its review of the entire record, as well as arguments and closing comments from both parties as to the relevant criteria under Admin R. M. 24.11.457. The Board provided specific reasons in its final decision for affirming the hearing officer\u2019s findings. The District Court, in turn, determined that the findings affirmed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the Board were supported by substantial evidence \u201ceven though there may also have been some evidence to the contrary.\u201d Like the District Court, we need not determine whether this Court would reach the same conclusion on the evidence presented. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 18. Based on our own review of the record and the substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s decision, we agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b629 In his reply brief, Cruson references and attaches a Montana State Electrical Board complaint proceeding entitled, <em>In the Matter of the Proposed Discipline of Case No. 2013-ELE-LIC-1600 </em>(Stipulation and Final Order). While not part of the record before the Board or the District Court, Cruson asserts that this Court should take judicial notice of the complaint \u201cbecause it undermines [MEC\u2019s] assertion that the law was unclear and that [Cruson\u2019s] license was never at risk.\u201d \u00b630 We generally do not take judicial notice of evidence not presented to the district court. <em>Holtz v. Babcock, </em>143 Mont. 341, 373, 390 P.2d 801, 802 (1964) (quoting 20 Am. Jur. <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 27 (1936) (\u201cthe general rule is that if the attention of the trial court is not called to a fact within its judicial knowledge and such fact is not judicially noticed, the appellate court will not take judicial notice of it\u201d)). This rule is particularly apropos here, where our review is confined to whether the Board had substantial evidence for its decision. In any event, we disagree with Cruson\u2019s assertion. The stipulation and order in the complaint proceeding \u2014 issued in late 2014 \u2014 do not prove any fact relevant here other than that that MEC acknowledged that linemen should not have performed certain electrical jobs without a license. MEC acknowledges the same in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The Board\u2019s Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"AHn\">\u00b631 In deciding whether the Board\u2019s legal conclusions are correct, we review the record of all prior proceedings. <em>See Mont. Dep\u2019t ofCorr., </em>\u00b6 24. \u201cWe apply a deferential standard of review to an agency\u2019s interpretation in matters of its expertise.\u201d <em>Somont, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Gypsy Highview, </em>221 Mont. at 16, 716 P.2d at 623 (deferring to the Board\u2019s conclusion as to unsafe working conditions because the Board had expertise in the area and was in better position to determine safety)).</p>\n<p id=\"Av2\">\u00b632 Cruson argues that the Board erred as a matter of law by determining that MEC\u2019s attempt to fix Cruson\u2019s complaints \u201cas they arose\u201d satisfies the \u201cgood cause attributable to the employer\u201d standard. Cruson argues that the plain language of the standard in Admin. R. M. 24.11.457 requires an employer, once on notice, to correct the problem, not just to attempt to correct it. Cruson asserts that the statute does not merely require the employer to react in a reasonable time, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>actually to fix the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b633 Cruson also claims that the Board erred when it concluded that Cruson could have remained employed as MEC\u2019s master electrician despite the problems of which he complains. To support his claim, Cruson cites to <em>Gypsy Highview, </em>where we stated that \u201can employee need not wait to be seriously injured before acting to remove himself from an unsafe working environment.\u201d <em>Gypsy Highview, </em>221 Mont. at 16, 716 P.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b634 MEC contends that Cruson\u2019s argument \u201crequests this Court to substitute its view of what is a \u2018reasonable opportunity5 to correct.\u201d MEC asserts that the statute neither defines \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d nor does it require that the employer \u201cimmediately and completely correct the issue, without exception.\u201d MEC claims that it was not until February 2013, when it received correspondence from the Montana State Electrical Board, that it learned that certain electrical work is outside the scope of a lineman\u2019s practice. MEC also claims that Cruson failed to inform Hayden of his subsequent discovery of events where MEC employees performed work for which they were not qualified. \u00b635 We agree with MEC that whether an employer had a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to correct an issue is left to the fact finder \u2014 in this case, the Board. The Board concluded that Cruson\u2019s reasons for leaving were personal and that there was no unreasonable action by MEC. The Board cited to the evidence to support this determination. The facts reasonably may be interpreted to support the Board\u2019s legal conclusion. Whether an employer takes sufficient action to respond to an employee\u2019s legitimate complaints is not a determination that a reviewing court should second-guess under the standard prescribed by \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA. While Cruson may have had good personal reasons to leave his job at MEC, evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that those reasons were not \u201ccompelling,\u201d as defined by Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(2), in light of MEC\u2019s responsive actions. The hearing officer found no indication that Cruson\u2019s license was ever at risk, and MEC did not reduce Cruson\u2019s wages or compel him to seek a lower-paying position. Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s decision that MEC did not act unreasonably and had corrected, or was working to correct, problems within a reasonable time period by tracking work orders, instructing employees to work within the scope of their licensure, and changing internal policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b636  Because the Board\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence, its legal conclusion \u2014 that \u201cgood cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>attributable to the employer\u201d has not been shown under \u00a7 39-51-1214(2)(a), MCA, or Admin. R. M. 24.11.457(l)(a) \u2014 was correct. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
