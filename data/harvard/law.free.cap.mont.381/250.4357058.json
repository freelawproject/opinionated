The State challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the District Court\u2019s ruling that the limitations period for unlawful possession of wildlife under \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, begins to run on the date a person gains control or ownership of unlawfully taken wildlife. We accept review of the petition in this instance because the case presents a purely legal issue for which there would be no adequate remedy on appeal if the District Court erred. For the following reasons, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly applied the statute of limitations to violations of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s June 10, 2015 order dismissing Counts I and V against McGrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b62 The State charged McGrath with a number of offenses under Title 87, MCA, including four counts of unlawfiil possession of wildlife under \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA. McGrath moved to dismiss two of the counts \u2014 Count I (felony possession of a mountain goat) and Count V (misdemeanor possession of a bobcat) \u2014 on the grounds that the statute of limitations barred prosecution. McGrath relied on \u00a7 45-l-205(2)(a) and (5), MCA, asserting that the limitations period for unlawful possession of wildlife begins on the date a person gains control or ownership of the unlawfully taken wildlife.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b63 The State argued that because \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, criminalizes the possession of unlawfully taken wildlife, the limitations period does not begin until a person no longer possesses the unlawfully taken wildlife. The State analogized a violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, to \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, which makes it an offense to possess dangerous drugs. The State asserted that concluding that the charges against McGrath were time-barred would be similar to concluding that the statute of limitations barred prosecution of a defendant who had taken possession of dangerous drugs more than five years before being found in possession of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b64 The District Court agreed with McGrath and dismissed Counts I and V. In doing so, the court relied on <em>State v. Mullin, </em>268 Mont. 214, 886 P.2d 376 (1994), and <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>252 Mont. 496, 830 P.2d 1264 (1992). The court reasoned that \u201c[a]dopting and applying the State\u2019s interpretation of the statutes to this case would essentially nullify the statute of limitations for wildlife crimes involving possession of an animal until a date that could far exceed the statute of limitations expiration date ... .\u201d The State petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b65 <em>1. Propriety of Supervisory Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b66 Pursuant to Article VII, section 2(2), of the Montana Constitution, this Court may exercise supervisory control over other courts. We are justified in doing so when \u201curgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeals process inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when ... the other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice.\u201d M. R. App. P. 14(3). \u2018We will assume supervisory control over a district court to direct the course of litigation if the court is proceeding based on a mistake of law, which ifuncorrected, would cause significant injustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Mont. Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 5, 361 Mont. 279, 259 P.3d 754 (citing <em>Simms v. Mont. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 135, 68 P.3d 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b67 We find it appropriate to review the State\u2019s contentions here. The State presents a purely legal question: whether a violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, is continuous conduct for statute of limitations purposes. Such determinations primarily involve statutory interpretation because \u201c[a] particular offense should not be construed as continuing \u2018unless the explicit language of the substantive criminal statute compels such a conclusion, or the nature of the crime involved is such that [the legislature] must assuredly have intended that it be treated as a continuing one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>252 Mont. at 500, 830 P.2d at 1267 (quoting <em>Toussie v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 112, 115, 90 S. Ct. 858, 860 (1970)). Moreover, whether a violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, is continuous conduct for statute of limitations purposes is an issue of first impression, and the answer will govern whether the trial proceeds on two of the five counts against McGrath. The State is not permitted \u201cto appeal from an order that dismisses one count but leaves the case still pending.\u201d <em>State v. Watters, </em>2009 MT 163, \u00b6 16, 350 Mont. 465, 208 P.3d 408 (citing \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA). As such, failure to assume supervisory control would cause significant injustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy. We therefore grant the State\u2019s petition and exercise supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b68 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the statute of limitations for a violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, begins when a person takes possession of illegally taken wildlife.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b69 Section 87-6-202(1), MCA, makes it unlawful for a person to \u201cpossess, ship, or transport all or part of any game fish, bird, game animal, or fur-bearing animal that was unlawfully killed, captured, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>taken, whether killed, captured, or taken in Montana or outside of Montana.\u201d We recognized in <em>State v. Norman, </em>2010 MT 253, 358 Mont. 252, 244 P.3d 737, that the State must prove three elements to convict a defendant under \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA: (1) that the defendant possessed all or part of any game animal; (2) that the game animal was unlawfully killed, captured, or taken, whether killed, captured, or taken in Montana or outside of Montana; and (3) that the defendant acted purposely or knowingly. <em>Norman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 39 (construing \u00a7 87-3-111, MCA (repealed and codified at \u00a7 87-6-202, MCA)). The focus of the statute is therefore not the unlawful killing or taking of wildlife, but the purposeful or knowing possession of wildlife that has been unlawfully killed or taken. <em>Norman, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b6 10 Here, the District Court correctly focused on McGrath\u2019s possession of the unlawfully taken wildlife \u2014 as opposed to when the wildlife was illegally taken \u2014 in analyzing when the statute of limitations began. The court, however, incorrectly relied on <em>Mullin </em>in concluding that the elements for Counts I and V were met \u2014 and thus the limitations period began running \u2014 when McGrath knowingly exerted control of the illegally taken wildlife and did not relinquish or terminate his control.</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">\u00b611 In <em>Mullin, </em>the defendant was charged with felony theft in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. <em>Mullin, </em>268 Mont. at 215, 886 P.2d at 376. The only issue on appeal was whether felony theft is continuous conduct for purposes of the statute of limitations. <em>Mullin, </em>268 Mont. at 215, 886 P.2d at 376. We began our discussion by citing the pertinent definitions of theft found in \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">(1) A person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">(b) purposely or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(3) A person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have been stolen by another and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">(b) purposely or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">In rejecting the State\u2019s argument that felony theft is continuous conduct, we concluded that the \u201cplain language of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, does not state that theft is a continuing offense. Nor does the nature of the crime compel a conclusion that the Legislature intended that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>taime be treated as continuing.\u201d <em>Mullin, </em>268 Mont. at 217, 886 P.2d at 378. We cited decisions from other jurisdictions holding that theft is not a continuing offense and quoted the following language with approval: \u201c[T]he crime of receiving and concealing stolen property is not a continuing offense and... the statute of limitations begins to run when the crime is complete, to wit: when the property is received and concealed with the knowledge that the same is stolen.\u201d <em>Mullin, </em>268 Mont. at 218, 886 P.2d at 378 (quoting <em>State v. Webb, </em>311 So. 2d 190, 191 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b612 Here, the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Mullin </em>is misplaced. The statute at issue in <em>Mullin </em>provides that it is an offense <em>to obtain or exert control </em>over stolen property. In contrast, the statute at issue here provides that it is an offense <em>to possess </em>illegally taken wildlife. The nature of the offense in <em>Mullin </em>is therefore different from the nature of the offense here. As we noted in <em>Mullin, </em>the crime of receiving stolen property is complete \u2014 and therefore the limitations period begins \u2014 when the property is received with the knowledge that it is stolen. Here, the statute criminalizes the act of possession and is not limited to receipt of the property. The weight of authority supports the conclusion that the crime of possessing illegally taken wildlife is complete \u2014 and therefore the limitations period begins \u2014 when a person stops possessing the wildlife. <em>United States v. Winnie, </em>97 F.3d 975 (7th Cir. 1996); <em>State v. Maidwell, 50 </em>P.3d 439 (Idaho 2002). <em>See also United States v. Blizzard, </em>27 F.3d 100 (4th Cir. 1994); <em>United States v. Krstic, </em>558 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2009); <em>People v. Bland, </em>898 P.2d 391 (Cal. 1995). The Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Maidwell </em>decision and the Seventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Winnie </em>decision are particularly persuasive because both involve wildlife possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b613 In <em>Maidwell, </em>the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of wildlife and argued that the statute of limitations barred prosecution. <em>Maidwell, </em>50 P.3d at 439-440. The statute at issue provided that \u201cno person shall have in his possession any wildlife or parts thereof protected by the provisions of this title ....\u201d Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 36-502(b). The Court concluded that unlawful possession of wildlife is continuous conduct for statute of limitations purposes because \u201cthe legislature made it unlawful for any person to \u201chave in his possession\u2019 the wildlife parts, rather than to \u2018take possession of the wildlife parts.\u201d <em>Maidwell, </em>50 P.3d at 442. Moreover, the Court noted, \u201cThe wording chosen by the legislature clearly indicates an intent to make this crime a continuing offense.\u201d <em>Maidwell, </em>50 P.3d at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b614 In Winnie, the defendant was charged with possessing a cheetah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>in violation of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538(c)(1). <em>Winnie, </em>97 F.3d at 975. Similar to the District Court\u2019s conclusion here, the defendant asserted that the statute of limitations barred prosecution because all the elements of the offense were present when the defendant took possession of the cheetah more than five years before the charges were brought. <em>Winnie, </em>97 F.3d at 975. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument, the court noted that such a position was \u201ccontrary to the plain language of the statute, part of which makes it a crime \u2018to possess\u2019 protected wildlife.\u201d <em>Winnie, </em>97 F.3d at 976. The court further noted that the defendant\u2019s \u201canalysis would require a conclusion that the crime defined by Congress was \u2018to take possession of illegally traded wildlife ... rather than \u2018to possess\u2019 wildlife.\u201d <em>Winnie, </em>97 F.3d at 976. The court concluded that the limitations period \u201cdid not begin to run until [the defendant] ceased possessing the cheetah. It was only then that he stopped violating the law.\u201d <em>Winnie, </em>97 F.3d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b615  Similar to the Endangered Species Act and the Idaho statute, the plain language of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, makes it unlawful \u201cto possess\u201d illegally taken wildlife rather than \u201cto take possession of\u2019 illegally taken wildlife. Therefore, a person stops violating \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA \u2014 and the limitations period begins to rim \u2014 only when he or she ceases to possess illegally taken wildlife. The District Court therefore erred in determining that the statute of limitations for a violation of \u00a7 87-6-202(1), MCA, begins when a person takes possession of illegally taken wildlife.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b616 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b617 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Counts I and V against McGrath is REVERSED. We remand this case to the District Court to reinstate Counts I and V and for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b618 The Clerk of Court is directed to provide copies hereof to all counsel of record and the Honorable Kurt Krueger, Second Judicial District Court Judge, presiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">DATED this 13th day of October, 2015.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-9\">/S/ PATRICIA COTTER /s/ laurie McKinnon</judges>\n<judges id=\"b281-10\">/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT</judges>\n<judges id=\"AWO\">/S/ JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
