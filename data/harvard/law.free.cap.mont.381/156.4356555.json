In 2011, the State charged Thompson with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Thompson filed a motion to dismiss in Justice Court under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, on the basis that he had not been brought to trial within six months of entering his not-guilty plea. The Justice Court denied the motion, and the District Court affirmed, both concluding that good cause existed to hold Thompson\u2019s trial past the six-month deadline provided in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. On appeal to this Court, Thompson seemingly concedes that pursuant to our decision in <em>State v. Luke, </em>2014 MT 22, 373 Mont. 398, 321 P.3d 70, the Justice Court correctly denied his motion to dismiss. However, Thompson requests that we overrule <em>Luke. </em>We decline to do so. We affirm the decisions of the Justice Court and District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: whether good cause existed for the Justice Court to conduct Thompson\u2019s trial past the six-month deadline provided in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b63 On October 11, 2011, the State charged Thompson with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). On the same day, Thompson appeared in Justice Court and pled not guilty. Thompson\u2019s acknowledgment of rights upon his plea of not guilty provided, in part: \u201cI understand that I am required to attend an omnibus hearing and pretrial conference. I understand that if I fail to attend either the omnibus hearing or the pretrial conference that I will have waived my right to a jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u00b64 The Justice Court conducted an omnibus hearing on December 27, 2011. Thompson and his counsel appeared in person. The omnibus order, which Thompson and his counsel both signed, stated that \u201cif either party requests a jury trial, the court will send the parties notice of the jury trial date and will set a pretrial conference a week before trial.\u201d The order further provided that the party requesting a jury trial shall \u201c[ajppear and confirm the party\u2019s intention to proceed to trial by jury.\u201d The order concluded with the following warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">If the party requesting a jury trial either fails to appear at the pretrial conference and to confirm the party\u2019s intention to proceed to trial by jury or fails to file and serve proposed jury instructions and verdict form at or before the pretrial conference, the party shall be deemed to have waived the party\u2019s right to trial by jury and the jury trial shall be vacated and the case re-set by the Court for a bench trial at the next available time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Thompson requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>\u00b65 On December 29,2011, the Justice Court notified Thompson that a jury trial would be held on March 22, 2012 and that the pretrial conference would be held on March 16,2012. The notice of the pretrial conference stated: \u201cThe court hereby orders the personal attendance of the defendant at this hearing.\u201d Like the omnibus order, the notice warned Thompson that if he failed to appear at the pretrial conference and confirm his intention to proceed to trial by jury, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to trial by jury and the \u201cjury trial shall be vacated and the case re-set by the Court for a bench trial at the next available time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b66 Thompson\u2019s counsel appeared at the March 16, 2012 pretrial conference, but Thompson did not appear. As a result of Thompson\u2019s failure to appear at the conference, the Justice Court vacated the March 22,2012 jury trial and reset the case for a bench trial on April 30,2012.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b67 On May 1, 2012, Thompson filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis that trial was being held beyond the six-month deadline imposed by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. The Justice Court denied Thompson\u2019s motion, concluding that there was good cause for the delay. The court found that if Thompson had appeared at the pretrial conference, the scheduled March 22, 2012 jury trial would have occurred and Thompson would have been brought to trial within six months after pleading not guilty. The court found that Thompson\u2019s \u201cvacating of the jury trial is what necessitated finding additional time or other time on the court\u2019s calendar aside from Thursdays... which is the day reserved for jury trials in this court and the next time available on the court\u2019s calendar for a one-hour bench trial... was April 30, 2012.\u201d After the court denied Thompson\u2019s motion, he pled guilty to DUI and the court sentenced him to a six-month sentence, with all but 24 hours suspended. Thompson reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b68 Thompson appealed his conviction to the District Court, which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss. The District Court reasoned that the delay in the trial was attributable to Thompson, because there was a direct connection between Thompson\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference and the delay in his trial. The court noted that Thompson had been clearly advised that if he failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>appear at the pretrial conference, his jury trial would be vacated and a bench trial would be rescheduled for the Justice Court\u2019s next available date. The District Court concluded that good cause existed to justify the delay in Thompson\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b69 Thompson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b610 Whether the right to a speedy trial under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, has been violated is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">\u00b611 <em>Whether good cause existed for the Justice Court to conduct Thompson\u2019s trial past the six-month deadline provided in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u00b612 Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[ajfter the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.\u201d The statute itself serves as the \u201csole standard of whether \u2018good cause\u2019 for the delay has been shown.\u201d <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, \u00b6 13, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543 (citing <em>State v. Ronningen, </em>213 Mont. 358, 362, 691 P.2d 1348, 1350 (1984)). \u201cGood cause necessarily depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">\u00b613 In <em>Luke, </em>we held, under facts that are indistinguishable from the case at bar, that the justice court had good cause for conducting the defendant\u2019s trial beyond the six-month deadline provided in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 22. In that case, the State charged Luke with five misdemeanor offenses in Flathead County Justice Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 3. Luke indicated his desire to be tried by a jury and the court warned him that if he failed to personally appear at the pretrial conference his jury trial would be vacated and a bench trial would be scheduled. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 4. Like Thompson, Luke failed to appear at the conference. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 5. As a result, the justice court vacated his jury trial and scheduled a bench trial at the next available date on the court\u2019s calendar, which was eight days past the six-month deadline. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 6. On the day of the bench trial, Luke moved to dismiss his case on speedy trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>grounds, arguing that trial was being held beyond the deadline imposed by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 6. The justice court denied the motion, reasoning that good cause existed to hold the trial past the deadline, based on Luke\u2019s failure to appear at the pretrial conference, which necessitated delay. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b614 On appeal to this Court, Luke asserted that his failure to attend the \u201cpretrial conference did not disrupt the Justice Court\u2019s schedule,\u201d and posited that with the jury trial already scheduled the court \u201cshould have simply converted\u201d the jury trial date into a bench trial date and heard evidence that day. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 18. We affirmed the justice court. We explained that a justice court \u201cmust retain a measure of flexibility over scheduling to hear cases on its docket.\u201d <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. 162, 167, 940 P.2d 108, 111 (1997)). We rejected the rule proposed by Luke that would have required a court to convert a scheduled jury trial into a bench trial when the defendant has waived his right to a jury trial by failing to appear at a mandatory pretrial conference. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">In this State, we do not have juries available on standby for one defendant, waiting to see whether that defendant will plead guilty, request a continuance, or request a bench trial. Trial courts, therefore, must maximize the presence of a jury panel by setting several trials on the day for which it has issued juror summonses.... [T]his is, in fact, the only way in which Montana trial courts can assure defendants that they will receive the jury trial to which each of them is entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19. Luke also relied heavily on <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543, in which we held that Bertolino\u2019s passive disregard for court-ordered deadlines did not constitute good cause for delaying her trial beyond the six-month time limit. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 15. We distinguished <em>Bertolino </em>by explaining that \u201c[ujnlike <em>Bertolino, </em>where there was no indication that Bertolino\u2019s failure to comply with court orders necessitated a continuance of the trial, there is a clear and direct connection between Luke\u2019s failure to appear punctually for the pretrial conference and his trial date[] being rescheduled\u201d beyond the six-month deadline. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b615 Here, in arguing the State failed to establish good cause for the delay in his case, Thompson concedes that <em>Luke </em>is factually indistinguishable, but contends that <em>Luke </em>should be revisited. To support his contention, Thompson reiterates Luke\u2019s former arguments. He argues that his absence from the court-ordered pretrial conference \u201cwas a mere technicality,\u201d posits that the court should have simply \u201cconducted a bench trial during the time scheduled for a jury trial,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and relies heavily on <em>Bertolino. </em>Additionally, Thompson relies on this Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>City of Helena v. Broadwater, </em>2014 MT 185, 375 Mont. 450, 329 P.3d 589, and argues it also supports reversal of <em>Luke.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b616 We have explained that under the doctrine of stare decisis \u201cprinciples of law should he positively and definitely settled in order that courts, lawyers, and, above all, citizens may have some assurance that important legal principles involving their highest interests shall not be changed from day to day, with the resultant disorders that of necessity must accrue from such changes.\u201d <em>Certain v. Tonn, </em>2009 MT 330, \u00b6 19, 353 Mont. 21, 220 P.3d 384 (quoting <em>St. ex rel. Sparling v. Hitsman, </em>99 Mont. 521, 525, 44 P.2d 747, 749 (1935)) (internal brackets omitted). While stare decisis is not a rigid doctrine that \u201cforecloses the reexamination of cases when necessary, \u2018weighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Certain, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wagner-Ells worth, </em>2008 MT 240, \u00b6 39, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042).</p>\n<p id=\"AVn\">\u00b617 We decline to revisit <em>Luke </em>as we continue to find our reasoning there persuasive. We again reject the adoption of a rule that would require a court to convert a scheduled jury trial into a bench trial to accommodate the defendant\u2019s right to be brought to trial within six months when the defendant has waived his right to a jury trial by failing to appear at a court-ordered pretrial conference. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19. A court \u201cmust retain a measure of flexibility over scheduling to hear cases on its docket.\u201d <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald, </em>283 Mont. at 167, 940 P.2d at 111), As we explained in <em>Luke, </em>we do not have juries available on standby in Montana, and thus trial courts \u201cmust maximize the presence of a jury panel\u201d by holding jury trials on the day for which they have issued juror summonses. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19. This is \u201cthe only way in which Montana trial courts can assure defendants that they will receive the jury trial to which each of them is entitled.\u201d <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"APS\">\u00b618  We also find Thompson\u2019s reliance on <em>Broadwater </em>to be misplaced. In <em>Broadwater, </em>we held that the City failed to establish good cause for delaying Broadwater\u2019s trial beyond the six-month time limit. <em>Broadwater, </em>\u00b6 19. There, the City\u2019s exclusive \u201cgood cause\u201d argument for the delay was that the municipal court\u2019s docket was crowded. <em>Broadwater, </em>\u00b6 18. In rejecting the City\u2019s argument, we explained that the City presented \u201cno evidence of any actions it took in an attempt to ensure that Broadwater\u2019s trial would be held in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Broadwater, </em>\u00b6 18. <em>Broadwater </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in the same way that we concluded in <em>Luke </em>that <em>Bertolino </em>was factually distinguishable from that case. Unlike in <em>Broadwater </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and <em>Bertolino, </em>where there was no connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and a delay in the trial, here the delay, as in <em>Luke, </em>is directly attributable to the defendant. There existed a \u201cclear and direct connection\u201d between Thompson\u2019s failure to appear at the conference and the delay in his trial. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 17. The Justice Court provided Thompson with a jury date within the six-month statutory period and had Thompson appeared at the court-ordered pretrial conference he would have received a trial within that period. Thompson\u2019s failure to appear at the court-ordered pretrial conference directly caused his trial to be continued past the six-month deadline provided in \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b619 The Justice Court \u201cwas not required to convert the jury trial into a bench trial in order to accommodate [Thompson\u2019s] speedy trial right when he had failed to comply with the court\u2019s order requiring him to appear at the pretrial conference.\u201d <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 19. Thompson\u2019s \u201cnotice of the pretrial conference, his notice of the consequences of not appearing personally at the conference, his unexcused absence from the conference, and the Justice Court\u2019s prompt rescheduling of his trial constituted, together, good cause for holding his trial\u201d past the six-month deadline. <em>Luke, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b620  We conclude the Justice Court did not err in denying Thompson\u2019s motion to dismiss. We accordingly hold the District Court did not err in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> The bench trial was later continued to accommodate a material witness. Thompson does not contend that the Justice Court improperly continued the bench trial beyond the April 30,2012, date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-12\"> The justice court in <em>Luke </em>was the same justice court in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-9\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"ACr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b622 My dissent in this case conforms to my dissent in <em>State v. Luke, </em>2014 MT 22, \u00b6\u00b6 24-31, 373 Mont. 398, 321 P.3d 70. I conclude once again, under <em>Bertolino, </em>that a defendant\u2019s passive mistakes or omissions do not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for purposes of avoiding dismissal. <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543. Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, <em>requires </em>dismissal of a misdemeanor charge against a defendant if, after the entry of a plea, the defendant is not brought to trial within six months, the State fails to show good cause for the delay, and trial has not been delayed by any motion of the defendant. Thompson\u2019s failure to personally appear at the pre-trial hearing in this case is a technicality that did not delay process and, in my opinion, does not meet the standard for \u201cgood cause\u201d because the delay was not \u201c[a postponement] upon the defendant\u2019s motion....\u201d Section 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">\u00b623 Under <em>Bertolino, </em>the State has the burden of showing good cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>for delay to overcome its statutory obligation to bring the case to trial in six months. The State cannot point to any motion or action taken by Thompson that delayed the trial date in this case; it only points to Thompson\u2019s failure to attend a hearing where his attorney was present. By contrast, I note that this case is not similar to <em>Fitzgerald </em>where we found \u201cgood cause\u201d because Fitzgerald\u2019s motions and conduct clearly delayed the proceedings beyond the six-month deadline. Here, unlike <em>Fitzgerald, </em>there is no evidence in the record showing similar conduct that is evidence of good cause. In my view, the State has not met its burden of showing good cause for the delay sufficient to alleviate its statutory obligation to bring the case to trial within six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b624 Thompson and Luke both fall within a no man\u2019s land between the clearly set out rules in <em>Bertolino </em>and <em>Fitzgerald. </em>This situation is created by a justice court rule that the State uses to the disadvantage of the defendants. Thompson and Luke both violated a justice court requirement for personal appearance at the pre-trial conference that waived their right to trial by jury, even though they were represented by counsel at the hearing. While I respect the Justice Court\u2019s significant workload and need for economy in docket management, I do not believe it is proper to take away a defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial based upon the failure of \u201cpersonal appearance\u201d at a pre-trial hearing when the defendant\u2019s attorney is present and can make final trial preparations. Further, the State should not be using this technicality to its advantage to deprive defendants of a jury trial and to further delay their trials beyond the six-month deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b625 The State has not shown \u201cgood cause\u201d for its failure to bring Thompson to trial within the period specified by the statute. I cannot join in the majority\u2019s opinion that the District Court correctly resolved this matter. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s determination and grant Thompson\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
