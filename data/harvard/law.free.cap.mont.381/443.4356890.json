Did the District Court err by ruling that a hearing was necessary as a matter of law to determine the fair market value of the foreclosed property on a request for a deficiency judgment?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by determining a value of the foreclosed property that was not supported by credible evidence?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\n<em>3. Did the District Court err by improperly admitting evidence at the hearing?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00b63 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to conduct a hearing, but remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion on the evidentiary issues and the applicable standard. Therefore, we do not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">\u00b64 Defendants Mary Kay and George W. Prindiville, Lloyd and Barbara Shinn, and Barry Rothschild (collectively \u201cthe Defendants\u201d), completed a series of transactions to acquire over 600 acres of real property along Patrick Creek Road, in Flathead County (the \u201cPatrick Creek property\u201d), borrowing $2,237,000 from WCU. After a series of amendments, Defendants signed a promissory note to WCU for a total of $1,949,466.81, secured by mortgages on the Patrick Creek property. In 2011, the Defendants defaulted on that note, owing a principal balance of $1,951,670.81, and offered WCU a deed in lieu of foreclosure. WCU did not accept the deed, and filed this action in June 2011 for foreclosure and collection of the debt, including any sums owing after the sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">\u00b65 WCU moved for summary judgment in October 2011, and the Defendants opposed the motion. The parties eventually stipulated to a foreclosure sale, and the District Court entered a Judgment of Foreclosure and Order of Sale in March 2012, reserving a ruling on the motion for summary judgment and the issue of a deficiency judgment against the Defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property was sold at a sheriffs sale on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>June 12,2012 to WCU, the highest and only bidder, for $1,100,000. \u00b66 WCU thereafter filed a request for entry of a deficiency judgment against the Defendants for the amount of $745,365.79. The Defendants opposed the request, arguing that the fair market value of the Patrick Creek property exceeded the loan balance. In opposing the entry of a deficiency judgment, Defendants argued that the parties had long disputed the value of the property, and requested a hearing to determine the fair market value of the property. After oral arguments, the District Court entered an Order in September 2013 granting WCU\u2019s motion for summary judgment in part by rejecting the Defendants\u2019 arguments that a deficiency judgment was barred, but holding that, as a matter of law, it \u201cmust hold a hearing\u201d to determine the fair market value of the property, and the amount of the deficiency judgment, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b67 At the hearing, both parties presented appraisals and expert testimony as evidence of the fair market value of the property. The appraisals were completed at various times before and during the foreclosure process. The first appraisal was completed by Lloyd Barrie (the \u201cBarrie appraisal\u201d) in 2011, prior to WCU filing the foreclosure action. Barrie was not present and did not testify at the hearing. The Patrick Creek property was again appraised a few months prior to the sheriffs sale in February 2012 by William Frazier (the \u201cFrazier appraisal\u201d). Finally, the Defendants hired Gene Lard to complete an appraisal in 2013 (the \u201cLard appraisal\u201d), which was prepared to retroactively value the property as of June 2012, or the date of the sheriffs sale. Both Frazier and Lard testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b68 The District Court found the Patrick Creek property was worth $2,366,667 as of the date of the sheriffs sale, and determined that no deficiency was owed to WCU. WCU appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that a fair market value hearing was required was a conclusion of law. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s legal conclusion \u2014 including its application of the law to the facts \u2014 to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Bank of Baker v. Mikelson Land Co., </em>1999 MT 76, \u00b6 26, 294 Mont. 64, 979 P.2d 180 (citation omitted) (reviewing a district court\u2019s valuation of a foreclosed property sold at sheriffs sale and subsequent award of deficiency judgment). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00b610 Evidentiary issues, including rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Simmons Oil Corp. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>1998 MT 129, \u00b6 17, 289 Mont. 119, 960 P.2d 291 (citations omitted); <em>Weber v. BNSF Ry. </em>Co., 2011 MT 223, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 53, 261 P.3d 984 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b611 Finally, \u201c[i]n reviewing the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, the standard of review to be applied is whether the findings are clearly <em>erroneous.\u201d In re Marriage of Olsen, </em>257 Mont. 208, 213, 848 P.2d 1026, 1030 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err by ruling that a hearing was required as a matter of law to determine the fair market value of the foreclosed property on a request for a deficiency judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b613 WCU argues that a hearing to determine the fair market value of a foreclosed property is not required under statute, and that nothing in the law requires a judicial determination of fair market value before entry of a deficiency judgment. At best, WCU argues, Montana law permits a district court to hold such a hearing \u201c[o]nly in cases where evidence presented shows that the amount bid was not a \u2018fair price ... .\u2019 \u201d and that, here, the Defendants did not submit any evidence to show that the successful bid of $1.1 million at the sheriffs sale was not a fair price for the Patrick Creek property. WCU argues that the District Court erred by concluding that a hearing was required as a matter of law and by failing to \u201cfind that it was moved in equity\u201d to consider the fair price of the property before entering a deficiency judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b614 Section 71-1-222(2), MCA, provides for entry of a deficiency judgment against the debtor after a foreclosure and sheriffs sale, stating: \u201cIf it appears from the sheriffs return that the proceeds are insufficient and a balance still remains due, judgment can then be docketed for the balance against the defendant or defendants personally liable for the debt ... .\u201d Although the statute does not contemplate a hearing, our cases have addressed this issue and provided additional guidance to the process of entering a deficiency judgment in a foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\u00b615 In Trs. <em>of Wash.-Idaho-Mont. Carpenters-Emp\u2019rs Ret. Trust Fund v. Galleria P\u2019ship, </em>239 Mont. 250, 263, 780 P.2d 608, 616(1989) <em>{Galleria I), </em>this Court affirmed that the debtors were \u201chable for [a] deficiency judgment,\u201d but in an exercise of equity, remanded the case to the district court for a hearing to assess the property\u2019s fair market value that would serve as the basis for the amount of the deficiency judgment. <em>Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265-66, 780 P.2d at 617. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>discretion was moved in light of the fact that the subject property was sold at a sheriffs sale for 30% of its originally appraised value, leading to \u201ca catastrophic deficiency judgment\u201d against the debtors. <em>Galleria </em>1, 239 Mont. at 264, 780 P.2d at 616. Although noting that the statutes were silent on the duty of the courts in this regard, we explained that mortgage foreclosure proceedings are \u201cin the equity jurisdiction of the courts\u201d and that the courts are therefore \u201cempowered to determine all the questions involved in the case and to do complete justice; this includes the power to fashion an equitable result... and grant all relief necessary to the entire adjustment of the subject.\u201d <em>Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265, 780 P.2d at 617 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b616 A year later, in Fed. <em>Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Hamilton, </em>241 Mont. 367, 786 P.2d 1190 (1990), the debtors argued on appeal that this Court should remand the case for a hearing to determine the adequacy of the sales price and the amount of the deficiency judgment, as we had in <em>Galleria I. </em>We declined to do so, noting first that, while \u201cseveral states have statutes requiring that the amount realized at a sheriffs sale must reflect the fair market value of the property, Montana statutes have no such requirement.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>241 Mont. at 371, 786 P.2d at 1193. We also reasoned that the debtors had \u201cfailed to submit any relevant evidence of the fair market value on the date of sale\u201d and that there was \u201ca total absence of facts demonstrating that [the purchase price] was not a fair price.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>241 Mont. at 371, 786 P.2d at 1193. While acknowledging that in <em>Galleria I </em>\u201c[w]e remanded \u2018in the exercise of our equity jurisdiction[,]\u2019 \u201d we concluded that \u201cthe Hamiltons have failed to present any evidence requiring an exercise of our equity jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>241 Mont. at 371, 786 P.2d at 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b617 WCU correctly argues that a hearing to determine the fair market value of the property is not mandated by statute, or by case precedent. A hearing is not a legal right of a debtor and, to the extent the District Court concluded that a hearing was required as a matter of law, this was incorrect. As <em>Galleria I </em>and <em>Hamilton </em>make clear, the specific facts of a case will determine if a court is moved \u201cin the exercise of\u201d equity jurisdiction to hold such a hearing. <em>See Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265, 780 P.2d at 617; <em>Hamilton, </em>241 Mont. at 371, 786 P.2d at 1193. However, the District Court had discretion to act in equity and we conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in proceeding to conduct a hearing. It noted the parties\u2019 long-standing differences of opinion about the value of the Patrick Creek property and WCU\u2019s request for a deficiency judgment exceeding $700,000. The Defendants had noted that a 2011 appraisal obtained by WCU (the Barrie appraisal) on 516 of the total 634 acres of the Patrick Creek property appraised the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to be $2,500,000, and that this figure had been assumed by WCU in certain of its internal lending documents. Thus, evidence in the record supports a decision to discretionarily act in equity and conduct a hearing. Although the District Court did not enter an express finding \u201cthat it was moved in equity,\u201d any such error was a <em>de minimus </em>omission in light of the support for such a hearing in the record. The court did not err by conducting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b618 WCLFs argument that a determination of fair market value is not required raises the question of the proper standard to be applied in this proceeding. Because the court is moved in equity, it is charged with \u201cfashioning] an equitable result,\u201d <em>Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265, 780 P.2d at 617, which necessarily encompasses an equitable result for both parties. The recent housing and foreclosure crisis, out of which this case arises, serves as a vivid reminder of the risk that a borrower assumes when entering into a mortgage. \u201cBy entering into a mortgage transaction, a property owner incurs a dual risk \u2014 the risk of loss of title to the property through foreclosure and the risk of personal liability for the deficiency in the event that the property sells at foreclosure for less than the remaining balance of the debt.\u201d Alan M. Weinberger, <em>Tools of Ignorance: An Appraisal of Deficiency Judgments, </em>72 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 829, 836 (2015). However, the borrower is not the only party assuming potential risk in a mortgage transaction. \u201cLenders who earn a fixed rate of return should not be expected to bear the full burden of the risk of declining property values. Protecting defaulting borrowers against deficiencies adversely affects a broader category of nondefaulting borrowers by increasing the cost and reducing the availability of credit.\u201d Alan M. Weinberger, <em>Tools of Ignorance: An Appraisal ofDeficiency Judgments, </em>72 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 829, 877 (2015). While we do not adopt these statements as binding principles of law, they nonetheless demonstrate the competing interests at stake that courts must recognize in this equitable proceeding. As has been explained, \u201cthe law governing the mortgage, deed of trust and land sales contract foreclosures in Montana is an attempted balance. It seeks to balance the protection the law affords to a debtor whose personal assets may ultimately be subject to a deficiency judgment and the restrictions imposed on a foreclosing creditor who must obtain the collateral in partial or total satisfaction of the defaulted loan.\u201d David J. Dietrich, <em>The Montana Judicial and Non-judicial Foreclosure Sale: Analysis and Suggestions for Reform, </em>49 Mont. L. Rev. 285, 287 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b619 When again considering <em>Trs. of Wash.-Idaho-Mont. Carpenters Emp\u2019rs Ret. Trust Fund v. Galleria P\u2019ship, </em>250 Mont. 175, 819 P.2d 158 (1991) <em>(Galleria ID, </em>we considered whether the district court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>discretion in determining the value of the property. In affirming the district court\u2019s assignment of value, we reiterated our previous definition of \u201cfair market value.\u201d <em>Galleria II, </em>250 Mont. at 185, 819 P.2d at 164 (\u201cAs our discussion will demonstrate, the definition of fair market value in <em>Galleria [I] </em>is adequate.\u201d). Revisiting <em>Galleria I </em>and a discussion of foreclosure laws from other jurisdictions provided in <em>First State Bank of Forsyth v. Chunkapura, </em>226 Mont. 54, 734 P.2d 1203 (1987), we again cited with approval a California decision that gave further guidance to the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">In <em>Galleria [I], </em>we defined \u201cfair market value\u201d as \u201cthe intrinsic value of the real property with its improvements at the time of sale under judicial foreclosure, without consideration of the impact of the foreclosure proceedings on the fair market value.\u201d <em>Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265, 780 P.2d at 617. Most importantly, we left the <em>method </em>of determining fair market value to the District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">Under normal conditions the \u201cfair value,\u201d or \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d of property will often coincide with its fair market value, the value a willing purchaser will pay to a willing seller in an open market. The court [in <em>Rainer Mortg. v. Silverwood Ltd. </em>(1985), 163 Cal. App. 3d 359, 367] explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">This correlation is not fixed, however, and market value is only <em>one </em>factor the court should consider when determining \u201cfair value.\u201d ... \u201cFair value\u201d is to be determined by <em>all of the circumstances affectins the intrinsic value of the property at the time of the sale. </em>This necessarily excludes the circumstances of the foreclosure sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\"><em>Galleria II, </em>250 Mont. at 185, 819 P.2d at 164 (emphasis in original; underlining added); <em>see also Bank of Baker v. Mikelson Land Co., </em>1999 MT 76, \u00b6 33, 294 Mont. 64, 979 P.2d 180 (\u201c[T]he standard for valuing real property for the purposes of determining a deficiency remains fair market value.\u201d) (citing <em>Galleria I, </em>239 Mont. at 265, 780 P.2d at 617; <em>Galleria II, </em>250 Mont. at 185, 819 P.2d at 164). Just as the decision to conduct a hearing is a matter of equity, the determination of \u201cfair market value\u201d is an equitable task that is neither automatic nor mechanical, but subject to the factors we have mentioned. \u201cFair value\u201d and \u201cfair market value\u201d may not necessarily be any different, although the circumstances of a particular case may cause a court to conclude there is a distinction. If a district court determines to act in equity and conduct a hearing, it is to apply our above-stated standards in the process of endeavoring to \u201cfashion an equitable result.\u201d <em>Galleria </em>I, 239 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Mont, at 265, 780 P.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b620 2. <em>Did the District Court err by determining a value of the foreclosed property that was not supported by credible evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b621 Because we remand to the District Court for further proceedings as discussed further herein, we will not consider the District Court\u2019s valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b622 3. <em>Did the District Court err by improperly admitting evidence at the hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b623 Appellants raise three evidentiary issues on appeal and we address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\n<em>I. Lloyd Barrie\u2019s Appraisal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b624 WCU argues that the District Court erred in admitting the Barrie appraisal because it was hearsay. Barrie did not testify and his statements made outside of court were offered to prove the value of the Patrick Creek property. Defendants argue that the Barrie appraisal was properly admitted as a hearsay exception because the report, commissioned by WCU, was a \u201cvicarious admission of value made by WCU\u201d through Barrie as its \u201cagent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,\u201d citing M. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). Alternatively, Defendants argue that the Barrie appraisal was not admitted for its substance or, if error, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">\u00b625 Defendant and owner Mary Kay Prindiville testified that she had read the Barrie appraisal and relied on it in forming her own valuation of the property. The Barrie appraisal was admitted into evidence, over WCU\u2019s objection, and, in its Order, the District Court cited and relied upon it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">The Court reviewed the appraisals submitted by the various experts .... The average of values placed on the property by Barrie, Elm and Lard is $2,366,667 and the Court is persuaded that the appraisals submitted by these experts are more reasoned and based on property which is more similar to the property at issue than the appraisal submitted by the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">\u00b626 The fact that WCU retained Barrie to appraise the Patrick Creek property does not support Defendants\u2019 contention that Barrie was acting as an agent or servant for WCU, making his appraisal a vicarious admission of value arising out of his agency or employment. Barrie, a professional independent appraiser, certified in his report that \u201c[t]he reported analyses, opinions, and conclusions are limited only by the reported assumptions and hmiting conditions and are my personal, impartial, and unbiased professional analyses, opinions, and conclusions.\u201d We find no merit in the argument that Barrie\u2019s appraisal was an admission of value by WCU that it is not defined as hearsay. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00b627 Ms. Prindiville was permitted to testify asa lay witness about her opinion of the value of the property. <em>See </em>M. R. Evid. 7 01; <em>Harding v. H. F. Johnson, Inc., </em>126 Mont. 70, 82, 244 P.2d 111, 118 (1952) (clarifying that \u201c[t]he owner of property is a competent witness to estimate its worth.\u201d). However, because she is a lay witness, M. R. Evid. 703 (allowing experts to rely on inadmissible data or opinions in forming their own opinions) does not apply to her, and her testimony regarding the contents of the Barrie appraisal was error. Defense expert Lard similarly read the Barrie appraisal, and was permitted to explain his reliance on it, but this did not authorize admission of the Barrie appraisal as substantive evidence, as we have recently explained. <em>See Reese v. Stanton, </em>2015 MT 293, \u00b6 22, 381 Mont. 241, 358 P.3d 208 (citing <em>Polythane Sys. v. Marina Ventures Int'l, Ltd., </em>993 F.2d 1201, 1208 (5th Cir. 1993) (\u201c[T]o admit the hearsay opinion of an expert not subject to cross-examination goes against the natural reticence of courts to permit expert opinion unless the expert has been qualified before the jury to render an opinion.\u201d)). By admitting the report into evidence and relying on the report to find the property\u2019s value, the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\n<em>II. Gene Lard\u2019s Undisclosed Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1P\">\u00b628 WCU argues that the District Court erred by admitting undisclosed expert opinions from Defendants\u2019 appraiser Lard when he testified as to the percentage adjustments that should have properly been used in the Frazier appraisal. Defendants respond that Mr. Lard\u2019s testimony was simply rebuttal testimony, or in the alternative, that Lard was qualified to offer an expert opinion regarding adjustments to the properties. WCU does not contest Lard\u2019s qualification as an expert, but only that he offered his opinion without proper disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b629 \u201cRebuttal testimony is proper only if it tends to counteract a new matter offered by the adverse party.\u201d <em>State v. Hart, 2000 MT 332, </em>\u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 71, 15 P.3d 917 (citing State <em>v. Daniels, </em>210 Mont. 1, 10, 682 P.2d 173, 178 (1984)). Lard\u2019s testimony criticizing Frazier\u2019s adjustment methods was proper rebuttal testimony. However, when Lard proceeded to testify about his opinions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the adjustments that should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>have been made, based on his professional knowledge, he was offering direct expert opinion testimony that should have been disclosed prior to the hearing. M. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(A)(i). \u201cThe underlying policies requiring expert disclosures are to ehminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>\u00b6 32 (citing <em>Hawkins v. Harney, </em>2003 MT 58, \u00b6 26, 314 Mont. 384, 66 P.3d 305). Because this opinion was not disclosed prior to the hearing, WCU was not prepared to cross-examine Lard on his opinions and the basis for them. Lard\u2019s opinions about the percentage adjustments he would make should have been excluded at the hearing, and the District Court abused its discretion by admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>III. Alan Elm\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b630 WCU argues that the District Court improperly considered the testimony of real estate broker Alan Elm when making its findings. Elm did not testify, but his affidavit valuing the property was previously filed as an attachment to Defendants\u2019 pleadings. Defendants argue that because WCU\u2019s counsel mentioned Elm\u2019s work in opening statements and in cross examination of Lard, WCU included Elm\u2019s opinion in the proceeding and \u201cshould not now be claiming error.\u201d The District Court\u2019s Order relied on the Elm affidavit and erroneously stated that he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Defendants Prindiville also engaged Alan Elm to appraise the property. Mr. Elm submitted his affidavit and he testified at trial; he placed a value on the property as of the June 12,2012, the date of Sheriff\u2019s sale, to be at least $2,400,000. Mr. Elm is a licensed real estate broker in Montana and is competent to testify as an expert. This value is close to the valuation placed on the property by Mr. Barrie, the real estate appraiser engaged by Plaintiff, Whitefish Credit Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b631 We disagree with the argument that WCU counsel\u2019s opening remarks that Elm was expected to testify served to introduce Elm\u2019s testimony into evidence, or that referencing Elm\u2019s work during cross examination of Lard served to introduce Elm\u2019s affidavit as substantive evidence. Elm did not testify and his report should not have been admitted, although the record does not appear to contain a specific ruling from the District Court on admitting Elm\u2019s affidavit. In any event, to the extent that the District Corut admitted and relied upon Elm\u2019s affidavit for the value of the Patrick Creek property, this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b632  \u201cAn abuse of discretion in an evidentiary ruling does not necessarily constitute reversible error, however. ... In other words, \u2018a reversal cannot be predicated upon an error in admission of evidence, where the evidence in question was not of such character to have affected the result.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re </em>A.N., 2000 MT 35, \u00b6 55, 298 Mont. 237, 995 P.2d 427 (citation omitted). Here, the District Court received significant evidence regarding the value of the property that was improperly admitted, and relied upon that evidence in entering its findings, which clearly affected the outcome of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b633 Although the District Court made technical errors, it nonetheless did not abuse its discretion by proceeding in equity to determine the fair value of the property for purposes of entering a deficiency judgment, if any. However, we conclude that the evidentiary errors clearly affected the outcome of the proceeding to the prejudice of WCU and that a remand for farther proceedings and application of the proper standards is necessary, consistent with the holdings herein. \u00b634 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-13\"> The District Court\u2019s Judgment of Foreclosure and Order of Sale states: \u201cIf it appears from the Sheriffs return that the proceeds are insufficient and a balance still remains due on the judgment, judgment for the balance due may be entered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Defendants if the Court so orders following the Court\u2019s consideration of the arguments raised by Defendants on summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\"> Counsel for Defendants Prindivilles asked Mr. Lard, \u201cSo getting back to that percentage adjustment, if you were going to attempt to say what might be an appropriate adjustment - even though of course you didn\u2019t make one and you said you didn\u2019t think such an analysis would be appropriate, but what percentage type would you be considering to try to do that with?\u201d Mr. Lard stated: \u201cBased on an appraisal my associate, Mary Arndt, did in Niarada last summer we were looking at sales throughout Sanders County, in Flathead County and Lake County, and it appears that property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>values are less than half of what we are in this county.
