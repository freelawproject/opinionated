We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-28\">\u00b62 We restate the issues for review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred by giving full faith and credit to the parenting plan and child support order entered by the Superior Court of California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred by refusing to terminate the parental rights of the father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b63 P.T.H. was bom in 2008 and is the natural son of T.C. (mother) and R.H. (father). The parents were divorced in Cahfomia in 2009 but then remarried each other. They subsequently separated and divorced a second time. The parties agreed to a parenting plan that was approved by the Kem County (California) Superior Court. That agreement specified that R.H. did not have to pay any child support, and that provision was adopted by the Kem County Court as part of its final order. Since that time neither T.C. nor R.H. has sought to modify the parenting plan or child support provision in the California court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b64 In 2010 T.C. moved to Montana and is now married to B.C., who is the petitioner for adoption in this case. B.C.\u2019s petition, filed in 2014, seeks to terminate R.H.\u2019s parental rights so that B.C. can adopt P.T.H. The sole basis for the petition to terminate R.H.\u2019s parental rights is the allegation that R.H. is an unfit parent because he failed to pay child support during the year prior to the filing date of the petition. R.H. responded to the petition, consented to the jurisdiction of the Montana court, but also requested that the District Court modify the California parenting plan. The District Court bifurcated the parenting plan issues pending resolution of the adoption case. After a hearing at which T.C., R.H. and R.H.\u2019s mother testified, the District Court found that there was no basis for terminating R.H.\u2019s parental rights and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b65 The District Court reviewed the 2010 California court order and found that it provided that \u201cchild support is set at zero,\u201d based upon the stipulation of the parties. The District Court found that neither party had sought to modify that order. The District Court found that during the four years prior to the present petition, R.H. made three payments to T.C. that he noted as \u201cchild support\u201d and that he sent periodic packages of clothes and presents for P.T.H. The District Court also found that R.H. has generally been employed during the four years prior to the petition, working in construction for wages between $11.00 and $15.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u00b66 The District Court concluded that the United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 1) and Montana law (\u00a7\u00a7 40-5-149 and 40-4-210(2), MCA) require that \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d be given to child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>orders entered by courts in other states, including the order of the California court in this case. The District Court concluded that the child support order from the California court must be recognized and enforced in Montana unless modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b67 In Montana a child cannot be adopted without the consent of the natural parent. Section 42-2-301, MCA. Parental consent to an adoption is not required if there is a judicial determination that the parent is unfit. Section 42-2-607(2), MCA. The District Court concluded that in this case the only ground for R.H.\u2019s alleged unfitness is based upon \u00a7 42-2-608(l)(c), MCA, which provides that the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">may terminate parental rights for purposes of making a child available for adoption on the grounds of unfitness if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the parent, if able, has not contributed to the support of the child for an aggregate of 1 year before the filing of a petition for adoption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The District Court noted the factors for determining whether a parent is \u201cable\u201d to support the child, as set out in <em>In re the Adoption of C.R.N., </em>1999 MT 92, \u00b6 15, 294 Mont. 202, 979 P.2d 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b68 The District Court noted that under Montana law, when there is no child support order in place, a parent still must support his or her child or, again, risk being found unfit for purposes of an adoption. <em>In re the Adoption of R.M., </em>241 Mont. 111, 115, 785 P.2d 709, 711 (1990). The District Court concluded that because R.H. had been \u201cable\u201d to make child support payments for the year prior to the petition, he risked being declared unfit except for the unique facts of this case: that there was an existing court order providing for \u201czero\u201d child support. The District Court concluded that \u201c[i]f another state\u2019s court order releases a parent of the responsibility to pay child support, this Court cannot later disregard that order and mandate that child support should have been paid.....Such an act would disregard the Full Faith and Credit clause of the U.S. Constitution and other Montana laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">\u00b69 The District Court then concluded that there were no grounds for finding R.H. to be an unfit parent, and refused to terminate his parental rights. Further, the District Court ordered that the parties\u2019 child support obligations be re-determined under the Montana Child Support Guidelines, and that the 2010 California order would be followed until that re-determination was completed. B.C. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous, and conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. Because the termination of parental rights involves a fundamental liberty interest, a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>terminating those rights must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See generally </em>In re the Adoption of <em>C.R.N. </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b611 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred by giving full faith and credit to the parenting plan and child support order entered by the Superior Court of California,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b612 The United States Constitution requires that \u201c[flull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the... judicial proceedings of every other state.\u201d U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 1. The requirement to give full faith and credit is \u201cexacting\u201d and a state court judgment qualifies for recognition \u201cthroughout the land\u201d for claim and issue preclusion purposes. <em>Baker v. GM, </em>522 U.S. 222, 233, 118 S. Ct. 657, 663-64 (1998). Federal law requires that each state \u201cshall enforce according to its terms a child support order\u201d from the court of another state. 28 USC \u00a7 1738B. In this case it is not contested that the Superior Court of California had full jurisdiction to enter the 2010 order setting the amount of child support owed by R.H. at \u201czero,\u201d and it is not contested that neither party has since obtained a modification of that order. \u00b613 Montana law requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">A court of this state shall accord full faith and credit to an order issued by another state and consistent with this chapter that enforces a child custody determination by a court of another state unless the order has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under 40-7-105,40-7-107 through 40-7-110, 40-7-112, and part 2 of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Section 40-7-313, MCA. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 40-5-186, MCA, providing for registration and enforcement of support orders. Section 40-4-210(2), MCA, provides that a Montana court \u201cshall recognize and, if petitioned to do so, enforce according to its terms a child support order issued by a court or administrative agency of another state if the order was made consistent with the fall faith and credit provisions of 28 USC 1738B.\u201d Both federal and Montana law allow Montana courts to modify child support orders issued by other state courts upon meeting the proper standards. Section 40-4-210(6), MCA. Therefore, the California order setting the support obligation at \u201czero\u201d has the same legal effect as if that order had been issued by a district court in Montana, but its provisions maybe modified pursuant to new proceedings in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"AiR\">\u00b614  Petitioner\u2019s argument is based upon the premise that this is a case in which there was \u201cno court-ordered support order\u201d and therefore R.H. nonetheless had an obligation to provide support. <em>Adoption of R.M., </em>241 Mont. at 115, 785 P.2d at 711. However, there clearly was a court order in this case setting the amount of support at zero. As this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Court recognized in <em>Adoption of R.M., </em>241 Mont. at 115-16, 785 P.2d 709, the parental support obligation exists \u201cabsent a court order releasing ... this responsibility or altering this obligation ... .\u201d Therefore, we hold that the District Court properly concluded that it was required to recognize the 2010 order of the California court which set R.H.\u2019s support obligation at \u201czero.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred by refusing to terminate the parental rights of the father.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b616 As previously noted, a child may be adopted only with consent of the natural parents, \u00a7 42-2-301, MCA, but consent is not required if the parental rights have been terminated, \u00a7 42-2-607, MCA. R.H. has not consented to the proposed adoption, and the only ground for declaring him to be unfit is based upon \u00a7 42-7-608(l)(c), MCA, That section allows, but does not require, a district court to terminate a parent\u2019s rights to his child for purposes of adoption if it is \u201cproven to the satisfaction of the court that the parent, if able, has not contributed to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year before the filing of a petition for adoption.\u201d <em>In re the Adoption of D.J.V., </em>244 Mont. 209, 213, 796 P.2d 1076, 1078 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b617 As the District Court here recognized, this is a different situation because there is a support order in place that currently governs the obligations of the parents. T.C., the mother, consented to that order. Recognizing it as a controlling order in this case is entirely consistent with the requirements of Full Faith and Credit, and with the obligation of a parent to comply with a support order if one is entered. Parents often agree and courts often order that there be no child support, such as when the parents share equally in custodial time with the child. Allowing termination of parental rights in such a situation after a year has gone by is clearly a trap for the unwary parent and would undermine the authority of the district courts to set the amount of support in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b618  Termination of parental rights impacts the parent\u2019s fundamental liberty interest, and a decree terminating those rights must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. A parent cannot be declared unfit and have his or her child adopted by another person after complying with a court order setting the amount of support due.</p>\n<p id=\"Aby\">\u00b619 The order of the District Court is affirmed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings regarding proposed modification to the parenting plan.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-9\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
