In the first, dated February 6, 2013, the District Court sua sponte amended an earlier August 21, 2012 order of protection. In the second, the District Court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint, granted summary judgment to Lizann Pluger and Earnest Anderson (collectively, the Defendants), and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the Defendants. We vacate the District Court\u2019s February 6,2013 amended order of protection. We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to amend, grant of summary judgment, and award of attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by issuing the amended order of protection?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\n<em>3.

Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding the Defendants attorney\u2019s fees?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">\u00b63 Scott Bardsley (Scott) owns a parcel of residential property (Bardsley property) located in Troy, Montana and resides there with his domestic partner, Dora Cichantek (Dora). Earnest Anderson (Earnest) and Lizann Pluger (Lizann), husband and wife, reside on the adjacent property (Pluger property). The Pluger property is owned by Lizann\u2019s uncle, Edwin Pluger (Edwin). Prior to 2011, Scott frequently used Pluger Way, a private road that traverses the Pluger property, to access his property without objection. However, beginning in 2011, relations between Scott and Lizann became increasingly hostile, leading Lizann to seek an order of protection against Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">\u00b64 On August 21,2012, the District Court granted Lizann\u2019s petition for a permanent order of protection against Scott. The order restrained Scott from committing acts of abuse or threats against Lizann, required that he stay at least 1500 feet from Lizann, and prohibited him from using Pluger Way to reach his residence. Scott did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>respond to Lizann\u2019s petition and the court\u2019s August 21 order is not the subject of this appeal. Shortly after the court issued its order, Lizann installed a locked gate across the entrance of Pluger Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b65 On December 13,2012, Scott and Dora filed a complaint against Earnest and Lizann alleging that the Bardsley property enjoyed an express easement over the Pluger property with regard to Pluger Way. The Plaintiffs sought money damages for interference with the alleged easement as well as a preliminary injunction to prevent the Defendants from obstructing Pluger Way. In support of their claim, the Plaintiffs attached several documents to their complaint, including the deed to the Pluger property, which identified Edwin as the sole owner of the property. The Plaintiffs did not name Edwin in their complaint, however. In response to the complaint, the Defendants argued that they were merely the occupiers of the Pluger property, not the owners, and the Plaintiffs needed to name Edwin, the real party in interest, to obtain the relief they sought. The Defendants argued further that the public record was clear that the Bardsley property did not enjoy an express easement over the Pluger property.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b66 On February 5, 2013, the District Court held a hearing on the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction. While neither Dora nor Lizann attended the hearing, Scott and Earnest both testified. Scott conceded that he had mistakenly pled an express easement over the Pluger property, but contended that his property enjoyed an easement by prescription or necessity. On February 6, 2013, the District Court issued its order denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a prehminary injunction. In the same order, the District Court sua sponte amended its earlier August 21 order of protection. The court\u2019s amended order of protection expanded the earlier order in that it prohibits Dora as well as her family members from using Pluger Way,</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b67 On June 20,2013, the Defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to name the actual owner of the Pluger property in their complaint. The Defendants also sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The Plaintiffs never filed a response to the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Instead, on May 28,2014, nearly a year and half after filing their complaint, the Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting leave to amend their complaint. The Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended complaint advanced new legal theories of easement, including prescription and necessity, and named the title holder of the Pluger property, Edwin, as a defendant. The Defendants objected to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion. On October 14,2014, the District Court issued its order, denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend, granting summary judgment to the Defendants, and awarding the Defendants attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>fees. The court concluded that, while motions to amend should generally be freely granted, legal grounds existed to deny the Plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b68 This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b69 We will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision to continue, amend, or make permanent an order of protection absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Lockhead v. Lockhead, </em>2013 MT 368, \u00b6 12, 373 Mont. 120, 314 P.3d 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u00b610 We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend pleadings to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Kershaw v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>2011 MT 170, \u00b6 11, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358. \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when \u2018it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kershaw, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conservation Dist., </em>2011 MT 51, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 393, 251 P.3d 131).</p>\n<p id=\"Arc\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria outlined in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Kershaw, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Kershaw, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Town &amp; Country Foods, Inc. v. City of Bozeman, </em>2009 MT 72, \u00b6 12, 349 Mont. 453, 203 P.3d 1283).</p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">\u00b612 A district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is a discretionary ruling which we review to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re Estate of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 31, 310 Mont. 435, 51 P.3d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by issuing the amended order of protection?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b614 The Plaintiffs argue that the District Court improperly issued the amended order of protection to include Dora. They contend that the court issued the permanent order without offering Dora an opportunity to be heard, and the court\u2019s failure in this regard amounts to a violation of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u00b615 We have held that an essential element of due process is the \u201copportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Fishbaugh, </em>2002 MT 175, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 519, 52 P.3d 395. Although the Plaintiffs characterize their argument on appeal in terms of the opportunity to be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>generally without reference to any particular statute, the Legislature has statutorily ensured that a respondent in a civil order of protection action is afforded an opportunity to be heard. Specifically, \u00a7 40-15-202(1), MCA, requires a court to conduct a show cause hearing before issuing a permanent order of protection wherein the respondent is permitted to testify and introduce evidence. <em>See Keller v. Trull, </em>2007 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 188, 158 P.3d 439. It is a manifest abuse of discretion for a court to issue a permanent order of protection without first conducting the statutorily mandated hearing. <em>In re Marriage of Coogler, </em>2004 MT 122, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 243, 90 P.3d 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b616 In the present case, the District Court did not conduct a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 40-15-202(1), MCA, before expanding the order of protection to include Dora. While the Defendants seem to suggest that the February 5, 2013 prehminary injunction hearing sufficiently afforded Dora an opportunity to be heard, the scope of the preliminary injunction hearing was strictly limited to determining whether the Plaintiffs could satisfy the legal standard for an injunction. The court did not receive or review evidence concerning Dora\u2019s conduct toward the Defendants. Nor did the court provide any notice to Dora that she would have to attend the hearing so as to mount a legal defense against an order of protection. The District Court failed to provide Dora with an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b617 We conclude the District Court abused its discretion in issuing the February 6,2013 amended order of protection. We accordingly vacate the court\u2019s amended order of protection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b619 The Plaintiffs argue that the District Court should have granted their motion for leave to amend their complaint and the court abused its discretion by refusing to do so. They reason that, although they sought to amend their complaint after the Defendants moved for summary judgment, the Defendants \u201cwere not prejudiced, even remotely, by the timing\u201d of their motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b620 M. R. Civ. P. 15(a) provides that \u201cleave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d However, \u201cthis does not mean that a court must automatically grant a motion to amend <em>.\u2019\u2019Kershaw v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>2011 MT 170, \u00b6 25, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358. Rather, the decision to deny a motion to amend is within the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>court\u2019s discretion. <em>Kershaw, </em>\u00b6 25. A district court is justified in denying a motion to amend if granting the motion would cause \u201cundue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional Consultants, </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990). In determining whether an amendment would cause undue prejudice, a court must balance the prejudice suffered by the opposing party \u201cagainst the sufficiency of the moving party\u2019s justification of the delay.\u201d <em>Farmers Coop. Ass\u2019n v. Amsden, LLC, </em>2007 MT 286, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 445, 171 P.3d 690. We have previously concluded that \u201clitigants should be allowed to change legal theories after a motion for summary judgment has been filed only in extraordinary cases.\u201d <em>Thornton v. Flathead Cty., </em>2009 MT 367, \u00b6 40, 353 Mont. 252, 220 P.3d 395 (quoting Peuse <em>v. Malkuch, </em>275 Mont. 221, 228, 911 P.2d 1153, 1157 (1996)) (quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b621 We recognized in <em>Peuse </em>that a party\u2019s prolonged delay in adopting a new legal theory is prejudicial to the opposing party, particularly when a party waits until after the opposing party files a motion for summary judgment. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157. In <em>Peuse, </em>the defendants sought leave to amend their answer almost two years after the original pleadings were filed and only after the plaintiff submitted a motion for summary judgment. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 226, 911 P.2d at 1156. In affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion, we noted the lengthy delay and explained that if the district court were to have granted the defendants\u2019 motion, the plaintiff would have been \u201cprejudiced since his [summary judgment] motion was based on the original pleadings which remained unchanged for almost two years.\u201d <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1157. We concluded that \u201c[l]itigants should be allowed to change legal theories after a motion for summary judgment has been filed only in extraordinary cases.\u201d <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b622  There are no extraordinary circumstances in this case that would warrant permitting the Plaintiffs to change legal theories. The Plaintiffs have not offered any reasonable justification for the delay. They have not sufficiently explained why they failed to name Edwin in their original complaint, why they failed to initially plead an easement by prescription or necessity, or why they failed for nearly a year and half to seek to amend their complaint and cure these deficiencies. Nor does the record offer any explanation. The deed to the Pluger property, which the Plaintiffs attached to their complaint, identified Edwin as the owner of the Pluger property, and the Plaintiffs acknowledged at the February 5, 2013 preliminary injunction hearing that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>mistakenly pled an express easement. The Plaintiffs were aware well in advance of the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on June 20, 2013, of their complaint\u2019s inadequacies. Yet, they repeatedly delayed requesting leave to amend, waiting almost a full year after the Defendants moved for summary judgment, before finally doing so on May28,2014. The Defendants\u2019 showing of prejudice combined with the Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to reasonably justify the delay provided an adequate basis for the District Court to reach its conclusion. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b623 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred hy granting the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b624 In light of our decision that the District Court properly denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend, this dispute no longer contains a genuine issue of material fact. The Plaintiffs concede that without amending their complaint they cannot \u201cprevent summary judgment since, indisputably, [they] had mistakenly pled an express easement which did not exist\u201d and [w]ithout the basis for a properly-pled easement claim, [they] could not maintain [a] request for injunctive relief.\u201d The District Court correctly determined that the Defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b625 <em>4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding the Defendants attorney\u2019s fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b626 The longstanding rule in Montana, often referred to as the American Rule, is that \u201cabsent statutory or contractual authority, attorney\u2019s fees will not be awarded to the prevailing party in a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 43, 296 Mont. 123, 988 P.2d 1221. However, we recognize an equitable exception to the general rule under which \u201ca district court may award attorney's fees to make an injured party whole under its equity powers.\u201d <em>Erker, </em>\u00b6 44. The equitable exception is \u201capplicable where the action into which the prevailing party has been drawn is without merit or frivolous.\u201d <em>Motta v. Granite Cty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2013 MT 172, \u00b6 29, 370 Mont. 469, 304 P.3d 72. A district court may grant an award of this type on a case-by-case basis. <em>Motta, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b627 The Plaintiffs challenge the District Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fee based on the merits of their proposed amended complaint. They reason that the \u201cproposed amended complaint cured all procedural and pleading defects but the District Court apparently closed its eyes to the content of the proposed pleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b628  However, the Plaintiffs fail to defend the legal theories advanced in their original complaint. They make no attempt to defend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the merits of the original complaint or otherwise offer a reasonable explanation for why they litigated under meritless legal theories for almost a year and a half. They concede, as mentioned above, that their original complaint cannot survive summary judgment, acknowledging the Defendants do not own the Pluger property, the Bardsley property does not enjoy an express easement over of the Pluger property, and they mistakenly pled otherwise in their original complaint. We have explained \u201c[i]t is not this Court\u2019s obligation to locate authorities or formulate arguments for a party in support of positions taken on appeal.\u201d <em>Cutler v. Jim Gilman Excavating, Inc., </em>2003 MT 314, \u00b6 22, 318 Mont. 255, 80 P.3d 1203 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the Defendants attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b629 We vacate the District Court\u2019s February 6,2013 amended order of protection.
