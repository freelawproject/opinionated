They were married on April 12, 1978 and separated in 2010. Two children were born of the marriage, both of whom are adults. Debora is 62 and Glenn is 69. Debora filed a petition for dissolution of her marriage in Flathead County on April 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u00b64 During most of the marriage, Debora was a homemaker, taking primary responsibility for rearing the parties\u2019 two children and maintaining the marital home. Debora is currently unemployed, but is eligible to receive social security benefits of $1,500 per month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Glenn is employed with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes as an investment manager, earning $175,000 annually. Glenn also receives $28,000 per year in social security benefits. Debora and Glenn have both been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Glenn has several other health issues, including heart problems, asthma, anxiety disorder, and sleep apnea. Glenn has been advised by medical professionals to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b65 Glenn resides on Kings Point Road in Poison. The Kings Point property is located on tribal land. Glenn is an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. Debora is not a tribal member. Glenn purchased the Kings Point property with funds he obtained by mortgaging property in Washington State that Debora\u2019s family friends, the Fredricksons, had transferred to him. Glenn encumbered the property in the amount of $198,000 and used $150,000 of those proceeds to purchase the Kings Point property. He thereafter sold the Frederickson property.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b66 Debora resides in the parties\u2019 marital home located on Flathead Lake, which the parties refer to as the Lake House. The Lake House has a market value of $595,000, but is encumbered with a mortgage of $536,982. The parties also own a parcel of property on Schaefer Road outside of Poison, and a lot in Hungry Horse, The Schaefer Road property has a market value of $90,000 and is encumbered with debt in the amount of $75,000. The Hungry Horse property is unencumbered and has a market value of $15,000. In addition to real property, the parties\u2019 personal property includes a 2006 SeaDoo watercraft vehicle and a Great West Retirement account valued at $251,544.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b67 After a two-day trial, the District Court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage and distributing their marital estate. The court made detailed findings and issued specific instructions regarding each item of real and personal property. It adopted Glenn\u2019s valuation of the parties\u2019 assets and attached to its order Glenn\u2019s spreadsheets that itemized the assets. The court ordered the immediate sale of the Lake House, Hungry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Horse property, and Schaefer property, and divided the net proceeds equally; ordered the Great West Retirement account to be divided equally; ordered the parties\u2019 social security benefits to be divided equally; awarded Debora the 2006 SeaDoo; and awarded Debora an equalization payment in the amount of $164,500. The court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to divide or transfer the Kings Point property and did not consider the property a marital asset. However, the court found that the proceeds from the Fredrickson property and $16,000 used for improvements on the Kings Point property were marital funds that were unilaterally taken by Glenn beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction or otherwise concealed. Consequently, the court considered the Fredrickson property proceeds and these improvements to the Kings Point property to be marital property in determining the equalization payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b68 The District Court ordered Glenn to pay $2,500 per month to Debora in maintenance. In support of the maintenance award, the court found that Glenn\u2019s claimed monthly expenses of $11,500 were inflated by monthly payments associated with the Lake House and his living expenses were actually $7,600. Reasoning that Debora was entitled to live a similar lifestyle, the court determined her living expenses to be the same as Glenn\u2019s. The court ordered that the maintenance payments would cease if Debora remarries or cohabits with another adult who is not her relative, or if both of the following occur: \u201ca) Glenn ceases to be gainfully employed; and b) Glenn ceases to receive income from investments (not counting retirement account income).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b69 Glenn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s distribution of marital property to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Williams, </em>2009 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 352 Mont. 198, 217 P.3d 67. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 123, 107 P.3d 488. Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm the district court unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>Bock, </em>\u00b6 14. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2005 MT 311, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 479, 124 P.3d 1151. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b611 1. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by ordering the division of Glenn\u2019s social security benefits ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b612 Glenn argues and Debora concedes that the District Court erred by ordering the distribution of Glenn\u2019s social security benefits as part of the equitable distribution of the marital property. The parties agree that, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., the transfer or assignment of social security benefits is forbidden, and, because \u00a7 407(a) preempts state law, the benefits cannot be directly divided in a dissolution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b613  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) provides that social security benefits \u201cshall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.\u201d In <em>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd., </em>409 U.S. 413, 417, 93 S. Ct. 590, 592 (1973), the United States Supreme Court stated that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) \u201cimposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits.\u201d Therefore, we conclude the District Court erred in ordering the distribution of a portion of Glenn\u2019s social security benefits to Debora. However, that does not end our inquiry. \u00b6 14 While Debora concedes Glenn\u2019s social security benefits may not be directly distributed, she argues that this Court must order the District Court to offset, with other marital property of the same value, the amount she was to receive had the benefits been able to be distributed. Glenn counters that such indirect allocation is likewise impermissible, arguing the \u201cweight of authority has concluded that an offset of Social Security benefits is prohibited,\u201d and this \u201cCourt\u2019s decision in <em>In re Marriage of Strong, </em>2000 MT 178, 300 Mont. 331, 8 P.3d 763, strongly supports adoption of the majority approach prohibiting offset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b615 The issue of whether a state court may offset social security benefits by ordering the distribution of other property of equal value when devising an equitable apportionment of marital property in a dissolution proceeding is a question of first impression for this Court. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572, 99 S. Ct. 802 (1979), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strong, </em>provide guidance. In <em>Hisquierdo, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of offset, albeit under the Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231 et seq. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588, 99 S. Ct. at 811. After holding that a direct distribution of a husband\u2019s railroad retirement benefits violated the nonalienation provisions of the Act, the Court considered the wife\u2019s alternative argument that the state court could vindicate her interests in the railroad retirement benefits by ordering an offsetting award of marital property. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588, 99 S. Ct. at 811. The Court rejected the argument, concluding that using other property to balance or offset one spouse\u2019s expected railroad retirement benefits was tantamount to directly dividing those benefits in violation of the Act. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588-90, 99 S. Ct. at 812. The Court explained that an offsetting award \u201cwould upset the statutory balance and impair petitioner\u2019s economic security just as surely as would a regular deduction from his benefit check.\u201d <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 588, 99 S. Ct. at 811. In reaching its decision, the Court noted similarities between the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act, including that both prohibited the assignment of benefits through garnishment or other legal process, and analogized the provisions of the two Acts throughout its opinion. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. at 574-76, 99 S. Ct. at 805-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b616  Almost uniformly, state courts have applied the principles from <em>Hisquierdo </em>to conclude that social security benefits may not be a basis for an offsetting award in state dissolution proceedings. <em>Stanley v. Stanley, </em>956 A.2d 1 (Del. 2008); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>2007 SD 56, 734 N.W.2d 801 (S.D. 2007); <em>In re Marriage of Crook, </em>211 Ill. 2d 437, 813 N.E.2d 198 (Ill. 2004); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>726 So. 2d 393 (Fla. App. 1999); <em>In re Marriage of James, </em>950 P.2d 624 (Colo. App. 1997); <em>Marriage of Zahm, </em>138 Wn.2d 213, 978 P.2d 498 (Wash. 1999); <em>Reymann v. Reymann, </em>919 S.W.2d 615 (Tenn. App. 1995); <em>In re Marriage of Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d 293 (Iowa 1995); <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>445 N.W.2d 1 (N.D. 1989). Like 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231m of the Railroad Retirement Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) of the Social Security Act prohibits the assignment of retirement benefits and removes the benefits from the reach of \u201cgarnishment, attachment, or other legal process under any circumstances whatsoever ... .\u201d Because virtually identical language appears in both statutes, and as we observe no other controlling differences between the Social Security Act and the Railroad Retirement Act, we are compelled to apply the reasoning announced in <em>Hisquierdo. </em>We join the majority of state courts that have considered this question and conclude that \u00a7 407(a) prohibits an offsetting award.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b617 This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strong </em>provides additional support for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>conclusion, but also offers guidance regarding the permissible role social security benefits may play in the distribution of a marital estate. In <em>Strong, </em>we considered whether a state trial court may include Veterans\u2019 Administration (VA) disability benefits in a marital estate and award those benefits as part of an equitable division of the marital property. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 11. We held that, under the provisions of the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408 et seq., and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(a), Congress had preempted state courts from including VA disability benefits in a marital estate. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 27. We also deemed it appropriate, for the purpose of providing guidance on remand, to \u201caddress what authority the courts of Montana ha[d] over VA disability benefits without running afoul of the Supremacy Clause.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 28. We first concluded it would be improper for a trial court to use the value of the military disability benefits as a basis for awarding offsetting marital property to the other spouse, explaining that the \u201c[disability benefits should not, either in form or substance, be treated as marital property subject to division upon the dissolution of marriage.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 35 (quotation omitted). However, we further concluded it was permissible for the trial court to consider the benefits more \u201cgenerally as an economic circumstance of the parties,\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 40, in the same way a court \u201cconsiders each party\u2019s ability to earn income post-dissolution as an important factor in achieving an equitable property division, thus avoiding the need to award spousal maintenance.\u201d jSiron,g, \u00b6 34 (internal citation omitted). We \u201ccaution[ed] trial courts to be careful not to achieve indirectly what they may not do directly.\u201d <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b618 The majority of state courts utilize a similar approach with respect to social security benefits. Although these courts prohibit offset, they allow a \u201cgeneral consideration of a party\u2019s anticipated social security benefits in the overall scheme when making a property division.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>2007 SD 56, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>Webster v. Webster, </em>716 N.W.2d 47, 55, 271 Neb. 788, 798 (Neb. 2006)); <em>see also In re Marriage of Morehouse, </em>121 P.3d 264 (Col. App. 2005); <em>In re Marriage of Brane, </em>21 Kan. App. 2d 778, 908 P.2d 625 (Kan. App. 1995); <em>Bradbury v. Bradbury, </em>2006 ME 26, 893 A.2d 607 (Me. 2006); <em>Mahoney v. Mahoney, </em>425 Mass. 441, 681 N.E.2d 852 (Mass. 1997); <em>Rudden v. Rudden, </em>765 S.W.2d 719 (Mo. App. 1989); <em>Neville v. Neville, </em>791 N.E.2d 434, 437 (Ohio 2003); <em>Zahm, </em>138 Wn. 2d 213; <em>In re Marriage of Boyer, </em>538 N.W.2d at 296 (\u201cWe see a crucial distinction between: (1) adjusting property division so as to indirectly allow invasion of benefits; and (2) making a general adjustment in dividing marital property on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>that one party, far more than the other, can reasonably expect to enjoy a secure retirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b619  Based upon our decision in <em>Strong </em>and the pervasive practice in other jurisdictions, we adopt the rule that social security benefits may be considered as a factor, among others, when dividing marital property. By not allowing a district court to divide the benefits in substance or form, this approach adheres to federal law, and, at the same time, advances the policy underpinning state law by promoting equitable apportionment. We remain aware, as we stated in <em>Strong, </em>of the possibility that our holding may tempt lower courts to simply shift property of equivalent value to the spouse not receiving the benefit as an offset. We again caution courts that this practice is unacceptable. A court may not treat social security benefits as the equivalent to marital property. Instead, in arriving at an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 estate, a court may consider social security benefits generally in determining the economic circumstances of the parties. We thus reverse the District Court\u2019s distribution of the marital estate and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b620 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding maintenance to Debora?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b621 Glenn argues the District Court abused its discretion by failing to adequately address Debora\u2019s financial resources and Glenn\u2019s ability to meet his own needs prior to the sale of the Lake House, on which he was making a substantial payment. Section 40-4-203(1), MCA, provides that a court may award maintenance only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance: \u201c(a) lacks sufficient property to provide for the spouse\u2019s reasonable needs; and (b) is unable to be self-supporting through appropriate employment ...\u201d Section 40-4-203(2), MCA, states that the award must be in amounts and for periods of time that the court considers just, and only after considering all relevant facts, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">(a) the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property apportioned to that party, and the party\u2019s ability to meet the party\u2019s needs independently...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">(b) the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">(c) the standard of living established during the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">(d) the duration of the marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">(e) the age and the physical and emotional condition of the spouse seeking maintenance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-12\">(f) the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>meet the spouse\u2019s own needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b622  We agree with Glenn that the District Court erred in determining the maintenance award. The court made no findings of fact to support its determination that Debora\u2019s monthly expenses were $7,600. The court merely stated that Debora\u2019s expenses should be the same as Glenn\u2019s expenses without any expressed factual basis to support this determination. <em>See Crowley v. Crowley, </em>2014 MT 42, \u00b6 42, 374 Mont. 48, 318 P.3d 1031 (\u201cWe are unable to determine from the District Court\u2019s brief findings whether the court properly awarded maintenance under the relevant factors listed in \u00a7 40-4-203(2), MCA, as its findings did not address these factors specifically.\u201d). Further, the court\u2019s failure to recognize Glenn\u2019s monthly expenses associated with the Lake House, at least until the house is sold, was clearly erroneous. Until then, these costs are properly included within Glenn\u2019s expenses and must be considered in determining Glenn\u2019s ability to \u201cmeet the spouse\u2019s own needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance.\u201d Section 40-4-203(2)(f), MCA. We reverse and remand the maintenance issue for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b623 <em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by imposing conditions on the termination of the maintenance ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b624 Glenn contends the District Court erred as a matter of law by ordering that maintenance would terminate when Glenn both ceases to be \u201cgainfully employed\u201d and ceases to receive income from investments, except for retirement accounts. Citing \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, Glenn argues that \u201cmodification or termination of spousal maintenance \u2018may only be made\u2019 under certain conditions, including in pertinent part \u2018a showing of change of circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d (underlining in original). Because we are remanding the maintenance issue for further consideration, we address this issue to provide instruction on remand. \u00b625 Section 40-4-208(1), MCA, provides: \u201ca <em>decree may be modified by a court </em>as to maintenance or support only as to installments accruing subsequent to actual notice to the parties of the motion for modification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, further provides that a decree can only be modified in regard to maintenance \u201cupon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b626 Glenn\u2019s argument mistakenly applies \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, to the District Court\u2019s conditions for termination of maintenance. This provision governs a court\u2019s modification of an earlier dissolution decree, including the modification of a maintenance award, which did not occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>here. The court simply set conditions that would trigger the termination of the maintenance it had decreed. Glenn would be free at a later time to petition for modification of any maintenance award pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(b), MCA, at which time he must satisfy the statute\u2019s requirements, including that he make \u201ca showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d Section 40-4-208(b)(i), MCA. However, the District Court\u2019s award of maintenance does not conflict with this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b627  Glenn also argues that the District Court\u2019s maintenance conditions are impermissibly vague. He offers that the term \u201cgainfully employed,\u201d as used in the court\u2019s order, could include a minimum-wage position that would be unable to support a large maintenance payment. Although this Court favors \u201cproviding the person obligated to pay maintenance as much certainty as possible regarding the amount and duration of the obligation,\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Zander, </em>262 Mont. 215, 225, 864 P.2d 1225, 1231 (1993), we conclude there is nothing impermissibly vague or uncertain about the term \u201cgainfully employed\u201d as used in the court\u2019s order. A change in Glenn\u2019s economic circumstances may well subject the maintenance award to modification or termination, especially if those changes are significant. In that event, Glenn would be free, as discussed above, to petition the court pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA, for modification of the award. We conclude the District Court\u2019s conditions for termination of the maintenance award are legally permissible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b628 <em>4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in awarding an equalization payment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b629  Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, governs a district court\u2019s division of property in a marital dissolution, stating that a district court shall \u201cequitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title ... is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d A district court\u2019s apportionment of the marital estate \u201cshould be equitable in light of the net worth of the estate.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Axelberg, </em>2015 MT 110, \u00b6 7, 378 Mont. 528, 347 P.3d 1225. A district court exceeds its authority under \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, when it awards cash or property that is in excess of the proven net worth of the estate. <em>In re Marriage of Dennison, </em>2006 MT 56, \u00b6 22, 331 Mont. 315, 132 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>535.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b630 Glenn first argues that the equalization payment exceeds the net worth of the estate. However, by Glenn\u2019s own calculations, the net worth of the estate is greater than the amount of the equalization payment. The District Court adopted Glenn\u2019s estimated value of the parties\u2019 assets and in view of the net value of merely the chief assets \u2014 the Fredrickson property proceeds ($198,000), Lake House ($58,018), Hungry Horse lot ($15,000), Schaffer Road property ($15,000), and the Great West Retirement account ($251,494) \u2014 the parties\u2019 net worth surpasses $537,500, far exceeding the equalization payment of $164,500. Thus, the District Court did not award more than the net value of the existing marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b631 Glenn also argues that because \u201cthe Fredrickson property was a gift to Glenn,\u201d the \u201cproceeds should not be taken into account in determining the value of the marital estate.\u201d However, the fact the Fredrickson property was gifted to Glenn does not alter the property\u2019s status as marital property subject to equitable apportionment. We have held that, in a dissolution proceeding, a district court must equitably apportion <em>\u201ceverything </em>owned jointly or by either party ... regardless of when or how it was acquired.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, \u00b6 13, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A57\">\u00b632 Lastly, Glenn argues that even if the Frederickson property proceeds were properly included within the estate, \u201conly $150,000 of these proceeds are traceable to the Kings Point property,\u201d and the \u201cremaining $45,000 is not accounted for at all and therefore should not be credited to Glenn.\u201d He adds that the \u201cimprovements Glenn made to the Kings Point property similarly should be disregarded in calculating the equalization payment.\u201d The District Court found that the $198,000 in Fredrickson property proceeds and the $16,000 of improvements to the Kangs Point property were unilaterally taken by Glenn beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction or were otherwise concealed. Because we see, after review of the record, no error in these findings, we conclude that the entire amount of the Fredrickson property proceeds and the identified sums expended for improvements to the Kings Point property were properly included in the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u00b633 While the ultimate distribution of the estate and calculation of an equalization payment may be altered on remand, we have provided resolution of the issues argued herein for guidance on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b634 <em>5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding Debora a 2006 SeaDoo watercraft vehicle?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b635 Glenn argues \u201c[t]here was no evidence, let alone substantial evidence, to warrant the award of the SeaDoo to Debora.\u201d However, Debora testified she enjoyed riding the SeaDoo with her daughter and wished to have the watercraft vehicle. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the 2006 SeaDoo watercraft vehicle to Debora.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b636 We reverse the District Court\u2019s distribution of the parties\u2019 social security benefits and remand the distribution of the marital estate for further consideration consistent with the analysis herein. We also reverse the maintenance award and remand for entry of sufficient findings concerning Debora\u2019s financial expenses, and for consideration of Glenn\u2019s expenses associated with the Lake House in determining Glenn\u2019s ability to make maintenance payments and meet his own needs during the pendency of the sale of the Lake House. Because questions of equitable distribution and spousal maintenance are intertwined, the District Court may reconsider these issues and the calculation of the equalization payment to the extent necessary, in its discretion, to enter a revised decree. In all other respects, we conclude that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b637 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE MeGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\"> Debora contends on appeal that her social security benefits are closer to $850 per month, but introduced no evidence at trial to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> Glenn makes additional arguments regarding the propriety of an award of maintenance here. Because we have reversed and remanded the award of maintenance for further consideration, we do not address those arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-6\"> The District Court rejected Glenn\u2019s position that the Fredrickson house should be excluded from the marital estate as gifted or inherited property, noting that \u201c[t]his is not \u2018gift\u2019 or \u2018inheritance\u2019 in any usual sense. Debora alleges Glenn\u2019s conduct was nefarious and dishonest. This Court lacks sufficient evidence to determine that, but finds the asset was gained through Glenn\u2019s \u2018services\u2019 and therefore an earned marital asset, whether acquired rightly or wrongly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
