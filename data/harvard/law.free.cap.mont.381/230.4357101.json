(Mother) appeals an order entered by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, terminating her parental rights to her five minor children, C.M., B.M., A.M., E.M., and D.M. We restate and address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Mother\u2019s conduct or condition that made her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">\u00b63 On January 26, 2014, following reports to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) that children were being exposed to methamphetamine use, law enforcement officers discovered methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia in Mother\u2019s home. The officers located three \u201c8 balls\u201d of methamphetamine as well as \u201cloaded syringes\u201d within reach of the children. The Department removed the children, who ranged in age from 16 months to 9 years, from Mother\u2019s care and placed them with their respective natural fathers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Four of the five children tested positively for methamphetamine exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">\u00b64 On January 30,2014, Child Protection Specialist Becci Dellinger interviewed Mother. During the interview, Mother stated that she had used methamphetamine in the past. When asked about the drugs and drug paraphernalia found in her home, Mother said that she had let some people \u201ccrash\u201d in her apartment. When asked why she had not kicked her boyfriend (T.B.) out of the apartment after learning of his methamphetamine use and distribution, Mother stated that T.B. was \u201cslowing down\u201d his use. Mother denied regularly using methamphetamine, stating that the only thing she needed help with was her bipolar disorder. During the interview, Dellinger noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Mother had very noticeable black eyes. The next day, Dellinger interviewed five-year-old E.M. E.M. stated that T.B. kicks her mom and yells at her and when this happens E.M. goes into the kitchen to hide while C.M. and B.M. cry. E.M. stated \u201c[B.M.] cries when [T.B.] hurts my mom\u201d and \u201c[T.B.] punches mommy in the tummy until she pukes,\u201d E.M. stated that she got an \u201cowie\u201d on her forearm from the needle T.B. used to poke her in the arm. When Dellinger informed Mother of E.M.\u2019s disclosures, Mother stated that E.M. is a liar and that T.B. had never hurt her in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b65 After several continuances, the District Court held a show cause hearing on April 16, 2014. Mother stipulated to adjudication of the children as Youths in Need of Care and the court granted temporary legal custody to the Department pending a dispositional hearing. On May 7, 2014, the District Court held a dispositional hearing. Mother did not appear but was represented by counsel. The District Court ordered a treatment plan for Mother and awarded temporary legal custody to the Department for a period of six months to allow Mother time to successfully complete her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b66 Mother\u2019s treatment plan required that she perform the following tasks to achieve the treatment plan\u2019s goals: 1) address her chemical dependency issues; 2) demonstrate effective parenting skills; 3) address her mental health issues; 4) maintain a safe and stable home environment; 5) attend supervised visitations with her children; and 6) sign releases of information for the Department and attend weekly meetings with her Child Protective Services (CPS) worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b67 The District Court held a status hearing on August 6, 2014. Mother did not appear but was represented by counsel. The Department indicated that Mother had been disengaged with her treatment plan tasks for some time but recently seemed willing to participate. The Department stated that it also was willing to reengage with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b68 Two months later, Mother was arrested on federal charges for conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute. She pleaded guilty and was awaiting sentencing at the time of the termination hearing. On October 24, 2014, the Department filed a petition to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights, alleging that she failed to successfully complete her treatment plan and was unlikely to change within a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n<p id=\"AsC\">\u00b69 The District Court held a termination hearing on February 13, 2015. The Department presented evidence reflecting Mother\u2019s noncompliance with her treatment plan. The Department presented letters written by the two oldest children, A.M. and D.M. In those letters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>A.M. and D.M. expressed significant anger and sadness over Mother\u2019s drug use. They wrote that they \u201cdo not feel safe\u201d around their Mother and often went hungry while living with her. A.M. expressed that she often was the one to care for the other children. The children\u2019s therapist, Robin Castle, testified that the children are traumatized from their time with Mother and did not want to live with her. Castle also testified that she thinks the children\u2019s goal is to \u201csomeday [have] some kind of relationship with [Mother].\u201d Mother\u2019s attorney argued against termination and requested that temporary legal custody be extended or that the matter be dismissed with full custody granted to the fathers.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b610 At the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights. The court found that the Department made reasonable efforts to unify Mother with her children. Despite Mother\u2019s disengagement, the court found that the Department continued to assist and motivate her in completing her treatment plan by making many referrals to providers and by giving her supervised visits with her children. The court found that the Mother\u2019s conduct rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time because she had not completed chemical dependency treatment, had not addressed her mental health issues, had not changed the drug and domestic violence patterns within the home, had not ended her criminal activity, and had not established a safe and stable residence for the children. The court also considered Mother\u2019s pending incarceration and sentencing in federal court as a factor in determining that she would remain an unfit parent and unable to parent within a reasonable time. Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for abuse of discretion. <em>In re L.N., </em>2014 MT 187, \u00b6 12, 375 Mont. 480, 329 P.3d 598 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law for correctness. <em>L.N., </em>\u00b6 12. An appellant bears the burden of establishing that the district court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re </em>D.F., 2007 MT 147, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 461, 161 P.3d 825 (citation omitted). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>In re </em>C.J.M., 2012 MT 137, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 298, 280 P.3d 899 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Mother\u2019s conduct or condition that made her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b613 A district court may terminate the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence that: 1) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care, 2) an appropriate treatment plan has not been complied with or has not been successful, and 3) the conduct or condition of the parent rendering him or her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b614 Mother first argues that she was not given a reasonable amount of time to complete her treatment plan and prove that she was capable of change. Mother points out that the Department petitioned for termination only five months after the treatment plan was entered; she argues that five months is an insufficient time to determine by clear and convincing evidence if someone is capable of change, \u201cespecially in light of [her] addiction.\u201d Mother describes the strongly addictive nature of methamphetamine, explaining that it \u201calters the way the brain functions, making recovery and attempts at sobriety very difficult.\u201d \u00b615 We consistently have held that \u201ca parent who does not object to a treatment plan\u2019s goals or tasks waives the right to argue on appeal that the plan was not appropriate.\u201d <em>In re C.B., </em>2014 MT 4, \u00b6 16, 373 Mont. 204, 316 P.3d 177 (citing <em>In re D.S.B., </em>2013 MT 112, \u00b6 10, 370 Mont. 37, 300 P.3d 702) (holding that mother waived any argument regarding whether her treatment plan took into account the pain that was the root cause of her addiction because she failed to explicitly object to the plan below); <em>In re T.S., </em>2013 MT 274, \u00b6 27, 372 Mont. 79, 310 P.3d 538 (holding that father waived any argument regarding whether treatment plan adequately addressed his hearing disability because he failed to object to the plan either at its inception or when the issue arose).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b616  Mother did not raise any objection to the treatment plan\u2019s goals or tasks concerning her drug addiction. The plan provided a six-month deadline for completion of each task. To the extent that Mother challenges the amount of time the treatment plan allowed for her to address her drug addiction, she does so for the first time on appeal. Mother thus waived her claim of the treatment plan\u2019s inappropriate timeline and we decline to consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b617 Mother\u2019s second argument is that there was not clear and convincing evidence that she was unlikely to change within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b618 In order to conclude that the conduct or condition rendering a parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the district court must find that continuing the parent-child legal relationship \u201cwill likely result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care.\u201d Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. In making this determination, the court must consider the following nonexclusive factors: emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent; a history of violent behavior by the parent; excessive use of drugs or alcohol by the parent; and any present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. The court also must consider \u201cpast and present conduct of the parent.\u201d <em>In re J.C., </em>2003 MT 369, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 112, 82 P.3d 900. A parent\u2019s past behavior may be considered in determining whether the parent would become a fit parent in the future. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.A., </em>2008 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b619 Mother claims that despite her failed treatment plan, she was beginning the \u201croad to recovery.\u201d She had completed two chemical dependency evaluations and applied for admission to the Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC). Mother contends that it would have been appropriate to dismiss the petition and extend legal custody to allow her to continue her attempts at sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b620 The State asserts that there was substantial evidence establishing that the condition rendering Mother unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The State explains that Mother\u2019s failure to participate fully in chemical dependency treatment and counseling has a negative effect on her ability to safely and appropriately parent. The State also argues that it was proper for the District Court to consider Mother\u2019s pending incarceration and its effect on her ability to parent. Finally, the State claims that the District Court appropriately considered the children\u2019s needs for a permanent, stable, and loving home in determining whether Mother\u2019s condition was likely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b621 The District Court concluded that continuation of the parent-child relationship between Mother and her children likely will result in continued abuse and neglect of the children. In reaching its conclusion, the court relied on Mother\u2019s failure to address the issues outlined in her treatment plan. The court also considered Mother\u2019s pending federal criminal sentence. The court noted that federal drug crimes carry mandatory minimum sentences of several years and that Mother\u2019s upcoming confinement renders her unable to provide a residence, food, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>other necessities, and care for her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b622 Mother\u2019s first tasks in her treatment plan required that she complete a chemical dependency evaluation, follow the evaluator\u2019s recommendations, and comply with random drug and alcohol testing. Mother was referred to random urinalysis (UA) sampling. Between January and October 2014, Mother was scheduled for 35 UAs. Mother failed to appear at 31 UAs. The other four UAs produced positive methamphetamine results. Theresa McCracken, a licensed addictions counselor, completed Mother\u2019s evaluation and recommended that she complete intensive outpatient treatment. Mother attended five group sessions between mid-May and mid-June 2014. She also attended one individual session. Mother did not attend any treatment with McCracken after mid-June 2014. In August 2014, Julie Messerly, a licensed addictions counselor, diagnosed Mother with amphetamine, opiate, and alcohol dependence. She also recommended that Mother complete intensive outpatient treatment. Mother attended one individual session and one group session in September. Mother\u2019s UA test during that time was positive for amphetamine. Messerly referred Mother to inpatient treatment at MCDC. Mother had a bed date for September 29,2014, but did not go because she complained of an ear infection. Mother had not, however, seen a doctor to have the ear infection diagnosed. Mother had another bed date for MCDC in October 2014. She attended inpatient treatment for four days, and was discharged early from the program for reasons that do not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b623 Mother\u2019s second task in her treatment plan required her to successfully complete parenting classes, demonstrate the skills learned, and learn about the effects drug exposure has on children. She also had to demonstrate an understanding of how to keep her children safe, and she had to successfully complete an in-home parenting program if the case progressed to reunification. Dellinger testified that she was unable to refer Mother for parenting classes because Mother\u2019s mental and chemical dependency issues were so severe that they needed to be addressed first. Mother never completed chemical dependency treatment and therefore was never referred for an in-home parenting program.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b624 Mother\u2019s third task required that she obtain a mental health evaluation and follow all recommendations once she achieved 30 days of sobriety. She was required to obtain domestic violence education and demonstrate an ability to keep her children safe from exposure to domestic violence. Mother did not achieve 30 days of sobriety but was referred to Angela Meyers, a licensed clinical professional counselor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and licensed addictions counselor, for a mental health evaluation on March 12,2014. Meyers was unable to make any diagnoses because of Mother\u2019s drug use. Meyers recommended that Mother attend the domestic violence women\u2019s group and individual counseling and complete a chemical dependency evaluation. Mother attended three appointments with Meyers, all of which were related to evaluations instead of counseling. She did not attend any appointments with Meyers after May 1, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b625 Mother\u2019s fourth task in her treatment plan required that she have a stable residence, not allow drugs or paraphernalia in her home, and seek employment or otherwise have adequate income to meet her children\u2019s needs. Mother indicated that she had been living in an apartment rented to her by her mother. However, she was arrested in October 2014 on federal criminal drug charges and had been incarcerated for several months at the time of the hearing. Dellinger testified that most of the jobs Mother claimed to have held prior to her arrest were unverified and of unknown duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b626 Mother\u2019s fifth and sixth tasks in her treatment plan required that she attend supervised visitations with her children, that she sign releases of information for the Department, and that she attend weekly meetings with her CPS worker. Prior to her October 2014 incarceration, Mother attended most visits with her children. Dellinger testified that following one of Mother\u2019s visits, Dellinger found a syringe and 9-millimeter ammunition in Mother\u2019s coat. Mother\u2019s October 2014 incarceration made it impossible for her to attend subsequent supervised visitations with her children. CPS worker Dellinger testified that Mother\u2019s contact with Dellinger, aside from the visitations, was \u201cpoor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b627 Castle testified that the children were transitioning well into their fathers\u2019 homes. She stated that there remains significant trauma from when they lived with Mother and that they are afraid of living with her. Dellinger testified that continued custody by Mother would be damaging to the children and that termination of Mother\u2019s rights would be in the children\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b628 It is the policy of the State of Montana to provide for the protection of children whose health and welfare are or may be adversely affected and further threatened by the conduct of those responsible for the children\u2019s care and protection. Section 41-3-101(l)(a), MCA. In determining whether to terminate a parent\u2019s rights, the courts give precedence to a child\u2019s best interests over parental rights. <em>In re Matter of E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 33, 307 Mont. 328, 37 P.3d 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00b629  Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court appropriately gave primary consideration to the needs of the children. There is substantial evidence of Mother\u2019s infrequent and inconsistent efforts in completing the required tasks in her treatment plan. The District Court did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence in reaching its conclusion that Mother is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. We acknowledge that methamphetamine addiction poses a steep challenge for parents trying to avoid termination of parental rights. A district court has discretion under the law to afford a parent more time to achieve sobriety where the parent is making progress. Sections 41-3-442(4)(a)(i), (6), MCA. In this case, however, Mother did not show meaningful signs of engaging in treatment, and then was arrested for additional drug offenses. Mother\u2019s pending incarceration and the substantial evidence of her continued drug use support the court\u2019s conclusion that continuing the parent-child legal relationship likely will result in continued abuse or neglect. We therefore affirm the District Court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b630 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b631 Section 41-3-604(1), MCA, establishes a presumption that if a child has been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child will be served by termination of parental rights. In such cases, the Department must file a petition to terminate parental rights unless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(a) the child is being cared for by a relative;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(b) the department has not provided the services considered necessary for the safe return of the child to the child's home; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">(c) the department has documented a compelling reason, available for court review, for determining that filing a petition to terminate parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Section 41-3-604(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">\u00b632 Mother argues that, \u201cwhen looking at the situation as a whole,\u201d the District Court abused its discretion by terminating her parental rights. Mother asserts that the requirement that the State file a petition to terminate under \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, does not apply because the children were placed with their respective fathers and not in the physical custody of the State. Mother relies on the discretionary language of \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA, to argue that because the court was not required to terminate her rights, it should have focused on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances and a balance of competing interests in determining if termination is appropriate when children are placed with a parent.\u201d Mother contends that because the children were doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>well and thriving with their fathers, the District Court\u2019s finding that continuation of the parent-child relationship would result in continued abuse and neglect was speculative and unsupported by the evidence. \u00b633 Mother urges that re-establishing the relationship between her and her children would be in their best interest \u201conce she received treatment.\u201d Mother explains that her criminal sentence would require her to complete treatment \u201cunder the watchful eye of her federal probation officer\u201d and create the potential to re-establish a safe and healthy relationship with her children. Mother refers to testimony from two of the fathers conceding that, before she became involved with drugs, Mother had done a \u201cgreat job with the kids,\u201d provided a \u201cgreat foundation,\u201d and was an \u201cexcellent mother.\u201d Mother also referred to therapist Castle\u2019s testimony that the children someday may want to re-establish a relationship with Mother. For the foregoing reasons, Mother concludes that dismissal of the case with custody to the fathers was in the children\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b634 The State argues that the District Court properly exercised its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights. The State asserts that the law does not negate the basis to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights simply by virtue of the children\u2019s placement with kin. The State argues that it was required to place the children with their non-offending parents under \u00a7 41-3-101(3), MCA, and that doing so \u201chad no bearing on the Mother or her parental rights.\u201d The State contends that it sought to terminate Mother\u2019s rights because it proved that Mother failed to comply with her treatment plan and that her conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. \u00b635 [3] While Mother is correct that \u00a7 41-3-604, MCA, did not mandate that the Department seek termination, it does not follow that the court abused its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s rights under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. Mother acknowledges that the law did not require dismissing the petition once the children were placed with their fathers. <em>See In re L.V-B., </em>2014 MT 13, \u00b6 19, 373 Mont. 344, 317 P.3d 191. When the circumstances set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, exist, the statute\u2019s permissive language gives district courts discretion in deciding whether to terminate parental rights. In this case, the facts warranted the State\u2019s petition under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. It is undisputed that the children were adjudicated youths in need of care; Mother does not argue that she successfully completed her treatment plan; and there is clear and convincing evidence that the conduct or condition rendering Mother unfit to parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Given these circumstances, and giving paramount importance to the best interests of the children, the court was within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>its discretion in deciding to terminate Mother\u2019s rights. The court made factual findings supported by substantial evidence and correctly applied the law based on those findings. As such, there was no abuse of discretion. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\"><em>\u00b636 </em>We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights. The District Court\u2019s factual findings are supported by the record, and the court did not err in finding that the conduct or condition rendering Mother unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\"> A.M. is the natural father of C.M., B.M., and E.M.
