We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">\n<em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it permitted A. U. to testify about prior sexual abuse by Given.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">\n<em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it limited the defense examination of witnesses regarding specific instances of conduct.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">\n<em>Issue 3: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony from the State\u2019s expert witness Wendy Dutton.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">\u00b63 In April of 2011, Detective Kevin Cunningham of the Yellowstone County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a report of sexual abuse of K.F., a ten-year-old boy, which K.F. had disclosed to a school counselor. During Cunningham\u2019s interview of K.F., the boy disclosed three incidents in which his neighbor, Given, had touched him inappropriately during the previous year: at his own home, at Given\u2019s home, and while the two were on a camping trip. Cunningham interviewed several other people, including KF.\u2019s mother and her cousin C.H., who was Given\u2019s boyfriend and lived with Given next door to KF.\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">\u00b64 Given was arrested and advised of his Miranda rights, after which he gave a statement to Detective Cunningham. Given stated that on one occasion K.F. had complained of a rash on his genitals and Given provided K.F. lotion to put on the rash. Given denied touching KF.\u2019s genitals, having K.F. masturbate in front of him, or kissing K.F. on the mouth, as K.F. had reported. Given acknowledged that he walked in on K.F. masturbating and watched him. He also admitted kissing K.F. on the cheeks, showing him pornographic videos featuring gay men, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>giving K.F. a cell phone without his parents\u2019 knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b65 The State charged Given with felony sexual assault and failure to register as a sexual offender. Given moved the District Court to sever the charge of failure to register, and the court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">\u00b66 During discovery, the State gave notice of its intent to call Given\u2019s sister A.U. as a witness at trial. In 1995, Given had admitted and been convicted of sexual assault against A.U. from the time she was six years old until she was eleven. Given opposed allowing A.U. to testify about the events leading to that conviction, and he filed a motion in limine to exclude A.U.\u2019s testimony as inadmissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b). The District Court held a hearing and later issued an order denying Given\u2019s motion in limine and allowing the State to present A.U.\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b67 The State asked the District Court to exclude all evidence that K.F. had been abused by his stepfather, all references to the status of Given\u2019s boyfriend C.H. as a registered sex offender, and all evidence from KF.\u2019s counseling records and Department of Family Services records. The court granted the first two of those motions, ordering that any allegations of sexual abuse of K.F. by his stepfather be excluded from evidence and prohibiting reference to C.H.\u2019s sex offender status at trial. Additionally, the court ordered evidence from RF.\u2019s records excluded unless it was \u201cappropriate to delve into certain matters on cross-examination pursuant to the exceptions contained in Rule 608 or pursuant to Rule 801.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b68 The case proceeded to a jury trial in early January of 2013. The State\u2019s witnesses included K.F., his mother and his stepfather, Detective Cunningham, A.U., and forensic interviewer Wendy Dutton.</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\">\u00b69 KF.\u2019s mother testified that she met Given through her cousin C.H. and that the couple later moved in next door to her family. She recalled how Given and K.F. spent time together fishing, camping, and playing video games, and that K.F. also spent time at Given\u2019s home. K.F.\u2019s mother testified that Given favored K.F. over her other children and bought him gifts including a cell phone, a television, a fishing pole, and a knife. She testified that, for a while, K,F. seemed to enjoy spending time with Given, but that in the fall of 2010, K.F. began to say that he hated Given and did not want to talk to him or see him. On cross-examination, she testified that K.F. sometimes told lies, some of which were of a serious and harmful nature, but that his lies were no more frequent than an average boy his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b6 10 K.F. testified to three instances of inappropriate conduct by Given. He testified that in the first incident, Given entered KF.\u2019s room and instructed him to lie on the floor and pull his pants down. K.F. testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>that Given then placed lotion on KF.\u2019s penis and rubbed it. K.F. told the jury his penis \u201cstood straight up\u201d and then \u201csome white stuff came out.\u201d K.F. also testified that Given made him stick his penis in a stuffed animal and showed him websites about gay men, including violent scenes of men whipping each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b611 K.F. testified to a second incident, when he went camping with Given, A.U., and A.U.\u2019s family. The group slept in Given\u2019s camp trailer. A.U. and her family stayed one night, while Given and K.F. camped for two nights. K.F. stated that Given cuddled him at night and K.F. woke up with his lower body wet and sticky. K.F. further testified that Given asked K.F. to rub lotion on his penis, but K.F. refused and Given did not persist.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b612 K.F. testified to a third incident, at Given\u2019s home, which K.F. would frequently visit. K.F. told the jury Given wanted him to rub lotion on his penis and that Given put his hand down KF.\u2019s pants and kissed K.F. on the mouth. Additionally, K.F. testified that Given showed K.F. a dildo and stated, \u201cSoon when you get old enough, you will stick this up your butt.\u201d K.F. then told Given to stop, and left the house because he felt uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b613 K.F. testified to numerous gifts Given had given him, including a cell phone, a fishing pole, a knife, a television, and sunglasses. According to K.F., Given specifically instructed him not to tell his mother about the cell phone or the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b614 During cross examination of K.F., Given\u2019s counsel demonstrated that KF.\u2019s story had inconsistencies and that K.F. had lied about his family. K.F. acknowledged calling the authorities and telling hurtful lies about his parents, including that he was afraid to go home. K.F. maintained, however, that he did not make up stories about Given.</p>\n<p id=\"AM1\">\u00b615 Prior to the testimony of Given\u2019s sister A.U., the District Court instructed the jury that the evidence of Given\u2019s prior acts was for the limited purpose of showing his intent or absence of mistake. The District Cotut warned that the evidence could not be used for any other purpose and the jury was to decide whether or not to convict based only on the crimes charged, not any other crimes or wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b616 A.U. identified Given as her half-brother. She recalled going camping with her four children, K.F., and Given in Three Forks, Montana. A.U. testified that, on the camping trip, Given and K.F. spent time alone behind a closed bedroom door. A.U. did not know where K.F. slept during the night. A.U. stated she had noticed that Given\u2019s behavior toward K.F. was similar to his behavior towards her when she was young. Specifically, she discussed how he purchased K.F. a fishing pole and sunglasses, but did not buy gifts for the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>children. A.U. noted that Given had given her special attention as a child and bought her gifts or took her to the park. She testified that this special attention \u201cled to him molesting me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b617 Over Given\u2019s objection, the District Court permitted the State to question A.U. about the abuse. A.U. testified to a slow escalation of sexual violence starting with touching when she was six years old, and progressing to Given inserting objects into her vagina and eventually full intercourse when she was eleven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b618 The State presented expert testimony by Wendy Dutton, a forensic interviewer for a child protection team at a Phoenix, Arizona, children\u2019s hospital. Dutton testified that she had been a forensic interviewer of children for over 20 years, and had interviewed over 8,000 claimed child victims of sexual abuse. She testified she had not reviewed any of the materials for this case, and she did not testify about this case. She testified that, generally, boys tend to delay disclosure longer than girls; and she listed some reasons for that. She testified that piecemeal disclosure is common and that recantation of disclosure occurs in a minority of cases. She described the process of victimization, including victim selection, engagement, grooming, assault, and concealment. She also described the variety of symptoms shown by victims of sexual abuse, including depression, difficulty in school, aggression, and temper tantrums. She testified that malicious false reports \u2014 reports that are made for some ulterior motive or secondary gain \u2014 typically occur in situations in which the child\u2019s parents are involved in a high conflict divorce or custody dispute. She described techniques for interviewing children and discussed characteristics of children\u2019s memories. Her testimony was based on both her own research and others\u2019 research in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b619 KF.\u2019s stepfather testified that he had observed that K.F. and Given were very close for some time, but that KF.\u2019s attitude later changed into one of apparent intense dislike for Given. Given\u2019s boyfriend C.H. echoed that testimony, telling the jury that Given and K.F. had once seemed to enjoy watching television and playing video games together, but that K.F. appeared angry with Given and did not want to be around him beginning in November or December of 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"AuIq\">\u00b620 Given testified on his own behalf. He stated he had a special interest in K.F., and that he related to him as he, like K.F., had been an ostracized child. According to Given, he saw K.F. once or twice a week. Given admitted to buying gifts for K.F., including a cell phone despite instructions from K.F.\u2019s mother that he wait until she consulted her husband about that gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b621 Regarding the specific allegations of sexual abuse, Given denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ever touching K.F. He testified that on the camping trip to Three Forks, he slept on the floor next to the queen-sized bed in the camper and that K.F. slept in the bed. He admitted that he had walked in on K.F. masturbating in KF.\u2019s bedroom and had observed him instead of walking away. He stated he had observed this because he was curious about starting his own family. Given also admitted to giving K.F. lotion for a rash, stating he \u201cput some lotion in [K.F.\u2019s] hands and told him to reach down his pants and rub his crotch.\u201d He denied assisting K.F. in applying the lotion. Given also testified that he kissed K.F. on the comer of the mouth or the cheeks. Given admitted to showing K.F. gay pornography. He acknowledged that this was a mistake, but stated he decided to show K.F. the pornography because \u201che was interested in becoming gay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b622 The jury found Given guilty of felony sexual assault. Given later entered a nolo contendere plea on the charge of failure to register as a sexual offender. He was sentenced to the Montana State Prison for seventy years with twenty years suspended on the sexual assault charge, and was committed to the Department of Corrections for two years for failure to register as a sex offender, to run concurrently to the sexual assault sentence. Given appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b623 A district court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence. Accordingly, we generally review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Lotter, </em>2013 MT 336, \u00b6 13, 372 Mont. 445, 313 P.3d 148. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. Franks, </em>2014 MT 273, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 431, 335 P.3d 725. To the extent the court\u2019s ruling is based on a rule of evidence, a statute, or a constitutional right, our review is de novo. <em>Lotter, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b624 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it permitted A. U. to testify about prior sexual abuse by Given.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\u00b625 As indicated above, Given moved in limine to prevent A.U. from testifying about the events that resulted in his 1995 conviction of sexual assault. Given pointed out that, under M.R. Evid. 404(b), evidence of other acts may not be used to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that the person acted in conformity with that character. In response, the State asserted that such evidence may be used for certain other purposes, and argued the evidence went to establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Given\u2019s intent, the absence of mistake, and the common scheme of grooming used to perpetrate the abuse. After a hearing on the motion in limine, the District Court permitted the State to use A.U.\u2019s testimony at trial for the \u201climited scope and purpose of demonstrating intent and absence of mistake.\u201d The court prohibited introduction of any evidence of Given\u2019s prior criminal conviction for the assault on A.U. and his subsequent sex offender treatment, unless Given \u201copens the door.\u201d Additionally, before A.U. testified, the court instructed the jury of the limited scope for which it may consider this evidence, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 105:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\">Evidence of other acts. The State has offered evidence that the defendant at another time engaged in crimes, wrongs, or acts. That evidence was not admitted to prove the character of the defendant or in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. The only purpose of admitting that evidence was to show the intent or absence of mistake or accident. You may not use that evidence for any other purpose. The defendant is not being tried for the other crime, wrong, or act. He may not be convicted for any offense other than that in this case. For the jury to convict the defendant of any other offense other than that charged in this case may result in an unjust double punishment of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Given argues admission of A.U.\u2019s testimony constitutes error for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b626 Given first argues the District Court used an incorrect standard by requiring him to disprove the evidentiary basis for the State\u2019s evidence. He is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b627 Under the <em>post-Just </em>and <em>Matt </em>interpretation of M. R. Evid. 404(b) articulated in <em>State v. Dist. Court of the Eighteenth Judicial </em>Dist., 2010 MT 263, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415, a prosecutor must disclose her intent to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. The prosecution is not required to explain, initially, why the evidence is admissible. <em>Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>\u00b6 49. After the prosecution discloses its intent, the defense must identify authority under which the prosecution\u2019s evidence should be excluded. At that time, the prosecutor must respond to the defense\u2019s objections and demonstrate the evidence\u2019s admissibility. The court may then conduct a hearing before it issues a written decision. If the court determines the evidence is admissible, the defendant may request an instruction on the limited purpose for which the evidence is admissible, pursuant to M. R. Evid. 105. <em>Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b628 In this case, the court followed the above process, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>requiring the State to demonstrate the admissibility of the evidence at a hearing on Given\u2019s motion in limine and giving an instruction on the limited scope for which the jury may consider the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b629 Given further argues the District Court erred in reasoning that AU.\u2019s testimony about his sexual assaults on her was relevant to prove intent and mistake, because he had never claimed mistake or lack of intent. But, as the District Court specifically noted, when Given was initially confronted with KF.\u2019s allegations, he claimed he merely made the mistake of failing to leave the room after walking in on K.F. masturbating, and that he provided K.F. lotion for a rash on his genitals. The District Court identified these responses as the claimed mistake. The court concluded that A.U.\u2019s testimony was admissible under M. R. Evid. 404(b), as it was offered to demonstrate intent and absence of mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b630 Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court was correct. Given acknowledged the truth of portions of KF.\u2019s testimony, but claimed his observation of K.F. masturbating and his supplying K.F. with lotion to rub on his penis were accidental or harmless acts. A.U.\u2019s testimony was admissible as evidence of absence of mistake as well as intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b631 Given states the District Court failed to articulate any basis for introducing evidence about events remote in time and with no similarity to the charged crime. However, neither nearness in time nor similarity is a prerequisite for the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. <em>Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>\u00b6 56. As to similarity, Given argues there were significant differences between the incidents of claimed abuse (gender of victims, family member status, and threats of violence to A.U. but not to K.F.) and that these dissimilarities made AU.\u2019s testimony inadmissible under M, R. Evid. 404(b). We disagree. Similarities between the events involving A.U. and those involving K.F., as noted by the District Court, include that both incidents involved young children with whose care Given had been entrusted and that, in both cases, Given had given special favors and generous gifts to the victims far in excess of what he did for their siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b632 Finally, Given asserts that A.U.\u2019s testimony served no other purpose than to establish character evidence of his propensity to commit sexual assault, and that the probative value was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. He points to the highly inflammatory nature of child molestation evidence, as recognized in <em>State v. Franks, </em>2014 MT 273, 376 Mont. 431, 335 P.3d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b633 M. R. Evid. 403 does not require the exclusion of relevant evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>simply because it is prejudicial. Rather, such evidence is inadmissible only when it will prompt the jury to decide the case on an improper basis. <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 68, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187. In conducting its analysis in this case, the District Court concluded A.U.\u2019s testimony was relevant and that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. And the court instructed the jury on the limited purpose for which the evidence could be used \u2014 to show intent or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b634  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing into evidence A.U.\u2019s testimony about Given\u2019s abuse of her when she was a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b635 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it limited the defense examination of witnesses regarding specific instances of conduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b636 Given claims, broadly, that the District Court abused its discretion in restricting his ability to examine witnesses. He contends that his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated by the District Court\u2019s rulings. In particular, he makes three arguments. He first argues he should have been allowed to cross-examine K.F. about a claim K.F. may have made that his stepfather had sexually abused him. Given also argues he should have been allowed to inquire about the sexual offender status of C.H. Finally, he argues he should have been allowed to inquire about all information in KF.\u2019s Department of Family Services (DFS) files and counseling records.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b637  We first address Given\u2019s claim that he should have been allowed to cross-examine K.F. about an allegation K.F. may have made to a counselor that his stepfather had sexually abused him. Reference to such an allegation appears in KF.\u2019s sealed counseling records but, following the District Court\u2019s review of those records, the court concluded \u201cit was not shown that he ever made an accusation. It is extremely possible that there was an error in the reporting process.\u201d We have stated that a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is not violated by the exclusion of evidence concerning the victim\u2019s past sexual abuse by other individuals unless the victim\u2019s accusations of prior abuse have been proven or admitted to be false. <em>State v. MacKinnon, </em>1998 MT 78, \u00b6 35, 288 Mont. 329, 957 P.2d 23; <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, </em>277 Mont. 349, 356, 922 P.2d 474, 479 (1996). In this case, not only is it unclear whether such an accusation was true or false, it is unclear whether K.F. ever made such an accusation. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>to allow Given to cross-examine KF. about this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b638  In prohibiting introduction of evidence of C.H.\u2019s sexual offender status, the District Court relied on M. R. Evid. 609: \u201cFor the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime is not admissible.\u201d As the court noted, Given suggested no purpose for such evidence other than for attacking C.H.\u2019s credibility. Given was not relying on the defense of mistaken identity, and KF. never accused C.H. of molesting him. We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting Given from cross-examining C.H. on his sexual offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b639 Finally, we address the District Court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence from KF.\u2019s counseling and DFS files that he had made false statements. One way of impeaching a witness is to introduce evidence that the witness has a bad character for truthftdness. M. R. Evid. 608(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 credibility, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">\u00b640 The District Court allowed witnesses to testify that K.F. had made false statements that were harmful. The court allowed questioning of KF.\u2019s mother about whether KF. had made reports to school and other authorities that he was afraid to go home, and whether there were issues with KF.\u2019s credibility. KF.\u2019s mother testified that KF. \u201cmade up a lot of stories\u201d and the stories \u201care of a serious and harmful nature.\u201d She explained that she did not believe K.F. lied more than an average child, but that \u201che just knows the correct authorities to go to.\u201d She acknowledged that KF. had made reports about her and his stepfather that were not true, and explained that she believed he did so because he had a hard life and it was \u201ca way for him to get rid of his anger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u00b641 The court also allowed Given to present the testimony of two counselors who had met with K.F., regarding his reputation for truthfulness. Both counselors testified that K.F. sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>embellished his stories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b642 The court also allowed Given to cross-examine K.F. about false allegations contained in his DFS file. Given\u2019s counsel asked K.F. whether he had reported hurtful allegations to authorities about his parents that were untrue, and K.F. confirmed that he had. When asked if he had told authorities that he was afraid to go home, K.F. responded, \u201cYes. It was a lie.\u201d K.F. confirmed that he had made up elaborate stories about things that were done to him that were a \u201cfigment of [his] imagination.\u201d K.F. explained that he did this because he had just started living with his mother, and he did not know her. He did not initially like living with his mother because there were \u201cactual rules,\u201d and he felt he was being treated unfairly because his brother got more stuff than he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b643 Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Given\u2019s questioning of witnesses about KF.\u2019s propensity for truth-telling. It was reasonable for the court to preserve the integrity of the trial and to prevent it from becoming a trial of K.F. by limiting Given\u2019s inquiry to matters concerning KF.\u2019s credibility and his disclosure that he was abused by Given.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b644  Given has failed to establish that the District Court abused its discretion in its rulings on examination of witnesses concerning specific incidents of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b645 <em>Issue 3: Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony from the State\u2019s expert witness Wendy Dutton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQ3\">\u00b646 On October 12,2012, the State filed notice of its intent to call Dr. Wendy Dutton as an expert witness at Given\u2019s trial. The State\u2019s notice indicated Dutton would testify about general characteristics of disclosure patterns of child sexual abuse victims, including delayed reporting and dynamics involved when the victim is male and the perpetrator is male; general characteristics of coping strategies of child sexual abuse victims; and general characteristics of the process of victimization, including selection, engagement, grooming, assault, and concealment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notice also stated the prosecution would coordinate an interview of Dutton if the defense wished to interview her.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u00b647 The defense filed a motion in limine in which it argued that disclosure of Dutton as an expert witness was filed too late. The District Court denied that motion. Then, at the beginning of Dutton\u2019s trial testimony, defense counsel objected on grounds that there had been inadequate disclosure of the subject of Dutton\u2019s testimony and she was not an impartial witness. The District Court denied that motion and allowed Dutton to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b648 On appeal, Given argues that the State\u2019s delivery to the defense of copies of Dutton\u2019s curriculum vitae and her two-year-old doctoral dissertation on \u201cGender differences in children\u2019s disclosures and legal narratives of sexual abuse\u201d was inadequate to comply with the defense\u2019s discovery requests. In those discovery requests \u2014 which had been made in June of 2011 and May of 2012 \u2014 the defense had asked for copies of all scientific reports and reports produced by all experts, and for written reports and resumes of any experts. Given states his challenge on appeal, however, is not based on timeliness of disclosure of Dutton as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b649 Disclosure of witnesses by the State in a criminal case is governed by \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA. Subsection (l)(a) of that statute requires disclosure, upon request, of \u201cthe names, addresses, and statements of all persons whom the prosecutor may call as witnesses in the case in chief.\u201d In addition, the prosecution must provide, upon request, \u201call written reports or statements of experts who have personally examined the defendant or any evidence in the particular case, together with the results of physical examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons.\u201d Section 46-15-322(l)(c), MCA. The State complied with those statutes. Given says making Dutton available for deposition was not enough to demonstrate what her testimony would encompass, but it is unclear what else he would have had the State do.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b650 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted Dutton\u2019s testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b651 We affirm the judgment entered by the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-8\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> Only one of those two counselors recalled that K.F. had disclosed to her his allegations about Given.
