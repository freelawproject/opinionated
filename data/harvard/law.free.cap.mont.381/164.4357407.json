We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A8_\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the Municipal Court properly denied McClelland\u2019s request to examine the mental health treatment form that supported the State\u2019s restitution request.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b63 In March 2012 McClelland was charged by citation with partner or family member assault, second offense. In January 2013 the State served and filed notice that the Crime Victims Compensation Program (Program) sought restitution from McClelland for the amount the Program paid to the victim\u2019s counselor as a result of treatment required by McClelland\u2019s conduct. The notice included a cover letter and affidavit attesting that the Program had awarded benefits to McClelland\u2019s victim by paying the victim\u2019s counseling costs of $845.24.</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">\u00b64 In February 2013 McClelland reached a plea agreement with the State in which he agreed to plead guilty to negligent endangerment. McClelland requested a hearing on the amount of the restitution, and the hearing was held in March 2013. McClelland agreed that the Program had provided benefits to the victim and did not dispute that the Program is entitled to restitution. The State called two witnesses from the Program. Amanda Eslick described the Program\u2019s claim-screening process and testified that McClelland\u2019s victim requested payment from the Program for mental health counseling she received as a result of McClelland\u2019s offense. Eslick testified that she examined law enforcement reports and the treatment plan form prepared by the counselor, but not actual counseling notes. She explained that the Program developed the treatment plan form, and that among other things it required mental health care providers to state, by percentage, the proportion of the counseling attributable to the particular crime. The counselor submitted a treatment plan form affirming that 100% of the victim\u2019s counseling was related to McClelland\u2019s offense. The Program relied upon that affirmation in setting the amount of restitution. The State\u2019s other witness, Kathy Matson, testified that she reviewed the claim and determined that the Program should pay benefits in the amount of the full billing for the counseling, based upon the counselor\u2019s treatment plan form which stated that all of the counseling costs related to McClelland\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b65 McClelland\u2019s attorney questioned whether 100% of the counseling was attributable to McClellan\u2019s offense, but acknowledged that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>no evidence to challenge that allocation. Further, McClelland did not subpoena any witness to the hearing, did not contact anyone connected with the Program seeking information, and did not request a continuance to do so. The only factual basis for McClelland\u2019s challenge to the restitution amount is that the treatment plan form, according to the testimony, stated that the victim had experienced domestic violence trauma in the past. McClelland\u2019s attorney moved that she be allowed to examine the form, but the State objected based upon an assertion that the victim had a right of privacy in the information. The Municipal Court did not examine the treatment plan form; did not admit it into evidence; and it is not part of the record. The Municipal Court denied McClelland\u2019s request to examine the form based upon the assertion that the victim had a right of privacy in the information it contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b66 McClelland did not offer any exhibits or witnesses at the restitution hearing, but contended that the State had failed to meet its burden of proof as to the amount of restitution. The Municipal Court found that a preponderance of the evidence supported the amount of restitution sought and ordered that McClelland make restitution to the Program for the counseling costs. McClelland appealed to the District Court; that court reviewed the record and affirmed the restitution order. The District Court denied McClelland\u2019s claims that he had not received sufficient notice of the witnesses who testified at the restitution hearing and that he should have had access to the mental health treatment form.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b67 A district court functions as an intermediate appellate court when a case is appealed from municipal court. Sections 3-5-303 and 3-6-110, MCA. This Court independently reviews an appeal from the district court\u2019s decision. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. This Court reviews a lower court\u2019s factual findings regarding restitution to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Essig, </em>2009 MT 340, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 99, 218 P.3d 838. This Court reviews a contention that the sentencing court violated a defendant\u2019s right to due process, as an issue of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 99, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b68 <em>Issue: Whether the Municipal Court properly denied McClelland\u2019s request to examine the mental health treatment form that supported the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number><em>State\u2019s restitution request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b69 A sentencing judge must require a convicted person to make \u201cfull restitution\u201d to a crime victim who has suffered a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA; <em>State v. Simpson, </em>2014 MT 175, \u00b6 10, 375 Mont. 393, 328 P.3d 1144. The measure of the restitution is \u201call special damages ... substantiated by evidence in the record\u201d that the victim could recover in a civil action based on the same facts or events. Section 46-18-243(1), MCA. While the Rules of Evidence do not apply at sentencing, a defendant has a due process right to explain, argue and rebut any information presented at the hearing. <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 12, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b610 Restitution is not criminal punishment, but is a civil remedy administered by courts for the convenience of victims. <em>State v. Field, </em>2005 MT 181, \u00b6 29, 328 Mont. 26, 116 P.3d 813. When there is no presentence investigation, as in the present case, \u201cthe court shall accept evidence of the victim\u2019s loss at the time of sentencing.\u201d Section 46-18-242(2), MCA. The restitution amount will be upheld if \u201ccalculated by use of reasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances\u201d and specific documentation is not required. <em>Simpson, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Dodson, </em>2011 MT 302, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 363 Mont. 63, 265 P.3d 1254. When the defendant does not present contradictory evidence \u201cthe District Court does not err in relying on a victim\u2019s estimates of loss.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>\u00b6 14. The restitution amount must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, \u00b6 4, 297 Mont. 23, 989 P.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b611 The Crime Victims Compensation Program exists to provide compensation to persons who are innocent victims of crime. Section 53-9-102, MCA. When the Program compensates a victim, the Program steps into the shoes of the victim and is entitled to restitution from the offender for the amount of compensation paid. Section 46-18-243(2), MCA. The Program has a subrogation right to any restitution ordered by a court, to the extent of its payment to the victim. Section 46-18-248, MCA. McClelland does not contest the Program\u2019s right to seek restitution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b612 McClelland contends that because the victim suffered some domestic violence in the past, her most recent counseling could not have all been based upon his conduct. He does not explain how the fact of prior domestic violence contradicted the counselor\u2019s conclusion about the victim\u2019s current treatment, and he did not produce any evidence to support this speculation. We do not make any determination as to validity or impact of the prior information about the victim\u2019s exposure to domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u00b613  Despite this, we agree with McClelland that it was error for the Municipal Court to categorically deny his attorney access to the treatment plan form. The State\u2019s witnesses relied on the form in their testimony. When the prosecution raised the privacy issue, the Municipal Court should have examined the form to determine whether it contained information that implicated the victim\u2019s privacy rights protected by Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution. If the form contains the victim\u2019s private information, then the court must determine whether the demands of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure. <em>Board of Trustees v. Cut Bank Pioneer Press, </em>2007 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 337 Mont. 229, 160 P.3d 482. The competing interests of individual privacy and the right to know must be individually balanced in light of the facts of each case. <em>T.L.S. v. Montana Advocacy Program, </em>2006 MT 262, \u00b6 25, 334 Mont. 146, 144 P.3d 818. To the extent that the form did not contain the victim\u2019s private information, McClelland was entitled to view the form as a matter of procedural due process. <em>Aragon, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b614 As noted above, McClelland was entitled to explain, argue or rebut any restitution information received at the hearing. The summary rejection of McClelland\u2019s request to examine the treatment plan form impacted McClelland\u2019s right to explain, argue or rebut the restitution information presented at the hearing. If a crime victim provides a written statement at the sentencing hearing, the court is required to provide a copy to the defendant. Section 46-18-115(4), MCA; <em>State v. McMaster, </em>2008 MT 268, \u00b6 32, 345 Mont. 172, 190 P.3d 302. In this case the Program stood in the shoes of the victim for purposes of restitution and provided a written statement of loss to the court. The Program witnesses relied on the form when testifying,</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b615 At the same time, the victim may have a protectable expectation of privacy to some portion of the contents of the treatment plan form. If the treatment plan included information that was subject to the victim\u2019s rights of individual privacy, then the Municipal Court could have taken steps to protect the victim\u2019s privacy, such as redacting that information and allowing access to the redacted form. Since the treatment plan form is not in the record we have no basis to further review the Municipal Court\u2019s decision that it could not be examined by McClelland\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b616 The Dissent misapprehends the nature and the breadth of the majority Opinion. Nothing in this Opinion requires that any person\u2019s private health care information be disclosed, nor does it contain any requirements contrary to the statutes that govern the Program. This Opinion applies only to the Program\u2019s form that the witnesses in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>case relied upon in seeking restitution from McClelland. It stands only for the proposition that a court faced with an issue of a document that may contain matters of individual privacy must determine the contents of the document and balance the competing interests of privacy and disclosure as clearly required by established Montana law. This Opinion clearly states that information that comes within the victim\u2019s right to individual privacy may not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b6 17 Therefore, we reverse the determination as to restitution due from McClelland and remand to the Municipal Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b618 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b195-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b619 McClelland argues that he should have been permitted to examine the mental health treatment plan form to evaluate Dr. Lindner\u2019s assessment that 100% of the victim\u2019s treatment was related to McClelland\u2019s crime. McClelland claimed, without support, that the victim\u2019s counseling could not be attributable entirely to his conduct because the victim had been previously abused. McClelland claimed, without support, that because the victim had a history of prior abuse there was thus created a corresponding due process right for McClelland, not otherwise existing when prior abuse is absent, to examine records pertaining to the victim\u2019s mental health. McClelland insists on disclosure of the victim\u2019s mental health treatment plan even when there was testimony, without objection, at four different times during the restitution hearing that Dr. Lindner indicated the victim\u2019s counseling was 100% attributable to McClelland\u2019s assault. The Court\u2019s decision fails to appreciate the implications of McClelland\u2019s arguments for victims of repeated domestic violence; fails to acknowledge the complete absence of any evidence supporting McClelland\u2019s speculation that the victim\u2019s counseling was not 100% attributable to his conduct; and, most importantly, fails to recognize that \u00a7 53-9-133, MCA, allows the court to \u201cset as a condition of probation the payment to the state of an amount <em>equal </em>to any benefits paid by the office [of victims services] to a victim or a victim\u2019s dependents.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Finally, the Court fails to even mention the provisions of \u00a7 53-9-107, MCA, which establishes records of the office of victim services are confidential and exempt from disclosure, except where the proponent of disclosure has shown a compelling interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b620 The Legislature in 1977 created the Crime Victims Compensation Program (CVCP) \u201cto provide a method of compensating those persons within the state who are innocent victims of criminal acts...\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>53-9-102, MCA. The CVCP is statutorily authorized to \u201cdetermine all matters relating to claims for compensation,\u201d and the program is authorized to adopt rules to implement the compensation program. Section 53-9-104(l)(c), MCA; <em>see </em>Admin. R. M. 23.15.10, et seq . The Legislature defined CVCP as a victim \u201cto the extent that it has reimbursed a victim for pecuniary loss.\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(v), MCA. The CVCP is designed to reimburse crime victims timely and completely and, as explained by Matson, award benefits to victims based on CVCP\u2019s internal claims processing without requiring the victim to wait until the criminal defendant is sentenced. To that end, and in recognition of the CVCP\u2019s right of subrogation as a victim, the court may set as a condition of probation the payment to the State of \u201can amount equal to any benefits\u201d paid by the CVCP. Section 53-9-133(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b621 The Court\u2019s decision undermines the operation of these statutory provisions because it ignores that restitution here is being claimed by CVCP and not the actual victim of McClelland\u2019s assault. The statutory framework does not require that CVCP substantiate or document the loss sustained by the person to whom the CVCP awards benefits. If the Legislature had intended CVCP to substantiate its administrative decision to award benefits, the Legislature could have expressly stated as much. Instead, the Legislature gave the CVCP broad administrative authority to \u201cdetermine all matters relating to claims for compensation.\u201d Section 53-9-104(l)(c), MCA. In authorizing the program, the Legislature empowered CVCP to obtain reports and data pertaining to health care information and confidential criminal justice information. Section 53-9-104(2)(a), (b), MCA. CVCP has the authority to subpoena witnesses and other prospective evidence, administer oaths or affirmations, and to conduct hearings and receive evidence. Section 53-9-104(2)(c), MCA. These statutory provisions do not require the CVCP to justify its administrative decision in awarding benefits to a crime victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b622 CVCP awarded the victim $845.24 for mental health counseling and submitted an affidavit \u201cthat specifically describe[d] [CVCP\u2019s] loss and the replacement value in dollars of the loss...\u201d as required by \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA. It is undisputed that CVCP is a victim and there was no further requirement for CVCP to submit additional documentation of its loss. <em>State v. Aragon, </em>2014 MT 89, \u00b6 12, 374 Mont. 391, 321 P.3d 841. We have explained that a defendant has a due process right to \u201cexplain, argue, and rebut any information\u201d presented at sentencing, <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 65, 339 Mont. 489, 171 P.3d 694, but a court does not err in relying upon testimony and evidence presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>by the victim when a defendant fails to present any evidence, as here, which rebuts the victim\u2019s testimony as to pecuniary loss. <em>State v. Dodson, </em>2011 MT 302, \u00b6 14, 363 Mont. 63, 265 P.3d 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b623 The State produced testimony explaining the CVCP\u2019s process for determining victim eligibility and the amount of compensation. The internal administrative process for evaluating a claim tracks the statutory provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 53-9-125 through -128, MCA. Consistent with its authority to \u201cprescribe forms for applications for compensation,\u201d the CVCP generated the mental health treatment plan form to assist in evaluating a victim\u2019s claim. Section 53-9-104(l)(b), MCA. Matson testified that, in addition to having the provider indicate diagnostic codes and a diagnosis, the provider must indicate on the form the duration of counseling, whether the counseling is directly related to the crime, and any previous history of trauma. Thus, the mental health treatment plan form, as the name suggests, clearly contained confidential information pertaining to the victim which McClelland was not entitled to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b624 The Court\u2019s analysis regarding in camera review of the mental health treatment plan form is therefore misplaced and contravenes clear statutory provisions setting forth the procedure for disclosure of records of the CVCP. Section 53-9-107(3)(a), MCA, specifically exempts from public disclosure records of the office that contain \u201cinformation of a personal nature, such as personal, medical, or similar information,\u201d unless there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the public interest requires disclosure in the particular instance. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he party seeking disclosure has the burden of showing that public disclosure would not constitute an unreasonable invasion of privacy.\u201d Section 53-9-107(3)(b), MCA, similarly provides that a criminal defendant may not examine CVCP records containing a victim\u2019s medical information which are prohibited from disclosure by federal law and regulations. The Justice Court indicated that pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d, et seq., where there is no waiver from the victim, prohibited disclosure of the contents of the mental health treatment plan form to McClelland. McClelland presented no evidence or even argument demonstrating a compelling interest for disclosure. In my opinion, the Justice Court got it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b625 Accordingly, the Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[McClelland] does not explain how the fact of prior domestic violence contradicted the counselor\u2019s conclusion about the victim\u2019s current treatment, and he did not produce any evidence to support this speculation,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12, is in direct contravention with the above statutory provisions requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>that a criminal defendant bear the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that disclosure of CVCP records is necessary to protect a compelling interest. The Justice Court explained to defense counsel that she was not relying on any information contained in the form other than the amount of counseling attributable to McClelland\u2019s actions. Matson and Eslick had already explained, without objection from McClelland, that services provided to the victim were 100% related to the incident with McClelland. In consideration of this record, McClelland has failed to present <em>any </em>evidence which would warrant further inquiry from the court such as an in camera review.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b626 As a final note, I feel compelled to address the underlying premise that has been set forth by McClelland, that is: if you are unfortunate enough to have a history of domestic violence the confidentiality of your health care information is somehow less worthy of protection than those without such a history. Absent nothing more than a fishing expedition on the part of McClelland\u2019s trial counsel and with no evidence produced that even suggested relevance of the victim\u2019s prior history, we have ordered an in camera review. The bald assertion from McClelland that testimony about a history of domestic violence \u201ctended to show that the counseling the victim received bore some relationship to that prior incident and, thus, was not solely related to\u201d McClelland\u2019s offense has no support in the record. Furthermore, a claim that Dr. Lindner \u201ccontradicted herself on the disputed fact\u201d when she indicated the victim\u2019s counseling was 100% attributable is reckless and akin to suggesting that Dr. Lindner made \u201ca false claim or a false statement ...in connection with any claim [and] is guilty of theft... .\u201d Section 53-9-111, MCA. I cannotjoininthis Court\u2019s condoning such arguments from counsel on this record. I believe our remand for an in camera review legitimizes an inappropriate and unsubstantiated conclusion regarding victims of domestic violence. Had defense counsel put any effort at all into proving the relevance of the victim\u2019s prior victimization, rather than conduct a fishing expedition of the state\u2019s witnesses, resolution of this matter may have been entirely different. Defense counsel did not, and I would affirm the Justice Court, as did the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b627 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to do otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
