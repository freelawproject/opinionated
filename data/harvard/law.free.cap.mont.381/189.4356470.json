Its sole director, Ken Hagman, incorporated Forquest Ventures in October2005. Hagman and his wife, Allison Hagman, were Forquest Ventures\u2019 principal investors and shareholders and its only corporate officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b64 In forming Forquest Ventures, Hagman, who had no commercial mining experience or expertise, relied in part on his brother-in-law Ronnie Miller\u2019s representations regarding the El Dorado Bar site. Miller, in turn, relied on purported assay reports of the site allegedly performed by Advanced Analytical. The assay reports purported to show high levels of precious metal content at the site. Hagman also reviewed Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays and other information provided by Miller about the El Dorado Bar site before forming Forquest Ventures. Forquest never completed any professional mining feasibility assessment of the El Dorado Bar site before soliciting investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b65 Following incorporation, Forquest sold or issued stock to at least 36 shareholders, including Investors. Most of the shareholders, including Investors, are relatives or family friends of Miller and Hagman. In making their initial investments, Investors ultimately relied on Forquest\u2019s representations that the mine likely would be highly profitable. Forquest based these representations on the purported Advanced Analytical assays. Prior to the mine\u2019s start-up and throughout its operation, Forquest repeatedly made representations to Investors about the mine\u2019s profit potential and continued to solicit capital from Investors. In total, Forquest received over $600,000 from Investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b66 Although Forquest acknowledged start-up and operational problems at the mine to Investors, Forquest\u2019s optimistic representations about the venture\u2019s ultimate profitability continued until late August 2007. In September 2007, Forquest received independent, third-party assay results showing very little precious metal content at the El Dorado Bar site. Forquest did not inform Investors about the third-party assay results until October 19, 2007. In that communication, Forquest told Investors that \u201creality and truth have finally been set in front of us\u201d and also informed Investors that Forquest Ventures had ceased mining operations. Ultimately, Forquest Ventures realized no profits and Investors received no return on their investments. The Hagmans, who owned approximately 31 percent of Forquest Ventures\u2019 stock, also received no return on their investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u00b67 On October 14,2009, Emilio and Candice Garza, individually and on behalf of all similarly situated Forquest Ventures investors, brought claims against Forquest for compensatory and punitive damages based on alleged violations of the Montana Securities Act, \u00a7\u00a7 30-10-301(1) and -307(1), (2), MCA; breach of fiduciary duty; violations of the Montana Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7 30-14-103, MCA; negligent misrepresentation; and constructive fraud. On October 1, 2010, the Garzas filed an amended complaint adding the other Investors as named plaintiffs. Forquest filed a counterclaim against Investors and a third-party complaint against Miller and Advanced Analytical. The third-party complaint alleged negligence against Miller and Advanced Analytical and sought contribution and indemnity from both.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b68 Advanced Analytical responded by filing an unsupported motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim that the District Court denied. Under new counsel, Advanced Analytical then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and alternatively, for summary judgment on the ground that Forquest\u2019s claims were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b69 Investors moved for summary judgment on their Montana Securities Act claims and Forquest filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the ground that the claims were statutorily time-barred. The District Court heard argument on all pending motions in June 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b610 In June 2013, the District Court issued a thorough 194-page order granting summary judgment to Investors, denying Forquest\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and granting Advanced Analytical\u2019s motion to dismiss. After resolving subsequent motions, the District Court entered an amended and final judgment in September 2014. The District Court concluded the following: \u201cMisrepresentation\u201d under \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA, is not a matter of strict liability but requires a showing of failure to use reasonable care regarding the truth or accuracy of statements made in the offer or sale of a security; Forquest offered and sold securities to Investors by means of \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA; Allison Hagman was not personally liable to Investors; Investors timely asserted their claims under \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA; the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims relate back to the original complaint\u2019s filing date; and the court did not have personal jurisdiction over Advanced Analytical. Advanced Analytical is unrepresented on appeal. Forquest appeals several of the District Court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b611 We review an entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Albert v. City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. <em>56(c)(3); Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. If this burden is met, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence \u2014 as opposed to mere denied, speculation, or conclusory assertions \u2014 that a genuine issue of material fact does exist or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 330, 170 P.3d 474. \u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo. <em>Milky Whey, Inc. v. Dairy Partners, LLC, </em>2015 MT 18, \u00b6 7, 378 Mont. 75, 342 P.3d 13. We construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Milky Whey, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether the District Court correctly determined that Investors timely asserted their claims under the Montana Securities Act, \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b614 A person claiming fraud or misrepresentation under the Montana Securities Act must file suit \u201cwithin 2 years after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which the liability is founded or after the discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Section 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA. The Montana Securities Act is partly modeled after federal securities law and this Court has applied federal case law to interpret Montana\u2019s securities statutes. <em>State v. Himes, </em>2015 MT 91, \u00b6 34, 378 Mont. 419, 345 P.3d 297. Federal courts interpret the federal securities limitations statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1), in the same manner as \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA, is written. <em>Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, </em>559 U.S. 633, 648, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 1796 (2010) (holding that \u201cdiscovery\u201d as used in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1) \u201cencompasses not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b615 The District Court granted summary judgment to Investors on the ground that Investors\u2019 fraud and misrepresentation claims did not accrue prior to receiving Forquest\u2019s October 19, 2007 correspondence informing Investors that Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays were inaccurate and mining operations had ceased. Therefore, the court ruled that Investors timely filed their complaint on October 14, 2009, pursuant to \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court relied in part on federal decisions construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1), including <em>Merck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\u00b616 On appeal, Forquest first argues that unless the limitations statute was tolled, Investors\u2019 claims are time-barred because the last securities sale occurred on February 27,2007. Investors therefore could not have been harmed by any misrepresentation in a securities sale after that date. In addition, Forquest relies on \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, and case law construing it, to argue that the limitations statute was not tolled because the facts underlying Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations were publicly available to Investors and therefore not self-concealing. Forquest relies on federal case law, including <em>Merck, </em>to further assert that Investors\u2019 knowledge of the mine\u2019s operational problems, the failure to recover precious metals from the mine, and resulting lack of return on investment constituted \u201cstorm warnings\u201d of Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations. Forquest claims these \u201cstorm warnings\u201d would have led a reasonably diligent investor to investigate further. Consequently, Forquest contends, Investors should have discovered Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations more than two years before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"As8\">\u00b617  Forquest\u2019s argument that Investors\u2019 claims are time-barred because the last securities sale occurred on February 27, 2007, is unpersuasive. Under \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA, the limitations period does not commence when a security is sold by fraud or misrepresentation; it commences when the fraud or misrepresentation is discovered, \u201cor after the discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d The date of the last securities sale therefore does not affect the statute of limitations under \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b618 Forquest\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, also is unpersuasive. Section 27-2-102(3), MCA, is a general statute relating to the time within which an action must be commenced. Its language differs from that in \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA. The general limitations statute, \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, does not control Montana Securities Act claims governed by the limitations statute specific to such claims, \u00a7 30-10-307(5), MCA. <em>Mosley v. American Express Financial Advisors, </em>2010 MT 78, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 356 Mont. 27, 230 P.3d 479. Accordingly, Forquest\u2019s reliance on <em>Thieltges v. Royal Alliance Associates, Inc., </em>2014 MT 247, 376 Mont. 319, 334 P.3d 382, is misplaced. <em>Thieltges </em>involved a general tort action, and it was undisputed that the general statute governing tort actions applied. <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b619 In <em>Thieltges, </em>we addressed whether the facts constituting investors\u2019 claims against a brokerage firm were concealed or self-concealing. <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 13. The investors in <em>Thieltges </em>failed to learn that the certified public accountant handling their investments was a registered securities salesperson with the brokerage firm until they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>deposed him after the \u00a7 27-2-204(1), MCA, limitations period ran. Thieltges, \u00b6 8. In concluding that the investors\u2019 lack of knowledge about their claims against the brokerage firm did not toll the limitations period, we first affirmed the general rule that \u201ca claim accrues and the limitation period begins to run when all elements of the claim exist or have occurred.\u201d <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 15. We determined that investors\u2019 claims accrued when they \u201cbecame aware of their injuries\u201d after being informed that they would not receive returns on their investments. <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 19. Finally, we concluded that the limitations period was not tolled because the facts constituting investors\u2019 claims against the brokerage firm \u201cwere neither concealed nor self-concealing.\u201d <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 19. In making this determination, we relied in part on the fact that investors \u201ccould readily have discovered through public records\u201d that the accountant was a registered securities salesperson with the brokerage firm. <em>Thieltges, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b620  Here, similar to <em>Thieltges, </em>Investors\u2019 claims did not accrue until they became aware of their injuries. Investors did not become aware of their injuries until they were informed that Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays were inaccurate and they would not receive any return on their investment because Forquest ceased mining operations. Even if \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, applied to Investors\u2019 claims, Forquest\u2019s reliance on <em>Thieltges </em>in arguing that Investors had a duty to search public records about the El Dorado Bar site\u2019s mining history and Advanced Analytical\u2019s reputation is unpersuasive. Unlike the publicly available information in <em>Thieltges, </em>which securities laws require be made available to the public,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the \u201cpublicly available\u201d information Forquest contends Investors had a duty to investigate is not easily searchable or readily available. Moreover, the information Forquest contends was \u201cpublicly available\u201d to Investors likewise was available to Forquest prior to beginning mining operations and solicitinginvestment. The Montana Securities Act imposes duties upon sellers and offerors of securities, not investors, regarding the truth and accuracy of representations made during the sale of a security. Section 30-10-301(1), MCA. The facts regarding accuracy of Forquest\u2019s representations were not the type of \u201cpublicly available\u201d information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>at issue in <em>Thieltges.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b621 Finally, Forquest misinterprets federal case law construing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1) in asserting that Investors should have discovered Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations more than two years before filing suit based on \u201cstorm warnings\u201d of the mine\u2019s ultimate failure. The United States Supreme Court examined 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1) for the first time in <em>Merck. Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 637, 130 S. Ct. at 1789. In <em>Merck, </em>respondent investors argued that they suffered economic losses due to the drug company\u2019s knowing misrepresentations about one of its products. <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 637-38, 130 S. Ct. at 1790. The drug company argued that the investors\u2019 claims were untimely because the investors had \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of the facts underlying their claims and therefore they knew or should have known of the misrepresentations more than two years before filing the complaint. <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 638, 130 S. Ct. at 1790.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b622 In addressing the drug company\u2019s arguments, the Court emphasized that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1), the \u201climitations period does not begin to run until \u2018discovery of the <em>facts constituting the violation.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 648, 130 S. Ct. at 1796 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1)) (emphasis in original). The Corut then specified that although \u201cinquiry notice\u201d could be \u201cthe point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have discovered ... \u2018facts constituting the violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 651, 130 S. Ct. at 1797. Thus, the Court concluded that the limitations period does not automatically begin upon \u201cthe \u2018discovery\u2019 of facts that put a plaintiff on \u2018inquiry notice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 653, 130 S. Ct. at 1798. In rejecting the \u201cinquiry notice\u201d standard, the Court further specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">In determining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d of [the facts constituting the violation] occurred, terms such as \u2018inquiry notice\u2019 and \u2018storm warnings\u2019 may be useful to the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. <em>But the limitations period does not begin to run until </em>the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered \u2018the facts constituting the violation,\u2019... irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\"><em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 653, 130 S. Ct. at 1798 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b623 Similar to the limitations period addressed in <em>Merck, </em>the limitations period prescribed in \u00a7 30-10-307(5)(b), MCA, does not begin to run until discoveiy of, or after a reasonably diligent plaintiff should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>have discovered, \u201cthe fraud or misrepresentation on which the liability is founded.\u201d Investors may have \u201cdiscovered\u201d facts concerning problems with the mining venture, but contrary to Forquest\u2019s argument, that does not automatically mark \u201cthe point at which [Investors] would already have discovered\u201d Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations. <em>Merck, </em>559 U.S. at 651, 130 S. Ct. at 1797.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b624 Forquest has not met its burden of estabhshing specific facts, as opposed to speculation or conjecture, showing how and when a reasonably diligent investor should have discovered Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations prior to October 19, 2007. Advanced Analytical\u2019s assays of the El Dorado Bar site purportedly showing \u2014 as Forquest represents in its brief\u2014 \u201cthat the mine would be one of the richest in the world\u201d led to Forquest Ventures\u2019 formation. Forquest, in turn, relied on the purported assays in making representations to Investors. These representations included claims that the mine held \u201cwell over one billion dollars of precious metals and stones,\u201d and led Forquest to project a \u201cconservative\u201d annual investment return rate of \u201c200%.\u201d Such representations are the representations on which Forquest\u2019s liability is founded. Investors reasonably could not have discovered that Forquest\u2019s representations were false or misleading until Investors knew that the purported assays of the El Dorado Bar site were inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b625 Forquest\u2019s argument that Investors had a duty to discover the inaccuracy of the purported assays based on the multiple issues surrounding the mine\u2019s operation is unpersuasive considering that Forquest did not discover the purported assays\u2019 inaccuracies until receiving the results of an independent, third-party assay in September 2007. Forquest waited to communicate this information to Investors until October 19, 2007. Forquest does not explain why reasonable diligence would demand that individual Investors obtain their own independent third-party assay in the face of Forquest\u2019s representations. It speculates that Investors could have discovered, but does not justify why they should have discovered, the misrepresentations before October 19,2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b626  Investors\u2019 claims did not accrue until October 19, 2007, and thus, Investors timely filed their complaint under \u00a7 30-10-207(5)(b), MCA. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Investors on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court correctly determined that the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims relate back to the original complaint\u2019s filing date.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u00b628 M. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B) provides that amendments to pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>relate back to the original pleading when the \u201camendment asserts a claim ... that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out... in the original pleading.\u201d In analyzing whether the claim of a new party plaintiff arises out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the original plaintiffs pleading, we look to whether there is a \u201cclear identity of interest\u201d between the original plaintiff and the newly-added plaintiff. <em>Tynes v. Bankers Life Co., </em>224 Mont. 350, 358, 730 P.2d 1115, 1121 (1986). The policies underlying statutes of limitation also should be considered when determining whether an amendment relates back. <em>Tynes, </em>224 Mont. at 358, 730 P.2d at 1120 (concluding that the purpose of the statute of limitations is to provide a defendant with adequate notice of the claim against it, give a defendant the opportunity to adequately defend, ensure fairness, and prevent undue prejudice to the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b629 In granting summary judgment to Investors, the District Court concluded that the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims related back to the original complaint because the claims arose out of the same continuing conduct, occurrence, and transactions \u2014 namely, Forquest\u2019s securities sales to Investors. On appeal, Forquest asserts that the District Court erred in its determination because Investors became involved in Forquest Ventures under different circumstances so there was no identity of interest among Investors. Forquest relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Walstad v. Northwest Bank of Great Falls, </em>240 Mont. 322, 783 P.2d 1325 (1989), to argue that the conduct asserted in the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims is not identical to the conduct asserted in the original complaint. Forquest therefore contends that the claims in the amended complaint do not relate back to the original complaint and the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims are barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b630 As the District Court noted, <em>Walstad </em>is not applicable to the facts of this case. In <em>Walstad, </em>we held that the claims in the amended complaint did not relate back to the claims in the original complaint due to the dissimilar nature of the collateral transactions at issue. <em>Walstad, </em>240 Mont. at 326, 783 P.2d at 1327-28. The alleged harm in the amended <em>Walstad </em>complaint arose from the defendants\u2019 loan to the party seeking to be added as a plaintiff whereas the alleged harm in the original complaint arose from the plaintiffs\u2019 guaranty of that loan. <em>Walstad, </em>240 Mont. at 326, 783 P.2d at 1327. We concluded that the parties therefore had no \u201cclear identity of interest.\u201d <em>Walstad, </em>240 Mont, at 326, 783 P.2d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u00b631 We agree with the District Court that the underlying transactions at issue \u2014 securities sales induced by common misrepresentations\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>distinguish this case from <em>Walstad. </em>We also agree that there is a clear identity of interest between Investors because, as the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">(1) The Garza and non-Garza [Investors] purchased of [sic] the same or similar securities in the same venture or corporate enterprise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">(2) [Forquest] sequentially offered and sold the same or similar securities to all of the [Investors] by means of the same or substantially similar negligently false and inaccurate representations of material fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">(3) the Garza [Investors] timely asserted their original claims individually in a representative capacity \u201con behalf of all others similarly situated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u00b632 Moreover, concluding that the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims relate back to the original complaint does not undermine the policies underlying the statute of limitations. Forquest had notice of the claims against it in the original complaint and had an adequate opportunity to defend those claims because the Garzas\u2019 original complaint asserted claims on behalf of all others similarly situated \u2014 which, as Forquest knew, was a relatively small pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u00b633 We conclude that the non-Garza Investors\u2019 claims arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in the original complaint and therefore relate back to the date of its filing. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Investors on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">\u00b634 <em>3. Whether the District Court correctly determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding Forquest\u2019s failure to use reasonable care in the sale of securities to Investors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\u00b635 After a detailed analysis, the District Court construed \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA, to require proof of failure to use reasonable care in offering or selling securities in order to establish misrepresentation. The parties do not challenge on appeal the District Court\u2019s construction of the statutory elements of a misrepresentation claim under \u00a7 30-10-307(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">\u00b636 The District Court further determined that Investors demonstrated the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding Forquest\u2019s failure to use reasonable care in the sale of securities. The District Court relied in part on the following facts in determining that, under the totality of the circumstances, Forquest failed to use reasonable care: Forquest affirmatively represented to Investors that the venture likely would be highly profitable; reasonably diligent analysis of the El Dorado Bar site would have revealed the site\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>unsuitability for profitable placer mining; and Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays were not reasonably reliable and accurate based in part on Forquest\u2019s sampling methodology and its erroneous assay interpretation, analysis, and projection.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b637 On appeal, Forquest argues that the District Court erred in determining that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding Forquest\u2019s exercise of reasonable care. At minimum, Forquest asserts, reasonableness is a question of fact for the jury. Forquest offers the following as evidence of its use of reasonable care: Hagman relied on an attorney when organizing Forquest Ventures; Forquest told investors that there was risk associated with investing in the mining operation; and Forquest relied on Advanced Analytical to analyze samples and provide consulting services. Forquest further asserts that if this Court holds under Issue 1 that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would not have a duty to investigate Forquest\u2019s representations based on the issues surrounding the mining venture, then there must be questions of fact regarding whether Forquest used reasonable care in relying on Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays.</p>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">\u00b638 Although breach of a duty to exercise reasonable care is generally a question of fact, <em>Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>1999 MT 193, \u00b6 40, 295 Mont. 363, 983 P.2d 972, such questions may be determined as a matter of law \u201cwhen reasonable minds cannot differ,\u201d <em>Wiley v. City of Glendive, </em>272 Mont. 213, 216, 900 P.2d 310, 312 (1995). Forquest has not met its burden of establishing by substantial evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding Forquest\u2019s failure to use reasonable care. In fact, Forquest\u2019s arguments under Issue 1 belie its argument here. Forquest argues that Investors were not reasonably diligent in discovering Forquest\u2019s misrepresentations because \u201cForquest was forecasting sunshine despite the fact that it was obviously raining.\u201d Reasonable minds cannot differ that forecasting sunshine despite the fact that it was obviously raining constitutes a failure to use reasonable care. In selling securities to Investors, Forquest was the \u201cweatherman\u201d on whom Investors relied in making their investments.</p>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">\u00b639 Forquest\u2019s proffered evidence of reasonable care does not rise above the level of mere denial, speculation, or conclusory assertions. By asserting that he relied on an attorney in organizing Forquest Ventures, Hagman, who had no mining experience or expertise, does not demonstrate his exercise of reasonable care in representing to Investors the mine\u2019s high profit potential. Forquest\u2019s assertion that it told Investors that there was risk associated with the mining operation does not rise to the level of substantial evidence of reasonable care considering that those same communications also contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>representations and assurances that the venture likely would be highly profitable. Finally, the reasonableness of Forquest\u2019s reliance on Advanced Analytical\u2019s expertise and purported assays is defeated by its own argument that Investors failed to exercise reasonable diligence by not investigating the accuracy of Advanced Analytical\u2019s purported assays.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b640 Contrary to Forquest\u2019s argument, our holding on Issue 1 does not undermine this conclusion. One of the fundamental purposes of the Montana Securities Act is to protect investors. Section 30-10-102(1), MCA. The Act does so by imposing duties upon sellers and offerors of securities. <em>E.g. </em>\u00a7 30-10-301(l)(b), MCA (\u201cIt is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of any security ... to ... make any untrue statement of a material fact....\u201d). Under the District Court\u2019s formulation of the statutory elements, one of the duties imposed upon sellers of securities in order to protect investors is the use of reasonable care. As discussed above, an investor is not held to the same duty to discover the fraud or misrepresentation upon which liability is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b641  Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court correctly determined that Forquest established no genuine issues of material fact demonstrating its exercise of reasonable care in the sale of securities to Investors. The District Court therefore properly concluded that Investors were entitled to summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b642 <em>4. Whether the District Court correctly dismissed Advanced Analytical for lack of personal jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b643 M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) provides that a party may raise a lack of personal jurisdiction defense by motion at its option. A party also may waive a personal jurisdiction defense and consent to a court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>El Dorado Heights Homeowners\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Dewitt, </em>2008 MT 199, \u00b6 16, 344 Mont. 77, 186 P.3d 1249. Rule 12(h)(1) states that a party waives the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by \u201comitting it from a motion in the circumstances described in Rule 12(g)(2); or ... [by] failing to either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">(i) make it by motion under this rule; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">(ii) include it in a responsive pleading ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Rule 12(g)(2) prohibits a party that makes any Rule 12 motion from making \u201canother motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\u201d Under these rules, a party waives a personal jurisdiction defense by failing to raise it in the party\u2019s initial response. <em>El Dorado Heights, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\u00b644 The District Court concluded that Advanced Analytical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u201cprocedurally, albeit unintentionally,\u201d waived its personal jurisdiction defense by filing, through former counsel, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion before filing a Rule 12(b)(2) motion with new counsel. The court reasoned, however, that dismissal based solely on such an \u201cunintentional procedural waiver\u201d does not comport with due process requirements and, without citing authority, concluded that personal jurisdiction can be waived only if done so \u201cknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.\u201d Proceeding to examine the merits of Advanced Analytical\u2019s personal jurisdiction defense, the court dismissed Advanced Analytical for lack of personal jurisdiction under Montana\u2019s long-arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b645 On appeal, Forquest relies on <em>Prentice Lumber Co. v. Spahn, </em>156 Mont. 68, 474 P.2d 141 (1970), and <em>In re Marriage of Smith, </em>2008 MT 461, 348 Mont. 174, 199 P.3d 824, to argue that Advanced Analytical waived its jurisdictional defense by filing an initial Rule 12(b) motion without raising personal jurisdiction. Forquest further argues that waiver of a personal jurisdiction defense does not violate due process, citing <em>Insurance </em>Corp. <em>of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, </em>456 U.S. 694, 102 S. Ct. 2099 (1982) (hereinafter <em>Ireland).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b646 Investors argue that the District Court correctly determined that Advanced Analytical could not waive unintentionally its personal jurisdiction defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Investors, however, lack standing to make this argument. <em>Jones v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2007 MT 82, \u00b6 50, 337 Mont. 1, 155 P.3d 1247 (concluding a party lacks standing to \u201cassert the constitutional rights of others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b647 In <em>Ireland, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court began its discussion of personal jurisdiction by noting that \u201cpersonal jurisdiction flows... from the Due Process Clause,\u201d and therefore \u201cprotects an individual liberty interest.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 702, 102 S. Ct. at 2104. As an individual liberty interest, personal jurisdiction may, \u201clike other such rights, be waived.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 703, 102 S. Ct. at 2105. The Court went on to note that personal jurisdiction may be waived intentionally, \u201cor for various reasons a defendant may be estopped from raising the <em>issue.\u201dIreland, </em>456 U.S. at 704, 102 S. Ct. at 2105. Moreover, a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>actions \u201cmay amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether voluntary or not.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 704-05, 102 S. Ct. at 2105. As the Court explained, \u201cThe expression of legal rights is often subject to certain procedural rules: The failure to follow those rules may well result in a curtailment of the rights. Thus, the failure to enter a timely objection to personal jurisdiction constitutes, under Rule 12(h)(1), a waiver of the objection.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 705, 102 S. Ct. at 2105.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b648 M. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1) is in relevant part identical to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1). In <em>Milanovich v. Schnibben, </em>2007 MT 128, 337 Mont. 334, 160 P.3d 562, we cited <em>Ireland </em>in stating, \u201cPersonal jurisdiction, as an individual right, can be waived by express or implied consent.\u201d <em>Milanovich, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 703, 102 S. Ct. at 2105). The procedural curtailment of the substantive right of personal jurisdiction pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12 does not implicate due process concerns. <em>See Ireland, </em>456 U.S. at 704-05, 102 S. Ct. at 2105. Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent makes clear that a party waives a personal jurisdiction defense by failing to enter a timely objection as prescribed by M. R. Civ. P. 12. <em>El Dorado Heights, </em>\u00b6 16 (concluding that by not raising the defense of personal jurisdiction in their first response, defendant consents to a court\u2019s jurisdiction and waives the defense); <em>Smith, </em>\u00b6 18 (holding that a defendant waives a personal jurisdiction defense by indicating that he anticipates to challenge personal jurisdiction and then failing to file such a motion or supporting brief within the time frame established by the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b649 In <em>Milky Whey, </em>we analyzed waiver of personal jurisdiction under M. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1)(B)(ii). <em>Milky Whey, </em>\u00b6 15. We held that the defendant did not waive its personal jurisdiction defense by failing to raise the issue in its initial notice of appearance when it raised the issue by motion two weeks later, prior to filing its answer to the complaint. We reasoned that a notice of appearance is not a responsive pleading within the meaning of Rule 12(h)(l)(B)(ii). <em>Milky Whey, </em>\u00b6 16. This case, in contrast, involves the filing of a Rule 12(b) motion that failed to raise lack of personal jurisdiction. Under Rule 12(g)(2), Advanced Analytical was required to join its Rule 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) motions in the same fifing. By omitting the personal jurisdiction issue from the motion to dismiss, Advanced Analytical came squarely within the prohibition of Rule 12(h)(1)(A) and therefore waived the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"AKq\">\u00b650  We hold that Advanced Analytical\u2019s waiver does not implicate due process concerns.
