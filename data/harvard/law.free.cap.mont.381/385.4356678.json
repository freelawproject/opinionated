Joseph V. Womack was appointed Trustee of the case. Golz is 40 years old. He is employed by Simms Fishing Products as a Customer Care representative. Golz is married; his spouse did not file bankruptcy with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b65 Item number 12 on Golz\u2019s Schedule B (fist of personal property) is a \u201cMorganStanley [sic] IRA. Acct. #319-116461-409\u201d valued at $6,905.65. Golz inherited the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) from his mother upon her death. Womack requested and received information from Golz regarding the IRA and learned that it was an inherited traditional IRA as set forth on the Morgan Stanley Client Statement. Golz claimed the inherited IRA as exempt property from the bankruptcy estate. Womack objected to Golz\u2019s claim of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"AuT\">\u00b66 Golz has made no personal contributions to the inherited IRA, and he cannot invest additional money in the account. Golz is required to withdraw money from the inherited IRA account no matter how far he is from retirement. Golz may withdraw the entire balance of the account at any time and use it for any purpose without penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b67 <em>Whether, under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, a debtor may claim an exemption in an inherited Individual Retirement Account pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b68 When a debtor files for bankruptcy, an estate is created consisting of all legal and equitable property interests of the debtor as of the date of filing. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a) (2012). A debtor is allowed to exempt certain property from the bankruptcy estate. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541(a)(1), 522 (2012). Property that may be exempt from the bankruptcy estate is set forth at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d). States may opt out of the federal exemption statutes pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2). Montana has opted out of the federal exemptions. Section 31-2-106, MCA; <em>In re Archer, </em>2006 MT 82, \u00b6 7, 332 Mont. 1, 136 P.3d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b69 Property that may be exempted in a bankruptcy proceeding in Montana includes property described in Title 25, chapter 13, part 6, of the Montana Code Annotated. Section 31-2-106(1), MCA. Relevant to the certified question before us, \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA, provides that debtors may claim exemptions, without limitation, in \u201cindividual retirement accounts, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 408(a), to the extent of deductible contributions made before the suit resulting in judgment was filed and the earnings on those contributions ...\u201d The Internal Revenue Code defines \u201cindividual retirement account\u201d as \u201ca trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>created or organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his beneficiaries ....\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b610 The U.S. Supreme Court has defined an inherited IRA as \u201ca traditional or Roth IRA that has been inherited after its owner\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Clark v. </em>Rameker, _U.S._,_, 134 S. Ct. 2242, 2245 (2014) (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(d)(3)(C)(ii), 408A(a) (2012)). \u201cWhen anyone other than the owner\u2019s spouse inherits the IRA, he or she may not roll over the funds; the only option is to hold the IRA as an inherited account.\u201d Clark, _U.S. at_, 134 S. Ct. at 2245.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b611 The Montana Constitution expressly states: \u201cThe legislature shall enact liberal homestead and exemption laws.\u201d Mont. Const, art. XIII, \u00a7 5. Montana courts give liberal construction to exemption laws. <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 15. However, the liberal construction of a law cannot disregard the plain language of the statute. <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b612 Golz argues that, because Montana\u2019s exemption laws are to be interpreted liberally, an inherited IRA should be exempt like other IRAs under \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA. However, in <em>Clark, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court held that inherited IRAs are not retirement funds exempt from a bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C), and the Court distinguished traditional and Roth IRAs defined in 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(a) and 408A, from inherited IRAs. Clark,_U.S. at_, 134 S. Ct. at 2244-45. In drawing the distinction, the Court noted that the holder of an inherited IRA may never invest money in the account under 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 219(d)(4) (2012); funds must be withdrawn no matter how close the holder is to retirement under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a)(9)(B), 408(a)(6) (2012); and the entire balance of the account may be withdrawn at any time without penaltyunder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 72(t)(2)(A)(ii) (2012). Clark,_U.S. at_, 134 S. Ct. at 2247.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">\u00b613 The Montana Legislature also distinguished traditional and Roth IRAs from inherited IRAs. In \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA, the Legislature exempted IRAs \u201cas defined in 26 U.S.C. 408(a)\u201d and Roth IRAs \u201cas defined in 26 U.S.C. 408A.\u201d The Legislature did not exempt IRAs defined in other subsections of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408. In <em>Clark, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court distinguished traditional and Roth IRAs defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(a) and 408A, from inherited IRAs. Inherited IRAs are not defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a) or \u00a7 408A. Rather, inherited IRAs are financial accounts with distinct legal characteristics addressed in other sections of Title 26, as outlined above. \u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Under the plain language of \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA, inherited IRAs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>are not exempt from the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b614  Our answer to the certified question is: No, under Montana law, a debtor may not claim an exemption in an inherited IRA pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(e), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE MCGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, MCKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
