Following a jury award of $3,665, O\u2019Connor moved for a mistrial and for a new trial. The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, denied her motions and she filed a timely appeal. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it denied O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion for a new trial based upon defense counsel\u2019s failure to disclose that some of George\u2019s photographic evidence depicted damage from another accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">\u00b63 On September 30, 2011, O\u2019Connor was stopped at a railroad crossing in Helena, Montana, when she was rear-ended by George. Both vehicles sustained minor damage, and State Farm, George\u2019s insurer, resolved O\u2019Connor\u2019s property damage claim; consequently, property damages are not at issue. O\u2019Connor alleges that in addition to property damage, however, she sustained serious physical injuries in the collision. George admitted liability for the incident, but disputed the extent of O\u2019Connor\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">\u00b64 In May 2013, O\u2019Connor sued George for personal injuries, seeking past and future medical bills, physical and emotional pain and suffering, loss of earning capacity, and loss of established course of life.</p>\n<p id=\"At\">\u00b65 State Farm investigated the incident and, at O\u2019Connor\u2019s request, provided her with various materials from the investigation, including approximately twelve photographs purportedly showing damage to the parties\u2019 vehicles resulting from the collision. O\u2019Connor was deposed in April 2014 and was shown the accident photographs for the first time. The photographs showed damage to the front of George\u2019s vehicle. O\u2019Connor did not conduct discovery with respect to the photographs. At her deposition, O\u2019Connor testified that George\u2019s vehicle was going between thirty and forty miles per hour when it struck her.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u00b66 In June 2014, O\u2019Connor filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude the damage photographs from being introduced at trial. O\u2019Connor anticipated that George would argue that because the pictures depicted relatively minor vehicle damage, O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim of injury was exaggerated. George opposed O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion and the District Court denied the motion, allowing the photographs to be introduced. The court agreed, however, to offer a cautionary jury instruction concerning the jury\u2019s use of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b67 The District Court conducted a three-day jury trial commencing on September 9,2014, nearly three years after the accident. Following voir dire but before opening statements, and outside of the jury\u2019s presence, the attorneys presented their exhibits to the court, including the photographs of the damage to George\u2019s vehicle. Both attorneys informed the court that the exhibits were stipulated. Once the jury was seated, O\u2019Connor called George as her first witness. When asked if the photographs accurately depicted the damage her vehicle suffered during the accident with O\u2019Connor, George testified that several of the photographs did not reflect damage sustained in her accident with O\u2019Connor, but rather reflected damage to her vehicle caused by another accident occurring one year later in which George, traveling at sixty miles an hour, hit a bird. O\u2019Connor\u2019s counsel expressed obvious surprise at George\u2019s response and shortly thereafter ceased questioning George. George\u2019s counsel declined to cross-examine his client at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b68 The following day, O\u2019Connor testified extensively on direct examination as to her injuries and treatment. On cross-examination, George\u2019s counsel questioned her further about her injuries and the extent of the damage to George\u2019s car. O\u2019Connor stated that George\u2019s car had scratches and cracks around the grille after the accident. George\u2019s counsel then showed O\u2019Connor two photographs of George\u2019s damaged vehicle and asked her if those photographs showed \u201cthe cracks [she was] talking about.\u201d O\u2019Connor replied that she believed the photos did. George\u2019s counsel then told the jury that \u201cWe\u2019ll have our client \u2014 she will testify shortly as to what all that means.\u201d Counsel did not inform O\u2019Connor that the photographs he had shown her were the photographs of the bird accident that occurred one year after O\u2019Connor\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b69 After O\u2019Connor rested her case and George began presenting her case-in-chief, O\u2019Connor\u2019s counsel cross-examined George about the \u2018bird accident\u201d photographs. George testified that she was insured by State Farm Insurance Company at the time she had the accident with O\u2019Connor and approximately one year later when she had the \u2018bird <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>accident.\u201d Both accidents were timely reported to the insurer. Subsequently, George discovered that her insurance company had conflated the two accidents, believing they constituted a single accident. She tried to resolve this error without success and ultimately changed insurers as a result of the unresolved mistake. She testified that she did not know that State Farm had provided the \u201cbird incident\u201d photographs to the attorneys in the O\u2019Connor case. When she discovered \u2014 on the Thursday before trial \u2014 that her attorney had the pictures showing the bird damage, she told her attorney that those pictures did not represent damages occurring in the accident with O\u2019Connor. Defense counsel did not tell O\u2019Connor about the mistake and did not withdraw the subject photographs as exhibits when he learned of the mistake. Instead, all the photos were introduced into evidence as stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b610 O\u2019Connor moved for a mistrial on the basis of surprise due to \u201cthe known misrepresentations concerning the photographs of the defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d O\u2019Connor argued that, as soon as George\u2019s counsel learned that the incorrect photographs had been submitted, he was obligated to disclose this to O\u2019Connor and the court. George opposed the motion, contending that O\u2019Connor\u2019s counsel would have discovered the bird incident had he conducted discovery with respect to the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b611 The court inquired of George\u2019s counsel why he would submit these photographs as exhibits if they did not reflect the damage sustained in the accident at issue in the trial. Counsel doggedly responded that he was obligated to submit all photographs, whether or not the damage was related to this accident. He said he didn\u2019t think the fact that the photographs reflected damage from another accident would be an issue, and maintained to the court that O\u2019Connor could have freely discovered this fact had she undertaken pretrial discovery. When the court asked whether counsel had an obligation to either withdraw the photos from the other accident or clarify what they represented, he responded that this is what discovery is for and that all of this information was accessible. He said that withdrawing the photos depicting damage from the other accident was not \u201csomething that even crossed [his] mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b612 The District Court denied O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion for a mistrial, though the court noted that it was \u201cconcerned over the fact that we have exhibits that have gone to this jury that are not relevant to the accident.\u201d The court gave the jury a cautionary instruction that, although the photographs maybe considered in conjunction with other evidence \u201cto determine the witnesses\u2019 credibility as to the speed of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>impact\u201d and \u201cin consideration of the extent\u201d of O\u2019Connor\u2019s injuries caused by the collision, \u201cinjuries may vary from the force of an impact and the damage to the vehicles is not conclusive of what injuries the plaintiff may have sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b613 At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of O\u2019Connor, awarding her $3,665 in total damages. This award was far less than the $17,236 in medical expenses for which O\u2019Connor sought recovery. It was also less than the award that George\u2019s counsel suggested might be reasonable during his closing argument. It is evident that the award included nothing for future medical expenses, physical and emotional pain and suffering, loss of earning capacity, or loss of established course of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b614 On September 17, 2014, O\u2019Connor filed a motion for a new trial and renewed her motion for a mistrial, arguing that she was prejudiced by George\u2019s failure to disclose that some of the damage depicted in the photographs was sustained in a later accident. O\u2019Connor argued that, had she known of the bird damage, she would have engaged an expert witness to testify about the damage to the vehicles from the parties\u2019 collision, and the potential for injury based upon those damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b615 On October 28,2014, the District Court issued an order denying O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion for a new trial. The court found it \u201cdisturbing\u201d that defense counsel did not disclose the bird damage, and noted that his actions \u201cmake this a much closer question that it would otherwise be.\u201d The court concluded, however, that O\u2019Connor did not show how the admission of photographs depicting bird damage affected her substantial rights or materially altered the outcome of the trial. The court observed that, though the jury\u2019s verdict may have been based in part on the photographs, it also was based on other testimony and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u00b616 O\u2019Connor appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motions,</p>\n<p id=\"AUa\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial or a M. R. Civ. P. 59 motion for a new trial for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Willing v. Quebedeaux, </em>2009 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 119, 204 P.3d 1248; <em>Kuhnke v.

Deiss, </em>2000 MT 169, \u00b6 19, 300 Mont. 312, 3 P.3d 1286 (citation omitted). A district court \u201chears the entire trial and is in the best position to determine the prejudicial effect of attorney misconduct on the jury,\u201d <em>Dees v. Am. Nat'l Fire Ins. </em>Co., 260 Mont. 431, 443, 861 P.2d 141, 148 (1993); <em>accord Kuhnke, </em>227 Mont. at 68, 740 P.2d at 628.

Ditzel, </em>255 Mont. 364, 376, 842 P.2d 707, 715 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion for a new trial based upon defense counsel\u2019s failure to disclose that some of George\u2019s photographic evidence depicted damage from another accident ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b619 Section 25-11-102, MCA, allows a district court to grant a motion for a new trial if the moving party\u2019s substantial rights are materially affected by (1) an irregularity in the proceedings which prevented either party from having a fair trial, or (2) surprise that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. O\u2019Connor contends that because defense counsel concealed the fact that the photographs depicted two different accidents, he was able to confuse the jury and make it appear that O\u2019Connor was not credible. She argues that this manipulation of the evidence constituted an irregularity in the proceedings that prejudiced her right to a fair trial. We agree with O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b620 In concluding that O\u2019Connor failed to show how the admission of the photographs of the bird damage affected her substantial rights or the outcome of the trial, the District Court failed to take into account the impact that the photograph evidence had on O\u2019Connor\u2019s credibility. Counsel showed O\u2019Connor one of the photographs depicting the bird damage, and asked her whether it reflected the cracks she had observed on George\u2019s vehicle after the accident, and she said yes. He then later elicited from George the explanation that the damage shown in that photograph was sustained in a different accident a year later. This orchestration of the photographic evidence was intended to and did impugn O\u2019Connor\u2019s credibility. Defense counsel then made the credibility of the witnesses the focus of his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b621 The District Court observed that the jury\u2019s verdict may have been based in part upon the photographs but it was also based upon other evidence, including the testimony of O\u2019Connor\u2019s medical care providers. This may well be true. However, while the jury was certainly free to infer from the medical evidence that O\u2019Connor exaggerated her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>injuries, it should have made such an assessment on the foundation of a fair proceeding. Because the photograph evidence made it appear that O\u2019Connor was lying about the damage to the George vehicle as a result of the accident, her credibility was compromised before the jury even took into account the evidence concerning the extent of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b622  In <em>Cooper v. Hanson, </em>2010 MT 113, 356 Mont. 309, 234 P.3d 59, we found that the district court manifestly abused its discretion when it denied the plaintiffs motion for a new trial. We reached this conclusion because of certain \u201cwell-placed\u201d comments made by defense counsel in closing arguments that exploited juror concerns about rendering a verdict against a physician and maximized the prejudicial effect on the jury. <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6 40. Quoting <em>Havens v. State, </em>285 Mont. 195, 945 P.2d 941 (1997), we observed that \u201cthere are certain instances in which the prejudicial matter at issue undermines the fairness to such a degree that a new trial is the only remedy.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6 42. This is such an instance. Defense counsel undermined the fairness of this trial to such a degree that a new trial is the only remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b623  Finally, we find disturbing the recurring contention that O\u2019Connor was at fault for not having taken George\u2019s deposition or propounded interrogatories about the damage shown in the photographs. Counsel told the jury in his closing argument that O\u2019Connor should have asked George about the photographs before trial but did not. In other words, counsel\u2019s argument amounted to: \u201cEven though we represented and stipulated that these photographs depicted the damage done during the parties\u2019 collision, it was O\u2019Connor\u2019s fault for not discovering that our representation was false.\u201d On appeal, George continues to blame O\u2019Connor for not conducting discovery regarding the photographs. This approach to litigation wholly undermines the goal of securing a \u201cjust, speedy, and inexpensive determination\u201d of an action (M. R. Civ. P. 1), especially in a case of admitted liability, as here. It was perfectly reasonable for O\u2019Connor to assume under these circumstances that she could forego the unnecessary expense of deposing the defendant or conducting discovery concerning the photographs of the defendant\u2019s damaged vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b624  We conclude that counsel\u2019s misi\u2019epresentation regarding the photographs constituted an irregularity in the proceeding and deprived O\u2019Connor of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b625 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion in failing to grant O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>for new trial. We reverse the jury\u2019s verdict and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-4\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b160-5\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b626 I share entirely the Court\u2019s assessment of defense counsel\u2019s conduct in this case. As the Court points out, however, this Court must find a manifest abuse of discretion in order to reverse the District Court. Opinion, \u00b6 17. Because the District Court was \u201cin the best position to determine the prejudicial effect of attorney misconduct on the jury,\u2019\u2019Dees, 260 Mont. at 443, 861 P.2d at 148, I would afford more deference to its decision not to grant O\u2019Connor a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b627 Although I agree with the Court that defense counsel\u2019s conduct constitutes \u201can irregularity in the proceeding\u201d on behalf of an adverse party, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief on that ground unless the irregularity deprived her of a fair trial. Section 25-11-102(1), MCA. Further, to obtain a new trial on the ground of surprise, O\u2019Connor must demonstrate not only that the facts causing the surprise had a material bearing on the case, but also that \u201cthe verdict or decision resulted mainly from these facts\u201d and that \u201cthe result of a new trial without the surprise would probably be different.\u201d <em>Clark v. Bell, </em>2009 MT 390, \u00b6 30, 353 Mont. 331, 220 P.3d 650 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b628 Based upon its review and recollection of the entire trial, the District Court concluded that the bird damage photographs \u201cdid not materially affect the [trial\u2019s] outcome.\u201d The court relied on all of the evidence, including notably that there was other testimony about the speed of George\u2019s vehicle and that the photographs were not a significant portion of the evidence pertaining to O\u2019Connor\u2019s injuries. \u00b629 George testified that the speed limit where the collision occurred was thirty miles per hour and that she normally drives twenty to twenty-five miles per hour on that route. George said that she saw O\u2019Connor\u2019s vehicle just before the collision, that she braked \u201cpretty hard\u201d before hitting O\u2019Connor, and that the collision felt \u201cvery light, like a little speed bump.\u201d George said that she did not feel any jolting motion and was not thrown forward in her seat. George also testified that none of her vehicle\u2019s air bags deployed and that her seatbelt never locked. O\u2019Connor likewise testified that none of her vehicle\u2019s air bags deployed. She further testified that she was not pushed into the car stopped immediately in front of her, and she did not remember whether her car moved at all due to the collision\u2019s impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b630 The jury also heard extensive testimony from O\u2019Connor\u2019s physicians regarding her history of chronic pain, predating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>collision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> O\u2019Connor testified that she did not have lower back pain until after the collision. However, defense counsel produced treatment notes from O\u2019Connor\u2019s chiropractor, Dr. Michael McClain, indicating that O\u2019Connor complained of lower back pain in the summer of 2008; from a pain specialist indicating that she had numbness and tingling in her heels in 2007; and from a massage therapist indicating that O\u2019Connor had pain radiating into her right hamstring and numbness and tingling in her lower legs in 2007. Dr. McClain\u2019s treatment notes showed that he treated O\u2019Connor for lower back pain more than twenty-five times in the summer of2008. His notes from each session with O\u2019Connor state, \u201cPatient presents today with neck pain, mid-back pain, and lower back pain.\u201d O\u2019Connor said she never told Dr. McClain that she had lower back pain, and she was unsure why she was treated for it. Defense counsel also questioned O\u2019Connor\u2019s doctors about her two workers\u2019 compensation claims \u2014 one in 1999 and one in 2004 \u2014 relating to neck injuries. She was still treating for the latter injury at the time of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b631 Dr. Lennard Wilson, who conducted an independent medical examination of O\u2019Connor, testified via video deposition that an examination of O\u2019Connor\u2019s medical records prior to the collision and her current complaints indicated a chronic degenerative medical condition dating back to 1999. Dr. Wilson advised that O\u2019Connor\u2019s chronic pain would be better managed through physical therapy than with the epidural injections she received earlier that year from her pain specialist, Dr. Steven Martini.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b632 Dr. Wilson also testified that, in his January 22, 2014 examination, he found no evidence of nerve damage or permanent injury to O\u2019Connor\u2019s lower back or to her right leg. Although Dr. Wilson surmised that O\u2019Connor likely had some whiplash and lumbar strain due to the collision, he found no evidence indicating that the collision caused major clinical worsening of her neck or back pain. A September 5, 2012 report by Dr. Charles Anderson, who conducted electromyography and motor nerve conduction tests on O\u2019Connor, likewise indicated no nerve damage. Although Dr. Martini diagnosed an annular tear in O\u2019Connor\u2019s lower back from his review of a June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>2012 MRI,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. Wilson and Dr. Philip Steele, O\u2019Connor\u2019s orthopedic doctor, examined the same MRI and found no nerve damage or other injury to O\u2019Connor\u2019s lower back.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b633 Given the totality of the evidence, particularly O\u2019Connor\u2019s history of chronic pain prior to the collision and the lack of concurrence by medical professionals on the cause of her pain, O\u2019Connor has not demonstrated that the verdict \u201cresulted mainly from\u201d the facts causing the surprise. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 30. Though both parties referred to the photographs depicting bird damage, each argued from the undisputed photographs about how much damage the accident caused. The District Court also gave an instruction cautioning the jury that minor damage to a vehicle does not necessarily mean that the occupant sustained minor injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b634 In <em>Cooper, </em>we examined the \u201ccumulative prejudice\u201d resulting from counsel\u2019s improper argument about a \u201cblack mark\u201d on the defendant doctor\u2019s reputation, combined with \u201canxieties expressed by the jurors\u201d during voir dire about the impacts on a physician of a malpractice judgment against him. <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-43. The expressed concerns by members of the venire (\u201cOne juror voiced his belief that a plaintiffs verdict would be tantamount to a life sentence,\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>\u00b6 38), taken together with counsel's appeal to passion and prejudice, rendered the trial unfair. Here, the District Court considered the cumulative record, having heard the voir dire, evidence, and argument both parties presented, and determined on balance that the trial was not unfair. Based upon the substantial conflicting evidence about O\u2019Connor\u2019s injuries, the District Court rejected her claim that it was the extra crack in the bumper depicted in the bird damage photographs that caused the jury to discredit her theory of the collision and award minimal damages for her claimed injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the record, and applying the considerable deference due a trial court under the \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion\u201d standard, I am unable to conclude that the court made an \u201cobvious, evident or unmistakable\u201d error in the exercise of its discretion. <em>McDermott, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b635 The District Court, having heard the entire trial, was in the best position to determine whether defense counsel\u2019s misconduct prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>O\u2019Connor\u2019s case. <em>Dees, </em>260 Mont. at 443, 861 P.2d at 148.
