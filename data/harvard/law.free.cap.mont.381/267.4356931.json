Since acquiring the property, Jones has prohibited public use of the two main roads transecting Boadle Ranch. Public Lands/Water Access Association (PLWA), a Montana non-profit membership organization dedicated to promoting access to public-owned lands, has consistently sought to regain access to these roads for public use. This is the fifth time the parties have been before us.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To date, PLWA has been successful in the courts but Jones has not yet removed the gates barricading entrance to the property. In this current case, Jones appeals the Ninth Judicial District Court\u2019s grant of supplementary relief to PLWA. PLWA cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of its motion for reasonable attorney fees and costs. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\u00b62 Restated, Jones\u2019s dispositive issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in awarding money damages as supplemental declaratory relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in failing to consider ownership of the railroad car bridge or its suitability as a bridge in fashioning relief, in violation of <em>PLWA </em>IV?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">\u00b65 PLWA\u2019s issue on cross-appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err by not awarding PLWA reasonable attorney fees and costs, in addition to the amount necessary to rebuild the bridge?</p>\n<p id=\"b294-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b294-16\">\u00b67 Boadle Ranch is an approximately 4,900 acre parcel in Teton County, Montana. Two roads transect Boadle Ranch \u2014 Boadle Road and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Canal Road. Boadle Road enters Boadle Ranch at the east boundary of the property and travels west where historically it crossed the Sun River Slope Canal (Slope Canal) via Boadle Bridge and intersected with Canal Road. Canal Road runs northwest to Pishkun Reservoir and southeast through the property and onto neighboring land. These roads have been used by the public since the early 1900s.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b68 In late July 2000, Roger Jones contracted to purchase Boadle Ranch from Robert Stephens, Jr. As part of the purchase agreement, Jones required Stephens to install gates at the east entrance of the property and at the bridge crossing Slope Canal. He also had Stephens post signs prohibiting the public from using Boadle Road and Boadle Bridge. Jones retained the gates and signs after he acquired ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b69 In December 2000, PLWA filed suit against Jones seeking: (1) a declaration that Boadle Road was a county or public road and (2) an injunction enjoining Jones from interfering with the public\u2019s right to use the road. <em>PLWA </em>I, \u00b6 9. While this suit was underway, a wildfire destroyed Boadle Bridge and Jones replaced the bridge with a personally-owned flatbed railcar. <em>PLWA IV, </em>\u00b6 4. The district court held that the historical use of Boadle Road established a public prescriptive easement. <em>PLWA I, </em>\u00b6 33. On appeal, Jones argued inter alia that the new bridge was his property and he could control access to it. We affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling and held that the easement established on Boadle Road included the new Boadle Bridge. We stated \u201cthe public has a right to access the bridge and the land under the bridge without interference from Jones.\u201d <em>PLWA I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31 and 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b610 In 2006, PLWA sought a declaration that Canal Road was also a public road for the same reasons Boadle Road was public. The district court ruled in favor of Jones but we reversed and remanded. <em>PLWA II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7 and 23. On remand, the district court held that Canal Road was a public road and Jones was prohibited from blocking the portions of both Boadle and Canal Roads that traversed his property. Jones appealed. In our non-cite opinion, <em>PLWA III, </em>issued on September 20, 2011, we affirmed the district court. <em>PLWA III, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b611 However, earlier in September 2011, before our ruling in <em>PLWA III </em>was issued, Jones removed the railcar bridge from its Boadle Road location, destroyed the abutments and support columns, and reinstalled the railcar bridge approximately one-quarter mile away on a private road to which the public had no access. This action allowed Jones to cross the Slope Canal to access the western portion of his property but precluded that public traveling Boadle and Canal Roads from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u00b612 As a consequence of Jones\u2019s removing the bridge, PLWA sued Jones in November 2011 claiming tortious interference with a public easement and public nuisance with actual malice. It also petitioned the district court for supplemental relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). It claimed Jones violated our ruling in <em>PLWA I </em>by removing the railcar bridge and sought declaratory relief and punitive damages. The district court denied PLWA\u2019s petition for supplemental relief and dismissed its complaint against Jones. The court stated that Jones owned the bridge and had no obligation to facilitate public access across Slope Canal. PLWA appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b613 <em>InPLWAIV, </em>we reversed the district court\u2019s ruling and remanded the case. We observed that in <em>PLWA I, </em>\u00b6 31, we ruled that Boadle Bridge fell within the scope of the public prescriptive easement and that Jones could not interfere with the public\u2019s right to access the bridge. <em>PLWA TV, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10 and 11. We explained that our ruling in that case as it pertained to Boadle Bridge was \u2018law of the case\u201d regardless of whether Jones built or owns the current bridge and, as such, our holding must be adhered to throughout the case\u2019s subsequent progress. <em>PLWA TV, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b614 On remand, the District Court conducted a three-day jury trial in June 2014 on PLWA\u2019s tort suit against Jones. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of PLWA, finding Jones hable for both tortious interference with an easement and public nuisance. It awarded PLWA $375,000 in damages to restore Boadle Bridge at its original location, $25,000 in loss of bridge use damages, and $10,000 in punitive damages upon finding that Jones had acted with actual malice. The District Court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict, finding that it was supported by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b615 On September 11, 2014, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order on PLWA\u2019s request for supplementary declaratory relief. The court adopted the jury\u2019s verdict as supplemental declaratory relief but incorporated several variations in its order. First, it awarded the $375,000 to PLWA as a restoration award but instructed that PLWA could subtract its costs and attorney fees from the award and use the remaining amount \u201cto restore\u201d the bridge at the Boadle Road location. Second, it allowed PLWA to provide the restoration award \u2014 less fees and costs \u2014 to other entities \u201cfor construction of a new Boadle Bridge.\u201d And, lastly, it awarded PLWA, as did the jury, $35,000 for loss of bridge use and punitive damages, instructing that this sanction be used for future bridge repair and maintenance. Jones appeals this order, and PLWA cross-appeals the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>portion of the judgment pertaining to its fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. A finding of fact may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record; if the district court misapprehended the evidence; or when our review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We review a court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 236, 77 P.3d 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b617 The grant of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, of the UDJA, is within the discretionary province of the district court. We therefore review a court\u2019s decision to award such fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err in awarding money damages as supplemental declaratory relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\u00b619 PLWA sought both tort damages and declaratory relief under the UDJA. Section 27-8-313, MCA, of the UDJA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">Further relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted whenever necessary or proper. The application therefor shall be by petition to a court having jurisdiction to grant the relief. If the application be deemed sufficient, the court shall, on reasonable notice, require any adverse party whose rights have been adjudicated by a declaratory judgment or decree to show cause why further relief should not be granted forthwith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">\u00b620 As noted above, the District Court relied upon the jury\u2019s verdict in granting PLWA\u2019s request for supplemental relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Jones argues that the court\u2019s grant of supplemental relief based upon the verdict was an abuse of discretion because the verdict itself was improper. He claims that PLWA requested \u201crestoration\u201d damages but the court failed to instruct the jury as to the meaning of \u201crestore.\u201d Moreover, the court submitted a verdict form to the jury referencing costs of \u201crestoring\u201d the bridge, which Jones maintains confused the jury and resulted in an inappropriate and excessive award.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">\u00b621 Jones cites multiple cases addressing restoration damages, <em>including McEwen v. MCR, LLC, </em>2012 MT 319, 368 Mont. 38, 291 P.3d 1253, <em>and Lampi v. Speed, </em>2011 MT 231, 362 Mont. 122, 261 P.3d 1000. Premised on these cases, he argues that a party seeking restoration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>damages must establish that (1) the injury is temporary, and (2) personal reasons necessitate restoration. He stresses that restoration damages are those that a party will be forced to spend to restore property to its previous, pre-tort condition and that a party should not profit from restoration damages. Jones does not allege that PLWA failed to establish the right to restoration damages under <em>McEwen </em>or <em>Lampi, </em>or that PLWA improperly enjoyed a profit or improved property based upon the jury award. Rather, he maintains that the District Court did not give proper \u201crestoration\u201d jury instructions and that no testimony or evidence was presented at trial to support a \u201crestoration\u201d damage award. He maintains that the only way to \u201crestore\u201d Boadle Bridge is to return the railcar bridge to Boadle Road at approximately the same cost he incurred when he moved it in 2011. Jones argues that because the jury was confused it erroneously awarded $375,000 to restore the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b622 PLWA counters that under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, the District Court sitting in equity has broad discretion to \u201cprovide complete relief to the parties.\u201d It further asserts that the evidence presented at trial supported both the jury\u2019s verdict and the District Court\u2019s order on supplemental relief. PLWA submits that because the District Court has the authority and discretion to rule on supplemental relief, and because findings in support of supplemental relief must be decided by the District Court, the instructions to the jury, if erroneous, were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b623 It has long been the rule that in cases in equity, errors in jury instructions are not prejudicial because the findings in support of equitable relief must be decided by the district court judge. <em>Lawlor v. Kemper, </em>20 Mont. 13, 49 P. 398 (1897) and <em>Talbott v. Butte City Water Co., </em>29 Mont. 17, 73 P. 1111 (1903). Additionally, Tinder the UDJA, the District Court is not limited to the relief requested in the complaint \u2014 or in this case, the verdict form \u2014 but rather \u201cmay order any relief needed to effectuate the judgment.\u201d <em>Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, </em>255 Mont. 430, 438, 843 P.2d 765, 770 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b624 It is apparent from the record that the jury understood that it was to determine whether Jones had tortiously interfered with the public\u2019s easement over Boadle Bridge and whether he should be liable for public nuisance. The jury answered these two questions in the affirmative. Additionally, during trial, the jury heard that Jones had spent between $40,000 and $50,000 to move the railcar bridge to its new location in September 2011. It also heard testimony that because Jones had destroyed the bridge abutments and support columns, returning the railcar to Boadle Road would require additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>construction and cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b625  The jury also heard extensive testimony from two structural engineers pertaining to building a replacement bridge over Slope Canal. The structural engineer testifying as a witness for PLWA testified that the cost of replacing the bridge with a traditional bridge that was not a railroad car would be approximately $300,000. The structural engineer who testified on behalf of Jones stated that the cost of rebuilding the bridge could be $800,000. Basing its decision upon the evidence at trial as instructed by the District Court, the jury concluded that a Boadle Road bridge could be provided to the public for $375,000. This figure is supported by the evidence and was a proper basis for the District Court\u2019s order of equitable supplemental relief. Additionally, Jones was free to argue in the District Court that he could return the bridge to its original location at a cost of $40,000 to $50,000, but he did not. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in adopting the jury verdict as supplemental relief and awarding money damages under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b626 Jones also argues that the District Court erred in awarding \u201cfuture bridge maintenance funds\u201d as restoration damages because such an award is \u201cantithetical to [a restoration] award\u2019s purpose of restoring a property to its pre-tort condition.\u201d Having ruled that the District Court did not err in adopting the jury\u2019s damages award, we decline to further address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court err in failing to consider ownership of the railroad car bridge or its suitability as a bridge in fashioning relief in violation of PLWA IV?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b628 Jones argues that the District Court presented a jury instruction that \u201cpermissively\u201d allowed the jury to consider Jones\u2019s ownership of the railroad car and its suitability as a bridge in determining whether the relief awarded was in accordance with <em>PLWA IV. </em>We stated in <em>PLWA IV, </em>\u00b6 12: \u201cJones\u2019s private ownership of the railcar bridge and his concerns about its suitability for public use are matters to be evaluated in determining the appropriate relief to be granted.\u201d Jones contrasts this language with jury instruction 18 which states: \u201cYou may consider [Jones\u2019s] ownership of the Boadle Bridge and the suitability for public use in determining the appropriate relief to be granted.\u201d Jones argues that by offering a permissive instruction the District Court ignored \u201cthe mandate and opinion\u201d of this Court. He claims that the jury instruction is both erroneous and an abuse of discretion. He asserts that this error justifies overturning the court\u2019s grant of supplemental relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b629 As discussed above, the District Court had discretion to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>supplemental relief under the UDJA and Jones\u2019s claims of improper jury instructions are unpersuasive. Moreover, acting within its discretion and in accordance with our instruction in PLWA <em>IV, </em>the District Court did consider Jones\u2019s ownership of the railcar and its suitability as a bridge when it allowed Jones\u2019s railcar to remain at its current location for exclusive use by Jones. Consequently, Jones retains complete ownership rights to the railcar and is free to sell it or relocate it to any desirable location on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b630 <em>Cross-Appeal: Did the District Court err by not awarding PLWA reasonable attorney fees and costs, in addition to the amount necessary to rebuild the bridge?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b631 Jones argues against an award of attorney fees to PLWA both in his direct appeal and in response to PLWA\u2019s cross-appeal. On direct appeal, he claims that the court\u2019s order that PLWA may reimburse itself its attorney fees from the restoration damages award was erroneous and an abuse of discretion. He asserts that a court has discretion to award attorney fees under the UDJA if to do so is equitable, necessary and proper, but notes that equity generally does not support an award of attorney fees under the UDJA if similarly situated parties genuinely dispute their rights. Jones also contends that upon a finding that equitable considerations support an award of attorney fees, the court must apply the \u201ctangible parameters\u201d test to determine if the fees are necessary and proper. He maintains that the District Court\u2019s failure to consider the tangible parameters\u2019 test or the equity of an attorney fee award constituted an abuse of discretion. Lastly, he claims that he acted in good faith when he removed the bridge based upon his concern that the railcar bridge was not safe for the general public, and the potential for liability. As such, he maintains, the District Court improperly awarded attorney fees to PLWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b632 On cross-appeal, PLWA asserts that the District Court erred in determining that its fees should be deducted from the restoration award. PLWA argues it is entitled to an actual award of attorney fees and costs to be paid by Jones. It notes that the jury and the District Court determined that $375,000 was required to reconstruct a bridge over Slope Canal to restore access to the public easement, and if PLWA reimburses itself from this award, there will be insufficient funds remaining to reconstruct a bridge. It acknowledges that the District Court did not analyze its claim for fees under the three-prong \u201ctangible parameters\u201d test but asserts that the case satisfies that test because: (1) Jones possesses what PLWA sought in its declaratory relief action; (2) it was necessary that PLWA seek a declaration showing that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>entitled to the relief sought; and (3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status quo. <em>Martin v. SAIF Corp., </em>2007 MT 234, \u00b6 23, 339 Mont. 167, 167 P.3d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b633 PLWA also sirgues that the equities support an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. It urges us to consider that as a volunteer non-profit organization, it has spent its member supporter\u2019s funds for the past fifteen years to re-establish the public\u2019s rights to access Boadle Road, Canal Road, and Boadle Bridge. It further contends that the District Court and the jury determined that Jones acted with malice when he removed the railcar bridge in violation of our earlier ruling. The jury was instructed that if Jones had knowledge of facts or intentionally disregarded facts that created a high probability of injuiy to PLWA, and that he deliberately proceeded to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury or deliberately proceeded to act with indifference to the high probability of the injury, he would be guilty of malice. Section 27-1-221(2), MCA. PLWA asserts that the jury\u2019s finding of malice fully supports an equitable award of attorney fees and without such an award, justice has not been attained.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b634 It is well-established in Montana that, absent statutory or contractual authority, attorney fees will not be awarded. <em>Goodover, </em>255 Mont. at 445, 843 P.2d at 774. However, we have held that in isolated cases, a district court using its equity powers may award attorney fees to make an injured party whole. <em>Goodover, </em>255 Mont. at 445, 843 P.2d at 774. The threshold question for an award of attorney fees is whether the equities support such an award. <em>City of Helena v. Svee, </em>2014 MT 311, \u00b6 20, 377 Mont. 158, 339 P.3d 32. Additionally, in <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>we addressed for the first time whether \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, authorizes a court to award attorney fees and concluded that it did, provided the award of such fees was equitable and \u201cnecessary or proper.\u201d <em>Trs. of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, \u00b6\u00b6 35-42, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. We acknowledged that \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d \u2014 a concept derived from Ohio law \u2014 presented a \u201csomewhat nebulous\u201d standard for courts. Therefore, in <em>Martin, </em>we adopted the three-part tangible parameters test set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b635 As argued by Jones and acknowledged by PLWA, the District Court did not indicate in its order that it considered the tangible parameters test when it ordered that PLWA could reimburse itself for attorney fees from the restoration damages award. We conclude, however, that it is not necessary to remand this issue to the District Court as it is apparent that the equities in this matter fully support an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>award of attorney fees. The District Court set forth findings supported by the evidence that establish that Jones acted with malice and with intent to interfere with public access in violation of prior orders of the District Court and this Court. These findings clearly satisfy the threshold question of whether equities support an award of attorney fees. It is equally clear that the first prong of the tangible parameters test has been met in that Jones possesses what PLWA sought in its declaratory relief action \u2014 access to the public easement in existence since the early 1900s. The second prong is met as well in that PLWA was repeatedly successful in establishing the existence of the public easement, yet Jones continued to prohibit access and PLWA was forced to seek a declaration showing that PLWA was entitled to the relief sought. And, finally, the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to change the status quo. <em>Svee, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b636  Lastly, we decline to accept Jones\u2019s claim that he acted in good faith. There was sufficient evidence before the District Court and the jury to conclude that even if Jones genuinely was concerned about the safety of the railcar bridge, he had blocked access to the original Boadle Bridge for two years before replacing the bridge with the railcar because he simply did not want the public driving near his home or on Boadle Road. Given the now-fifteen-year history of this case, Jones\u2019s continuous efforts to thwart the public\u2019s easement rights, and his persistent disregard for the multiple judicial decisions rendered in favor of PLWA, equity fully supports an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b637 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of supplemental relief in the amount of $375,000 in restoration damages and $35,000 in loss of bridge use and punitive damages. We hold that the $375,000 in restoration damages should be used to establish a bridge on Boadle Road over Slope Canal and therefore reverse the court\u2019s instruction that PLWA may reimburse itself for attorney fees from the restoration fund. Pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, and supporting case law, we remand this matter to the District Court with instructions to award reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by PLWA in pursuing Cause No. DV-11-054 and this appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\"><em> Public Lands v.

The Court holds, without expressly stating, that the District Court abused its discretion by including attorney fees within the $375,000 restoration award fashioned for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>PLWA. \u201c \u2018In an action for a declaratory judgment, \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, may provide a statutory basis for awarding attorney fees as supplemental relief, if such an award is determined to be necessary and proper.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beebe v. Bd. of Dirs. of the Bridger Creek Subdivision Cmty. Ass\u2019n, </em>2015 MT 183, \u00b6 26, 379 Mont. 484, 352 P.3d 1094 (citation omitted). \u201cWe review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s order to grant or deny attorney fees if legal authority exists for the fees.\u201d <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Hanke, </em>2013 MT 320, \u00b6 12, 372 Mont. 350, 312 P.3d 429 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b639 \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Wagner v. Woodward, </em>2012 MT 19, \u00b6 18, 363 Mont. 403, 270 P.3d 21 (citation omitted) (affirming District Court\u2019s denial of attorney fees). I believe the District Court carefully considered and fashioned a multipronged package of relief for PLWA with the flexibility to use part of the restoration award for attorney fees, in addition to awarding loss-of-use damages and punitive damages. Under the standard of review, I would hold that the court did not act \u201carbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceed[] the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b640 On the appeal, Jones states that he was given no notice, advance or otherwise, that the jury would act in an advisory capacity. He cites federal authority that holds it is reversible error for the trial court to determine that a jury verdict would be advisory after a case is submitted to the jury, because \u201c[t]he parties are entitled to know prior to trial whether the jury or the court will be the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Parkes, </em>963 F.2d 885, 889 (6th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(c)). He notes this Court has stated that, when Montana civil rules are modeled on federal rules, we look to the interpretation of the federal rules for guidance in interpreting our rules, citing <em>Muri v. Frank, </em>2001 MT 29, \u00b6 12, 304 Mont. 171, 18 P.3d 1022. Despite this persuasive authority, I would conclude, given my conclusion to affirm the District Court on the cross-appeal, that the error is harmless, and affirm. Though describing the damages in slightly different terms, the District Court imposed the same amount of damages as the advisory jury ($375,000 to restore Boadle Bridge, $25,000 for loss of bridge use, and $10,000 in punitive damages versus $375,000 for a restoration award and attorney fees and costs and $35,000 for loss of bridge use and punitive damages). The Court\u2019s decision to reverse on the cross-appeal and grant greater damages creates prejudice against Jones for the failure to advise him that the jury was only advisory.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
