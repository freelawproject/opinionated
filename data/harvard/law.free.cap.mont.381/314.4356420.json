We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">\u00b62 Root presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether Root\u2019s attorney was ineffective for not requesting an accomplice instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred in denying Root\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose a video statement of a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">\u00b65 This case began with events in Butte, Montana, on July 27,2012, that resulted in Lawrence Lee being stabbed in the arm and neck and cut on his hand. This happened after defendant Root and a juvenile referred to as S.R. entered Lee\u2019s pickup truck and asked for a ride up the hill to Walkerville. Lee testified at trial that as the trio motored to and through Walkerville, Root pulled a knife and stabbed and cut him and said \u201cThis is for Jennifer Marshall.\u201d Lee testified that as the truck slowed S.R. jumped out the passenger side door and he (Lee) struggled with Root and eventually forced him from the cab. Lee then tried unsuccessfully to hit both S.R. and Root by backing the truck into them. He left the scene, stopping at a house for assistance. He did not notify the police because \u201cyou know, it\u2019s Butte, you don\u2019t call the cops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAF\">\u00b66 S.R. testified that Root stabbed and cut Lee; that both he and Root ended up out of the truck trying to avoid Lee; and that both he and Root fled the scene. S.R. testified that he did not know Root or Lee, but that he saw the two together and offered them some weed if they would give him a ride to a house in Walkerville. S.R. testified that after he jumped out of the truck he looked back and saw Lee and Root struggling and saw that Lee had been stabbed. S.R. testified that after Root and S.R. were out of the truck, Lee backed up and tried to hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>them. S.R. testified that after Lee left, he (S.R.) took the knife from Root and buried it because he was afraid for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b67 Root testified that he did not stab and cut Lee, but that S.R. did. He said that he met S.R. earlier in the day and saw him later when Lee and S.R. pulled up in Lee\u2019s truck and the ride began. Root testified that Lee attacked S.R. in the truck, and that when that started he got out. Root testified that when he saw that Lee had a knife, he intervened and fought with Lee inside the truck. He said that S.R. then pulled him out of the truck and Lee tried to run them down. On appeal Root summarizes his defense at trial as based on the argument that \u201che was innocent of attempted homicide and that he didn\u2019t use a knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b68 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 14, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b69 This Court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo to determine whether the decision was correct. <em>State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 24, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b610 <em>Issue One: Whether Root\u2019s attorney was ineffective for not requesting an accomplice instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b611 This Court evaluates claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984) and <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. First the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 14. There is a strong presumption that the attorney\u2019s performance fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15, because there are \u201ccountless ways to provide reasonable assistance in any given case.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u00b612 Second, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. This requires a showing of a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. An ineffective assistance claim that cannot be determined from the facts in the record can be reviewed in a petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u00b613 Root contends that his trial attorney should have requested a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>instruction that S.R. was legally accountable (an accomplice) for the charged offense and that his testimony must be viewed with distrust and must be corroborated. Sections 26-1-303(4) and 45-2-302, MCA. S.R. was not charged with any offense arising from this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b614  Even if an accomplice instruction could be given in a case if requested, an attorney does not necessarily provide ineffective assistance to his client by failing to request one. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>257 Mont. 157, 162-63, 848 P.2d 496, 499 (1993) (where accomplice instruction conflicted with the defendant\u2019s claim that he did not commit the crime, not requesting an accomplice instruction was a \u201cclear\u201d tactical decision that did not support a claim of ineffective assistance). In this case Root\u2019s attorney did not provide ineffective assistance by not requesting an accomplice instruction because it would have conflicted with Root\u2019s defense that he did not stab Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b6 15  It is not proper to give an accountability/accomplice instruction where it is unsupported by the evidence and is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 356, 77 P.3d 239. Even where there was clearly an accomplice, the trial court is not required to give the accomplice instruction in every case, and counsel is not ineffective for failing to request the instruction where it would be inconsistent with the theory of defense. <em>Johnson, </em>257 Mont. at 162-63, 848 P.2d at 499. Defense counsel is responsible for making the tactical decision to forego an accomplice instruction where it would be inconsistent with the theory of defense. <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>270 Mont. 122, 129-30, 890 P.2d 754, 758 (1995). In the case of an inconsistent defense, this Court on appeal can determine from the face of the record that defense counsel made a \u201cclear\u201d tactical decision that does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>Johnson, </em>257 Mont. at 163, 848 P.2d at 499; <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b616 Root claims that, while he did not stab Lee, he committed an offense (assault) by fighting with Lee and therefore he did not claim that he was \u201ctotally innocent.\u201d However, he claims that S.R. was an accomplice in the attempted deliberate homicide, a charge for which Root denies any culpability. His attorney was faced with defending based upon Root\u2019s version of the events. Defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics are necessarily constrained by the facts and evidence that will be considered by the jury. <em>State v. Morsette, </em>2013 MT 270, \u00b6 21, 372 Mont. 38, 309 P.3d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b617  We conclude that the performance of Root\u2019s attorney did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, and was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance, <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that counsel perform with reasonable competence, and that success is not the test of effective counsel. Root has not demonstrated that but for counsel\u2019s performance the result would have been different. <em>Bomar v. State, </em>2012 MT 163, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, 365 Mont. P.3d 396. Therefore we determine that Root\u2019s attorney was not ineffective in failing to offer an accomplice instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b618 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred in denying Roofs motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose a video statement of a witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b619 Between the second and third days of trial the State provided the defense with a copy of a recording of an interview between police and a previously-disclosed witness named Lonnie Boyd. The next morning defense counsel moved the District Court to dismiss the charges on the ground that the late disclosure of the recording was a violation of Root\u2019s right to due process under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). Under <em>Brady, </em>a criminal defendant has a due process right to obtain exculpatory evidence held by the prosecution. To prevail on a <em>Brady </em>violation the defendant must establish that the State possessed evidence favorable to the defense because of its exculpatory or impeachment value; that the prosecution willfully or inadvertently suppressed the evidence; and that suppression of the evidence prejudiced the accused. <em>State v. Fish, </em>2009 MT 47, \u00b6 20, 349 Mont. 286, 204 P.3d 681. However, a defendant\u2019s right to due process \u201cis not violated every time the government fails or chooses not to disclose evidence that might prove helpful to the defense\u201d and the defendant must demonstrate that the suppressed evidence \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 437, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1566, 1567 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b620 The District Court held a hearing out of the presence of the jury on Root\u2019s motion to dismiss. After argument from counsel the District Court denied the motion to dismiss, holding that the recording of the Boyd interview was cumulative; that the defense knew about Boyd prior to the disclosure of the recording; that the defense knew Boyd had given a statement to officers; and that the defense knew that the police obtained a search warrant for a building in Butte based upon Boyd\u2019s statement. The District Court found that the defense in fact had Boyd available to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b621 It is clear that the State had an obligation to disclose the Boyd statement earlier than it did, even though there is no contention that the prosecutor in Root\u2019s case knew about the recording prior to disclosing it to the defense. It is also clear that the Boyd statement had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>exculpatory value in that it provided evidence that S.R. had claimed that he, and not Root, stabbed the victim. It is also clear that the statement had impeachment value because it contradicted the testimony of S.R., who testified (along with the victim) that Root was the culprit. At the same time, because Boyd testified at trial after disclosure of the recording of his statement, the jury heard his account of S.R.\u2019s claim to have done the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b622 Additional facts about Boyd appear in the record. Boyd was not involved in the incident in which Lee was stabbed. Rather, Boyd was in police custody on unrelated charges, and about six days after the stabbing he offered to police that he would give a statement that S.R. had told him that S.R, and not Root, stabbed Lee. Boyd provided a recorded statement recounting his interactions with S.R. and about S.R.\u2019s description of the stabbing. The police obtained a search warrant based upon Boyd\u2019s statement that S.R. showed him where the knife was hidden, but they found nothing during the search to corroborate Boyd\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b623 In early December 2012 before trial, Root moved in limine that he be allowed to introduce the testimony of a police detective who had interviewed Boyd, because Boyd had told police that S.R. admitted to stabbing Lee. The State responded that the defense had been given Boyd\u2019s name, address and \u201call pertinent information.\u201d The State objected to introduction of the detective\u2019s testimony about Boyd\u2019s statement on the ground of hearsay. In January 2013 the State obtained and filed a subpoena issued to Boyd to secure his attendance at trial, and separately disclosed him (and his address) as a witness for the State. The District Court\u2019s order in January 2013 denied on hearsay grounds Root\u2019s motion that the police officer be allowed to testify what Boyd had said about what S.R. had said. In February 2013 the defense obtained and filed a subpoena to secure Boyd\u2019s appearance at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b624 The State called S.R. as a witness during its case-in-chief, before Boyd or Root testified. On cross-examination, Root\u2019s attorney asked S.R. whether he told Lonnie Boyd that S.R. had stabbed Lee. S.R. testified that he did not know Boyd and that it was \u201cnot true\u201d that he claimed to have stabbed Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b625 After the District Court denied Root\u2019s motion to dismiss, the defense called Lonnie Boyd to testify at trial. Boyd testified for the defense that he talked to S.R. in person and on the phone after the stabbing. Boyd directly contradicted S.R.\u2019s prior testimony that S.R. did not know Boyd and did not talk to him about the incident. Boyd testified that S.R. told him that S.R. had gotten a ride with Lee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>had tried to rob him of drugs. Boyd testified that S.R. told him he stabbed Lee while fighting with Lee about the drugs. Boyd testified that he told law enforcement about S.R.\u2019s claims after he heard that S.R. claimed that Boyd was present at the stabbing. Boyd testified that S.R. told him that he and Lee were also involved in some kind of transaction involving guns, but that the stabbing was about drugs. Boyd testified that S.R. showed him a knife that he claimed he used to stab Lee, and that the knife was with a number of guns in a \u201ccubby hole\u201d in a particular house in Butte. Boyd also testified that S.R. talked about a woman that he knew who may have been assaulted by the victim Lee, but that the assault was not the reason that Lee got stabbed. Boyd testified that he felt that S.R. wanted to be seen as a gangster and was telling the story about stabbing the victim to enhance his credibility in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b626 Root contends that there were other critical impeachment facts in the recording of Boyd\u2019s statement to police. Those included the color of a knife that he says S.R. showed him; that it was wrapped in \u201cold fabric\u201d; that while S.R. tried to posture as a criminal, he came across as a \u201cnutty gangster\u201d; and that Boyd had seen him pull a gun. These aspects of the Boyd statement, which Root\u2019s defense knew about before Boyd testified, were cumulative at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b627 Unlike most <em>Brady </em>cases, Root obtained the recording of the interview before the conclusion of the trial and at a time when he could use it in his defense. Root argues that prior knowledge of the contents of the recording could have allowed different questioning of S.R., who had already testified for the State. However, the only relief he sought from the District Court was dismissal of the charges. He did not seek to recall S.R. and examine or cross examine him based upon information in the recording.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b628 While Boyd\u2019s statement about what S.R. told him was clearly exculpatory, Root obtained the statement during trial. Root also took advantage of the impeachment value of Boyd\u2019s statement, directly contradicting S.R.\u2019s earlier testimony. Root argues that there were additional details in Boyd\u2019s recorded statement that he could have used to impeach S.R. when he originally testified. It is clear that Boyd\u2019s trial testimony as given substantially conflicted with and, if believed, substantially impeached S.R.\u2019s testimony that Root stabbed the victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The jury heard Boyd testify and heard him give his account of S.R.\u2019s purported confession to the crime. Root presented this potentially exculpatory evidence to the jury, which determined nonetheless that Root stabbed the victim. He was entitled to present the testimony, as he did, but it was the province of the jury to believe it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b629 While S.R. may have been \u201cexcused from his subpoena\u201d after testifying in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, there is no showing that S.R. was \u201clong gone\u201d or that he could not have been subpoenaed again to testify in the defense case. Root\u2019s attorney made the tactical decision to not seek to recall S.R. after disclosure of the Boyd statement but to seek dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b630 We conclude that the late disclosure of the Boyd statement was not prejudicial to Root\u2019s defense. The narrow issue here is whether not having Boyd\u2019s statement before S.R. testified prejudiced Root\u2019s right to a fair trial. Root has not demonstrated that the impeachment value of Boyd\u2019s recorded statement was sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. We conclude that Root did receive a fair trial; that the jury heard fully and fairly the testimony about each of the various versions of the stabbing story; and that the resulting verdict is \u201cworthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 435, 115 S. Ct. at 1566. Consequently, the late disclosure of the recording did not violate Root\u2019s right to obtain exculpatory evidence under <em>Brady,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> A defendant may subpoena a witness to testify at his trial, \u00a7 46-15-101, MCA, and may be entitled to a continuance of the trial in order to serve a subpoena on a critical witness, <em>State v.

I would conclude that the District Court erred in denying Root\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the Boyd video statement to Root prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b633 As the Court notes at \u00b6 19, in order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must establish that the State possessed evidence favorable to the defense, that the evidence was inadvertently or willfully suppressed, and that suppression of the evidence prejudiced the accused. <em>Fish, </em>\u00b6 20. Otherwise stated, a successful <em>Brady </em>petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability\u201d that the result of the trial might have been different had the suppressed evidence been properly disclosed. <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 289-90, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1952 (1999) (citing <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434-35).</p>\n<p id=\"A3n\">\u00b634 The Court maintains that because Root obtained the recording of the interview with Boyd before the conclusion of the trial, he was able to use the statement in his defense. Opinion, \u00b6 27. While it is true that Root was able to elicit some of the details of Boyd\u2019s statement to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>police by calling Boyd to the witness stand after the State rested, he was completely deprived of the opportunity to paint the State\u2019s chief witness as a liar <em>during </em>the State\u2019s presentation of its case. Had Root been provided with S.R.\u2019s statement prior to trial, he could have impeached the State\u2019s witness while he sat on the stand; instead, S.R.\u2019s testimony was essentially uncontradicted until Root was able to call Boyd as a witness in his case. Respectfully, an effective impeachment of the State\u2019s key witness places reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors from the outset, and therefore packs a far greater punch than a belated offer of testimony during the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b635 Boyd provided the police with many non-cumulative details about S.R., including his mother\u2019s name and address, the names of many of his friends, the name of his girlfriend, and the nature of his interests and proclivities. As defense counsel argued, had he been possessed of this information before trial, he could have used it to impeach S.R.\u2019s assertion at trial that he did not even know Boyd. He also could have asked S.R. about other information contained in the statement, such as the fact that Boyd met with S.R. on the day of the stabbing while S.R. was in possession of a bloody knife, and that S.R. told Boyd that Root \u201cwas just sitting around,\u201d and did not participate in the stabbing. Defense counsel could have asked S.R about many things revealed in Boyd\u2019s statement, had it been provided to him prior to trial as the law requires. However, he had no opportunity to utilize the valuable information contained in the Boyd statement to impeach S.R., because the statement was only provided to him <em>after </em>S.R. testified, and only after the State requested and the court allowed S.R. to be \u201cpermanently excused from his subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b636 There is no question that the State possessed evidence favorable to the defense, and that it failed to provide the evidence to Root in advance of trial. The only question remainingin <em>the Brady </em>analysis is whether suppression of the evidence prejudiced Root. It clearly did. Three persons were in the vehicle when the stabbing occurred \u2014 the defendant, the victim, and S.R. \u2014 and the three provided radically different versions of what occurred prior to, during and after the stabbing. One cannot state for certain that the outcome of the case would have been different had Root been provided with the Boyd statement prior to trial; however, a ftdly informed impeachment of S.R. would have surely undermined S.R.\u2019s credibility, which was central to the State\u2019s case,</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b637 Root\u2019s inability to present his most persuasive case is not his fault; the fall lies clearly with the State. The Ninth Circuit has recently emphasized that \u201c[tjhe prosecutor\u2019s obligation under <em>Brady </em>is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>excused by a defense counsel's failure to exercise diligence with respect to suppressed evidence.\u201d <em>Amado v. Gonzalez, </em>758 F.3d 1119, 1135 (9th Cir. 2014). The court observed that the \u201crequirement of due diligence would flip that [disclosure] obligation, and enable a prosecutor to excuse his failure by arguing that defense counsel could have found the information himself. The proposition is contrary to federal law as clearly established by the Supreme Court, and unsound public policy.\u201d <em>Amado, </em>758 F.3d at 1136 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b638 In addressing the \u201creasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different\u201d component of the <em>Brady </em>test, the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cthe adjective [reasonable] is important. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434. Root did not receive a fair trial. Had defense counsel been in possession of the Boyd statement at the time he cross-examined S.R., he could have asked S.R. pointed factual questions premised upon Boyd\u2019s statements. Had S.R. then denied the truth of those statements, impeachment via a prior inconsistent statement would have been set, as the State itself acknowledged during the <em>Brady </em>arguments to the District Court. However, S.R. was long gone by the time the State provided the defendant with the Boyd statement, having been permanently released from his subpoena at the State\u2019s request. Thus, the defendant irretrievably lost the opportunity to conduct a meaningful cross-examination and impeachment of the State\u2019s critical witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b639 We err in blithely concluding that the late disclosure of the recording did not prejudice Root. Opinion, \u00b6 30. It is equally troubling that we seemingly shrug off as insignificant the State\u2019s <em>Brady </em>violation. While I do not contend that the State intentionally withheld the Boyd statement until after it had rested its case, \u201cinadvertent\u201d suppression should not be so easily excused. As the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Chief Judge Kozinski famously observed in 2013, \u201c[t]here is an epidemic of <em>Brady </em>violations abroad in the land. Only judges can put a stop to it,\u201d <em>United States v. Olsen, </em>737 F.3d 625, 626 (9th Cir. 2013) (Kozinski, J., dissenting). I would conclude that the District Court erred in denying Root\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the prosecution\u2019s <em>Brady </em>violation, and I therefore dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-6\">JUSTICES MCKINNON and SHEA join in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
