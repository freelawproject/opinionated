While institutionalized in January 2012, Robertson assaulted and seriously injured a nurse at MSH. He was charged with felony aggravated assault and, based upon a 2005 felony aggravated robbery attempt sentence he was then serving, was transferred to Montana State Prison where he remained until the District Court entered an order directing that he be transferred back to MSH on January 10, 2014. Robertson actually transferred to the Hospital on January 22, 2014. Under \u00a7 46-14-221(3), MCA, the Hospital was required to submit a fitness-to-proceed evaluation report to the Montana Third Judicial District Court, Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, within 90 days of commitment. The Hospital submitted its report on April 16,2014. In June 2014, Robertson moved to dismiss his assault charge on the grounds that the fitness evaluation report had not been timely submitted. The District Court agreed and granted his motion. The State of Montana appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in dismissing the aggravated assault charge against Robertson based upon the State\u2019s failure to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-14-221(3)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u00b63 Ross Robertson, currently 30 years old, began displaying signs of mental illness at age 16, exhibiting erratic moods, aggression, violence, and paranoia. Robertson also began abusing alcohol and drugs shortly before his mental illness symptoms manifested. He was first institutionalized at MSH in July 2004 when he was 19 years old. He has been in and out of MSH at least seven times since 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u00b64 In late December 2005, Robertson attempted to rob a Billings convenience store using a weapon. He was charged with felony attempted robbery and temporarily confined in the Yellowstone County Detention Facility until he was transferred to MSH in May 2006 following a competency evaluation. In late May or early June 2007, he entered a plea of \u201cguilty but mentally ill\u201d and was sentenced to DPHHS\u2019s custody for 15 years with 5 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\u00b65 Robertson was subsequently released from MSH but his health and behavior deteriorated and he was sent back to MSH in April 2010, where he remained until July 19, 2011. He was released into the community again but violated several of his parole conditions. He was sent to the START program but returned to MSH on November 28, 2011, to continue serving his attempted robbery sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u00b66 On January 10,2012, Robertson violently attacked and seriously injured a nurse at MSH. He was transferred to Montana State Prison (MSP) the following day where he continued serving his sentence for attempted robbery. While Robertson was serving his sentence at MSP, the State charged him with aggravated assault. Arraignment was continued until February 21, 2013, at which Robertson entered a not guilty plea. After he was charged, counsel questioned his fitness to proceed and his ability to assist his counsel in defending against the assault charge. Following a July 2013 fitness-to-proceed evaluation which found Robertson competent to proceed, Robertson voluntarily discontinued all medications resulting in a return of his mental illness symptoms. In both October 2013 and January 2014, additional fitness-to-proceed evaluations found him unfit to proceed. During this time, Robertson continued to serve his attempted robbery sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b67 Based upon the unfit-to-proceed evaluations, the District Court issued an order on January 10, 2014, suspending the aggravated assault proceeding and ordering Robertson to be transferred back to MSH for treatment. In order to prepare for Robertson\u2019s return to the Hospital and to begin work on an individualized treatment plan for him, MSH delayed Robertson\u2019s physical transfer until January 22, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b68 On April 16, 2014, MSH physicians issued a fitness-to-proceed report that again found Robertson unfit. The report requested that Robertson\u2019s commitment to MSH be extended for an additional 90 days of treatment. The District Court conducted a telephone conference with the parties on April 18,2014, during which the parties stipulated that the court could enter an order continuing Robertson\u2019s mental health treatment at MSH. On April 21, 2014, the District Court issued the agreed-upon order. On June 20,2014, having re-evaluated Robertson, MSH mental health physicians determined he was now fit to proceed in the aggravated assault proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b69 On June 24,2014, Robertson filed a motion to dismiss the assault charge asserting that the requirements of \u00a7 46-14-221(3), MCA, were not met. He claimed that \u00a7 46-14-22l(3)(a), MCA, required the District Court to determine <em>within 90 days of his commitment </em>whether he was fit to proceed. He asserted that he was ordered to return to MSH on January 10,2014, and consequently the fitness-to-proceed evaluation report should have been submitted to the court no later than April 10, 2014. Robertson maintained that because the report was not issued until April 16,2014, the statutory requirements were not met and the District Court lost jurisdiction of the matter. On January 7,2015, the District Court granted Robertson\u2019s motion to dismiss. Relying on \u00a7 53-21-102(4), MCA, the court determined that Robertson\u2019s MSH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>commitment began on January 10 and under the non-discretionary timing requirements of \u00a7 46-14-221(3), MCA, it was obligated to dismiss the action because the report was not filed within 90 days of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u00b610 The State filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b611 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal proceeding is a question of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion of law is correct. <em>State v. Willis, </em>2008 MT 293, \u00b6 11, 345 Mont. 402, 192 P.3d 691. Whether the district court has correctly interpreted a statute is also a conclusion of law reviewed for correctness. <em>State v. Yarnall, </em>2004 MT 333, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 164, 102 P.3d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing the aggravated assault charge against Robertson based upon the State\u2019s failure to satisfy the statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-14-221(3)(a), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\u00b613 Section 46-14-221(3)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">The committing court shall, within 90 days of commitment, review the defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed. If the court finds that the defendant is still unfit to proceed and that it does not appear that the defendant will become fit to proceed within the reasonably foreseeable future, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed, except as provided in subsection (4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arb\">\u00b614 As noted above, the District Court concluded that because Robertson was ordered to MSH on January 10, the court was required to review his fitness to proceed within 90 days, or no later than April 10, 2014. MSH did not submit the report to the District Court for its review until April 16, 2014, Based upon untimeliness, Robertson argued and the District Court agreed that his charges should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">\u00b615 At the heart of this dispute is the meaning ofthe provision \u201cwithin 90 days of commitment,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 46-14-221(3)(a), MCA. Robertson argues and the District Court agreed that a \u201ccommitment\u201d is defined as \u201can order by a court requiring an individual to receive treatment for a mental disorder.\u201d Section 53-21-102(4), MCA. Thus, the court reasoned that the operative date for commencing the 90-day timeframe was the date of the District Court\u2019s order of commitment, January 10, 2014. The State counters that the date of Robertson\u2019s commitment was the actual date of Robertson\u2019s transport to MSH, January 22,2014, and therefore, the April 16,2014 report was timely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The State further argues that the District Court erred in applying the provisions of \u00a7 53-21-102(4), MCA \u2014 which applies to civil mental health commitments \u2014 to proceedings governed by Title 46 with respect to the mental competency of an accused in a criminal action. We conclude that for the reason set forth below, we need not resolve this debate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b616  As noted above, the District Court conducted a telephone conversation with the parties on April 18, 2014, at which time the parties stipulated to a District Court order that MSH should continue treating Robertson\u2019s mental illness for an additional 90 days in an attempt to achieve the statutory \u201cfitness\u201d status that would allow him to become fit to proceed. Robertson\u2019s counsel did not object during this conference to the timeliness of the report. It was not until the June 2014 report from MSH indicating that Robertson was fit to proceed that Robertson first interposed the timeliness objection. It is well settled that judicially or statutorily created procedural deadlines are subject to forfeiture and waiver. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706; <em>Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Pub. Serv., </em>223 Mont 191, 194-95, 725 P.2d 548, 550 (1986). Moreover, we have held that \u201c[t]o properly preserve anissue for appeal, a party must notify the court at the time the objectionable conduct is at issue.\u201d <em>In re A.T., </em>2006 MT 35, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 155, 130 P.3d 1249. We therefore conclude that by agreeing to a continuing course of treatment at MSH after the initial report was submitted to the District Court, Robertson waived his objection to the timeliness of that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\u00b617 As noted above, the parties in this case disagree over when Robertson\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d began for purposes of triggering the 90-day deadline \u2014 on the date the District Court issued its order of commitment or the date on which Robertson actually entered the Hospital to begin treatment. Title 46, chapter 14, references the term \u201ccommitment\u201d on multiple occasions but nowhere is it stated when a \u201ccommitment\u201d commences for purposes of mental competency proceedings under this title and chapter. It may therefore behoove the legislature to specify when a \u201ccommitment\u201d commences with respect to proceedings conducted under Title 46, chapter 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the order of the District Court dismissing the charge against Robertson and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
