Barrett argues that Idaho\u2019s reduction, pursuant to a plea agreement, of Barrett\u2019s third DUI conviction to a second DUI, precludes Montana from charging Barrett as a fourth DUI for sentencing purposes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b62 We address the following issue appeal: Whether Barrett was properly sentenced as a fourth DUI offender when one of his predicate DUIs was reduced in Idaho from a third to a second DUI pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b63 Barrett, a resident of Idaho, was pulled over by police on January 27,2014, after he failed to stop at an intersection in Dillon, Montana. The Officer noted the smell of alcohol, that Barrett\u2019s speech was slurred, and that he had red eyes. Barrett failed the Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and was detained. A Preliminary Breath Test administered at the detention facility revealed a 0.140 blood alcohol content. Barrett was charged with DUI, fourth or subsequent offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Barrett filed a motion to dismiss the felony DUI charge, arguing that the charge was his third DUI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"AnR\">\u00b64 The stipulated facts concerning Barrett\u2019s three prior Idaho DUI convictions are as follows: On March 9,2004, and again on January 20, 2009, Barrett pleaded guilty to DUI in violation of Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8004. On September 25,2010, Barrett was charged with his third DUI violation in ten years, a felony under Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-8004 and 18-8005(6). To avoid the felony enhancement, Barrett reached a plea agreement with the State of Idaho which amended the charge to DUI \u201cSecond Offense\u201d under \u00a7 18-8004. Barrett was convicted of this charge on January 18, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b65 The District Court concluded that Barrett had three prior convictions for DUI and that the label Idaho placed on the convictions was immaterial. The District Court noted that all of the convictions remained valid and had not been expunged, dismissed, or vacated. Barrett agreed to plead guilty and the District Court sentenced Barrett under Montana\u2019s DUI Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401, -731, MCA, as a fourth or subsequent DUI offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u00b66 Absent a factual dispute, a decision on a motion to dismiss is an issue of law which we review de novo for correctness. <em>State v. Blue, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>2009 MT 304, \u00b6 9, 352 Mont. 382, 217 P.3d 82. We exercise plenary review for questions regarding constitutional law. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2015 MT 221, \u00b6 10, 380 Mont. 198, 356 P.3d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b67 <em>Whether Barrett was properly sentenced as a fourth DUI offender when one of his predicate DUIs was reduced in Idaho from a third to a second DUI pursuant to a plea agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b68 In Montana, an offender\u2019s first, second, and third convictions for DUI are punished as misdemeanors. Section 61-8-714, MCA. The fourth or subsequent conviction is punished as a felony. Section 61-8-731, MCA. For purposes of determining the number of prior convictions, a \u201cconviction\u201d means a final conviction, as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101, MCA, as well as a \u201cconviction for a violation of a similar statute or regulation in another state.\u201d Section 45-2-101(16), MCA. Guilty pleas are included in Montana\u2019s definition of \u201cconviction.\u201d Section 45-2-101(16), MCA. With an offender\u2019s third or subsequent DUI offense, all previous convictions must be used for sentencing purposes. Section 61-8-734(l)(b), MCA. The title placed on a charge is not material to counting the number of offenses. <em>Blue, </em>\u00b6 14. In <em>Blue, </em>we held that the statutory scheme for the DUI statutes provided for increasing gradations of punishments and required that \u201ceach conviction [be counted] without regard to what the charge or conviction was called at the time.\u201d <em>Blue, </em>\u00b6 14,</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b69  DUI statutes are deemed similar if they proscribe the same blood alcohol content. <em>See State v. Calvert, </em>2013 MT 374, \u00b6 14, 373 Mont. 152, 316 P.3d 173. We have previously determined that Montana and Idaho have substantially similar DUI statutes. <em>State v. Young, </em>2012 MT 251, \u00b6 19 366 Mont. 527, 289 P.3d 110. Both states find it unlawful to be in actual physical control of a (noncommercial) vehicle with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or above. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-8004(l)(a); \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA. Barrett has stipulated to the fact that he has pleaded guilty on three prior occasions to DUI in violation of Idaho\u2019s DUI statutes. Therefore, under Montana\u2019s DUI statutes and precedent, a Montana Court is required to count all three of Idaho\u2019s prior convictions when sentencing Barrett for his current Montana DUI. We distinguish the present case from our decision in <em>Cleary </em>where we recognized South Dakota law provided for an expungement of a charge, precluding it from being counted as a previous conviction for sentence enhancement purposes. <em>State v. Cleary, </em>2012 MT 113, \u00b6 25, 365 Mont. 142, 278 P.3d 1020. Barrett\u2019s DUI conviction has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>been expunged, dismissed, or vacated by Idaho.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b610 Barrett\u2019s constitutional argument concerning the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution is unconvincing. Barrett argues that the Montana District Court erred when it gave full faith and credit to Barrett\u2019s 2011 DUI conviction but not to Idaho\u2019s restatement of the number of prior DUIs for enhancement purposes. He argues that Montana is precluded from counting the 2011 DUI as Barrett\u2019s fourth offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b611 Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuE\">Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Pursuant to this provision, a foreign judgment rendered by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and persons must be given credit by other tribunals. Precedent differentiates, however, \u201cthe credit owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments. The Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel <em>\u2018a </em>state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. General Motors, </em>522 U.S. 222, 232, 118 S. Ct. 657 (1998), citing <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm\u2019n, </em>306 U.S. 493, 501, 59 S. Ct. 629 (1939); see also <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 818-19, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985). \u201cRegarding judgments, however, the full faith and credit obligation is exacting. A final judgment in one State, if rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment, qualifies for recognition throughout the land.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>522 U.S. at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b612 Therefore, contrary to Barrett\u2019s contentions, Montana is required to give full faith and credit to each conviction rendered by Idaho and has done so in this instance. <em>State v. Berry, </em>141 Wash. 2d 121, 129, 5 P.3d 658 (2000). \u201cFull faith and credit, however, does not mean that States must adopt the practices of other States regarding the time, manner, and mechanisms for enforcing judgments. Enforcement measures do not travel with the sister state judgment as preclusive effects do; such measures remain subject to the even-handed control of forum law.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>522 U.S. at 233. <em>See McElmoyle ex rel. Bailey v. Cohen, </em>13 Peters 312, 325 (1839) (judgment may be enforced only as \u2018laws [of enforcing forum] may permit\u201d); <em>see also Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 99 (1969) (\u201cThe local law of the forum determines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the methods by which a judgment of another state is enforced.\u201d). Montana courts accordingly must give fall faith and credit to the Idaho judgment, but may enforce it according to Montana\u2019s statutory scheme for DUI penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b613  Montana law requires all prior DUI convictions be counted when determining whether felony enhancement is appropriate. The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not require that we ignore that Barrett has three prior convictions for DUI. The District Court correctly determined that all of Barrett\u2019s DUI convictions should be considered for purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b329-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
