Richards petitioned to dissolve her marriage with Ernest W. Trusler. The couple began their relationship in July 1991, had three children between 1992 and 2000, and formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>engaged in a marriage ceremony in May 2008. Prior to 2008, under various circumstances and on multiple occasions, the couple held themselves out as married beginning with the birth of their first child in 1992. On August 8, 2014, the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Powder River County, issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution, dissolving the marriage of the parties and dividing the marital property. Richards appeals the District Court\u2019s allocation of assets, arguing it was grossly disproportionate and inequitable. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b62 Richards and Trusler began their relationship in July 1991, at ages 20 and 21 respectively. Later that summer, Richards moved in with Trusler on his family\u2019s ranch property, Trusler Ranch, in Ashland, Montana. Richards was working at a local grocery store at the time and Trusler was a ranch hand for Trusler Ranch. In April 1992, the couple had their first child, son TR. TR was bom severely disabled and required near constant, full-time care until his death at age 22 on August 12,2014. Richards and Trusler agreed that TR\u2019s care would be provided by Richards. In 1999, Richards gave birth to a healthy daughter, and in 2000, a healthy son was bom.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b63 From 1991 until 2003, Trusler, Richards, and the children lived on the Ranch in a home owned by the family corporation, Trusler, Inc. William and Jacqueline Trusler, Trusler\u2019s parents, incorporated Trusler, Inc. and controlled the majority of the stock during this time. Trusler, Inc.\u2019s assets include, among other things, real property, coal leases, cattle, equipment and machinery. At the time of dissolution, Trusler, Inc. was valued at $7.2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b64 Trusler became a minority stockholder in 1992, an officer of the corporation in 1994 and a member of the board of directors in 1996. He remains both an officer and a director. In addition to these managerial positions, since at least 1990 Trusler has worked, and continues to work, as a Ranch hand. He is paid a salary, provided corporate housing and utilities, an insured company vehicle, health insurance for himself and his family, an annual $6,000 Costco account, and other benefits that the family utilized throughout the parties\u2019 relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\u00b65 In 2003, Richards and the children moved from the Ranch to Broadus, Montana, and in 2004, the couple bought a home in Broadus, which became the primary residence for Richards and the children. Trusler stayed in Broadus some of the time and Richards stayed on the Ranch some of the time. At both home locations, Richards spent her time maintaining the household and providing care for their special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>needs child and the two other children. Richards testified that she moved the children to Broadus primarily to escape Trusler\u2019s then-ongoing alcohol and drug abuse. When circumstances allowed, she cleaned and prepared ranch cabins and bunkhouses for work crews and hunters, cooked meals for work crews, and cleaned Trusler\u2019s mother\u2019s home. She performed these tasks at times without compensation and at other times for an hourly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b66 On December 16, 2011, Richards filed a petition for dissolution against Trusler claiming the marriage was irretrievably broken. By agreement of all parties, Trusler, Inc. was named as a party to the dissolution in a later amended petition based upon its co-ownership of Ranch property and corporate stock with Trusler.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties stipulated to a Final Parenting Plan in May 2014 and neither the parenting plan nor child support is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b67 In Richards\u2019 original petition, her amended petition, and her proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law, Richards consistently sought maintenance from Trusler based upon the lack of sufficient income or assets to provide for her reasonable support. The District Court conducted a bench trial in May and July 2014. In August 2014, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution. The court valued the marital estate at $2,100,666. The court awarded Richards assets totaling $115,844, an equalization payment of $100,000, and liabilities of $8,200, for a net award of $207,644. It awarded Trusler total assets of $1,984,822, and liabilities of $94,500, for a net award of $1,890,322.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b68 In September 2014, Richards filed a motion to amend the court\u2019s findings and judgment and for a new trial. The District Court denied the motion on October 31, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b69 Richards appeals the District Court\u2019s apportionment of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u00b610 A restatement of the issue on appeal is: Did the District Court err and/or abuse its discretion in apportioning the marital estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">\u00b611 The distribution of marital property in a dissolution proceeding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>governed by \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, under which a trial court is vested with broad discretion to distribute the marital property in a manner that is equitable to both parties. <em>In re Marriage of Lee, </em>282 Mont. 410, 421, 938 P.2d 650, 657 (1997). When dividing marital property, the trial court must reach an equitable distribution, not necessarily an equal distribution. <em>In re Marriage of Walls, </em>278 Mont. 413, 416, 925 P.2d 483, 485 (1996); <em>In re Marriage of Kostelnik, </em>2015 MT 283, \u00b6 18, 381 Mont. 182, 357 P.3d 912. The district court\u2019s apportionment of the marital estate will stand unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion as manifested by a substantially inequitable division of the marital assets resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Larson, </em>234 Mont. 400, 402, 763 P.2d 1109, 1110 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b612 We also review a district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding division of marital property, child support, and maintenance awards to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Patton v. Patton, </em>2015 MT 7, \u00b6 18, 378 Mont. 22, 340 P.3d 1242 (internal citation omitted). We apply a three-part test to determine if a finding is clearly erroneous. First, the Court will review the record to see if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Second, if the findings are supported by substantial evidence we will determine if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of evidence. Third, if substantial evidence exists and the effect of the evidence has not been misapprehended the Court may still find that <em>\u201cA </em>finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when, although there is evidence to support it, a review of the record leaves the [Cjourt with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been <em>committed.\u201dInterstate Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n v. Desaye, </em>250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287 (1991). If the findings are not clearly erroneous, we will affirm the distribution of property unless the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 19. The standard of review for an abuse of discretion in a dissolution proceeding is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Engen, </em>1998 MT 153, \u00b6 26, 289 Mont. 299, 961 P.2d 738, <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Funk, </em>2012 MT 14, 363 Mont. 352, 270 P.3d 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err and/or abuse its discretion in apportioning the marital estate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b614 Richards argues on appeal that the District Court inequitably apportioned the marital estate. She requests that we vacate the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>order and remand for a new trial to determine an equitable apportionment. Trusler responds that the court\u2019s award is appropriate, that there is no injustice to Richards, and that Richards did not make substantial contributions to the Ranch business.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b615 Section 40-4-202(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">In a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage, ... the court, without regard to marital misconduct, shall, and in a proceeding for legal separation may, finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title to the property and assets is in the name of the husband or wife or both. In making apportionment, the court shall consider the duration of the marriage and prior marriage of either party, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties, custodial provisions, whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance, and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution or dissipation of value of the respective estates and the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker or to the family unit. In dividing property acquired prior to the marriage, property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent, property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the marriage or in exchange for property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent, the increased value of property acquired prior to marriage, and property acquired by a spouse after a decree of legal separation, the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">(b) the extent to which the contributions have facilitated the maintenance of the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">(c) whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u00b616 At the time of dissolution Trusler, Inc. held assets of $7,262,118, consisting of 10,108 deeded acres of land, income-generating leases with coal companies, gravel pit income, cattle, equipment, machinery, and bank deposits. It is a closely held corporation whose board and management has historically been, and continues to be, comprised exclusively of Trusler family members. The members of the corporation\u2019s current board are Trusler\u2019s mother, Trusler, and his brother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">\u00b617 Trusler has worked at the Ranch for the majority of his fife. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>1992, he was given as a gift 29 shares of the corporation\u2019s 2,109 shares. At that time, his stock constituted 1.375 % ownership in Trusler, Inc. Each year from 2007 through 2009, Trusler received as gifts 24 shares of stock. In June 2009, Trusler\u2019s father died. In February 2011, Trusler inherited 402 shares of corporate stock from his father\u2019s estate and shortly thereafter received 8 additional shares, bringing his total at the time of marital dissolution to 511 shares of 2,109, or 24.229% ownership of Trusler, Inc. There are corporate restrictions on stock transfer that preclude Trusler from disposing of his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b618 Additionally, during the time Richards and Trusler were together, Trusler inherited the \u201cRainey Place\u201d valued at $150,000, a one-third interest in the \u201cPotter Place\u201d valued at $25,000, and a one-fourth interest in the Tongue River Reservoir land and cabin valued at $46,750. Trusler and his two siblings are beneficiaries of a trust established by their father and will receive distribution of the trust\u2019s assets upon their mother\u2019s death or remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b619 Richards acquired relatively few individual assets during the relationship. The couple owned individually or co-owned 11 vehicles and they co-own the Broadus home which, at dissolution, was subject to a $62,000 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b620 The District Court determined the net worth of the marital estate was $1,997,966. This included the couple\u2019s vehicles, cows, Broadus home, and Trusler\u2019s inherited or gifted real property and corporate stock. The court apportioned the following marital assets to Richards: 4 of the family\u2019s used vehicles valued at $13,200,2 Ranch cows valued at $2,644, and the Broadus home valued at $100,000. The court assigned Richards debts totaling $8,200. The District Court also awarded Richards a $100,000 equalization payment to be paid in 10 increments of $10,000 annually. Richards\u2019 total net award was $207,644. Additionally, Trusler was ordered to pay Richards spousal maintenance of $2,000/month to assist in the care of TR. These payments were to continue for 3 months beyond TR\u2019s death or other defined circumstances. The Dissolution Decree was issued on August 8, 2014. TR died on August 12, 2014. Richards therefore received a total of $6,000 in spousal maintenance per the Dissolution Decree. \u00b621 The District Court apportioned the following assets to Trusler: 7 family-owned used vehicles valued at $31,057, the complete value of his interests in the Rainey Place, the Potter Place and the Tongue River property totaling $221,750, and the value of his 24.229% interest in Trusler, Inc. at $1,732,015. Trusler was assigned the following liabilities: the $62,000 Broadus home mortgage, the remaining balance due on one of the vehicles he was awarded, and miscellaneous medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>and credit card bills. His liabilities totaled $94,500, resulting in a total net award of $1,890,322.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b622 As required by \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, the District Court considered the factors set forth in the first three sentences of \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA \u2014 the \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d section of the statute as it was characterized in <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 13. The cotut analyzed the duration of the parties\u2019 marriage, beginning with a determination of whether the parties\u2019 time together before the May 10, 2008 wedding ceremony constituted a common law marriage. The court concluded that the record did not support the statutory or common law presumption of marriage. It determined therefore that the parties\u2019 marriage began on May 10, 2008. However, the court then applied our ruling in <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>2003 MT 168, \u00b6 16, 316 Mont. 327, 71 P.3d 1228, in which we upheld a district court\u2019s consideration of a parties\u2019 premarital cohabitation in equitably apportioning the marital estate. The District Court considered the parties\u2019 time together beginning in 1991 and issued findings of fact that \u201cspecifically noted considerations related to the length of the parties\u2019 relationship and the ongoing care needs for TR to be provided by [Richards], [Richards\u2019] absence of other assets, employment or income opportunities, and the significant resources available to [Trusler].\u201d The specific findings related to these factors are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b623 Turning to the remaining factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, the District Court noted the parties\u2019 respective ages, good health, and that neither party had been married previously. It addressed their occupations, amounts and sources of incomes, skills, employability, liabilities, custodial provisions, and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court also repeatedly referenced Richards\u2019 contribution as a homemaker and to the family unit. The District Court discretely divided Richards\u2019 awards into three categories: apportionment of the marital estate, an equalization payment, and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b624 The court next turned its attention to distribution of the assets acquired by Trusler through family gifts and inheritance \u2014 the \u201cinherited property\u2019 section of the statute as referenced in <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 14. The court noted Richards\u2019 nonmonetary contributions as a homemaker and determined that while this work supported Trusler\u2019s work as a Ranch hand and allowed Trusler to work outside the home, Richards devoted \u201crelatively minor\u201d time to work as a \u201ctraditional ranch wife\u201d in the service of Trusler Ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b625 After issuing numerous factual findings that are supported by the record, the District Court determined that equitable distribution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>marital assets to Richards would be accomplished by awarding her the Broadus house, 4 used cars and 2 cows for a total property amount of $115,844. As \u201cequalization\u201d to Trusler\u2019s interest in Trusler Inc. worth $1,732,015, the court awarded Richards $100,000 to be paid in $10,000 increments over 10 years. As noted above, the court also instructed Trusler to pay Richards maintenance in the sum of $2,000/month for the remainder of TR\u2019s life and for three months thereafter. TR died 4 days after the Dissolution Decree was issued, and therefore Richards received $6,000 in maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b626 Relying on <em>Funk, </em>Richards argues that the District Court improperly minimized her contribution as a wife and homemaker, resulting in a lesser apportionment than had she been found to be a \u201ctraditional ranch wife\u201d who provided services that enhanced the value of the gifted or inherited property. As we are determining the equitability of the apportionment based upon all relevant factors, we need not dwell on this distinction. In Funk, \u00b6 <em>26, we </em>expressly rejected the notion that the non-acquiring spouse is entitled only to the equitable share of the appreciated or preserved value of the acquiring spouse\u2019s gifted contributions attributable to her efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b627 In <em>Funk, </em>the parties were married approximately 20 years. Both parties were working at the time they married but the wife later became a ftdl-time homemaker and raised their daughter. During the marriage the husband inherited over 115 acres of property, 2.5 acres of which was lakefront property on Flathead Lake. On appeal, the primary issue became the district court\u2019s distribution of the inherited property. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 3. Based upon the wife\u2019s contribution to the family, the district court fashioned an apportionment under which she received one-half the value of the lakefront property and one-third of the increased value of the non-lakefront property, totaling $344,167 to be paid by the husband within six months of the decree. The court also awarded the wife one-half of husband\u2019s employment retirement. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b628 In our analysis in <em>Funk, we </em>noted that \u201cmuch confusion\u201d had developed through our case law over the interpretation and application of \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA. We concluded that the Court had \u201cmoved away from the overarching premise of the statute in an attempt to interpret and apply those portions of the statute that specifically address the division of... property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or descent.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 16. We therefore reaffirmed that the overarching premise of the statute is to \u201cfinally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>or wife or both.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 16, We explained that while the statute specified particular matters to be considered in dividing inherited property, the statute did not provide \u201cthat these \u2018considerations\u2019 constitute a constraint on the district court\u2019s essential mandate, which is to equitably divide all assets of the parties, however and whenever acquired.\u201d <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b629 Richards points out that her $100,000 equalization payment constitutes less than 6% of the value of Trusler\u2019s Ranch interest of $1,732,015. She further notes that her entire award of $207,644 is just slightly more than 10% of the net marital estate of $1,997,966. She maintains that these percentages reflect an inequitable distribution and an abuse of discretion warranting reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b630 <em>In re Marriage of Berthiaume, </em>173 Mont. 421, 567 P.2d 1388 (1977), supports Richards\u2019 argument, <em>la Berthiaume, </em>the parties were married approximately six years and had two children. The wife had worked for the first four years of the marriage and then stayed home with the couple\u2019s children. <em>Berthiaume, </em>173 Mont. at 422, 567 P.2d at 1389. During the marriage, the parties purchased and sold a home in Helena, Montana, and purchased another home in Elliston, Montana, using funds from the Helena sale. <em>Berthiaume, </em>173 Mont. at 423, 567 P.2d at 1389. Upon dissolution, the district court awarded the marital home to the husband without making an offsetting provision for the wife. We observed that the total market value of property awarded to the wife constituted less than 10% of that awarded to the husband and such an award was \u201cdirectly contrary\u201d to a requirement that \u201cproperty ... be divided as equally as possible.\u201d <em>Berthiaume, </em>173 Mont. at 424-25, 567 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b631  We acknowledge that an equitable award does not mean an equal award. We nonetheless conclude that Richards\u2019 award of 6% to 10% of the value of the marital estate does not constitute an equitable award under the circumstances of this case and thus amounts to an abuse of discretion by the District Court. As noted above, in its Findings of Fact and Conclusion of Law and Decree of Dissolution, the court repeatedly gave Richards credit for her extraordinary contribution to TR, the other children, and to running the family household. The court further correctly found that Richards was not \u201cvoluntarily underemployed\u201d throughout the marriage. The court appropriately observed that she had no retirement funds and probably would not qualify for future social security benefits, and that her job prospects were limited or non-existent as long as TR was alive. Taking account of these factors, however, the court nonetheless unduly minimized Richards\u2019 contributions as a wife and homemaker and failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to acknowledge that Richards was unable at present to be self-supporting or to perpetuate the standard of living the parties enjoyed during their relationship and marriage. Upon dissolution of the marriage, Richards lost her financial underpinning. Once divorced, Richards became responsible for everyday and extraordinary household expenses, such as groceries, fuel, clothing, payment of her health, automobile and home insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs on the Broadus home. In addition, she still has two teenagers at home through 2017. Clearly, in the absence of maintenance, the apportionment fails to provide Richards with sufficient property to provide for her reasonable needs. We therefore set aside the court\u2019s apportionment and remand for a new trial on the issue of equitable division of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b632 As noted, Richards requested an award of maintenance in the District Court. However, the court awarded her maintenance only for as long as TR survived. Once TR died within days of the entry of the decree of dissolution, the award of maintenance terminated. On remand, the court should re-apportion the marital estate to achieve a more equitable result.

Instead, the Court reverses based upon what is, in reality, only a subjective feeling that the property distribution simply is not equitable. Opinion, \u00b6 31. While I reluctantly join the Court\u2019s decision, it is not without misgivings about the propriety of second-guessing the District Court\u2019s judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and I believe several points should be clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b635 This case presented the District Court with numerous contrasting equities that it wrestled with extensively. Basically, Trusler was a wage earner for most of the parties\u2019 relationship, having little ownership interest in the ranch until late in the marriage. Long before then, Richards had moved to Broadus and had ceased to be involved in the ranch operations. Trusler supported the family household in Broadus by providing Richards with $2,330 per month for over 10 years. The Court generously credits Richards with performing ranch tasks \u201cat times without compensation,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 5, but the District Court clearly found that Richards had received a wage for all of her ranch work except for \u201coccasionally cook[ing] meals for work crews,\u201d leading it to conclude that \u201cthe extent and contribution of her work\u201d on behalf of the ranch \u201cwas relatively minor.\u201d The bulk of the value of the marital estate was from land that Trusler inherited, and the Court cannot fault the District Court\u2019s handling of this property under <em>Funk. </em>The Court uses the value of the inherited land interest to present a stark value contrast between the parties\u2019 distributions, but it should be clarified, first, that Richards made no claim at all to a significant portion of it, valued at about $412,000. Further, a difference in value alone does not necessarily render the distribution inequitable. We clearly held in <em>Funk </em>that the district court has discretion to distribute inherited property to a single party if the evidence supports such a result. <em>Funk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 32. In its initial decision, the District Court found a number of reasons in the evidence to award the property to Trusler, and even though the Court is returning the case for a revised distribution, those reasons remain valid considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b636 What convinces me to join the Court\u2019s opinion is the District Court\u2019s findings that Richards\u2019 work in the family home during the course of the relationship, including attending to the needs of the parties\u2019 disabled son, TR, \u201csupported [Trusler] and his work as a ranch hand, and allowed [Trusler] to work outside the home ... .\u201d Richards\u2019 provision of TR\u2019s extensive care, at the expense of any of her own career interests, enabled Trusler to dedicate his efforts to the ranch that ultimately resulted in his gaining an extensive ownership interest in it. Consequently, I agree that Richards is entitled to sufficient support for a sufficient time to enable her to adjust to the changed circumstances of her fife brought about by both the dissolution of the marriage and the passing of TR.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
