B.D. argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>on appeal that the District Court erred by failing to specify in its Involuntary Mental Health Commitment Order the specific statutory basis for commitment, and that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support an involuntary commitment. The State contends that although the District Court did not specifically cite the statutory scheme, the District Court implicitly found that, as a result of his mental disorder, B.D. presented an imminent threat of injury to others under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA, and that the evidence more than supports this finding. We affirm, and address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>1. Was there sufficient evidence to support a finding that, as a result of his mental disorder, B.D. required an order ofinvoluntary commitment?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err by failing to provide a detailed statement of the facts and basis for BJD.\u2019s commitment?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AHE\">\u00b62 B.D. suffered a closed head injury in 2003. Since then, B.D. has been treated for the secondary effects of that brain injury, and was previously involuntarily committed in 2005 and 2008. His current diagnosis is personality change due to a traumatic brain injury. On February 25, 2014, based on reports that B.D. was not consistently taking his medications and was decompensating, the county attorney again petitioned for B.D.\u2019s commitment and for an order of apprehension, examination, and treatment, which the District Court issued. B.D. was detained and treatment was administered, including medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">\u00b63 Seven days later, on March 5,2014, the District Court conducted a commitment hearing. Dr. Jay Palmatier testified that, two weeks prior to B.D.\u2019s detention, B.D.\u2019s treating psychiatrist, case manager, and father had met to discuss growing concerns about B.D. At this meeting, it was noted that B.D. had not picked up his medications from the pharmacy for approximately six weeks, and that B.D. was exhibiting increasing paranoia and suspicion. This paranoia was primarily targeted toward his neighbors, whom B.D. believed were \u201cout to get him,\u201d but also directed toward his case manager and members of his treatment team at the Western Montana Mental Health Center.</p>\n<p id=\"AFb\">\u00b64 Dr. Palmatier further testified that prior to B.D.\u2019s detention, tensions between B.D. and his neighbors had escalated to the point of at least one physical altercation where law enforcement was called to the scene. In addition, B.D.\u2019s employer, who had given B.D. \u201cglowing reports\u201d up until that point, expressed concern about B.D.\u2019s increasing irritability, hostility, and guardedness at work. Further, Dr. Palmatier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>testified that, for some time, B.D. had been making comments and inquiries about obtaining a firearm as \u201cself protection against anybody who was causing him problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b65 The District Court entered an order for involuntary commitment not to exceed 90 days, initially to MSH as the least restrictive alternative. B.D. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">We review the findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)[(6)]. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\"><em>In re Mental Health of A.S.B., </em>2008 MT 82, \u00b6 17, 342 Mont. 169, 180 P.3d 625 (citations omitted). \u201cAdditionally, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>A.S.B., </em>\u00b6 17. \u2018We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct.\u201d <em>A.S.B., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">\u00b66 <em>1. Was there sufficient evidence to support a finding that, as a result of his mental disorder, B.D. required an order of involuntary </em>commitment?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">\u00b67 Involuntary civil commitment is a statutory procedure outlined in Title 53, Chapter 21, MCA. A district court faced with a civil commitment petition must determine first if the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. <em>See </em>\u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA; <em>In re D.M.S., </em>2009 MT 41, \u00b6 15, 349 Mont. 257, 203 P.3d 776. If the court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, then it is tasked with determining if the respondent requires commitment, considering the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the respondent\u2019s own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-13\">(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent or to others because of the respondent\u2019s acts or omissions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(d) whether the respondent\u2019s mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent\u2019s recent acts or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent\u2019s mental condition to the point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Section 53-21-126(1), MCA. If commitment is justified based on subsection (c), the \u201c[i]mminent threat of self-inflicted injury or injury to others\u201d must be proven by \u201covert acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as to be material and relevant as to the respondent\u2019s present condition.\u201d Section 53-21-126(2), MCA. We have long emphasized the necessity of \u201cstrict adherence\u201d to the statutory scheme governing involuntary commitment, given the utmost importance of the rights at stake in such proceedings, and the \u201ccalamitous effect of a commitment, including loss of liberty and damage to a person\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of L.K.-S., </em>2011 MT 21, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 191, 247 P.3d 1100 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b68 B.D. first argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to cite the subsection of \u00a7 53-21-126(1), MCA, under which it was ordering commitment, was itself a violation of the requirement for strict adherence to the statutory scheme. The State answers that although the District Court failed to cite the specific subsection of the statute it used as a basis for B.D.\u2019s commitment, the court implicitly found that B.D. required commitment under \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA. We agree with the State. Although the failure to specify the subsection relied upon was clearly an oversight to be avoided, the District Court used language that pointed to \u00a7 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA, as the basis for B.D.\u2019s commitment (\u201cBased on his mental state and recent behaviors, Respondent [B.D.] is a danger to himself and others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b69 B.D. does not dispute on appeal the finding that he suffers from a mental disorder, but argues the State failed to meet its burden of proving the necessity of commitment by clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-126(2), MCA. B.D. emphasizes testimony from Dr. Palmatier that, at the time of the hearing (after B.D. had received seven days of medication and treatment), he \u201cseem[ed] to be recovering, somewhat,\u201d and that he was \u201cless vehement about obtaining a weapon\u201d or making threats to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b610 Dr. Palmatier testified that B.D. failed to pick up his medications for at least six weeks, and B.D., during his own testimony, admitted to not taking his prescribed medication for at least two weeks. B.D.\u2019s parents, employer, and treatment team all noted that B.D. had become increasingly suspicious and paranoid during this period, and that he spoke frequently about multiple conspiracies arrayed against him. On at least one occasion, B.D. was involved in a physical altercation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>his neighbors involving a mailbox, where police were called. Dr. Palmatier also testified that, prior to B.D.\u2019s pre-hearing detention and treatment, B.D. had mentioned several times that he wanted to acquire a firearm for \u201cself-protection against anybody who was causing him problems.\u201d Although Dr. Palmatier reported a change in B.D.\u2019s motives regarding a firearm since re-starting treatment, B.D.\u2019s interest in obtaining a gun remained: \u201c[B.D.] states, though, that the only reason that he would need a firearm today, as opposed to several days ago, when he said he would need it to protect himself from neighbors and others, and an invasion from the north \u2014 today, he says he just wants it for hunting.\u201d The District Court\u2019s finding that \u201c[B.D.] still expresses a desire to possess a firearm\u201d is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC7\">\u00b611  B.D. argues that the District Court\u2019s Order \u201crecites allegations from the petition regarding B.D.\u2019s actual attempt to obtain a weapon, but the State presented no evidence to substantiate the allegations.\u201d However, the testimony about B.D.\u2019s stated interest in obtaining a gun was evidence viewed credibly by the District Court and, as we have noted, an imminent threat need not be \u201ca certainty.\u201d <em>In re S.L., </em>2014 MT 317, \u00b6 31, 377 Mont. 223, 339 P.3d 73 (\u201cThreat is not certainty. The law requires only proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the threat of future injury presently exists and that the threat is imminent, that is, impending, likely to occur at any moment.\u201d). As we have noted, \u201c[t]he statute does not require a court wait until a person ... takes the next step ... and actually uses weapons ... against others.\u201d <em>In re Mental Health of R.J.W., </em>226 Mont. 419, 423, 736 P.2d 110, 112 (1987) (affirming a district court\u2019s involuntary commitment order under a previous version of the mental health commitment statute). B.D.\u2019s increasing hostility, paranoia and suspicion, culminating in multiple altercations with his neighbors (one that required police intervention), and finally his alarming comments and inquiries about obtaining a firearm to protect himself from \u201canybody who was causing him problems,\u201d satisfied the statute\u2019s requirements that overt acts be proven to support the District Court\u2019s findings that B.D. posed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>danger to himself and others in his community, justifying commitment because of \u201cimminent threat of injury to [himself] or others because of [his] acts ....\u201d Section 53-21-126(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b612 <em>2. Did the District Court err by failing to provide a detailed statement of the facts and basis for B.D.\u2019s commitment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b613 B.D. argues that the District Court\u2019s verbal and written orders lacked sufficient factual detail to satisfy statutory requirements for an order of commitment. Section 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, requires that when ordering an involuntary commitment, the district court shall make \u201ca detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d We have previously faulted a district court\u2019s findings of fact that were insufficient to satisfy the statute. <em>See L.K.-S., </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted); <em>In re G.M., </em>2007 MT 100, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 116, 157 P. 3d 687 (\u201cThe [district] court\u2019s conclusory restatement of the statutory criteria and its vague reference to witness testimony do not constitute strict compliance with the statutory mandate.\u201d). We have cautioned trial courts that they must enter a \u201cdetailed statement of the facts upon which the court [finds] the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment.\u201d <em>In re A.K., </em>2006 MT 166, \u00b6 14, 332 Mont. 511, 139 P.3d 849 (citations omitted) (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b614 The District Court found that B.D. \u201cha[d] stopped taking his medications consistently over the course of the last two months\u201d and was unwilling to voluntarily submit to treatment. It found that B.D. was \u201cextremely paranoid and believed his neighbors are trying to break into his trailer,\u201d and that \u201chis parents are against him and are out to put him in prison.\u201d The District Court noted his statements about his desire to obtain a firearm, and the concerns noted by coworkers, employer, and case manager. It referenced B.D.\u2019s \u201cmultiple physical altercations with his neighbors in the last two months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b615  While we emphasize that findings of facts \u201cupon which the court found the respondent to be suffering from a mental disorder and requiring commitment\u201d must be detailed, \u00a7 53-21-127(8)(a), MCA, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were sufficient here to satisfy the statute. <em>See In re Mental Health of L.R., </em>2010 MT 76, \u00b6 23, 356 Mont. 20, 231 P.3d 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-9\">JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-4\"> B.D.\u2019s argument suggests that, because he is prevented under federal law from owning a firearm, due to his prior mental health commitments, his comments about obtaining a weapon should be disregarded. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4) (makingit \u201cunlawful for any person ... who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d). However, regardless of any legal prohibition he was tinder, B.D.\u2019s statements of interest in obtaining a firearm remained relevant to the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
