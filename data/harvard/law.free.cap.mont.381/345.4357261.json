We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>affirm and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by affirming the decision of a panel of county school superintendents to dismiss a school territory transfer petition?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b62 The educational facility in question is the Hillcrest Hutterite Colony Attendance Center, located in Cascade County. The Attendance Center was formed after several colony members petitioned the Vaughn School District\u2019s Board of Trustees in February 2013 to open an attendance center for elementary education on the Colony. Vaughn School District ultimately entered into a contract with Hillcrest Colony to provide educational services in exchange for use of a Colony facility, entitled the Hillcrest Colony Attendance Center Agreement. The Agreement provided that \u201cHillcrest Elementary School shall be operated at all times as a public school of the Vaughn School District....\u201d Vaughn School District employs a full-time teacher and a teacher\u2019s aide to staff the Attendance Center. Vaughn School District also provides textbooks, equipment, and teaching supplies for the Attendance Center, and the Administrator of Vaughn School District serves as the chief administrator for the Attendance Center. The Attendance Center opened its doors to students in the late summer of 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b63 In November 2013, Vaughn School District received a petition, pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-105, MCA, requesting the transfer a specified portion of territory (Transfer Territory) from Vaughn School District to the Power School District in Teton County. Because the petition sought a territory transfer involving more than one county, a panel of three county school superintendents was assembled to decide the matter, pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-105(10), MCA. The statutory criteria for a transfer petition include the requirement that the requested territory not be \u201clocated within 3 miles, over the shortest practicable route, of an operating school in the district from which it is to be transferred.\u201d Section 20-6-105(l)(a)(iii), MCA. After receiving briefing on this issue, the superintendent panel determined: <em>\u201cIt </em>is the majority opinion of the Panel that Hillcrest Attendance Center is a school based on the information discussed above and operates as any public school in the state of Montana.\u201d Because the Transfer Territory was located within three miles of the Attendance Center, the panel dismissed the transfer petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b64 Power School District petitioned for judicial review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>superintendent panel\u2019s decision. The District Court affirmed the panel\u2019s dismissal of the petition, reasoning that \u201c[t]he [Attendance Center] has been operating as a school since the 2013-2014 school year. In all respects, it is an operating school maintained under state law at public expense.\u201d Power School District appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b65 A ruling on a territory transfer petition \u201cmust be upheld unless the court finds that the county superintendent\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.\u201d Section 20-6-105(9), MCA. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when a tribunal acts \u2018arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason[,] resulting in substantial injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Petition to Transfer Territory from Dutton, </em>2011 MT 152, \u00b6 7, 361 Mont. 103, 259 P.3d 751 (citation omitted). \u201cA decision is arbitrary if it appears to be \u2018random, unreasonable, or seemingly unmotivated, based on the existing record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutton, </em>\u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b66 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness.\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>\u00b6 7 (internal citation omitted). \u201cA statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>State v.

Power School District further asserts that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the governing statute was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b69 Section 20-6-501, MCA, provides the following definition of \u201cschool\u201d: \u201c[U]nless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term \u2018school\u2019 means an institution for the teaching of children that is established and maintained under the laws of the state of Montana at public expense.\u201d While interpreting statutes, a court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. \u201cThe terms of a writing are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>jurisprudentially presumed to have been used as they are primarily and generally accepted <em>\u201dLabatte v. Town of Culbertson, </em>282 Mont. 342, 345, 938 P.2d 611, 613 (1997) (applying maxim to interpretation of city code); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1-4-107, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\">\u00b610 Montana statutes do not provide a definition for an attendance center. An informal description is provided by the Office of Public Instruction (OPI): \u201cAn attendance center is a location where students regularly attend school at a location other than the regular school building. The attendance center is effectively part of a specified school of the district. Attendance centers are not specifically defined in law, since they are a part of a school, which is defined.\u201d Mont. Office of Pub. Instruction, <em>Get Answers </em>\u2014 <em>Attendance Centers, </em>opi.mt.gov, http://perma.cc/Q39Q-A59R (last updated May 21,2010). Throughout the description, OPI refers to an attendance center as a \u201cschool,\u201d using the terms synonymously: \u201cBecause it is a public school that is also part of a school district, an attendance center falls under the accreditation requirements of the school it is a part of.\u201d Mont. Office of Pub. Instruction, <em>Get </em>Answers. However, while OPI\u2019s description gives helpful information about attendance centers generally, it is not conclusive of the legal issue before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b611 The operative facts are essentially uncontested. Under the terms of the Agreement between Vaughn School District and the Hillcrest Colony, the Attendance Center was opened to \u201coperat[e] at all times as a public school of the Vaughn School District,\u201d or in other words, as \u201can institution for the teaching of children\u201d of Vaughn School District. Section 20-6-501, MCA. The Attendance Center was open to any student in the area, not just colony students.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vaughn School District employs a teacher and a teacher\u2019s aide to staff the Attendance Center, and Vaughn School District had applied for and received funding from OPI for the Attendance Center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Vaughn School District provides textbooks, teaching supplies, and administrative supervision to the Attendance Center, and is also responsible for providing any additional support services for the Attendance Center students. In addition, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>terms of the Agreement, the Attendance Center is required to meet Vaughn School District policies and standards, including \u201call State and Federal laws, administrative rules and policies applicable to public schools and all rules and policies of the School District,\u201d as well as compulsory enrollment requirements. These facts convince us that the panel\u2019s judgment did not exceed the bounds of reason, nor did the panel act unreasonably when concluding that the Attendance Center \u201ccurrently operates as any public school in the state of Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b612 Power School District also contends that the District Court \u201cmisinterpreted and misapplied operative statutes,\u201d arguing that the Attendance Center cannot be an established \u201cschool\u201d because it was not opened consistent with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 20-6-502, MCA. That statute establishes the procedures for opening or reopening an elementary school, including the requirements that the county superintendent and board of county commissioners approve the opening of the school, and that the superintendent of public instruction likewise approve the opening. <em>See </em>\u00a7 20-6-502(2)-(4), MCA. Power School District argues that \u201c[t]he District Court\u2019s conclusion ignores a significant part of the statutory definition (i.e. that to be a school, the institution must also be <em>established </em>under the laws of Montana) and it ignores a more specific statute prescribing what must be done before a school can be opened.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b613 The District Court addressed this issue, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">The territory transfer panel acknowledged the approval of the county commissioners was missing from the process to open the Hillcrest Colony facility... . The Court agrees with the transfer panel, though, that the lack of county commissioner approval does not, ipso facto, invalidate the Hillcrest Colony facility\u2019s status as an \u201coperating school\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 20-6-105(l)(a)(iii), MCA.... The Hillcrest Colony facility is currently operating as a public elementary school.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u00b614 In <em>McKirdy v. Vielleux, </em>2000 MT 264, \u00b6 21, 302 Mont. 18, 19 P.3d 207, this Court was faced with the validity of a single petition seeking transfer of territory for both a high school and an elementary school under a statute providing that a high school territory petition \u201cmust be accompanied by a petition to transfer the same territory as elementary territory in accordance with [\u00a7] 20-6-213, [MCA],\u201d in the absence of such a separate petition. Approving the combined petition, we reasoned that \u201cthis Court has refused to abide by such a strict, formalistic approach to statutory interpretation, and have readily applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>maxim: \u2018The law respects form less than substance/ pursuant to \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA.\u201d <em>McKirdy, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">\u00b615 Similarly, we conclude upon the record of this case, including that the Attendance Center was approved by local school authorities and approved for funding by state school authorities, staffed with school employees, funded with public resources, regulated under state<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and federal law, and opened to all qualifying students, that it was \u201cestablished and maintained under the laws of the state of Montana at public expense.\u201d Section 20-6-501, MCA. To conclude that a school was not established here by the lack of a vote by the county commissioners, who do not exercise direct supervision over public schools, and the lack of formal approval by the state superintendent, when that office approved the Attendance Center <em>de facto </em>by funding and regulating it, would truly elevate form over substance. The record evidence clearly establishes the substance of the matter \u2014 the Attendance Center is fully functioning as a public school and providing \u201cfor the teaching of children.\u201d Section 20-6-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b616  The District Court correctly held that the superintendent panel did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err as a matter of law in interpreting the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-5\"> The Agreement provided that \u201cEnrollment at Hillcrest Elementary School shall also be open to any and all qualified residents of the Vaughn School District.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> While the Dissent notes that Vaughn School District applied for and received additional funding for the Attendance Center under the procedure for \u201cAnticipated Enrollment Increase,\u201d the funding application stated that the reason for such increased enrollment was the \u201cOpening of Colony Attendance Center.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\"> The Dissent posits that \u201cthe Attendance Center could not have been accredited under State law\u201d because it was not properly opened as a school.

The record is devoid as to the Attendance Center\u2019s accreditation status as of the 2013-2014 year because it opened at the same time that OPI was in the data collection phase for the accreditation process for that year. However, the record indicates that \u201cHillcrest Colony Elementary\u201d was granted regular accreditation status for the 2014 school year, as attested to by a certificate signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A5G\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b618 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. I cannot agree with the Court that the Attendance Center was a \u201cschool\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 20-6-105(1)(a)(iii), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-501, MCA, before a learning facility may be classified as a \u201cschool\u201d it must be \u201cestablished ... under the laws of the state of Montana at public expense.\u201d Once established in accordance with State law, a learning facility is entitled to all the benefits and protections of a school under Montana law, including the availability of funding, accreditation, and protection against land transfers within the district. Sections 20-9-313, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>20-7-102(1), (2), 20-6-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">\u00b619 The Legislature has specifically provided a process under which a new elementary school is established. Section 20-6-502, MCA, et seq. That process includes seeking and obtaining approval from the board of county commissioners and the superintendent of public instruction. Sections 20-6-502(3), (4), MCA. In this regard, the Vaughn School Trustees failed to follow the applicable law for establishing a new elementary school. The Vaughn School Trustees neither sought, nor obtained, approval from the Cascade Board of County Commissioners or the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction to open a new elementary school. Because the Trustees failed to establish the Attendance Center as a new elementary school under the laws of the State of Montana, the Attendance Center cannot be considered a school. To conclude otherwise would be tantamount to disregarding the plain language of the statutory scheme and omitting language that the Legislature inserted. Section 1-4-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b620 The statutory scheme unambiguously requires the board of county commissioners to approve the opening of a new elementary school. The initial step in establishing a new elementary school is for the parents of the students of the prospective school to submit a petition. Section 20-6-502(1), MCA. If the trustees approve the petition, \u00a7 20-6-502(3), MCA, provides that the trustees \u201cshall present the petition, the trustees\u2019 approval, and the county superintendent\u2019s findings\u201d on the parents\u2019 petition to the \u201cboard of county commissioners for their consideration.\u201d The county commissioners shall deny the opening if the anticipated enrolment is less than two pupils. Section 20-6-502(3), MCA. \u201cIn all other cases,\u201d \u00a7 20-6-502(3), MCA, states that it is within the county commissioners\u2019 discretion to \u201capprove or disapprove the requested opening or reopening of the elementary school.\u201d The statutory scheme is clear that the county commissioners\u2019 approval is necessary to establish an elementary school. The Legislature has vested them with this power under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b621 Although it is not this Court\u2019s function to question the wisdom of the Legislature, the Legislature is not without a policy justification for providing the commissioners with their power over the opening of a new elementary school. The county commissioners are directly responsible for financing schools in Montana. While the trustees control the budget process in a school district, the trustees are without taxing authority. It is the county commissioners who actually levy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>required mills for the budget. Section 20-9-131(3), MCA, provides that after the adoption of the final budget for the school district, the trustees \u201cshall deliver the adopted budget, including the amounts to be raised by tax levies, to the county superintendent,\u201d to be placed before the county commissioners. Section 20-9-142, MCA, then requires the county commissioners \u201cto fix and levy on all the taxable value of all the real and personal property within the district all district and county taxation required to finance, within the limitations provided by law, the final budget.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b622 The process for funding the transportation fund for a school district, which is a county based fund used to pay for the costs of getting students from home to school and back, operates in much the same way, with the exception that the transportation fund is controlled by a county transportation board made up of five members, including the county superintendent and a county commissioner. Section 20-10-131, MCA. Like the final budget for a school, the levy required for the final budget for the county transportation fund \u201cmust be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-142.\u201d Section 20-10-144(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b623 Based upon this statutory scheme, it is clear that the county commissioners have a genuine interest in deciding whether a new elementary school is established. It is the county commissioners who will ultimately levy the taxes for its formation and the transportation of its students. And it is the commissioners who will no doubt be held accountable by taxpayers for the creation of the new school and the corresponding tax increases. The statutory scheme allows the commissioners one substantive opportunity to exercise their power over the funding of a new school for which they are responsible \u2014 this comes at the time the school is to be established pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-502, MCA. After the school is established, the county commissioners must levy the required taxes to fund and provide transportation for the new school. In short, the Legislature vested the board of county commissioners with their power for good reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b624 The statutory scheme also unambiguously requires the superintendent of public instruction to approve the opening of a new elementary school. Section 20-6-502(4), MCA, provides that \u201c[i]f the board [of county commissioners] approves a school opening\u201d the trustees must provide \u201ca copy of the approval, along with the petition, the trustees\u2019 approval, and the county superintendent\u2019s estimate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>probable [number of students], to the superintendent of public instruction.\u201d Section 20-6-502(4), MCA, further provides that the \u201csuperintendent of public instruction shall approve or disapprove the requested opening or reopening of the elementary school by the fourth Monday of June.\u201d Here again, the statutory scheme is clear: the superintendent of public instruction\u2019s approval is necessary to establish an elementary school.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">\u00b625 Nonetheless, the Court concludes that the superintendent of public instruction\u2019s approval is unnecessary in this case because the office of public instruction (OPI) \u201capproved the Attendance Center <em>de facto </em>by funding and regulating it.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. First, the statutory scheme by its plain terms expressly requires the superintendent of public instruction, not OPI officials, to approve an elementary opening. The \u201csuperintendent of public instruction\u201d is defined as the \u201cstate government official designated as a member of the executive branch by the Montana constitution.\u201d Section 20-1-101(24), MCA. The OPI is defined separately under \u00a7 90-14-105, MCA. The Montana Constitution requires that the superintendent of public instruction be \u201celected by the qualified electors at a general election\u201d and vests the superintendent of public instruction with all \u201cduties as are provided by law.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4. The Legislature does not use the terms \u201csuperintendent of public instruction\u201d and \u201coffice of public instruction\u201d interchangeably within the statutory scheme and defines their respective powers and duties separately.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended OPI officials to have the power to approve an elementary school opening, instead of the superintendent of public instruction, it could have easily stated as much. The approval of OPI is no substitute for the exercise of actual authority by the superintendent of public instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b626 Second, the Court\u2019s statement that OPI \u201capproved the Attendance Center <em>de facto </em>by funding [it]\u201d is inherently misleading. While OPI did release funding to the Vaughn School District for additional students, it did not do so because of the opening a new elementary school. The Attendance Center did not receive any funding from OPI in its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>name as a newly cast elementary school. Rather, OPI released additional funding to the Vaughn School District because the Vaughn School Trustees claimed an unusual increase of students at the already existing Vaughn Elementary School.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b627 Section 20-9-313, MCA, permits a school district to seek increased funding from OPI for additional students under limited circumstances. For purposes of the present case, there are two relevant subsections of \u00a7 20-9-313(1), MCA, which permit OPI to release increased funding for additional students: subsection (a) and subsection (d). Subsection (a) provides that funding may be increased when \u201cthe opening of a new elementary school or the reopening of an elementary school has been approved in accordance with [\u00a7] 20-6-502.\u201d Subsection (d) provides that funding may be increased in other unusual circumstances, such as the creation of a new mining operation, when \u201ca district anticipates an unusual enrollment increase in the ensuing school fiscal year.\u201d The manner of computation of funding and the requisite procedures to obtain funding under subsection (a) and subsection (d) are not the same. <em>See </em>Sections 20-9-313, 314, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b628 In the present case, the Vaughn School Trustees did not seek funding under \u00a7 20-9-313(l)(a), MCA, but instead applied for funding under \u00a7 20-9-313(l)(d), MCA. The application form for additional funding submitted by the Vaughn School Trustees clearly described the different categories for requesting funding and the procedures to be followed for obtaining such funding, including an explanation that the procedures under subsection (a) \u2014 for obtaining funding for the opening of a new elementary school \u2014 and the procedures under subsection (d) \u2014 for obtaining funding for an unusual enrollment increase at an existing elementary school \u2014 were statutorily different. Yet, the Vaughn School Trustees opted to apply for funding under subsection (d) and follow the requisite procedures applicable to that subsection. And it was under that subsection that OPI provided funding to the Vaughn School District. The release of taxpayer dollars to the Vaughn School District under \u00a7 20-9-313(a), MCA \u2014 absent the Attendance Center being \u201capproved in accordance with [\u00a7] 20-6-502,\u201d MCA \u2014 would have been a clear violation of State law. Section 20-9-313(1), MCA. Make no mistake about it, the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction, nor anyone in her office, approved any funding to the Vaughn School District for additional students based on the opening of a new elementary school at the Hillcrest Colony.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b629 Lastly, there is no evidence in the record showing that OPI regulated the Attendance Center as a school under State law during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the 2013-2014 school year. The only evidence in the record concerning past accreditation is the Vaughn Elementary School\u2019s accreditation status. There is simply no accreditation data for the Attendance Center in the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More importantly, the Attendance Center could not have been accredited under State law. A learning facility must be established in accordance with \u00a7 20-6-502, MCA, before it can be accredited. Sections 20-7-102(1), (2), MCA, provide that \u201ceach elementary school... must be reviewed by the superintendent of public instruction to determine compliance with the standards of accreditation\u201d; the \u201caccreditation status of each <em>school </em>must then be established\u201d; and only a <em>\u201cschool </em>may be accredited ... .\u201d (Emphasis added.). The Superintendent of Public Instruction could not have properly accredited the Attendance Center because the Vaugh School Trustees did not open the Attendance Center as a school in accordance with \u00a7 20-6-502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b630 The Legislature designed a statutory scheme in which the board of county commissioners and the superintendent of public instruction approve the opening of a new elementary school. Once established in accordance with State law, the Legislature permitted the new elementary school to seek funding, obtain accreditation, and protect itself against land transfers. The Court today fundamentally alters that design. The Court\u2019s decision permits a school to be established in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>an entirely different manner them the one provided by law. Local school trustees may now sidestep elected officials; seek funding under the pretext of an unusual enrollment increase in an existing school; and, as long as OPI grants funding of some type, establish a new elementary school. This is not the system the Legislature adopted when it passed \u00a7 20-6-501, MCA, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">\u00b631 The Court\u2019s decision ultimately rewards the failure to follow State law. The Vaughn School Trustees are now entitled to all the benefits and protections that come with a new elementary school. The Cascade County Commissioners must now levy taxes to support the Attendance Center; the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction must now fund and accredit the Attendance Center; and the Power Elementary School District is now prohibited from transferring land within three miles of the Attendance Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b632 The Legislature vested the Cascade Board of County Commissioners and the Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction with the collective authority to establish a new elementary school in Cascade County. It is not this Court\u2019s function to divest elected officials of power that has been properly granted to them by the Legislature. The Vaughn School District failed to obtain the requisite approval to open a new elementary school under the laws of the State of Montana. I would accordingly conclude that the Attendance Center was not established as an elementary school under the laws of the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b633 I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-5\"> For instance, <em>compare </em>\u00a7 20-1-401(3), MCA (\u201cThe trustees shall certify to the <em>office of public instruction </em>that a school safety plan or emergency operations plan has been adopted.\u201d) <em>with </em>\u00a7 20-1-301(3), MCA (\u201c[T]he <em>superintendent of public instruction </em>shall reduce the direct state aid for the district for that school year by two times an hourly rate, as calculated by the <em>office of public instruction, </em>for the aggregate hours missed.\u201d) (Emphasis added.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\"> The Court concedes that the \u201crecord is devoid as to the Attendance Center\u2019s accreditation status as of the 2013-2014 year,\u201d but nonetheless argues that the Attendance Center \u201cwas granted regular accreditation status for the 2014 school year, as attested to by a certificate signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15 n.3. First, because the taxpayers here sought to transfer the land in 2013, the relevant inquiry is whether the Attendance Center was a \u201cschool\" within the meaning of \u00a7 20-6-105(l)(a)(iii), MCA, in 2013, not 2014. Thus, whether the Attendance Center later became a \u201cschool\u201d is irrelevant. Second, the \u201ccertificate\u201d the Court relies on to show that the Attendance Center was later accredited is not part of the record. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that evidence must be introduced for admission at a trial or hearing by a party. Evidence does not simply make its way into the record unless and until it is offered.\u201d <em>In re Adjudication of Existing Rights In the North End Subbasin of the Bitterroot River, </em>1999 MT 202, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 447, 98 P.3d 151. The Vaughn School District did not introduce the certificate into the record before the Territory Transfer Panel during the evidence phase of this case. The certificate was merely attached to the Vaughn School District\u2019s brief on appeal to the District Court. The Court\u2019s reliance on the document is improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
