We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIy\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the Defendants on the ground that Not Afraid failed to produce evidence demonstrating that the Defendants violated a standard of care.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">\u00b63 Not Afraid was severely injured during a single vehicle accident in the early morning hours of August 18,2009. The vehicle, driven by Jeremy Flatmouth, was traveling on Zimmerman Trail in Billings, Montana. Zimmerman Trail is a steep, winding, narrow road with Jersey-type concrete barriers along the sharp curve where the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>occurred. Flatmouth, who was intoxicated and speeding, struck the concrete barriers while navigating the sharp curve \u2014 causing the vehicle to go over the barriers and down a steep hillside. All of the occupants were ejected from the vehicle. One passenger died and Not Afraid was paralyzed as a result of the accident. Flatmouth was convicted of felony vehicular homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b64 Zimmerman Trail was a private road until it was deeded to Yellowstone County (County) in 1938. In the mid-1980s, the County, or a contractor hired by the County, installed the concrete barriers along the sharp curve where the accident took place. The County transferred its interest in Zimmerman Trail to the City of Billings (City) in 2005. In November 2005, the State of Montana (State) entered into an agreement with the City to carry out winter maintenance \u2014 such as plowing, sanding, ice control, and emergency closures \u2014 on Zimmerman Trail. This agreement ended in July 2009, approximately one month before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b65 Nearly two years after the accident, Not Afraid retained two accident reconstruction experts who visited the crash site and reviewed pertinent documents. The experts\u2019 four-page report estimated that the vehicle was traveling 45 miles per hour when it first struck the concrete barriers. The posted speed limit on Zimmerman Trail is 25 miles per hour. The experts found that, in June 2011 when they went to the scene, the concrete barriers were tilted approximately 15 degrees. Based on the concrete barriers\u2019 tilt, the experts concluded that the barriers were improperly installed and therefore, \u201cthe barriers were relatively ineffective in containing higher speed vehicles traveling around the curve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b66 Not Afraid subsequently filed two complaints \u2014 one against City Public Works Director David Mumford, and one against the State, the County, and the City. The complaint against Mumford alleged a products liability claim and both complaints alleged negligence in the concrete barriers\u2019 placement, installation, and maintenance. The District Court consolidated the cases following Not Afraid\u2019s unopposed motion,</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b67 The City retained its own accident reconstruction expert, who issued a 16-page report in May 2014. The City\u2019s expert determined that the vehicle was traveling between 68 and 73 miles per hour when it struck the barriers and that the barriers were tilted approximately 13 to 14 degrees at the time he inspected the scene in March 2014. The City\u2019s expert concluded that the barriers tilted as a result of the vehicle\u2019s impact. His conclusion was based on investigation photographs showing fresh disturbances in the gravel and staining of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the concrete at the base of the barriers, the barriers\u2019 measured geometry, and literature regarding barrier performance testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b68 On August 6,2014, the County moved for summary judgment on the ground that it could not be liable for the condition of Zimmerman Trail because it had transferred ownership of Zimmerman Trail to the City prior to the accident. On August 15, 2014, Mumford moved for summary judgment on the grounds that he was immune from Not Afraid\u2019s tort claims under \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, and that he could not be liable under the product liability claims. On August 18,2014, the State moved for summary judgment on the ground that it did not own, maintain, or control Zimmerman Trail, and thus, Not Afraid established no cognizable theory upon which to seek damages against the State. On August 28,2014, the City moved for summary judgment on the ground that Not Afraid failed to establish that the City breached a duty of care, in part because Not Afraid failed to establish the barriers\u2019 condition at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b69 The District Court issued orders granting Mumford\u2019s and the remaining Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Not Afraid appeals only the judgments in favor of the government entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b610 We review an entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dubiel v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>2012 MT 35, \u00b6 10, 364 Mont. 175, 272 P.3d 66. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 10. If this burden is met, \u201c[t]he burden then shifts to the party opposing summary judgment to \u2018present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of its case to raise a genuine issue of material fact,\u2019 or to show why the undisputed facts do not entitle the moving party to judgment.\u201d <em>Weber v. State, </em>2015 MT 161, \u00b6 12, 379 Mont. 388, 352 P.3d 8 (quoting <em>Dollar Plus Stores, Inc. v. R-Mont. Assocs., L.P., </em>2009 MT 164, \u00b6 27, 350 Mont. 476, 209 P.3d 216). The nonmoving party cannot satisfy its burden with \u201cmere denial, speculation, or conclusory assertions.\u201d <em>Phelps v. Frampton, </em>2007 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 330, 170 P.3d 474 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the Defendants on the ground that Not Afraid failed to produce evidence demonstrating that the Defendants violated a standard of care.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u00b612 As an initial matter, Not Afraid contends that the District Court improperly applied the summary judgment standard because the court \u201cwrongfully shifted the burden of proof to Not Afraid.\u201d Based on our review of the District Court\u2019s orders, we disagree. The court determined that the Defendants \u2014 the moving parties \u2014 met their initial burden by demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact regarding essential elements of Not Afraid\u2019s claims. The court then shifted the burden to Not Afraid \u2014 the party opposing summary judgment \u2014 to establish with substantial evidence that genuine issues of material fact did exist regarding those essential elements of his claims. The court, therefore, correctly applied the summary judgment standard. <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b613 Not Afraid asserts negligence claims against all of the Defendants and therefore must prove four essential elements as to each: \u201c(1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a legal duty, (2) the defendant breached that duty, (3) the breach was the actual and proximate cause of an injury to the plaintiff, and (4) damages resulted.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 540, 189 P.3d 615 (citations omitted). Although negligence actions ordinarily are inappropriate for summary judgment, \u201c[i]t is well established that if a plaintiff fails to offer proof of any one of the elements of a negligence claim, the negligence action fails and summary judgment in favor of the defendant is proper.\u201d <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Hinkle ex rel. Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. </em>#37, 2004 MT 175, \u00b6 23, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1230).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b614 In granting the Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions, the District Court concluded that Not Afraid failed to offer any proof regarding the standard of care by which to measure the Defendants\u2019 actions. Observing that Not Afraid did not produce evidence of any standards applicable to concrete barriers in Montana, the court found that Not Afraid failed to provide the requisite expert testimony relating to any standards the Defendants may have violated in the concrete barriers\u2019maintenance, placement, or installation. As such, the court held that Not Afraid failed to satisfy his burden of estabhshing with sufficient evidence \u2014 as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory assertions \u2014 that there were issues of material fact regarding the Defendants\u2019 breach of any duties of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b615 Not Afraid claims in general fashion that the Defendants had a duty to properly maintain, place, and install the barriers on Zimmerman Trail. He asserts that the Defendants\u2019 breach of those alleged duties resulted in his injuries. He contends that his experts\u2019 report, crash site photographs, and the County\u2019s Road and Bridge Director\u2019s deposition testimony provide evidence from which a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>reasonably could infer negligence in the concrete barriers\u2019 placement, installation, and maintenance. The Defendants respond that Not Afraid first must establish the standard of care by which to measure their actions; \u201cin other words, [he] must establish the degree of prudence, attention, and caution [that the Defendants] must exercise in fulfilling that duty of care.\u201d <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Dalton v. Kalispell Reg\u2019l Hosp., </em>256 Mont. 243, 247, 846 P.2d 960, 962 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b616 M. R. Evid. 702 provides: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert... may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Based in part on M. R. Evid. 702, we have held that expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care in cases where professional duties may not be apparent to a layperson. <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 18 (holding that plaintiff was required to present expert testimony to establish the standard of care applicable to the Montana Department of Transportation\u2019s decision-making process for closing a road); <em>Dulaney v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2014 MT 127, \u00b6 21, 375 Mont. 117, 324 P.3d 1211 (holding that plaintiffs failure to obtain an expert witness resulted in an \u201cinsufficiency of proof regarding [the] duty\u201d of an insurance agent to advise his client on sufficient coverage); <em>Dayberry v. City ofE. Helena, </em>2003 MT 321, \u00b6 21, 318 Mont. 301, 80 P.3d 1218 (holding that expert testimony was required to determine whether the depth of a swimming pool was unreasonably dangerous for the diving board length in a case against a swimming pool operator).</p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">\u00b617  We recognized in <em>Dubiel </em>that governmental highway maintenance activities may be outside the common experience of jurors. <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-18. The County\u2019s Road and Bridge Director testified that he relied on engineers in making decisions involving Jersey barriers. The City acknowledges its duty to keep roadways in a reasonably safe condition for ordinary use; that Flatmouth\u2019s vehicle flipped over the barriers at an excessive rate of speed, the City argues, does not evidence that the City breached its duty. We agree. Like in <em>Dubiel, </em>we conclude that the placement, installation, and maintenance of concrete barriers is \u201csufficiently beyond the common experiences\u201d of a lay jury. <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 17. Expert testimony would assist the trier of fact in determining whether the Defendants\u2019 placement, installation, and maintenance of those barriers did not keep the roadway reasonably safe for ordinary or foreseeable use. Not Afraid therefore was required to produce expert testimony to establish the standard of care by which to measure the Defendants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u00b618 Not Afraid contends that his experts raised sufficient factual issues in this regard to survive summary judgment. In support of his contention that the County breached its duty of care by negligently installing the barriers, Not Afraid argues that his experts \u201cclearly demonstrated that [Not Afraid\u2019s] injuries were caused by the improper installation of the barriers.,. .\u201d Not Afraid\u2019s experts\u2019 report, however, does not establish by substantial evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the County\u2019s breach of a duty of care. It simply concludes that the position in which the experts found the. barriers \u201cnecessarily reduced the barriers\u2019 ability to hold vehicles to the inside of the curve.\u201d Not Afraid failed to provide any evidence regarding standards for concrete barrier installation in Montana or the vehicle speeds that such barriers should be able to withstand. Moreover, the experts\u2019 finding that the barriers were tipped 15 degrees in June 2011 \u2014 nearly two years after the accident \u2014 is not sufficient to establish beyond speculation or conclusory assertion that the barriers were placed and installed improperly in the 1980s. Finally, Not Afraid\u2019s references to the Road and Bridge Director\u2019s deposition testimony regarding barrier placement on other County roads is not substantial evidence of a standard of care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not Afraid has therefore failed to establish \u201cthe degree of prudence, attention, and caution\u201d that the County must have exercised in placing and installing the concrete barriers twenty-five to thirty years ago. <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b619  Not Afraid\u2019s next contention is that the City breached its duty of care by improperly maintaining the concrete barriers. Not Afraid argues that his experts \u201cclearly demonstrated that [Not Afraid\u2019s] injuries were caused by the ... lack of maintenance of [the] barriers.\u201d Again, however, Not Afraid has offered no evidence regarding standards for concrete barrier maintenance in Montana. In fact, Not Afraid\u2019s experts did not mention maintenance at all, let alone standards the City allegedly breached in the concrete barriers\u2019 maintenance. The experts\u2019 opinions are confined to installation of the barriers; the report is silent as to any alleged relationship between the City\u2019s maintenance and Not Afraid\u2019s injuries. Not Afraid has failed to \u201cestablish the standard of care by which to measure\u201d the City\u2019s maintenance of the barriers or what acts or omissions by the City violated any such standard. <em>Dubiel, </em>\u00b6 14. Not Afraid therefore has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>failed to establish with substantial evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists concerning breach of the City\u2019s duty of care in maintaining the concrete barriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b620 Finally, Not Afraid argues that the State breached its duty of care by improperly maintaining the concrete barriers. Not Afraid contends that the State had a duty to maintain the barriers based on the State\u2019s agreement with the City to conduct winter maintenance on Zimmerman Trail. As Not Afraid concedes, the State\u2019s maintenance agreement was limited to winter road maintenance and ended \u201capproximately one month before the wreck occurred.\u201d The agreement did not pertain to maintenance activity involving the concrete barriers. The State\u2019s expired winter maintenance agreement cannot be the predicate for the State\u2019s alleged duty to maintain the barriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b621  Not Afraid\u2019s general assertions that his claim against the State nonetheless is proper because the Defendants \u201cdid not set forth to the court how they provided maintenance,\u201d and that \u201cone or all of [the Defendants] were providing maintenance\u201d of Zimmerman Trail do not satisfy his burden of establishing specific facts \u2014 as opposed to speculation or conjecture \u2014 regarding breach of any duty of care by the State. Again, Not Afraid\u2019s experts\u2019 conclusions discuss only installation of the barriers. Not Afraid has therefore failed to offer proof that the State had a duty to maintain the barriers and that the State breached its alleged duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b622 In sum, Not Afraid\u2019s summary judgment submissions suffer from \u201can insufficiency of proof regarding\u201d breach of the Defendants\u2019 alleged duties to properly place, install, and maintain the concrete barriers. <em>Dulaney, </em>\u00b6 21. Not Afraid has therefore failed to offer substantial evidence of one of the essential elements of his negligence claim against each Defendant. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b623 The District Court correctly granted summary judgment to each of the Defendants on the ground that Not Afraid failed to raise an issue of material fact regarding the breach of their alleged duties of care. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"> Contrary to Not Afraid\u2019s argument, the witness did not acknowledge erosion of the shoulder, water build-up, or improper placement of the barriers in the stretch of roadway where the incident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
