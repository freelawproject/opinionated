We restate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in not applying the statutory homestead exemption to the tax lien sale on Stewart\u2019s property.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court should have considered the Flathead County Tax Assessor\u2019s failure to investigate Stewart\u2019s complaints regarding irregular tax assessments on Stewart\u2019s property.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court deprived Stewart of due process by denying her request for a hearing.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b63 Stewart owned and lived on real property located at 6655 Highway 93 South, Lakeside, in Flathead County, Montana (property). The property also is known as Lots 40,41, and 42 of the unrecorded plat of Mission View Terrace. On April 27, 2001, Stewart recorded a Declaration of Homestead for the property pursuant to \u00a7 70-32-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b64 Beginning in 2006, Stewart failed to pay real property taxes on the property. As a result, on July 15,2008, the Flathead County Treasurer (County) held a tax lien sale for the delinquent taxes. There was not a purchaser for the tax lien at the sale, so the County was listed as the purchaser of the tax hen pursuant to \u00a7 15-17-214, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\u00b65 On January 11, 2011, RN &amp; DB paid $5,306.89 to the County Treasurer for the delinquent taxes, penalties, interests, and costs for the year 2007 and thereafter. On that same day, the County Treasurer assigned the County\u2019s interest in the tax lien to RN &amp; DB.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">\u00b66 On July 6,2011, RN &amp; DB mailed a Notice That Tax Deed May be Issued to Stewart via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address disclosed by records at the office of the County Clerk. RN &amp; DB also published the same Notice in the <em>Daily Interlake </em>newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">\u00b67 Upon recording proof of notice, the County Clerk and Recorder advised RN &amp; DB that it had failed to file proof of notice within 30 days of mailing or publishing the notice as required by statute. In an attempt to start the tax deed application process over, RN &amp; DB then mailed Stewart a second Notice That Tax Deed May be Issued on August 30,2011. The second notice included an inaccurate amount of tax due and was not published.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">\u00b68 The County issued a tax deed to RN &amp; DB on November 7, 2011. The initial tax deed had an incomplete property description, rendering it defective. The County issued a corrected tax deed on November 28, 2011. RN &amp; DB subsequently filed an action to quiet title to the property. Stewart contested the action on the ground that the tax deed issued to RN &amp; DB was void due to multiple problems with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>statutory notice processes. In that action, Stewart was represented by counsel. The court found that RN &amp; DB had failed strictly to comply with the specific statutory requirements for issuance of a tax deed. As a result, the court held that the County Treasurer was without jurisdiction to issue the tax deed and the tax deed was therefore void <em>ab initio. </em>The court dismissed the cause without prejudice on August 22, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b69 After continuing to pay the delinquent taxes, RN &amp; DB applied for a tax deed to the property again in late 2013, having paid a total amount of $13,722.69 in taxes, penalties, interest, and costs. This time, Stewart did not contest the tax deed on grounds of problems with the statutory notice process. Stewart did not redeem the property within 60 days of the day she received the Notice That Tax Deed May be Issued. The County issued a tax deed to RN &amp; DB on December 9, 2013. RN &amp; DB recorded the tax deed the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b610 RN &amp; DB then filed a second action to quiet title to the property. Stewart was personally served with the complaint on January 22, 2014. The District Court entered default judgment against Stewart and a decree of quiet title to the property in favor of RN &amp; DB on February 18, 2014. Several months later, appearing pro se, Stewart moved to vacate the judgment based, in part, on her belief that the notice of the tax deed issuance was from the prior action. The court set aside the entry of default and the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u00b611 Stewart filed an answer claiming that her property was exempt from execution or forced sale under Montana\u2019s homestead laws. RN &amp; DB moved for summary judgment on the ground that there was no forced sale or execution because a tax deed extinguishes a delinquent payer\u2019s title and creates a fresh title granted directly by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">\u00b612 The District Court granted RN &amp; DB\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding no genuine issues of material fact, and entered a decree quieting title in favor of RN &amp; DB on April 30, 2015. Stewart moved for a stay of judgment pending this appeal. The District Court granted the motion. Stewart appeals the judgment and decree of quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u00b613 We review summary judgment rulings <em>de novo, </em>applying the criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2015 MT 264, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 59, 357 P.3d 320 (citing <em>Tin Cup Cnty. Water v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating Inc., </em>2008 MT 434, \u00b6 21, 347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60). Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Anderson v. BNSF Ry., </em>2015 MT 240, \u00b6 15, 380 Mont. 319, 354 P.3d 1248. If there are no genuine issues of material fact, we review for correctness the district court\u2019s conclusion that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Zinvest, LLC v. Hudgins, </em>2014 MT 201, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 72, 330 P.3d 1135. A statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Zinvest, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a hearing on a summary judgment motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Goetz, </em>2014 MT 150, \u00b6 9, 375 Mont. 281, 327 P.3d 483. A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Dollar Plus Stores, Inc., v. R-Mont. Assocs., L.P., </em>2009 MT 164, \u00b6 15, 350 Mont. 476, 209 P.3d 216 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in not applying the statutory homestead exemption to the tax lien sale on Stewart\u2019s property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b616 Section 70-32-201, MCA, provides that homestead property generally is exempt from execution or forced sale. Section 70-32-202, MCA, provides three exceptions to the general exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">A homestead is subject to execution or forced sale in satisfaction of judgments obtained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">(1) on debts secured by construction or vendor\u2019s liens upon the premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">(2) on debts secured by mortgages on the premises, executed and acknowledged by the husband and wife or by an unmarried claimant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">(3) on debts secured by mortgages on the premises, executed and recorded before the declaration of homestead was filed for record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">\u00b617 The District Court concluded that the homestead exemption provides no protection from the sale of a tax lien. Based on \u00a7\u00a7 70-32-201 to -202, MCA, Stewart contends that summary judgment was improper on that question because there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether the homestead exemption applies. Stewart alleges, \u201cIt was <em>plainly </em>disputed between the parties as to whether rights of homestead protect against a tax deed execution.\u201d Stewart is mistaken that the parties\u2019 dispute over whether the homestead exemption applies constitutes a genuine issue of material fact. Application of the homestead exemption is a legal issue, not a factual issue. As such, Stewart has not raised an issue of material fact. In the absence of factual issues, we must determine whether RN &amp; DB <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Zinvest, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b618 In concluding that the homestead exemption did not protect Stewart from a tax lien sale, the District Court cited \u00a7 15-18-211, MCA, That section provides that the \u201ccounty treasurer shall grant the purchaser a tax deed for the property\u201d once the redemption period has passed and the property is not redeemed. According to the court, the statutory procedure for issuing a tax deed is not a forced sale or execution in satisfaction of judgment; rather, \u201cit is a grant of deed from the sovereign and therefore not subject to the homestead exemption.\u201d The court, relying in part on <em>Collier v. Kincheloe, </em>2008 MT 100, 342 Mont. 314, 180 P.3d 1157, held that a tax deed extinguishes title in the original owner and creates a brand new title with the purchaser now holding fee simple to the property. The District Court also noted, \u201cIt makes sense that the sovereign would not grant exemptions for tax debts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b619 Stewart argues that because property tax liens are not explicitly excepted from the homestead exemption by \u00a7 70-32-202, MCA, the District Court did not have authority to issue a decree quieting title to the property. Stewart claims that, when the County issued the tax deed to RN &amp; DB <em>\u201cin exchange </em>for payment of unpaid taxes,\u201d it constituted the type of forced sale implicated under \u00a7 70-32-201, MCA. Stewart also claims that when RN &amp; DB sought <em>\u201cexecution </em>upon the tax deed through <em>execution </em>of a quiet title,\u201d it constituted the type of execution implicated under \u00a7 70-32-101, MCA. Stewart reasons that \u00a7 15-16-401, MCA, entitled Tax Due as Judgment or Lien, supports her argument on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b620 Stewart argues that the District Court erred in applying <em>Collier </em>because <em>Collier </em>concerned a party who had a life estate instead of a homestead declaration. Stewart posits that there is \u201cno genuine causal relationship\u201d between homestead law and life estate law because a homestead \u201cprovides specific and exact exemptions from execution or forced sale,\u201d while a life estate \u201cprovides no immunity under law to execution upon the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b621 RN &amp; DB supports the District Court\u2019s observation that \u201cit makes sense\u201d not to grant exemptions for tax debts, asserting that the purpose of tax lien statutes is to provide for a reliable method of collecting property taxes. RN &amp; DB argues that the Legislature could not have intended to allow property owners \u201cto opt out of the property tax system simply by filing homestead claims.\u201d RN &amp; DB emphasizes that nothing in the homestead statutes\u2019 legislative history mentions an intent to abrogate the enforcement of property tax liens, RN &amp; DB also points out that nothing in the tax lien statutes\u2019 legislative history suggests an intent to exempt homestead property from tax liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u00b622 Title 15, Chapters 16 through 18, of the Montana Code set forth Montana\u2019s property tax lien and tax deed enforcement procedures. This Court has held that the statutory procedures for the issuance of a tax deed require strict technical compliance. <em>Showell v. Brosten, </em>2008 MT 261, \u00b6 14, 345 Mont. 108, 189 P.3d 1210 (citation omitted). Section 15-16-403, MCA, provides that \u201cevery tax due upon real property is a lien against the property assessed...\u201d A \u201clien\u201d is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust by which it is made security for the performance of an act. Section 71-3-101(2), MCA. A property tax hen is \u201ca hen acquired by the payment at a tax lien sale of all outstanding dehnquent taxes, including penalties, interest, and costs.\u201d Section 15-17-121(4), MCA. A tax lien sale, with respect to real property and improvements, occurs when the county treasurer offers the sale of a property tax hen representing dehnquent taxes, including penalties, interest, and costs. Section 15-17-121(7)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b623 A person purchases a tax hen by paying the dehnquent taxes, together with penalties, interest, and costs. Section 15-17-121(5), MCA. If no person purchases the tax lien on the first day of the tax hen sale, the county is considered to be the purchaser and the tax lien sale certificate is assigned to the county treasurer. Section 15-17-214, MCA. Where the county is the purchaser, the tax hen sale certificate \u201cmust be assigned by the county treasurer to any person who, after providing proof of mail notice to the person to whom the property was assessed ... pays to the county the amount of dehnquent taxes, including penalties, interest, and costs, accruing from the date of delinquency.\u201d Section 15-17-323, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b624 Sections 15-18-111(1), -211, MCA, allow the holder of a tax hen sale certificate to apply for a tax deed to the property after a redemption period of 36 months from the sale has elapsed and after giving at least 60 days\u2019 notice to the owner and other interested persons. Section 15-18-212, MCA, requires that the purchaser or assignee of a tax lien sale certificate give notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">(1) Not more than 60 days prior to and not more than 60 days following the expiration of the redemption period provided in 15-18-111, a notice must be given as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">(b) for each property for which there has been issued a tax hen sale certificate to a purchaser other than the county or for which an assignment has been made, the purchaser or assignee, as appropriate, shall notify all persons considered interested parties in the property, if any, that a tax deed will be issued to the purchaser or assignee unless the property tax hen is redeemed prior to the expiration date of the redemption period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(4)(a) The notice required under subsections (1) and (2) must be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each interested party and the current occupant, if any, of the property</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Section 15-18-212( l)(b), (4)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b625 If a tax lien is not redeemed in the time allowed, \u201cthe county treasurer shall grant the purchaser a tax deed for the property.\u201d Section 15-18-211, MCA. Subject to only a few specific exceptions that do not apply here, a tax deed conveys to the grantee \u201cabsolute title to the property described in the deed as of the date of expiration of the redemption period, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances ... .\u201d Section 15-18-214, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b626 In a quiet title action, a tax deed purchaser may obtain an order from the court directed to the \u201ctrue owner\u201d \u2014 the person who owns the property; has an interest in or lien upon the property; has a right to redeem the property; or has rights hostile to the tax title. Section 15-18-411(1), MCA. Stewart is the \u201ctrue owner\u201d of the property in this case. The court order may command the true owner to deposit with the court for the use of the purchaser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(A) the amount of all taxes, interest, penalties, and costs that would have accrued if the property had been regularly and legally assessed and taxed as the property of the true owner and was about to be redeemed by the true owner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(B) the amount of all sums reasonably paid by the purchaser following the order and after 3 years from the date of the tax lien sale to preserve the property or to make improvements on the property while in the purchaser's possession, as the total amount of the taxes, interest, penalties, costs, and improvements is alleged by the plaintiff and as must appear in the order; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">(ii) show cause on a date to be fixed in the order, not exceeding 30 days from the date of the order, why the payment should not be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Section 15-18-411(l)(c)(i), (ii), MCA. The deposit described above is not required of a person found to be indigent by the court following an examination into the matter by the court and upon the request of a true owner claiming to be indigent. Section 15-18-411(l)(d), MCA. If the court does not find that the true owner is indigent, or if the true owner fails to pay the deposit within the time fixed by the court, the true owner is considered to have waived any defects in the tax proceedings and any right of redemption. Section 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA. In that case, \u201cthe true owner has no claim of any kind against the state or purchaser and a decree must be entered in the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>quieting title of the purchaser as against the true owner.\u201d Section 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b627 Tax deed proceedings require strict compliance with statutory requirements because they implicate an owner\u2019s fundamental interests. <em>Hansen Trust v. Ward, </em>2015 MT 131, \u00b6 26, 379 Mont. 161, 349 P.3d 500. <em>In Hansen Trust, </em>although the property at issue was not homestead property, we recognized the power of the tax deed statutes by stating that if a purchaser strictly follows the statutory requirements, an \u201cowner risks losing his or her real property for the failure to pay the property taxes.\u201d <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 26. It is undisputed that in this action, RN &amp; DB strictly complied with the statutory requirements. Stewart\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 15-16-401, MCA, to argue that a tax deed has the effect of a judgment or execution, is misplaced; that section applies to personal property, not to real property. Section 15-16- 401, MCA, in pertinent part, provides that \u201cevery tax has the effect of a judgment against the person, and every lien created by this title has the force and effect of an execution duly levied against all <em>personal property </em>in the possession of the person assessed from and after the date the assessment is made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b628 In contrast, a tax imposed on real property and unpaid when due becomes a hen against the property. Section 15-16-403, MCA. The statutes provide for the sale of a tax hen, not the sale of the property itself. Sections 15-17-121(7)(a), -212, MCA. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 15-17-121(7)(a), MCA (with respect to real property, a tax lien sale is \u201cthe offering for sale by the county treasurer of a property tax hen representing dehnquent taxes, including penalties, interests, and costs\u201d) <em>with </em>\u00a7 15-17- 12 l(7)(b), MCA (with respect to personal property, a tax lien sale is \u201cthe offering for sale by the county treasurer of the personal property on which the taxes are dehnquent or other personal property on which the dehnquent taxes are a hen\u201d). With respect to real property, until the tax deed is issued, the tax sale purchaser has neither legal nor equitable title but merely a hen against the property, which ripens into title through the statutory process. <em>Higgins v. Mont. Hotel Corp., </em>181 Mont. 149, 153, 592 P.2d 930, 933 (1979); <em>State ex rel. City of Billings v. Osten, </em>91 Mont. 76, 81, 5 P.2d 562, 565 (1931). Present title remains in the former owner subject to the hen or encumbrance of the purchaser as security for the money paid at the sale. <em>State ex rel. Tillman v. Dist. Ct., </em>101 Mont. 176, 182-83, 53 P.2d 107, 110 (1936). \u201cUntil the tax deed is issued, the tax sale procedure is essentially nothing more than a tax collection device.\u201d 5-39 Richard R. Powell, <em>Powell on Real Property, </em>\u00a7 39.04,39-63 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"ALGn\">\u00b629 The owner is given notice and has the opportunity to redeem the hen at multiple steps throughout the process. Sections 15-17-122, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>15-18-111, -212, -411, -412, MCA. At the end of the process, if the property tax hen is not redeemed in the manner prescribed by the statutes or in the time allowed by law, the purchaser of the hen acquires the property by tax deed, \u00a7 15-18-211, MCA, imposing \u201cthe ultimate sanction of losing title to the property.\u201d Powell, <em>supra, </em>at 39-64. It is undisputed that Stewart did not redeem the hen in the manner or time allowed by law: she did not prevent the tax lien sale by paying the delinquent taxes, including penalties, interest, and costs prior to the sale; she did not redeem the hen within 60 days \u2014 or at any time thereafter \u2014 following the Notice That Tax Deed May be Issued; and she neither deposited funds with the court nor requested during the quiet title action that the court waive the deposit requirement on the ground of indigence. As such, Stewart is considered to have waived any defects in the tax proceedings and any right of redemption. Section 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b630 We analyzed the effect of a tax deed on former titles to property in <em>Collier. </em>In <em>Collier, </em>a life estate holder failed to pay his property taxes and Rosebud County acquired a tax deed to the property. This Court held that Rosebud County\u2019s title was complete and eliminated the remainder interests held by the life estate holder\u2019s children. We held that the \u201ctax deed created a new title, extinguishing all former titles and liens not expressly exempted from its operation....\u201d <em>Collier, </em>\u00b6 16. <em>Accord McDonald v. Grassle, </em>228 Mont. 25, 30, 740 P.2d 1122, 1125 (1987) (stating, \u201ca tax deed is not derivative but creates a new title in the nature of an independent grant from the sovereign, extinguishing all former titles and liens not expressly exempted from its operation\u201d). Here, Stewart similarly failed to pay property taxes and the County acquired a tax hen on her property. The tax hen sale certificate did not grant title to the property either to the County or to RN &amp; DB; as such, there was no sale of the property at that time. Like in <em>Collier, </em>where Rosebud County\u2019s acquisition of a tax deed to the property created a new title and \u201cextinguished all former titles\u201d including remainder interests, when Stewart failed to redeem the property and when RN &amp; DB obtained a tax deed to the property, the tax deed conveyed absolute title to it \u2014 free and clear of all liens and encumbrances \u2014 and extinguished all former titles, including Stewart\u2019s homestead claim. <em>Collier, </em>\u00b6 16; \u00a7 15-18-214, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b631  Based on the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the homestead exemption statutes set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 70-30-201 to -202, MCA, do not apply to property tax hen or property tax deed sales. A majority of jurisdictions agree with our conclusion. 40 Am. Jur. 2d Homestead \u00a7 91 (2015) (stating, \u201cIn most jurisdictions, liability of homestead property for taxes does not differ from that of other property and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>state or municipality can proceed against it as though there were no exemption law in existence.\u201d); <em>Morrison v. Barham, </em>184 Cal. App. 2d 267, 272 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1960) (holding that the general homestead exemption \u201cmay not be invoked to defeat claims against the holder for taxes and assessments against the homestead property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b632 A tax is \u201can enforced contribution from the people\u201d for the purpose of raising \u201cthe necessary revenue for the support of the government and the consequent security of the people in the possession of their property.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Tillman, </em>101 Mont. at 181, 53 P.2d at 110. \u201cFailure to pay taxes is a serious breach of an individual\u2019s social obligations. Public policy requirements for prompt payment of taxes assessed against property give rise to drastic measures to enforce collection of taxes that are delinquent.\u201d Powell, <em>supra, </em>at 39-37. Through the Legislature\u2019s enactment of property tax lien laws, it has established the policy of the state \u201cto collect the taxes, not to divest the owner of the property to which the hen for taxes attaches.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Billings, </em>91 Mont. at 79, 5 P.2d at 564. \u201cYet, if the tax is not paid promptly, the taxing authority may enforce its hen by a legal taking of the property or by sale of the property. Clearly the need for the individual to pay its obhgations is strong, so the remedy, if such obhgations are not paid, is powerful.\u201d Powell, <em>supra, </em>at 39-37. Montana law reflects this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">The sale of property for taxes is a device to compel the owner to pay his share of the burden of government. If he does not pay within the time allowed, his property will be sold subject to redemption, but with added burdens consisting of penalties, interest and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"><em>State ex rel. Billings, </em>91 Mont. at 79, 5 P.2d at 564. The effect of these statutes may seem harsh when applied, as here, to deprive a homesteader of the full value of her property over the non-payment of a relatively small amount of tax liability. In a tax deed case, however, \u201ca citizen\u2019s right to own property is challenged by the government and the assignee of a tax sale certificate, almost always for a payment by the assignee to the government of far less than the property\u2019s full value.\u201d <em>Isern v. Summerfield, </em>1998 MT 45, \u00b6 9, 287 Mont. 461, 956 P.2d 28. By the same token, \u201c[pjayment of the underlying tax delinquency terminates the lien as well as sale of the property in a tax lien enforcement action.\u201d Powell, <em>supra, </em>at 39-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b633 The imposition of taxes and the administration of tax deeds are exclusively creatures of statute. Mont. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 3. The Legislature has crafted a comprehensive scheme to address a property owner\u2019s non-payment of taxes. It is the Court\u2019s function to apply those statutes as written. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Stewart\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>would insulate a homesteader from her obligation to pay taxes on the property, a conclusion that does not find support in the statutes. The record in this case demonstrates that county officials and the court gave Stewart all the protections that the law affords, including rejecting defective notice, setting aside the first faulty tax deed, and withdrawing issuance of default judgment against Stewart. Because the homestead exemptions do not apply to property tax lien sales, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to RN &amp; DB on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b634 <em>2. Whether the District Court should have considered the Flathead County Tax Assessor\u2019s failure to investigate Stewart\u2019s complaints regarding irregular tax assessments on Stewart\u2019s property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b635 Stewart claims that RN &amp; DB made erroneous reports to the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office resulting in \u201can exorbitant increase\u201d in her property taxes. Stewart contends that in or around May 2013, she reported these alleged \u201cirregular\u201d assessments to the County but that the Tax Assessor\u2019s Office \u201cdisregarded her request.\u201d Stewart states that she reported her assessment dispute to the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office, rather than to the Montana Department of Revenue, because the taxes in dispute were issued by the County. Stewart argues that the County should not have issued a tax deed \u201cwhile the irregular assessment was under contest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b636 Section 15-7-101, MCA, establishes that it is the Department of Revenue\u2019s duty to appraise \u201call taxable city and town lots\u201d and \u201call taxable rural and urban improvements.\u201d Section 15-7-101(l)(b)-(c), MCA. Property assessment notices are sent to the owner of real property whenever there is a re-appraisal or change in ownership, classification, or value of property. Sections 15-7-102, -138, MCA. If an owner is dissatisfied with the appraisal as it reflects the market value of the property, \u201cthe owner may request an assessment review by submitting an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the department for that purpose\u201d within 30 days after receipt of the notice of appraisal and classification. Section 15-7-102(3)(a), MCA. The county tax appeal board may not reduce the valuation of property unless the taxpayer makes a written application for reduction and submits it for filing with the county clerk and recorder. Section 15-15-102, MCA. The county treasurer may not sell the property or a property tax lien, if, prior to the tax hen sale, the county treasurer discovers that the property on which the taxes are delinquent has been irregularly assessed. Section 15-17-124, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b637 RN &amp; DB contends that Stewart\u2019s arguments on the value of the tax assessments cannot be the basis for denying the validity of the tax lien and tax deed because she \u201cfail[ed] to follow the statutory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>administrative procedure for objecting to appraisals and property classifications.\u201d RN &amp; DB further contends that \u00a7 15-17-124, MCA, does not apply to Stewart\u2019s argument because she objected to the assessment of her property taxes sometime in May 2013 and the tax lien sale occurred in July 2008. Therefore, according to RN &amp; DB, the County Treasurer would not have discovered any irregularities in the assessment \u201cprior to the tax lien sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b638 The District Court concluded that Stewart had not properly reported irregular tax assessments. The court relied on the affidavit of Holly Dale, Lead Property Valuation Specialist for the Office of the Montana Department of Revenue, who testified that the assessments for the property were in accordance with Montana law and with other tax assessment notices for all other property in the County and in the State of Montana. Dale testified that Stewart \u201chas never filed a request for informal review or an appeal on the property... .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b639 Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Stewart failed to object timely or properly to the tax assessment on her property. There is no evidence that Stewart submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the Department of Revenue within 30 days after receipt of the notice of appraisal pursuant to \u00a7 15-7-102(3), MCA. There is no evidence that Stewart made and filed a written application for reduction in valuation with the county clerk and recorder pursuant to \u00a7 15-15-102, MCA. Stewart did not make her objection \u201cprior to the tax hen sale\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 15-17-124, MCA. Also, as noted above, Stewart did not make the required deposit or seek exemption from the deposit requirement once RN &amp; DB filed the quiet title action; under \u00a7 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA, she is deemed to have waived any defects in the proceedings. Therefore, her claims now are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b640 3. <em>Whether the District Court deprived Stewart of due process by denying her request for a hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u00b641 Stewart argues that the District Court deprived her of due process when it \u201cdeliberately disregarded\u201d her request for a summary judgment hearing. Stewart claims that she made a specific request for a hearing on grounds that the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office would not voluntarily submit an affidavit regarding Stewart\u2019s alleged reports disputing the property\u2019s tax assessment. Stewart claims that subpoenaing the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office and holding a hearing was the \u201conly means\u201d by which to obtain testimony about Stewart\u2019s reported dispute and to \u201ccounter\u201d Holly Dale\u2019s affidavit. Stewart contends that, upon request to the District Court, she was entitled to a hearing under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u00b642 RN &amp; DB argues that the District Court did not deny Stewart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>right to due process because 1) Stewart failed to comply with Rule 56(c)(2) hearing request requirements and 2) because the testimony Stewart sought to introduce \u201ccould not have affected the validity of the County\u2019s tax lien purchase, its subsequent assignment to [RN &amp; DB], or the tax deed issued to [RN &amp; DB].\u201d RN &amp; DB argues that Stewart\u2019s hearing request was untimely because she failed to follow the District Court\u2019s specific instructions \u2014 requiring parties to include a proposed Order and self-addressed, stamped envelope \u2014 for making a hearing request. RN &amp; DB also points out that Rule 56 \u201cdoes not authorize live testimony\u201d and argues that the most favorable testimony the County Tax assessor could have offered \u201cwould be the same as what Exhibit B to [Stewart\u2019s] Brief avers: That she appeared at [the County Tax Assessor\u2019s] office in May 2013 to complain of some \u2018fees assigned to her tax bill.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b643 Rule 56(c)(2)(A) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cthe right to hearing is waived unless a party requests a hearing within 14 days after the time for filing a reply brief has expired.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The purpose of a hearing is for the district court to consider \u201cnot so much legal arguments, but rather whether there exists genuine issues of material fact.\u201d <em>Cole v. Flathead </em>Cnty., 236 Mont. 412, 418, 771 P.2d 97, 101 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b644 A district court may grant a motion for summary judgment without first holding a hearing. <em>Chapman v. Maxwell, </em>2014 MT 35, \u00b6 11, 374 Mont. 12, 322 P.3d 1029 (citing <em>SVKV L.L.C. v. Harding, </em>2006 MT 297, \u00b6 37, 334 Mont. 395, 148 P.3d 584). We have held that \u201cthere may be an occasion where the movant is so \u2018clearly entitled\u2019 as a matter of law to summary judgment that the district court may dispense with the need for a hearing.\u201d <em>Richards v. Cnty. of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 453, \u00b6 17, 354 Mont. 334, 223 P.3d 878 (citing <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101). Thus, we will not put a district court in error for failing to hold a summary judgment hearing if the hearing testimony would not raise any issue of material fact. <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (holding that a summary judgment hearing was not necessary and \u201cwould not have added anything to the proceedings\u201d because defendant\u2019s \u201cone lone memorandum\u201d would not raise an issue of material fact); <em>Dollar Plus, </em>\u00b6 39 (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment without first holding a hearing because defendant gave \u201cno indication of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>evidence it would have presented at the hearing that would have helped it establish a genuine issue of material fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b645 RN &amp; DB filed its motion and brief for summary judgment on December 18,2014. On December 22,2014, the District Court ordered a briefing schedule, requiring briefs and affidavits from Stewart by January 12, 2015, and reply briefs and affidavits by RN &amp; DB by January 27, 2015. Stewart filed a response brief and affidavit on January 12, 2015, objecting to the summary judgment motion and requesting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b646 Although we agree with Stewart that she did not waive her right to request a hearing, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying her request because there was \u201cno indication that the evidence [Stewart] would have presented at the hearing would have helped [her] establish a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Dollar Plus, </em>\u00b6 39. Stewart claims that testimony from the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office would have raised an issue of material fact by showing that she had disputed the irregular assessments to that office. But, even if Stewart\u2019s factual assertion is true, the most the County Tax Assessor\u2019s Office could have offered would be that she informally disputed the taxes to that office in or around May 2013. Such testimony \u201cwould not have added anything\u201d as to the validity of the County\u2019s tax lien purchase, its subsequent assignment to RN &amp; DB, or the tax deed issued to RN &amp; DB in light of Stewart\u2019s failures to comply with the statutory processes discussed above. <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b647  The testimony Stewart sought to introduce raised no genuine issue of material fact and RN &amp; DB was \u201cclearly entitled\u201d to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Richards, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment without holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\u00b648 For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s judgment and decree of quiet title are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> Although we have decided only a few cases interpreting M.
