His will appointed his grandson, John Watkins, personal representative. The will devised three lots and five certificates of deposit to Schreiber\u2019s granddaughter, Jaime Harlicker, and the children of Schreiber\u2019s grandson, Donald Watkins. The personal representative was also the residuary beneficiary of the will. Between the time Schreiber executed his will and the date of his death, he sold the lots and certificates of deposit. In his capacity as personal representative, John Watkins traced the proceeds from the sale of the lots and the certificates of deposit using the \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d accounting method, and concluded that Schreiber had spent all the proceeds of the sales prior to the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">\u00b62 The personal representative filed a final accounting and petition for distribution with the Fifth Judicial District Court, Beaverhead County, that called for Jaime Harlicker and the children of Donald Watkins to receive nothing, and the residuary beneficiary to receive the net distributable estate. The named beneficiaries objected to the personal representative\u2019s methods and conclusions. The District Court denied the final accounting and petition for distribution, finding that the personal representative breached his fiduciary duty by interpreting the will to benefit himself at the expense of other beneficiaries. The personal representative appealed. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the District Court for issuance of an amended order in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">\u00b63 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in concluding that the devises of the lots and the certificates of deposit had not been adeemed and the named beneficiaries were thus entitled to a distribution amounting to the value of the lots and the certificates of deposit?</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err when it rejected the final accounting submitted by the personal representative?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b66 August J. Schreiber of Beaverhead County died testate on September 30,2013. His Last Will and Testament and the First Codicil to Last Will and Testament (collectively the \u201cWill\u201d) were admitted to informal probate on October 10, 2013. In accordance with Schreiber\u2019s Will, his grandson, John Watkins (hereafter \u201cJohn\u201d or the \"personal representative\u201d), was appointed personal representative. John is also the residuary beneficiary under his grandfather\u2019s Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b67 Paragraph 12 of Schreiber\u2019s Will provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">I hereby give, devise and bequeath unto JAMIE HARLICKER and to the children of DONALD WATKINS who shall have survived me the following described property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">(d) Those three (3) lots held by me in the Schreiber Amended Subdivision, and in the event of sale or disposition of said lots, or any or [sic] them, any receipts, payments, proceeds, certificates, deposits, income or accounts as a result of or arising out of the sale or disposition of said lots, or any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">(e) Those certain five (5) certificates of deposit now held by me and in my name in NMBA, along with any income and accumulations therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">(f) Any future certificates of deposit, or other accounts that I may purchase, obtain or maintain or obtain in or with NMBA, along with any and all income and proceeds thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">The above described property shall be divided into two (2) equal parts, with one part or one-half (1/2) thereof distributed to JAMIE HARLICKER and the second part or remaining one-half (1/2) thereof divided equally among the children of DONALD WATKINS who shall survive me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">\u00b68 Schreiber executed his Last Will and Testament on January 27, 2003, and the First Codicil to Last Will and Testament on November 5,2004. In 2005, Schreiber sold the three lots referenced in paragraph 12(d) for $20,000 each. In 2007, Schreiber cashed the NMBA certificates of deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d) referenced in paragraph 12(e). The personal representative estimates the CDs had a total value between $51,989.52 and $59,987.91.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the personal representative\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>calculations, from 2005 until the time of his death, Schreiber spent a total of $301,392.74. Using the \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d (\u201cFIFO\u201d) accounting method, the personal representative traced the proceeds of the lots and the CDs, determined that all funds from the lots and CDs had been consumed by Schreiber prior to his death, and concluded that no money remained to be distributed to the named beneficiaries. As a result, the net distributable estate of $111,110.33* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would pass to John himself, as the residuary beneficiary, John prepared a final accounting reflecting this conclusion and filed it with the District Court on August 27,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"Aye\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing on the final accounting and petition for distribution on September 30, 2014. The only attendants other than the personal representative and his attorney were Jaime Harlicker,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a granddaughter of the decedent, and Brittany Watkins, a great-granddaughter of the decedent. Jaime and Brittany objected to the personal representative\u2019s conclusion that the named beneficiaries were to receive nothing under paragraph 12 of the decedent\u2019s Will. Specifically, they objected to the personal representative\u2019s use of the FIFO method of tracing proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b610 The District Court found that the personal representative failed to show Schrieber intended ademption of the devises of the lots and the CDs, and that a personal representative breaches his fiduciary duty by interpreting a will to benefit himself at the expense of other beneficiaries. The District Court denied the final accounting and petition for distribution and directed the personal representative to file an amended accounting with a proposed distribution that provides Jaime and the children of Donald Watkins with the value of the three lots and the five CDs. The personal representative filed a timely appeal. Additional facts will be discussed as necessary in the following analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b611 The interpretation and construction of a will presents a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Estate of Ayers, </em>2007 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>155, \u00b6 12, 338 Mont. 12, 161 P.3d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the devises of the lots and the certificates of deposit had not been adeemed and the named beneficiaries were thus entitled to a distribution amounting to the value of the lots and the certificates of deposit?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b613 Paragraph 12 of Schreiber\u2019s Will specifically devises the lots and the CDs to Jaime Harlicker and the children of Donald Watkins. But neither the lots nor the CDs remained in Schreiber\u2019s estate on the date of his death, which raises the question of whether the devises were adeemed. Ademption is \u201c[t]he destruction or extinction of a testamentary gift by reason of a bequeathed asset\u2019s ceasing to be part of the estate at the time of the testator\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>47 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). At common law, a specific devise of property was adeemed or extinguished if the property was not part of the estate on the date of the decedent\u2019s death. Title 72, chapter 2, MCA, <em>Annotations, </em>Official Comments at 613 (2012). However, under the Uniform Probate Code, Montana allows for the nonademption of some specific devises. Section 72-2-616, MCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">(1) A specific devisee has the right to the specifically devised property in the testator\u2019s estate at death and:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">(f) unless the facts and circumstances indicate that ademption of the devise was intended by the testator or ademption of the devise is consistent with the testator\u2019s manifested plan of distribution, the value of the specifically devised property to the extent the specifically devised property is not in the testator\u2019s estate at death and its value or its replacement is not covered by subsections (l)(a) through (l)(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">This section \u201ccreates a mild presumption against ademption by extinction, imposing on the party claiming that an ademption has occurred the burden of establishing that the facts and circumstances indicate that ademption of the devise was intended by the testator or that ademption of the devise is consistent with the testator\u2019s manifested plan of distribution.\u201d <em>Holtz v. Deisz, </em>2003 MT 132, \u00b6 35, 316 Mont. 77, 68 P.3d 828 (citing Official Comments to \u00a7 72-2-616, MCA). \u00b614 The District Court correctly concluded that Schreiber did not intend ademption of his specific devise of the lots. After devising the lots to Jaime Harlicker and the children of Donald Watkins, Schreiber explicitly acknowledged the possibility that the lots may not be part of his estate on the date of his death. His Will provides that \u201cin the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of sale or disposition of said lots, or any of them, any receipts, payments, proceeds, certificates, deposits, income or accounts as a result of or arising out of the sale or disposition of said lots, or any of them\u201d are devised to the named beneficiaries. Such a provision only reinforces the existing \u201cmild presumption\u201d against ademption.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b615 The personal representative, as the party claiming the devise of the lots was adeemed, bore the burden of establishing that the testator intended ademption or that ademption is consistent with the testator\u2019s plan of distribution. He did not meet that burden. John maintains that the proceeds from the sale of the lots must be traceable in order to be distributable. But the Will insists on no such tracing requirement; it simply devises to the named beneficiaries \u201cany receipts, payments, proceeds, certificates, deposits, income or accounts\u201d that arise from the sale of the lots. As the District Court noted, by insisting on tracing the proceeds of the sales, John effectively interpreted this provision out of the Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b616  The words of a writing are to be given their primaiy and general meaning, unless a technical meaning was used and understood. Section 1-4-107, MCA. Although \u201cproceeds\u201d does have a technical meaning in some instances \u2014 for example, in the bankruptcy code and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code \u2014 its primary and general meaning is simply \u201cthe profits or returns from a sale.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1542 (2d ed. 2001). Schreiber\u2019s sale of the lots in 2005 resulted in proceeds of $60,000, which he devised to the named beneficiaries in his Will. The District Court correctly concluded that Schreiber did not intend ademption, so the proceeds of the sale of the lots are to be distributed to Jaime and the children of Donald Watkins, regardless ofwhetherthe original funds can be traced through Schreiber\u2019s accounts using the FIFO or any other method.</p>\n<p id=\"As0\">\u00b617  However, the language in Schreiber\u2019s Will devising the CDs differs from the language devising the lots. Regarding the CDs, Schreiber simply devised \u201c[tjhose certain five (5) certificates of deposit now held by me and in my name in NMBA, along with any income and accumulations therein.\u201d The five NMBA CDs were no longer in existence on the date of Schreiber\u2019s death, and the Will makes no reference to proceeds from these CDs. It is also notable that Schreiber held CDs in other banks but did not devise them or designate them as a back-up to the NMBA CDs. Following \u201cthe bedrock principle of honoring the intent of the testator,\u201d <em>Holtz, </em>\u00b6 23, it is clear that Schreiber intended ademption of the devise of the CDs. Accordingly, the devise of the five NMBA CDs is adeemed. Section 72-2-616, MCA; Title 72, chapter 2, MCA, <em>Annotations, </em>Official Comments at 613 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>(2012). The District Court incorrectly ordered the personal representative to distribute to the named beneficiaries the value of those CDs.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err when it rejected the final accounting submitted by the personal representative?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b619 The District Court denied the personal representative\u2019s final accounting and petition for distribution and instructed the personal representative to file an amended accounting that provides distribution to Jaime and the children of Donald Watkins equivalent to the value of the lots and CDs. Although the District Court incorrectly concluded that the devise of the CDs had not been adeemed, it did not err in rejecting the final accounting. We affirm the District Court\u2019s rejection of the final accounting and remand with instructions to the District Court to order the personal representative to file an amended accounting that distributes the value of the lots but not the value of the CDs to the named beneficiaries. The amended accounting should also clarify the fate of certain items of property Schreiber held in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship with John.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b620 Under the Uniform Probate Code, the term \u201cjoint tenants with the right of survivorship\u201d \u201cincludes co-owners of property held under circumstances that entitle one or more to the whole of the property on the death of the other or others ... .\u201d Section 72-1-103(27), MCA. We have held that \u201c[o]rdinarily, upon the death of one joint tenant, the decedent\u2019s ownership interest ceases and the jointly-held property immediately passes to the surviving joint tenant as a matter of law.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Garland, </em>279 Mont. 269, 271, 928 P.2d 928, 930 (1996) (citing <em>Vogele v. Estate of Schock, </em>229 Mont. 259, 263, 745 P.2d 1138, 1140 (1987)). Thus, any property Schreiber held in joint tenancy passed immediately to the joint tenant upon his death and should not have been included in the distributable estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b621 The record reflects that John and Schreiber held a checking account and some silver in joint tenancy at the time of Schreiber\u2019s death. The fate of this property was not clear from the final accounting. In the \u201cAssets on Hand at Date of Death\u201d section of the final accounting, John included $38,974.64 from the joint checking account. Also included was 1,247 ounces of silver valued at $27,005.03 that Schreiber held in a safe deposit box in joint tenancy with John. Then in the \u201cCash Disbursements\u201d section of the final accounting, John reported that the $38,974.64 from the checking account had been disbursed to him as joint tenant. The value of the silver was not accounted for under \u201cCash Disbursements\u201d but was erroneously included in the net distributable estate. John now argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>District Court erred when it failed to exclude the safe deposit box and checking account from the distributable estate. After several misstatements and miscalculations, the personal representative reached the correct conclusion in his reply brief that the net distributable estate should exclude both the value of the checking account and the value of the silver, both of which should be disbursed to him as joint tenant. The amended accounting should reflect disbursements of property held in joint tenancy and a net distributable estate of $111,110.33, not $138,115.39, as appeared in the final accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b622  The District Court did not err when it denied the final accounting and petition for distribution because the accounting contained errors. An amended accounting should distribute to Jaime Harlicker and the children of Donald Watkins the value of the three lots but not that of the five certificates of deposit, and should exclude from the distributable estate the value of property held in joint tenancy with John.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the District Court\u2019s February 12, 2015 Order and remand to the District Court for issuance of an amended order in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-13\"> NMBA was dissolved prior to 2007 and the CDs were transferred to Bank of America. The total value of the CDs can only be estimated because Bank of America could not produce records of the CDs. The personal representative arrived at the approximate value of the CDs by using a 1099-INT statement issued by Bank of America during tax year 2006. The statement showed Schreiber received interest income of $2,729.45 on the CDs that year. The personal representative used interest rates from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>local banks during 2006 to estimate the value of the CDs based on the interest income they generated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> In the final accounting, the personal representative incorrectly reported that the net distributable estate is $138,115.39. He reached the correct calculation of $111,110.33 in his reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> Jaime\u2019s name was incorrectly spelled \u201cJamie\u201d in the Will.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b206-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b624 I concur with the Court\u2019s holdings, but I reach those conclusions via slightly different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b625 Schreiber devised the lots, as well as any receipts, proceeds or deposits arising out of the sale or disposition of the lots, to a grandchild and great grandchildren. The Court sees the proceeds provision as having the effect of \u201creinforcing]\u201d the presumption against ademption, Opinion, \u00b6 14, but I consider the proceeds to be, not merely an enhancement of the devise of the lots, but a specific devise itself to which the anti-ademption statute must be applied. In other words, had Schreiber\u2019s Will simply stated, \u201cI give the proceeds of the sale of my lots\u201d to the devisees, the proceeds would clearly stand on their own as a specific devise. That is the same situation that developed here, following the sale of the lots, and I believe the proceeds should be analyzed in that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">\u00b626 John took the position that the proceeds of the lots had to be traceable for the devise to be valid. The Court rejects this position, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>reasoning that the Will imposed no tracing requirement and that \u201cby insisting on tracing the proceeds of the sale, John effectively interpreted this provision [regarding proceeds] out of the Will.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15.1 also reject John\u2019s position that the proceeds had to be traceable for the devise to be valid, but I would not go so far as to say that tracing itself was inappropriate merely because the Will imposed no such requirement. Rather, I believe the effort to trace the proceeds was an appropriate tool in gathering evidence and making a determination from \u201cthe facts and circumstances\u201d whether \u201cademption of the devise was intended by\u201d Schreiber or was \u201cconsistent with [Schreiber\u2019s] manifested plan of distribution.\u201d Section 72-2-616(l)(f), MCA. Had the proceeds been traceable and found to be preserved intact, the case against ademption would have been strengthened to a certainty. Here, while the proceeds could not be traced, that fact alone, in my view, did not overcome the presumption against ademption, given that sufficient other cash monies were held by the Estate to permit distribution of \u201cthe value of the specifically devised property.\u201d Section 72-2-616(l)(f), MCA. Again, the specifically devised property for this analysis is, not the lots, but the proceeds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
