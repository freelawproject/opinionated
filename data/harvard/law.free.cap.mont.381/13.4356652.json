We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b62 Sharbonos present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b63 Issue One: Whether the District Court\u2019s order of September 3, 2014, properly granted the Coles\u2019 motion in limine to exclude the Sharbonos\u2019 expert witnesses from testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b64 Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly granted judgment in favor of the Coles and awarded them attorney fees against the Sharbonos.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">\u00b65 Sharbonos and Coles own adjoining parcels of land adjacent to Rock Creek in Carbon County, Montana. The Sharbonos have a senior right to the use of water that arises on the Coles\u2019 property and flows or seeps into a pond on the Sharbonos\u2019 property. In 1994 the Coles obtained a water use permit for a pond on their property, and in subsequent years they engaged in other development and construction. The Sharbonos contend that in 2007 the effect of the Coles\u2019 construction activities was to greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of water onto the Sharbonos\u2019 land and that they have been unable to utilize their senior water right. In 2008 the Sharbonos brought the present action against the Coles, contending that they interfered with the Sharbonos\u2019 water right by erecting a pond, engaging in significant construction activities; and placing rip-rap and fill in wet areas without taking adequate steps to protect the flow of water onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property. The Sharbonos sought damages, an order requiring the restoration of the natural flow of water, attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-12\">\u00b66 The parties engaged in discovery. In 2012 the Coles moved for summary judgment, contending that the Sharbonos had no rights to any water arising on the Coles\u2019 property because the Sharbonos\u2019 point of diversion was not located on the Coles\u2019 property. The Sharbonos moved the District Court to certify the issue of the source of their water right to the Montana Water Court pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA. In March 2012 the District Court issued the certification order, and the Water Court issued its decision in May 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\u00b67 The Water Court conducted a site visit and received briefing and argument from the parties. The Water Court found that the Sharbonos had an irrigation water right dating to August 5, 1963, and that the source of the right was water arising on or flowing through the Coles\u2019 property. The Water Court found that the Coles engaged in \u201cconsiderable speculation to spin an alternative theory\u201d to disprove the Sharbonos\u2019 water right, and that the Coles\u2019 assertions about the source of the Sharbonos\u2019 right \u201cis wrong as a matter of law and defies common sense.\u201d The Water Court found that the ponds of each party are \u201cbuilt in the same slough or stream channel and share a common source of supply,\u201d with the Coles\u2019 pond located upstream from the Sharbonos\u2019 pond. The Water Court found that this is \u201cobvious from a visual inspection.\u201d Further, the Water Court found that the State issued the water permit for the Coles\u2019 pond \u201cwith the intention that water would flow through the Cole pond and down to the Sharbono property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b68 The case returned to District Court in late 2013. The parties continued with motions, including the Coles\u2019 motion in Umine to exclude the Sharbonos\u2019 experts. The motion was based upon the contention that the Sharbonos had served inadequate disclosures of their experts\u2019 opinions as required by Rule 26(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P. After briefing, the District Court in September 2014 granted the Coles\u2019 motion in limine and prohibited the Sharbonos from calling any of their proposed expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b69 The parties proceeded to a bench trial in October 2014. At the conclusion of the Sharbonos\u2019 case-in-chief, the District Court granted the Coles\u2019 motion for a verdict in their favor. In November 2014 the District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, finding that the Coles had not interfered with the Sharbonos\u2019 water right; that the Sharbonos could only prove their case through expert testimony (which the District Court previously excluded); and that the Coles\u2019 activities on their property did not unreasonably interfere with the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights. The District Court subsequently entered judgment for the Coles, awarding them costs and attorney fees of $81,846.51 against the Sharbonos.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Norris v. Fritz, </em>2012 MT 27, \u00b6 17, 364 Mont. 63, 270 P.3d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court\u2019s order of September 3,2014, properly granted the Coles\u2019 motion in limine to exclude Sharbonos\u2019 expert witnesses from testifying at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b612 A party to civil litigation may discover from an opposing party information concerning any expert the party intends to call as a witness. Rule 26, M. R. Civ. P., provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Rule 26(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P. The \u201cspirit\u201d of the civil rules requires \u201cliberal disclosure\u201d of witnesses. <em>Superior Enterprises v. Montana Power Co., </em>2002 MT 139, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 198, 49 P.3d 565. The underlying purposes of Rule 26 are to eliminate surprise and to promote effective cross-examination of experts. <em>Hendrickson v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 57, 319 Mont. 307, 84 P.3d 38. A court should examine the adequacy of an expert disclosure in light of those underlying purposes. <em>Harkins v. Harney, </em>2003 MT 58, \u00b6 24, 314 Mont. 384, 66 P.3d 305, We evaluate a district court\u2019s sanction for an inadequate expert witness disclosure to determine whether the consequences of the sanction relate to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse; the extent of prejudice to the opposing party; and whether the district court warned the answering party of the consequences. <em>Hendrickson, </em>\u00b6 58. A factor in determining prejudice to the opposing party is whether that party could have obtained additional information by deposing the designated expert. <em>Hawkins, </em>\u00b6 27; <em>Hendrickson, </em>\u00b6 60; <em>Norris, </em>\u00b6 21. \u201cA party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial.\u201d Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(ii), M. R. Civ. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">\u00b613 The District Court here noted that the Sharbonos served an initial expert disclosure in October 2011, after which the Coles moved to exclude the experts for inadequate compliance with Rule 26. The Sharbonos served a supplemental disclosure in February 2012. After the case returned from the Water Court, in March 2014 the District Court ordered simultaneous disclosures of experts pursuant to Rule 26, and the Sharbonos made a third supplemental disclosure. The Coles again moved to exclude the Sharbonos\u2019 experts for inadequate disclosure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court, in its order of September 3,2014, granted the Coles\u2019 motion in limine and excluded all of the Sharbonos\u2019 experts from testifying at trial. The District Court concluded that the disclosures were \u201cunsupported,\u201d citing a common sentence in each of them that \u201c[d]efendants\u2019 acts, practices and construction activities have negatively impacted the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights.\u201d The District Court characterized this as a \u201clegal conclusion unsupported by data and analysis.\u201d The District Court concluded that the Sharbonos had not adequately disclosed \u201creports, data and analyses,\u201d and did not include an analysis \u201con what numbers mean or opinions of where any contamination arose.\u201d It is unclear what contamination issue this refers to.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u00b615 The District Court specifically determined that the disclosure as to expert Yelin was \u201cvague\u201d and did not sufficiently state the grounds for his conclusions. The District Court noted the report by Water Rights Inc., submitted by the Sharbonos as part of their expert disclosure, and dismissed it as being speculation, noting that it used phrases such as \u201ccould have happened\u201d and \u201cprobably curtailed.\u201d Based upon this, the District Court concluded that nothing in this report would be admissible and therefore was an inadequate disclosure. Finally, the District Court dismissed the Sharbonos\u2019 suggestion that the Coles had the opportunity to depose the experts but did not do so, noting that the Sharbonos did not offer to pay for all the costs of deposing the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b616 Rule 26(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P. requires a party, if asked to do so, to state the subject matter of the expert\u2019s testimony, the \u201csubstance\u201d of the expert\u2019s expected facts and opinions, and a \u201csummary\u201d of the grounds for each opinion. The Rule does not require production of a separate report by the expert and does not require that the disclosures be stated in the exact form of trial testimony, requiring that information about opposing experts may \u201conly\u201d be obtained through an interrogatory seeking the Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i) information. The district court can order the parties to make other or further disclosures, Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b617 Early in the present case (June 2010) the Sharbonos served a prediscovery disclosure required by local rule, disclosing the location of their property and the reference number for their water right claim. They stated that the Coles engaged in construction activities including building a large house, rip-rap, a shop building and placement of fill. They stated that the Coles failed to install culverts, drains or pipes to protect the springs that are the source of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights. They stated that when the Coles constructed a pond in 2007, the spring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>water flowing from the Coles\u2019 property stopped. They stated that this construction activity and its interference with the flow of water damaged them and their water rights. They stated that the Coles had a duty to refrain from interfering with their water right and that the Coles breached that duty by failing to mitigate the adverse impact of their construction activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u00b618 In October 2011 the Sharbonos filed and served an expert disclosure pursuant to Rule 26, disclosing three experts. Lee Yelin was a Senior Water Rights Specialist with Water Rights, Inc. The subject matter of his expected testimony was his background in water rights; the extent of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; the findings of his site visit in September 2011; the photographs and maps attached to the disclosure; and the negative effect of the Coles\u2019 construction activities on the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights. The substance of Yelin\u2019s facts and opinions was that the Coles\u2019 construction activities negatively impacted the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights by decreasing the flow of water since 2007; that the source of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights is a slough on the Coles\u2019 property; and that at the time of his inspection the only water flowing onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property was waste water from the Coles\u2019 com crop irrigation. The substance of Yelin\u2019s facts and opinions also included a description of the Coles\u2019 shop and parking area and the fill and compaction that it required, which he believed likely altered the groundwater flow, and that an outlet culvert on the Coles\u2019 pond, observed in an earlier inspection, was not present. The substance of Yelin\u2019s facts and opinions also included that the Coles\u2019 bank stabilization and channel shaping along Rock Creek had directly plugged the opening of the tributary slough that had historically fed the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights. The disclosure stated that Yelin would opine that the Sharbonos had done nothing to decrease the flow of water to their property. Finally, the disclosure stated that the grounds for Yelin\u2019s testimony would be his background, experience and training; his knowledge of water rights; his site visit; his review of water rights documents and other material produced during discovery; and his interviews with individuals who had knowledge of the facts. \u00b619 Ben Horan was a Hydrologist, also with Water Rights, Inc. The subject matter of Horan\u2019s testimony was essentially similar to that stated for Yelin. The substance of Horan\u2019s facts and opinions was that the Coles\u2019 acts and construction activities negatively impacted the quality and quantity of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights since 2007. The disclosure stated that Horan would explain how the Coles\u2019 soil compaction affected the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights and would include an analysis prepared by Alpine Analytical, attached to the disclosure. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>disclosure stated that Horan would testify that the Coles\u2019 bank stabilization and channel shaping on Rock Creek directly plugged the opening in the slough that feeds the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights and caused the creek to move away to the east. Finally, the disclosure stated that the grounds for Horan\u2019s testimony would be his background, experience and training; his knowledge of water rights; his site visit; his review of water rights documents and other material produced during discovery; and his interviews with individuals who had knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b620 Expert Howell, author of the Alpine Analytical report, would testify if needed to verify the water sample testing as set out in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b621 In February 2012 the Sharbonos filed a supplemental expert disclosure consisting of an affidavit of expert Yelin. The affidavit describes a number of documents and investigations he undertook to reach a conclusion that the source of the Sharbonos\u2019 water right is a series of springs located in an unnamed tributary of Rock Creek. The affidavit stated Yelin\u2019s conclusion that the springs arise on the Coles\u2019 property and then flow into the Sharbonos\u2019 property where they use the water. A topographic map attached to the affidavit showed the location of the properties, the ponds and the slough. Yelin stated that the Coles\u2019 pond is fed by separate springs for which the Coles have separate water rights. Yelin stated that historic photos starting in 1962 (attached to the affidavit) show that the slough at issue runs through the Coles\u2019 property and is the source of water that flows into the Coles\u2019 wildlife pond and then onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b622 The Sharbonos filed and served a supplemental disclosure in April 2014 that included the prior disclosures for Yelin and Howell. It also contained the expert disclosure of Toby Hewitt, Senior Hydrologist with Whetstone Associates in Gunnison, Colorado. The subject matter of his testimony was essentially the same as Yelin\u2019s. The substance of Hewitt\u2019s facts and opinions was that the Coles\u2019 construction activities negatively impacted the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights, specifically that a herm the Coles constructed on the northern boundary of their property diverted return flows away from the Sharbonos\u2019 property and that this flow could have provided water to the Sharbonos\u2019 irrigation pond. Hewitt would also testify that the direction of groundwater flow changes depending upon the irrigation that the Coles carry on, and that at times of the year shallow groundwater flows onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property. Hewitt would also testify that a berm that the Coles built keeps water from flowing into the natural slough and onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property. Hewitt would also testify that the bottom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the Coles\u2019 pond was lower than the slough, adversely affecting the flow of water onto the Sharbonos\u2019 property. Finally, the disclosure stated that the grounds for Hewitt\u2019s testimony would be his background, experience and training; his knowledge of water rights; his site visit; his review of water rights documents and other material produced during discovery; and his interviews with individuals who had knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b623 The April 2014 supplemental expert disclosure included a disclosure for Richard Bondy, P.E. The subject matter of Bondy\u2019s testimony would include the current quality and quantity of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; the presence of clay soil and its use during construction; the negative effect of the Coles\u2019 construction on the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights, including the use of clay, sand and gravel that could change the groundwater flow. The substance of the facts and opinions in Bondy\u2019s testimony included that the Coles\u2019 construction activities negatively impacted the quantity and quality of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; that the Coles\u2019 construction caused a decrease in flow and quality of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights, based upon compaction of the soil as it alters groundwater flows; that construction of the parking lot and use of clay, gravel and sand caused compaction that impacted historic water flows; that compaction of the soil around the Coles\u2019 shop created an impermeable surface in a former wetland that impacted the flow of water. Finally, the disclosure stated that the grounds for Bondy\u2019s testimony would be his background, experience and training; his knowledge of water rights as a professional engineer; his site visit; his review of photographs and water rights documents and other material produced during discovery and his interviews with individuals who had knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b624 The April 2014 supplemental expert disclosure included a disclosure for Jeff Silkwood, a Geomorphologist and Project Advisor for Water Rights, Inc. The subject matter of his expected testimony was his background in water rights; the current quality and quantity of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; the presence of clay soil and the effect of its use in construction; the negative effect of the Coles\u2019 construction on the quality of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; and damages. The substance of Silkwood\u2019s facts and opinions was that the Coles\u2019 construction activities have negatively impacted the quality and quantity of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights; that the Coles\u2019 construction has caused a decrease in the flow rate and quality of the Sharbonos\u2019 water rights, particularly as to soil compaction and placement of a pipe into the channel; that the Coles\u2019 bank stabilization and channel shaping on Rock Creek that directly plugs the tributary slough, moving the creek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>away from the slough that has fed the Sharbonos\u2019 pond; and that the Sharbonos have not affected the decrease of water available to them. The grounds for Silkwood\u2019s opinions are his background and training, his knowledge of hydrology and water rights, his review of water rights documents and other documents produced in discovery and his conversations with others who have knowledge of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b625 The Sharbonos also furnished the Coles with a report by Water Rights, Inc., that included photographs of specific areas of the Coles\u2019 construction that had impacted the Sharbonos\u2019 water right. The Sharbonos also furnished a resume of each of the proposed witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">\u00b626  A review of the expert disclosure materials furnished by the Sharbonos during the course of this case makes it clear that they did not \u201cabuse\u201d the discovery process. The analytical factors for examining the adequacy of expert witness disclosures relate to whether the party under consideration engaged in \u201cdiscovery abuse.\u201d <em>Henrickson, </em>\u00b6 58. A finding of \u201cdiscovery abuse\u201d is more properly relegated to such practices as providing cryptic disclosures with no meaningful information, or attempting to call an un-disclosed expert at trial. <em>Superior Enterprises, </em>\u00b6 19. We find no basis to conclude that the Sharbonos abused the discovery process in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b627 In addition, a review of the expert disclosure materials furnished by the Sharbonos makes it clear that they adequately complied with the requirements of Rule 26(b)(4), M. R. Civ. P. They complied with both the substance and the spirit of the Rule and it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to strike all of their expert witnesses. This is particularly true in a case in which the District Court determined that the Sharbonos could not make out a prima facie case without expert testimony. In addition, there is no indication that the District Court warned the Sharbonos that they were in danger of having their case gutted by striking their experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b628 There is also no demonstrable prejudice to the Coles based upon the quality of the Sharbonos\u2019 expert disclosures. While the Coles claim some degree of frustration and inability to determine the substance of the testimony of the Sharbonos\u2019 experts, the Sharbonos adequately met their disclosure obligations under Rule 26. The Rule requires disclosure of subject matter areas, the substance of facts and opinions, and a summary of the grounds. The Sharbonos met those requirements. If the Coles needed more information even after the Rule 26 disclosures, they were free to depose the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b629  We emphasize that all parties are required to provide full expert disclosures under Rule 26, and are required to comply with orders of the district court concerning expert disclosure. As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">The spirit of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure requires liberal disclosure on the part of all parties, including the disclosure of witnesses. Failure to disclose an expert witness constitutes reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Superior Enterprises, </em>\u00b6 18. We reiterate what we said almost twenty years ago, that \u201cdilatory abuse of discovery must no longer be dealt with leniently and that the transgressors of discovery abuses should be punished rather than encouraged repeatedly to cooperate.\u201d <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow Co., </em>276 Mont. 329, 332, 916 P.2d 91, 92-93 (1996). Further, district courts have the discretionary power to impose sanctions appropriate to the case and to the discovery conduct at issue. A party who makes incomplete and evasive disclosures or who attempts to hide the true testimony of any expert does so at that party\u2019s peril. In this case, however, the Sharbonos complied with their disclosure responsibilities and should not have been sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b630 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court properly granted judgment in favor of the Coles and awarded them attorney fees against the Sharbonos.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b631 The judgment against the Sharbonos was entered at trial after they presented an abbreviated case in support of their complaint, without being able to present any of their disclosed experts. Because the experts were wrongfully excluded the result of the trial was tainted and must be reversed. Similarly, the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to the Coles as prevailing parties is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b632 Therefore, the District Court is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Ak\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AjA\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">\u00b633 Effective October 1,2011, following extensive study by this Court\u2019s Advisory Commission on Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure, receipt of public comment, and consideration during several public meetings, the Court adopted comprehensive amendments to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. The amendments were recommended by the Advisory Commission to bring Montana\u2019s rules more closely in line with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Commission, however, recommended against wholesale adoption of the federal rules. Among the federal rules that we did not adopt <em>in toto </em>is Rule 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">\u00b634 Federal Rule 26 provides detailed requirements for expert disclosures that are not found in the Montana rules.

The federal rule \u201crequires the basis and reasons for every opinion, including the facts or data considered in forming them.\u201d <em>Henson, </em>at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">\u00b635 Montana\u2019s federal district courts have held, \u201cAn inadequate report or disclosure may result in the exclusion of the expert\u2019s opinions at trial even though the expert has been deposed.\u201d <em>Olson v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>227 F.R.D. 550, 552 (D. Mont. 2005). Under F. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1), which \u201cgives teeth to the expert disclosure requirements,\u201d the U.S. District Court has prohibited a party\u2019s expert \u201cfrom relying in any way upon data or conclusions specifically not included and spelled out\u201d in a timely disclosure, and has stricken opinions of the expert \u201cthat ha[ve] not been disclosed in compliance with the requirements of Rule 26(a) and the [court\u2019s] Scheduling Order[,] as [well as] any opinion or evidence based on undisclosed data or testing.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>227 F.R.D. at 552-53. \u201cExclusion is appropriate for violations of the disclosure rules even where it may preclude an \u2018entire cause of action or defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graham v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>No. CV 12-145-M-DWM, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39454 (D. Mont. 2014) (quoting <em>Yeti By Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp., </em>259 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">\u00b636 When proposing changes to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, the Advisory Commission rejected the initial disclosure and pretrial disclosure requirements of F. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1) and (a)(3), as well as the detailed expert disclosure rules and report requirement of F. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Civ. P. 26(a)(2). The Commission determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">those detailed expert disclosure rules \u2014 while appropriate in certain cases \u2014 are potentially too costly and difficult for the majority of civil cases handled by state district courts. To the extent detailed disclosure requirements beyond those of the existing Rule 26(b)(4) may be necessary, the district court has sufficient power to impose such requirements by virtue of its general powers over discovery as well as through the orders issued following preliminary pretrial conference or any discovery conference held pursuant to Rule 26(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Committee Notes to M. R. Civ. P. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b637 In excluding the Sharbonos\u2019 experts from trial, the District Court appears to have applied the federal standards, including the perhaps laudable consideration of avoiding excessive deposition costs in litigated cases. But Montana\u2019s rule \u2014 as discussed in the Opinion and set forth in our precedent \u2014 does not impose the federal standards. And the District Court did not enter any orders in this case calling for more detailed disclosures than the rule requires. Because Montana has not adopted the federal rule on expert disclosures, the distinction between the rules must be given significance. Sharbonos\u2019 expert disclosures met the requirements of Montana\u2019s Rule 26.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u00b638 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
