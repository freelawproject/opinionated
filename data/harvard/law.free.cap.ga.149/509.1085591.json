Judgment was entered accordingly, and the claimant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The court committed no error in directing the verdict. Delivery of a deed, actual or constructive, during the life of the' grantor, is essential to a conveyance of title. <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>147 <em>Ga. </em>438 (94 S.
