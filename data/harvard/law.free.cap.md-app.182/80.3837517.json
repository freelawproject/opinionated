Did the lower court err in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Affirming the Office of Administrative Hearings\u2019 ... decision [a]nd refusing to reverse the [administrative] law judge\u2019s dismissal order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">II. Is the regulation and the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u2022 Unconstitutional?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u2022 Contrary to the [a]gency\u2019s [statutory [authority or jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\u2022 Resulted [sic] from an unlawful procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">\u2022 Arbitrary or capricious?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">We conclude that the OAH erred in dismissing Tabassi\u2019s administrative appeal under FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 706.1(b)(3) based on Tabassi\u2019s conviction for reckless endangerment and child access to firearms in the related criminal proceeding. Tabassi\u2019s guilt on these criminal charges did not require proof that he was a \u201cperson who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of the child[,]\u201d a necessary element of \u201cneglect\u201d under FL \u00a7 5-701(s). Tabassi\u2019s criminal charges, therefore, did not arise \u201cout of the alleged abuse or neglect\u201d in a manner that warranted dismissal of his administrative appeal under FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 706.1(b)(3). Because we remand on issue I, we do not reach issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">In December 2003, the Carroll County Department of Social Services sent Amir Tabassi, the appellant <em>pro se, </em>a \u201cnotice of action\u201d stating that it found Tabassi responsible for \u201cindicated child neglect.\u201d DSS conducted an investigation of Tabassi upon having received information that officers of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, while executing a search warrant for illegal firearms at Tabassi\u2019s home, found a 12-year-old unrelated girl living at the home and \u201callegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>sleeping in Mr. Tabassi\u2019s bed.\u201d A DSS worker went to Tabassi\u2019s residence, which was being searched, and observed \u201cvarious weapons\u201d being taken from the home. The worker first encountered a 29-year-old woman, named Vera, sitting on the front porch who stated that she was the sister of the 12-year-old girl inside the residence and that the two had been staying with Tabassi.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The DSS worker was then informed by troopers searching the home that the 12-year-old, named Simone, was found sleeping in Tabassi\u2019s bed with loaded firearms on and next to the bed. The DSS worker spoke with Simone and elicited the following information, documented in the DSS investigation report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">[Simone] stated that she lives at [redacted] with her parents Mary and George [redacted]. She is a student at [redacted]. Simone stated that her sister and Mr. Tabassi met through a friend and that Vera had helped watch Tabassi\u2019s two small children when they visited from Tennessee. Simone had come with her sister from Ohio for the summer. Simone stated that she does not normally sleep in Mr. Tabassi\u2019s room. Simone denied that she had ever slept in Mr. Tabassi\u2019s bed when he was in the bed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">Simone stated that the night before, they had gone to the airport and returned about 1 am. She laid down in the bedroom that Mr. Tabassi\u2019s children sleep in when they are there. She could not sleep and got up around 2-3 am and got on the computer in the kitchen. After a while she went and laid down in the living room on the sofa. At approximately 5-6 am Mr. Tabassi got up to go to work. He came out to the living room and told her she could go sleep in his bed. Simone stated that she did so and that there were two loaded guns on the bed with her when she went to sleep. She stated that there were also numerous loaded guns by the bed on the floor and a machine gun. Simone stated that she knew that there were guns in the top dresser drawer and that guns are on a regular basis out in the open. The DSS worker contacted the mother of the two girls and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbM\">the mother stated that Vera had met Tabassi on the internet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that Tabassi told Vera that he wanted to marry her, and requested that she come to Maryland. The girls\u2019 parents then allowed Simone to come with Vera for the summer because they trusted Vera\u2019s judgment. The DSS worker spoke with Tabassi, who denied that there were any loaded guns left out in the open until the day before the search and that they were always locked up in a safe or cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Tabassi filed a request for a contested case hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings on March 1, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The OAH dismissed this request as untimely and Tabassi appealed the dismissal. On November 21, 2005, we vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the OAH for further proceedings. The OAH, on remand, stayed the proceedings concerning Tabassi\u2019s requested contested case hearing, pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706. l(b)(3)(i), because it had \u201cbeen advised of criminal proceedings pending[,] arising out of the alleged abuse or neglect appealed in the [OAH] matter[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">On April 26, 2006, DSS filed a Motion to Dismiss Tabassi\u2019s appeal \u201cbased on [his] being found guilty of reckless endangerment and firearms-access by minors, criminal charges arising out of the alleged neglect, on August 31, 2004[.]\u201d Tabassi filed an opposition to DSS\u2019s motion to dismiss on May 11, 2006. The OAH dismissed Tabassi\u2019s appeal on May 11, 2006, pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3)(ii). Tabassi sought judicial review of the OAH\u2019s dismissal in the Circuit Court for Carroll County, and on May 3, 2007, the court affirmed the OAH\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">\n<em>Standard Of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u201cWhen reviewing an administrative agency decision, our role \u2018is precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Howard County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Linda J., </em>161 Md.App. 402, 407, 869 A.2d 404 (2005) (citation omitted). We review only the decision of the administrative agency and do not evaluate the factual findings and conclusions of law made by the circuit court. <em>See id. </em>We apply a limited standard of review and will not disturb an administrative decision on appeal \u201cif substantial evidence supports factual findings and no error of law exists.\u201d <em>See Howard County v. Davidsonville Area Civic and Potomac River Ass\u2019ns, Inc., </em>72 Md.App. 19, 34, 527 A.2d 772, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 286, 533 A.2d 1308 (1987). \u201c[I]f the issue before the administrative body is \u2018fairly debatable\u2019, that is, that its determination involved testimony from which a reasonable man could come to different conclusions, the courts will not substitute their judgment for that of the administrative body.\u201d <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 542, 253 A.2d 372 (1969). We are under no constraint, however, \u201c \u2018to affirm an agency decision premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Berkshire Life Ins. Co. v. Md. Ins. Admin., </em>142 Md.App. 628, 653, 791 A.2d 942 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The OAH\u2019s Dismissal Of Tabassi\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Tabassi argues that the OAH erred in dismissing his appeal of DSS\u2019s finding Tabassi responsible for indicated child neglect. The OAH relied on FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3) and Tabassi\u2019s guilt for the offenses of reckless endangerment and child access to firearms in dismissing his appeal. The pertinent provisions of FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b) provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">(b) In the case of a finding of indicated abuse or neglect, an individual may request a contested case hearing to appeal the finding in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article by responding to the notice of the local department in writing within 60 days....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">(3)(i) If a criminal proceeding is pending on charges arising out of the alleged abuse or neglect, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall stay the hearing until a final disposition is made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>(ii) If after final disposition of the criminal charge, the individual requesting the hearing is found guilty of any criminal charge arising out of the alleged abuse or neglect, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall dismiss the administrative appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Tabassi argues, first, that the OAH could not conclude from the mere criminal docket entries that the issue of neglect had been adjudicated in his criminal case. Tabassi contends, second, that the OAH, in dismissing his appeal, deprived him of the opportunity to challenge DSS\u2019s finding of neglect in a matter that contravened the legislative intent of FL \u00a7 5-701.1. In support of his position, Tabassi cites <em>Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. L.D., </em>349 Md. 239, 707 A.2d 1331 (1998), in which the Court of Appeals considered the procedural protections the legislature has afforded individuals accused of child abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In <em>L.D., </em>the Court concluded that individuals accused of child abuse or neglect were entitled to a \u201cfull contested case hearing\u201d before their names were entered into databases accessible on a statewide basis. <em>See id. </em>at 275, 707 A.2d 1331. The Court based this conclusion on an analysis of FL \u00a7 5-715, a statute that was repealed in 1999, and its opinion in <em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>343 Md. 14, 680 A.2d 470 (1996). The Court rejected an argument that a full hearing right to the accused would hinder local departments of social services from entering information into databases and that this would cripple their ability to protect children from abuse and neglect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">We believe the Legislature has spoken on this issue, and it is clear it sought a balance between the critical need to investigate and prosecute child abusers and neglectors and the equally critical need to allow persons accused of abuse and neglect the opportunity to clear their names before dissemination throughout the entire state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\"><em>See id. </em>at 275, 680 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Tabassi argues, in light of the recognized legislative intent in <em>L.D., </em>that he was entitled to a hearing before the OAH to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>have the opportunity to clear his name of the accusation of child neglect, because DSS\u2019s claim of neglect was not adjudicated in his criminal case. Tabassi claims support for this proposition from the following Court of Appeals discussion of the legislative history behind FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-706.1, 5-706.2, and 5-715, by which the legislature created a new hearing procedure and broadened the scope of registries subject to procedural requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">This history ... demonstrates the legislature\u2019s concern that before information relating to alleged child abuse can be disseminated state-wide, that information must have been demonstrated to be accurate either through adjudication or an administrative hearing. Clearly, \u00a7\u00a7 5-701 to 5-715 grant broad authority to social services and law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of child abuse and to prevent its recurrence. At the same time, the legislature has also shown that this authority must be tempered to ensure that individuals are not labelled [sic] as child abusers on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\"><em>See C.S., </em>343 Md. at 28-30, 680 A.2d 470.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Tabassi maintains, third, that his criminal charges did not arise out of the alleged child neglect and that his guilt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>these charges, therefore, did not warrant dismissal under FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3)(ii). Tabassi contends that this provision is applicable only if the elements of the crime for which an individual is charged include the charge of neglect or abuse as defined under the Family Law Article. Tabassi argues that his criminal charges did not arise out of the alleged child neglect, because his criminal charges did not prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was a caretaker for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">DSS responds that the OAH properly dismissed Tabassi\u2019s appeal request on the basis that he was found guilty of reckless endangerment and child access to firearms, charges arising out of the alleged child neglect. DSS argues the elements of FL \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(3)(h) were satisfied because the endangerment for which Tabassi was found guilty was the same endangerment that was the basis for DSS\u2019s finding of neglect, <em>i.e. </em>that Tabassi failed to provide Simone with proper care and attention and, thus, exposed her to a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">DSS rejects the contention that FL \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(3)(h) required OAH to determine whether the crimes of which Tabassi was found guilty contained the same elements as \u201cindicated child neglect.\u201d According to DSS, \u201c[s]uch an interpretation ... is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s reference to the preclusive effect of a finding of guilt on \u2018any criminal charge arising out of the alleged abuse or neglect.\u2019 \u201d DSS argues, moreover, that such a requirement would render the reference to \u201cneglect\u201d in FL 5~706.1(b)(3) nugatory as there is no crime called, or with the same elements as, child neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">DSS contends that the more reasonable construction of the statute is the one adopted by the OAH and circuit court: Tabassi was not entitled to a contested case hearing because he was found guilty of criminal charges that \u201cstemmed from the same incident that gave rise to DSS\u2019s finding of indicated abuse or neglect.\u201d DSS maintains that this interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>supported by <em>Linda J., </em>161 Md.App. at 409-11, 869 A.2d 404, in which we concluded that the OAH properly dismissed a request for a contested case hearing to challenge alleged child abuse pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(3)(H) after a foster parent pleaded guilty to second degree assault and received probation before judgment. Second degree assault, unlike the definition of child abuse in the Family Law Article, contains no requirement that the perpetrator have a special relationship with the victim or that the victim be a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Our decision in <em>Linda J. </em>is not dispositive on the question of whether the OAH properly dismissed Tabassi\u2019s appeal under FL \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(3)(h). We summarized the issue in <em>Linda J. </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">[T]o deny Linda J.\u2019s request for a hearing, appellant must show two things: first, that Linda J.\u2019s criminal charges arose out of her alleged abuse of her foster daughter and, second, that Linda J. was \u201cfound guilty\u201d of those charges. Since there is no dispute that the charges at issue arose out of Ms. J.\u2019s alleged abuse of her foster daughter, we are left only with the question of whether she was \u201cfound guilty\u201d of those charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\"><em>See id. </em>at 409, 869 A.2d 404. The propriety of the OAH\u2019s dismissal of Tabassi\u2019s appeal, unlike the dismissal in <em>Linda J., </em>turns on whether Tabassi\u2019s criminal charges arose out of the alleged neglect in a manner that obviates the need for a contested case hearing, and not on whether he was \u201cfound guilty\u201d of his charges. We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that Tabassi\u2019s criminal proceeding and resulting guilt for reckless endangerment and child access to firearms did not establish the accuracy of all the information necessary to support DSS\u2019s finding of Tabassi\u2019s having engaged in child neglect, obviating the need for a contested case hearing. <em>See C.S., </em>343 Md. at 30, 680 A.2d 470. Tabassi\u2019s appeal was, therefore, improperly dismissed pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to \u201cascertain and carry out the real legislative intention.\u201d <em>See Baltimore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Calvert County, </em>278 Md. 26, 31, 358 A.2d 241 (1976). \u201cIn determining that intention, we consider the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification; only when the statute in question is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning need we look elsewhere to ascertain the legislative intention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, \u201clook to the normal, plain meaning of the language!,]\u201d and if \u201cthat language is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the provision\u2019s terms to inform our analysis!.]\u201d <em>See City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u201cWhen the provision is part of a statutory scheme, [we] will interpret it in the context, as one element of a whole, so as to harmonize and reconcile the statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>158 Md.App. 45, 57, 854 A.2d 259, <em>aff'd, </em>386 Md. 63, 871 A.2d 575 (2005). \u201c[W]here the meaning of the plain language of the statute, or the language itself, is unclear, \u2018we seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u2019 \u201d <em>Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 480, 754 A.2d 1004 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">FL \u00a7 5-706.1 is the result of a legislative effort to alter the administrative appeals process for individuals suspected of child abuse or neglect in the wake of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>C.S., </em>343 Md. at 30-34, 680 A.2d 470. <em>See </em>Fiscal Note for H.B. 148 (1999). The <em>C.S. </em>Court held that alleged abusers had an independent right to a contested case hearing before his or her name could be entered into a central registry. <em>See C.S., </em>343 Md. at 23-24, 680 A.2d 470. The Court concluded that a more limited record review procedure, contained in a provision allowing alleged abusers to request administrative review of the findings made by a local social services department, was insufficient. <em>See id. </em>The Court explained what must be addressed at the contested case hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">The sole question at a hearing ... must necessarily be whether the alleged incident of abuse or neglect is correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>indicated as \u201cindicated\u201d or \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d In determining this issue, the ALJ must sift between potentially conflicting information presented by the [Department of Human Resources] and the alleged abuser to determine whether there are sufficient facts to meet the definitions provided in [FL \u00a7 5-701(m) and (y) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 33, 680 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The legislature\u2019s alteration to the administrative appeals process following <em>C.S. </em>did not, in any way, diminish the procedural protections for individuals accused of abuse or neglect, but merely streamlined the appeals process in a manner that preserved an individual\u2019s right to a contested case hearing when accused of abuse or neglect. <em>See </em>Fiscal Note for H.B. 148 (1999)(stating that the legislation \u201cis intended to streamline the hearing procedures by providing for one procedure (contested case hearing) for a finding of indicated and another procedure (conference with a local department of social services) for a finding of unsubstantiated and by eliminating record review process\u201d). The legislature, by enacting FL \u00a7 5-706.1 and streamlining the appeals process, did not abandon its concern, as stated in <em>C.S., </em>\u201cthat before information relating to alleged child abuse [or neglect] can be disseminated state-wide, that information must have been demonstrated to be accurate either through adjudication or an administrative hearing.\u201d <em>See C.S., </em>343 Md. at 30, 680 A.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Tabassi\u2019s guilt for reckless endangerment and child access to firearms did not remove his right to have DSS\u2019s finding of neglect reviewed by the OAH under FL \u00a7 5-706. l(b)(3)(ii). Neglect is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">the leaving of a child unattended or other failure to give proper care and attention to a child <em>by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child </em>under circumstances that indicate: (1) that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-8\"><em>See </em>FL \u00a7 5-701(s)(emphasis added). Tabassi\u2019s guilt for reckless endangerment and child access to firearms did not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>proof that Tabassi was a parent of, caretaker for, custodian of, or responsible for Simone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His guilt for these offenses, therefore, did not obviate the need for an opportunity to appeal DSS\u2019s finding of neglect such that dismissal was warranted under FL \u00a7 5-706.1. An individual\u2019s status to a child is an element of a finding of neglect, and since this status was not adjudicated in his criminal proceeding, Tabassi was entitled to a hearing to ensure that DSS\u2019s information, supporting its neglect finding, was demonstrated to be accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We believe that a reasonable interpretation of FL \u00a7 5-706.1(b)(3) is that dismissal of an alleged abuser or neglector\u2019s administrative appeal is warranted where an accused is found guilty of criminal charges stemming from the same conduct that serves as the basis for a finding of abuse or neglect and the requisite status of the individual to the child has been adjudicated or is not disputed. But Tabassi insists that he was not a caretaker of or responsible for Simone when he engaged in conduct for which he was found guilty of reckless endangerment and child\u2019s access to firearms. He should have the opportunity to challenge DSS\u2019s finding regarding his status before he is found and listed as responsible for indicated child neglect in a central registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY VACATED.

Former Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.) \u00a7 5-706.2 of the Family Law Article (FL) defined the administrative review procedures the OAH was required to follow if a local department declined to change its finding on abuse or neglect after having engaged in an initial requested review of its own records. The OAH, under FL \u00a7 5-706.2, was instructed to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the full departmental report or record to determine its accuracy. <em>See C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>343 Md. 14, 19-20, 680 A.2d 470 (1996). FL \u00a7 5-706.2 was repealed in 1999 as part of the legislature\u2019s effort to streamline the hearing procedures for those accused of child abuse or neglect by eliminating a record review process and replacing it with a two-tiered appeal process under FL \u00a7 5-706.1. <em>See </em>1999 Md. Laws, ch. 214; Fiscal Note for H.B. 148 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The legislature also repealed FL \u00a7 5-715, <em>see </em>1999 Md. Laws, ch. 214, a provision which had provided \u201can alleged abuser with a separate and independent right to an administrative hearing before his or her name may be entered into a central registry.\u201d <em>See C.S., </em>343 Md. at 23,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. Tabassi's guilt for reckless endangerment merely required proof that he recklessly engaged in conduct creating a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2007 Supp.) \u00a7 3-204 of the Criminal Law Article (CL). His guilt for providing a child\u2019s access to firearms, moreover, only required proof that he stored or left a loaded firearm in a location where he knew or should have known that an unsupervised child, <em>i.e. </em>an individual under the age of 16, would gain access to the firearm. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 4-104.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
