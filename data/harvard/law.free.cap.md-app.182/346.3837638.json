Claggett, Sr., appellant, to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (\u201cMALPF\u201d or the \u201cFoundation\u201d), appellee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a division of the Department of Agriculture. The easement, tendered in February of 2000, applied to a tract of land owned by appellant in Kent County, over 200 acres in size (the \u201cProperty\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Under the terms of the Deed of Easement, as well as the law then in effect, appellant retained the right to apply to the Foundation for release from the easement restrictions of a lot of up to two acres \u201cfor the purpose of constructing a dwelling house\u201d for his use (the \u201cOwner\u2019s Lot\u201d). For that purpose, in 2002 appellant received a \u201cpreliminary release\u201d of a two-acre lot. Thereafter, effective October 1, 2004, the General Assembly amended the applicable statute to require that, absent the approval of MALPF, \u201c[a]ny release or preliminary release ... shall include ... [a] statement that the owner\u2019s ... lot may not be transferred for 5 years from the date of the final release.\u201d In 2005, the Foundation tendered to appellant a proposed \u201cFinal Release,\u201d which incorporated the provision required by the amended statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Appellant refused to sign the proposed release, and proceeded with construction of a residence on the Owner\u2019s Lot. He also filed a declaratory action against the Foundation in the Circuit Court for Kent County, contending that he is not bound by the five-year restriction on his right to alienate the Owner\u2019s Lot. The circuit court granted dismissal or summary judgment in the Foundation\u2019s favor as to all counts of appellant\u2019s Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">This appeal followed. Appellant poses two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred by finding that the Appellees\u2019 retroactive application of Md.Code Ann. Agrie. \u00a7 2-513(b)(2)(vi) to the Deed of Easement did not impair Appellant\u2019s vested contractual rights[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred by finding that the Appellees\u2019 retroactive application of Md.Code Ann.

A second (final) Release and Agreement will also be recorded upon request releasing the lot of all easement restrictions once a non-transferrable building permit is presented to the Foundation in your name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">Before a preliminary release can be prepared, the Foundation requires the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">1. Reimbursement of the amount paid to you by the Foundation for the requested lot. Our records show this total amount to be $2,470, @ $1,235 per acre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">2.

A final release will be prepared once the Foundation receives and certifies a non-transferrable building permit in your name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Accordingly, appellant remitted payment and a metes and bounds description of the Owner\u2019s Lot.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Foundation then sent appellant a \u201cPreliminary Release and Agreement,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the parties executed and recorded in the land records of Kent County on October 17, 2002. The Preliminary Release, which referred to the Foundation as \u201cReleasor\u201d and appellant as \u201cReleasees,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">[I]n consideration of ... payment by the Releasees to the Releasor of the sum of $2,470.00 and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Releasor hereby conditionally releases [the Owner\u2019s Lot] from restriction contained in the agricultural land preservation easement, subject, however, to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, including the condition that its use be for the purpose of constructing a dwelling house for the owner\u2019s residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Preliminary Release also set forth the following \u201cterms and conditions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">1. The Releasees, on behalf of themselves, their Personal Representatives and assigns ... grant and relinquish the right to subdivide the [Owner\u2019s Lot]. This grant and relinquishment of right shall be deemed and construed as a real covenant, running with the land, and shall bind all current and future owners and any other person, firm or corporation having any interest in the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">2. This preliminary release shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">a) Become final when the Foundation receives and certifies a nontransferable building permit in the name of the landowner for the construction of a dwelling house and issues a final release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">b) Become null and void upon the death of the person [for] whose benefit the release was intended if the Foundation has not received a building permit as provided in the subparagraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">3. Subject to the proceeding [sic] Paragraphs 1 and 2 it is the intent of this instrument to release the above described 2.00 acres parcel of land from agricultural easement restrictions set forth in the above mentioned Deed of Easement for the purpose of constructing a dwelling.

However, all of the terms, covenants, conditions, limitations and restrictions set forth in the Deed of Easement shall remain in full force, operation and effect on the remaining portions of the Releasees\u2019 land not herein or heretofore expressly released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">5. Upon compliance with all of the terms and conditions hereinabove set forth, the Releasees shall have the right to request that the above described parcel of 2.00 acres be released from the operation and effect of the Deed of Easement subject only to the Terms and Conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 above. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Appellant later submitted a building permit in accordance with the terms of the Preliminary Release. The record does not disclose the date of the submission. Nor does it reveal whether the permit was submitted before or after the enactment of two amendments to \u00a7 2-513 of the Agriculture Article that are relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Effective October 1, 2003, the General Assembly enacted 2003 Md. Laws ch. 258 (\u201cChapter 258\u201d), which amended Agrie. \u00a7 2-513 by reducing the total number of owner\u2019s or children\u2019s lots that could be released from an agricultural preservation easement from ten to three, and adding a new \u00a7 2-513(b)(3), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">A landowner may reserve the right to exclude 1 unrestricted lot from an easement in lieu of all owner\u2019s and children\u2019s lots to which the landowner would otherwise be entitled under paragraph (2) of this subsection, subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">(ii) An unrestricted lot may be subdivided by the landowner from the easement and sold to anyone to construct one residential dwelling;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(iv) The landowner shall agree not to subdivide further for residential purposes any acreage allowed to be released, and the agreement shall be recorded among the land records where the land is located and shall bind all future owners;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">(v) The right to the lot is taken into consideration in the appraisal of fair market value and determination of easement value;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(vi) The lot can be subdivided at any time and the location of the lot to be subdivided is subject to the approval of the local agricultural advisory board and the Foundation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">(vii) If the property is transferred before the right to exclude the lot has been exercised, the right may be transferred with the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">One year later, effective October 1, 2004, the General Assembly again amended Agrie. \u00a7 2-513, adding language to \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2)(vi) requiring that \u201c[a]ny release or preliminary release issued under this paragraph shall include ... [a] statement that the owner\u2019s ... lot may not be transferred for 5 years from the date of the final release,\u201d absent the approval of the Foundation or another exception not applicable here. 2004 Md. Laws ch. 498 (\u201cChapter 498\u201d). As amended by Chapter 498, Agrie. \u00a7 2-513(b)(2)(vi) stated (new language underlined):<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Any release or preliminary release issued under this paragraph shall include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">1. A statement of the conditions under which it was issued, a certification by the Foundation that all necessary conditions for release or preliminary release have been met, and copies of any pertinent documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aca\">\n<em>2. A statement that the owner\u2019s or child\u2019s lot may not be transferred for 5 years from the date of the final release, \u25a0 except on:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\n<em>A Approval by the Foundation; or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2j\">\n<em>B. Notwithstanding any conditions on transfers imposed under item 1 of this subparagraph, a lender providing notice to the Foundation of a transfer pursuant to a bona fide foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust or to a deed in lieu of foreclosure.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">On June 7, 2005, after the effective date of the amendments, the Foundation wrote to appellant, acknowledging receipt of his non-transferable building permit and attaching a proposed \u201cFinal Release and Agreement\u201d for his signature. In addition to other terms and conditions that were substantially equivalent to those contained in the Preliminary Release, the proposed Final Release stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">[I]t is the intent of this instrument to release the [Owner\u2019s Lot] for the personal residential use of the person named in the building permit____ <em>The parties agree that this right may not be transferred to any other person for five (5) years from the date of the final release, except on:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">a) Approval by the Foundation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-14\">b) Notwithstanding <em>any </em>conditions on transfers imposed under item 1 of this subparagraph [sic], a lender providing notice to the Foundation of a transfer pursuant to a bona fide foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust or to a deed in lieu of foreclosure. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Appellant refused to sign the proposed Final Release. Through counsel, he wrote to the Foundation, questioning whether he was subject to the language derived from Chapter 498, prohibiting transfer of the Owner\u2019s Lot for five years from the date of the final release, given that Chapter 498 was enacted after the execution of the Easement and the Preliminary Release. On September 12, 2005, the Foundation responded, maintaining that appellant was subject to Chapter 498. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">As the easement grantor, only [appellant] has the one time right to an owner\u2019s lot for the purpose of constructing a dwelling solely for his personal use. Before Chapter 498\u2019s enactment the law did not allow a released lot for a dwelling to be conveyed to any other person but restricted its use to the landowner who sold the easement. This left the released owner\u2019s lot in legal limbo -with lenders and others that was corrected by the enactment of Chapter 498 (effective October 1, 2004) that now allows certain transfers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">Chapter 498 ... provides a benefit to landowners, such as [appellant], who make application for allowable lot releases after October 1, 2005; again, this benefit allows them to transfer owner\u2019s lots to others, whereas before, the law did not provide this opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">Lastly, the Foundation does not have the authority to waive the language release requirements of Chapter 498; [appellant] applied for a lot release after Chapter 498\u2019s effective date and he is subject to its requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">On November 9, 2006, appellant filed a \u201cComplaint for a Writ of Mandamus and Declaratory Judgment\u201d against Lewis R. Riley, then the State Secretary of Agriculture, and James Conrad, Executive Director of the Foundation. Appellant filed an amended complaint on January 8, 2007, adding the Foundation as a defendant and substituting Daniel W. Colhoun, the Chairman of the Foundation, for Conrad. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Roger L. Richardson succeeded Riley as Secretary, Richardson was substituted for Riley, pursuant to appellees\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In his amended complaint, appellant sought a declaratory judgment that Chapter 498 \u201cmay not be applied retroactively to modify the terms and conditions of the Deed of Easement or the terms and conditions of the final release to which [appellant] is entitled.\u201d He also sought a writ of mandamus ordering appellees to execute a final release that did not include the terms derived from Chapter 498. Additionally, appellant sought damages in the amount of $100,000, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">On April 9, 2007, appellees moved to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. In an affidavit of Conrad, appended to the motion, Conrad opined that, under the terms of appellant\u2019s Deed of Easement and the proposed Final Release, \u201cthe dwelling is only for Claggett\u2019s use; the easement does not grant Claggett the right to sell or transfer the dwelling.\u201d Conrad asserted that before Chapter 498\u2019s enactment,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abs\">MALPF\u2019s long-standing administrative practice was to allow or approve dwelling transfers after a dwelling is constructed and is actually occupied by the owner, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) death of the owner; (2) upon a mortgage foreclosure; (3) upon a change in employment or upon the illness of the owner; (4) or for any reason when MALPF determines that it would be impracticable for the dwelling to be occupied by the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Conrad explained that, by enacting Chapter 498, the General Assembly \u201cprovided MALPF with a procedure to ensure that a landowner is using the dwelling after it is constructed for his use and not immediately selling it as a commercial investment.\u201d According to Conrad, after the enactment of Chapter 498, the Department of Agriculture promulgated an \u201cinterpretive regulation\u201d in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO MAR\u201d), incorporating the Foundation\u2019s administrative practice with respect to dwelling transfers and the requirements of Chapter 498. <em>See </em>COMAR 15.15.06 (discussed <em>infra </em>).

The Foundation contended that the right to an owner\u2019s lot is \u201ca personal covenant, one not intended to run with the land, a limited right that may not be conveyed to a third person.\u201d It also asserted: \u201cThis restriction prohibiting Mr. Claggett from conveying this right to a third person was expressly noted ... in the preliminary release that the Foundation issued Mr. Claggett in 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">While opposing appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, appellant maintained that \u201cthe matter is ripe for resolution by this Court by the issuance of a Declaratory Judgment and a Writ of Mandamus.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted that the Foundation\u2019s \u201crestriction prevents Mr. Claggett from doing things like estate planning,\u201d and explained that under the restriction, \u201che can\u2019t transfer the property to his wife. Mr. Claggett was not married in 2000 when he granted the deed of easement. He is married now. He can\u2019t transfer by inter vivos deed to his wife to even out their holdings for estate planning purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The circuit court inquired whether appellant had asked the Foundation to \u201capprove release of [the] land if [appellant] transferred it to [his] wife,\u201d to which appellant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cNo. But he shouldn\u2019t have to. That\u2019s the point of why we\u2019re here.\u201d When asked whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>appellant could transfer title to his wife\u2019s name alone, counsel for the Foundation conceded, \u201c[t]hat would be a problem....\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">After considering the arguments of counsel, the court ruled from the bench. It said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkIb\">This case raises the question of the retroactivity of the statute that was enacted effective October 1, 2004 to state that the owner of a two acre lot, an owner\u2019s lot or family lot, that was before subject to the restrictions of an Agriculture Foundation Preservation Foundation [sic] easement could not sell that lot for a period of five years from the date of the final release from the easement. And as Counsel know every [sic] well, there is \u00e1 presumption against such retroactivity of a statute. There are exceptions to that presumption. The presumption is overcome if the statute affects only procedures or remedies. And that\u2019s the position of the [Foundation] \u2014 that this statute affected only procedures and remedies and it actually benefits the landowner because, until this statute, the [Foundation] argues, there is no right to transfer the lot, and this at least allows that lot to be transferred after the owner resides on the property or owns the house for five years. [Appellant\u2019s counsel] says that the [Foundation] is therefore missing the point either accidentally or deliberately that the distinction is between the building permit issuance and ... the release and the transfer without that building permit and final release. This ... case is distinguished because there is a house already built, built by the owner, apparently, with a building permit issued some two years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">The [appellant] has filed an amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and a writ [of] mandamus----[A]nd ... the easy part of the case, that this Court award [appellant] damages in the amount of $100,000.00 plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and the cost of this proceeding. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the Court says that\u2019s the easy part because the Court accepts the [Foundation\u2019s] argument that, under the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity, the [appellant\u2019s] claim for money damages is barred. And, therefore, that portion of Count 2 is dismissed.<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">The [Foundation] also argues that there\u2019s no justiciable issue between the Parties and, therefore, Count 1 must be dismissed and argues that, as we\u2019ve noted, Count 2 should also be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">The Court is troubled by the case in that the whole purpose of the Agricultural Preservation Foundation easement was to protect agricultural land and to stop the diminution of acreage in agricultural use. That purpose is no longer applicable to this lot. The house is there. It\u2019s now residential property. And the entire purpose of the Ag Preservation Foundation ... has been circumvented in part by the owner\u2019s provisions that the Foundation itself proposed to permit one owner\u2019s house, and in part by Mr. Claggett proceeding to construct this house pursuant to his building permit without having first secured the executed release from the Maryland Agricultural Preservation Foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">The Court finds that the [Foundation\u2019s] intent and the Legislative intent in passage of ... Chapter 498 of the Laws of 2004 is clear. [T]he [Foundation\u2019s] intent and the Legislature\u2019s intent was to restrict transfer of such properties for a period of five years from the issuance of the final release. Accordingly, we find that Mr. Claggett was subject to the provisions of the [Foundation] and the legislation, and we will grant summary judgment to the [Foundation] with respect to the declaratory judgment ... count and will grant summary judgment as to the remainder of the writ of mandamus that was not already dismissed, being that part that sought money damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The court entered an Order effectuating its oral ruling on May 7, 2007.

In appellant\u2019s view, this language constitutes \u201ca five year restriction on the alienability of the two-acre lot which ... was not included in the terms of the Deed of Easement, the Preliminary Release, or in the law in effect at the time the Deed of Easement was executed by Appellant and delivered to MALPF....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Appellant \u201ccontends that there can be no doubt that Chapter 498 added a new restriction to the alienability of title to Appellant\u2019s two-acre lot which restriction was not a part of the Deed of Easement or Preliminary Release.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt is equally clear that this new restriction materially alters and impairs Appellant\u2019s rights to deal in and with his property for a period of five years from the date of the Final Release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">According to MALPF, appellant errs in asserting \u201cthat Chapter 498 impairs his right to transfer the owner\u2019s lot,\u201d and mis characterizes Chapter 498 as imposing a \u201cFive-Year Restriction.\u201d In its view, the statute \u201cis not a restriction at all, but a benefit to Mr. Claggett....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The Foundation explains that, under the terms of the Deed and the provisions of the Agriculture Article in effect at the time the Easement was granted, appellant \u201cwould not have been permitted to transfer the released lot and dwelling except under circumstances consistent with MALPF\u2019s longstanding administrative practice.\u201d As a result of the passage of Chapter 498, however, the Foundation claims that appellant \u201cis free to transfer the lot without MALPF\u2019s permission after five years have elapsed from the date of the Final Release.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>According to MALPF, by enacting Chapter 498, \u201cthe Legislature has granted [appellant] the unconditional right to transfer his owner\u2019s dwelling lot five years from the date of the final release, a right that does not exist in his Deed of Easement and did not exist before Chapter 498\u2019s enactment.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">Thus, the Foundation maintains that the circuit court was correct in concluding that the General Assembly intended Chapter 498 to apply to Mr. Claggett\u2019s Final Release. Contrary to his claim, Chapter 498 does nothing to interfere with Mr. Claggett\u2019s right to an owner\u2019s lot under the Deed of Easement. Instead, Chapter 498 provides a remedy that addresses the General Assembly\u2019s concern over the potential for abuse over the transfer of an owner\u2019s lot to ineligible persons once MALPF grants a Final Release this lot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Foundation posits that \u201cMALPF has not given retroactive effect to Chapter 498 beyond anything intended by the legislature. MALPF followed the legislature\u2019s direction that Chapter 498 applies to all releases issued on or after October 1, 2004. Mr. Claggett applied for his Final Release after Chapter 498\u2019s effective date.\u201d In addition, it argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[S]ince the statements required by Chapter 498, <em>Laws of Maryland </em>2004, do not affect Mr. Claggett\u2019s right to a lot for a dwelling provided in the Deed of Easement and only provides remedies and procedures for the enforcement of that right, the lower court correctly determined that the Legislature intended Chapter 498 to apply to Claggett\u2019s pending request for a Final Release. Any other decision allowing Mr. Claggett to sell or transfer his owner\u2019s dwelling and lot anytime he wishes would be contrary to the Deed of Easement and the requirements of State law, and would undermine one of the fundamental deed covenants provided in each of the more than 1800 easements held by MALPF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Appellant has framed the issues on appeal in terms of whether Chapter 498 applies retroactively to his easement. Ordinarily, \u201cstatutes are presumed to operate prospectively.\u201d <em>Roth v. Dimensions Health Corp., </em>332 Md. 627, 636, 632 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>1170 (1993). \u201cOnce a party enters into a contract valid under the statute at the time of execution, subsequent statutes, generally, cannot impair the operation of those contracts.\u201d <em>Selig v. State Highway Admin., </em>383 Md. 655, 677, 861 A.2d 710 (2004); <em>see also County Comm\u2019rs for Carroll County v.

Thus, a statute cannot be applied retroactively if it \u201cwould impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party\u2019s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\u201d <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). Nevertheless, there is \u201cno absolute prohibition against retroactive application of a statute.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 123, 360 A.2d 1 (1976). The Court of Appeals has described a retroactive statute as \u201cone which purports to determine the legal significance of acts or events that have occurred prior to the statute\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">One exception to the general rule of prospective application concerns legislation involving procedural changes that provide remedies for the enforcement of rights. <em>See Roth, </em>332 Md. at 636, 632 A.2d 1170 (\u201cNotwithstanding this presumption [against retroactivity], if the statute \u2018contains a clear expression of intent that it operate retrospectively, or the statute affects only procedures or remedies, it will be given retroactive application.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. at 124, 360 A.2d 1); <em>Mason v.

Keehn, </em>183 Md. 140, 144, 36 A.2d 544 (1944) (\u201cWhere the effect of the statute is not to obliterate existing substantial rights but affects only the procedure and remedies for the enforcement of those rights, it applies to all actions whether accrued, pending or future, unless a contrary intention is expressed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Maryland law recognizes four basic principles regarding the application of statutes to events that occurred prior to their effective date. These principles, set forth in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v.

Riverdale Heights Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 563-64, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The parties do not disagree over the present meaning of Agrie. \u00a7 2-513, as amended by Chapter 498.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As we have indicated, under the current statute, a landowner who obtains an owner\u2019s release requires the Foundation\u2019s permission to sell or transfer the owner\u2019s lot until five years after the lot is released; after five years have passed, the landowner may freely alienate the lot. However, the parties vigorously dispute what rights the statute provided to landowners before Chapter 498 was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The parties\u2019 positions on the retroactivity of Chapter 498 are predicated on their respective interpretations of the substantive provisions of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513, which were in effect prior to the enactment of Chapter 498, at the time when the Deed and the Preliminary Release were executed. The par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ties\u2019 fundamental disagreement pertains to what rights appellant had under Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Appellant contends that he had the right to sell his Owner\u2019s Lot under the statutory scheme that existed before Chapter 498 was enacted. He believes, therefore, that retroactive application of Chapter 498 would impair his vested contractual rights by creating a substantive restriction on the alienability of his Owner\u2019s Lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Conversely, under the Foundation\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Agriculture Article, the restriction on alienability existed before Chapter 498 was enacted. MALPF claims that, before the amendment was passed, any transfer of an owner\u2019s lot was subject to its approval. In the Foundation\u2019s view, Chapter 498 actually represents a relaxation of the restriction, because it provides that, once five years have elapsed after the release of an owner\u2019s lot, the Foundation\u2019s approval is no longer required in order to sell the lot. Thus, the Foundation\u2019s view as to retroactive application is predicated on its view of Chapter 498 as a procedural enactment that enlarges appellant\u2019s substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The parties agree that Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 specifies a right that is reserved only to appellant. The question is, what is the nature of that right? Notably, the Foundation does not argue that, if Chapter 498 does, in fact, impose a new restriction on alienability, the restriction is nonetheless enforceable retroactively. If the Foundation is correct that, even before Chapter 498 was enacted, appellant was barred from selling his Owner\u2019s Lot, appellant presumably would not quarrel with a retroactive application of Chapter 498 that would lift this restriction after five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">To resolve the controversy, we must construe Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513. We have not found a reported decision in Maryland that has interpreted this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In the first instance, the parties\u2019 rights are contractual. The relevant provisions of the Agriculture Article authorize the Foundation to acquire easements and grant releases. But, it is the easement and release agreements themselves that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>directly establish the rights of the parties. Nevertheless, when, as here, \u201cthe terms of the contract are derived from explicit statutory guidelines ... the paramount consideration is interpreting the pertinent statutory provision.\u201d <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194 (2001). <em>See also Forty West, </em>178 Md.App. at 381, 941 A.2d 1181 (\u201c \u2018[P]arties to a contract are presumed to contract mindful of the existing law and ... all applicable or relevant laws must be read into the agreement of the parties just as if expressly provided by them, except where a contrary intention is evident.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Auction &amp; Estate Reps., Inc. v.

Consequently, if an easement grantor did not take advantage of the release procedure before selling the burdened property, a subsequent purchaser would be unable to obtain the release of an owner\u2019s lot. Moreover, if a grantor commenced the release procedure and obtained a preliminary or final release, but then sold the entire burdened property and/or an owner\u2019s lot before constructing a dwelling, the subsequent purchaser would be unable to build a dwelling on the unimproved owner\u2019s lot, because the building permit required to obtain a release is non-transferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In arguing that the Foundation may not add additional requirements to the statutory release scheme, appellant relies on the provision of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2)(viii), in effect at the time he granted the Easement. It provided: \u201cThe Foundation may not restrict the ability of a landowner who originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>sold an easement to acquire a release under this paragraph beyond the requirements provided in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">In contrast, the Foundation contends that, under Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513, appellant was not \u201cpermitted to transfer the released lot and dwelling,\u201d absent the Foundation\u2019s approval. The Foundation rejects appellant\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2)(viii), reasoning that \u201c[s]ince Chapter 498 is now a part of \u00a7 2-513 there is no violation of this section because MALPF is not requiring anything to be in the Claggett release that is \u2018beyond the requirements provided in this section [\u00a7 2-513].\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In our view, the Foundation\u2019s interpretation of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 is incorrect. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The plain language of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 does not contain an explicit restriction on the right of a landowner who has obtained the release of an owner\u2019s lot to sell the lot to a third party. The statute simply does not speak to the issue. Until the enactment of Chapter 498, there was no mention in \u00a7 2-513 of the alienability <em>vel non </em>of an owner\u2019s lot. Rather, Agl999 \u00a7 2-513 spoke in terms of the \u201cuse\u201d of the owner\u2019s lot. Other than restrictions on further subdivision of an owner\u2019s lot, <em>see </em>Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513(b)(2)(iv), Chapter 498 marks the first appearance in the statutory scheme of any language that explicitly suggests a restriction on the landowner\u2019s ability to transfer the lot to another person. It speaks directly in terms of alienability of the lot, providing that <em>\u201cthe owner\u2019s </em>... <em>lot may not be transferred </em>for 5 years from the date of the final release____\u201d 2004 Md. Laws ch. 498, at 2330 (emphasis added). On its face, this is a restriction on the alienability of property, which does not appear in Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Thus, the plain text of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 suggests that the Foundation is incorrect. The Foundation\u2019s interpretation of the pre-Chapter 498 statute requires a significant inferential leap: the Foundation derives an <em>implied </em>restriction on alien-ability from language that, at most, only explicitly restricts the use of an owner\u2019s lot.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In MALPF\u2019s view, \u201cthe construction of a dwelling is for Claggett\u2019s use only,\u201d and it is the right to use the dwelling for residential purposes that is nontransferable. Put another way, the Foundation considers the right to \u201cuse\u201d the constructed dwelling to be reserved \u201conly for Mr. Claggett; a personal covenant [that] does not pass and cannot be transferred or assigned by Mr. Claggett to any. future owner of the farm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">To be sure, the language of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 can be read grammatically to support the view that only the original landowner may <em>use </em>an owner\u2019s lot for residential purposes. In the provision that the Foundation \u201cshall release [a lot] free of easement restrictions <em>only for the landoumer </em>who originally sold [the] easement,\u201d the ambiguity concerns what is modified by the phrase \u201conly for the landowner.\u201d Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513(b)(2). (Emphasis added.) \u201c[0]nly for the landowner\u201d may refer back to \u201crelease,\u201d i.e., the right to obtain a release (supporting appellant\u2019s view) or \u201cfree of easement restrictions,\u201d i.e, the right to use the lot for residential purposes (supporting the Foundation\u2019s view).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As the Foundation construes the statute, only the landowner may possess an owner\u2019s lot that is \u201cfree of restrictions.\u201d This is because the statute says \u201cfree of easement restrictions only for the landowner.... \u201d MALPF relies on its \u201clong-standing administrative practice,\u201d later codified in COMAR 15.15.06, by which the Foundation, as grantee of an easement, permits a grantor to transfer an owner\u2019s lot only under certain conditions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Under COMAR 15.15.06.01(C), an owner\u2019s lot \u201cmay not be transferred to any other person,\u201d except as provided by the regulation. COMAR 15.15.06.05(A) states that a landowner who obtains the release of an owner\u2019s lot \u201cmay not transfer or lease the lot to any person except after the expiration of 5 years from the date of the Foundation\u2019s final release for the lot.\u201d Further, COMAR 15.15.06.05(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Before the expiration of the 5-year period, the Foundation may only approve a landowner\u2019s or child\u2019s request to transfer a lot upon the occurrence of the following events:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">(1) Notice to the Foundation of a transfer pursuant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">(a) A bona fide foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">(b) A deed in lieu of foreclosure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">(2) The death of the landowner or landowner\u2019s child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>(3) A decree of divorce where the landowner or child is ordered to sell or transfer the lot as part of a bona fide property settlement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">(4) A change of employment location of the landowner or child where the Foundation determines that it would be impractical for the landowner or child to commute to the new work location; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">(5) Any other circumstance, as determined by the Foundation, where it would be impossible<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark> for the landowner or child to continue to occupy the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The regulation also mandates: \u201cA landowner or child who has a lot released under the terms of the easement may not transfer or lease the lot if a dwelling has never been constructed on the lot.\u201d COMAR 15.15.06.05(B). And, it provides that \u201c[a] person who transfers a lot in violation of this chapter is in violation of the agricultural land preservation easement applicable to the farm.\u201d COMAR 15.15.06.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Notably, COMAR 15.15.06 was adopted by the Department of Agriculture as an emergency regulation, <em>after </em>the enactment of Chapter 498. Indeed, it was adopted after the Foundation tendered its proposed Final Release to appellant. The regulation became effective on an emergency basis on July 17, 2006, only shortly before appellant filed suit. <em>See </em>33 Md. Reg. 1417, 1435 (Aug. 18, 2006) (\u201cNotice of Emergency Action\u201d). It was proposed as a permanent regulation on August 18, 2006, <em>id. </em>at 1473-74 (\u201cNotice of Proposed Action\u201d), and was permanently adopted effective November 6, 2006. 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Md. Reg. 1703, 1733-34 (Oct. 27, 2006) (\u201cNotice of Final Action\u201d). Until that point, according to Conrad, the Foundation adhered to a similar, unwritten policy that was a \u201clongstanding administrative practice.\u201d We have no basis to conclude that COMAR 15.15.06 is an impermissible regulation under the present provisions of Agrie. \u00a7 2-513, as amended by Chapter 498. Because the regulation postdates Chapter 498\u2019s enactment, however, it cannot be seen as an interpretation of the statutory scheme that existed before Chapter 498, under Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513. Moreover, we are not persuaded that the Foundation\u2019s \u201clong-standing administrative practice,\u201d prior to Chapter 498\u2019s enactment, was a correct or reasonable interpretation of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">In our view, the Foundation\u2019s interpretation is problematic in terms of the plain text of the statute. In essence, the Foundation believes that the statute creates a <em>de facto </em>restriction on the ability to sell an owner\u2019s lot, because the Foundation believes that only the original landowner may use the lot for residential purposes. But the statute plainly contemplates that an owner\u2019s lot will be owned by other persons after the original owner. The statute provides: \u201cAny release, preliminary release, building permit, or other document issued or submitted in accordance with this paragraph shall be recorded among the land records where the land is located and shall bind all future owners.\u201d Ag-1999 \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2)(vii). Indeed, given the finite duration of a human life, one must expect that persons other than the original landowner will one day own an owner\u2019s lot. If the Foundation were correct that such subsequent owners could not \u201cuse\u201d the lot for residential purposes, any subsequent owner would be forced to tear down the dwelling on the owner\u2019s lot and return the land to agricultural use. Although this result is, in some sense, in harmony with the purpose of the agricultural preservation easement scheme to preserve land for agricultural use, it seems a perverse way of ensuring agricultural preservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Our conclusion that the Foundation\u2019s interpretation does not accord with the Legislature\u2019s intent is supported by consideration of the history of \u00a7 2-513 of the Agriculture Article. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>legislative history reveals that appellant is correct: the Legislature intended that the right reserved \u201conly for the landowner\u201d is the right to obtain the release of an owner\u2019s lot. In turn, that would enable the grantor to build a house on the lot and subsequently sell both the lot and the house, free of easement restrictions. Although the Foundation cites certain recent elements of the statutory history in support of its interpretation, it is apparent, on closer inspection, that the history of Agrie. \u00a7 2-513, including the amendments cited by MALPF, lend support to appellant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Foundation was created and empowered to acquire agricultural preservation easements by 1974 Md. Laws ch. 642. The 1974 Act set forth form language to be used in a deed to convey an agricultural preservation easement. <em>Id. </em>Deeds of easement executed under the 1974 Act only prohibited \u201cindustrial or commercial activities, with the exception of farming\u201d on burdened property. . <em>Id. </em>at 2183. Such deeds did not explicitly restrict the residential use of the land. They did bar subdivision of the land without the Foundation\u2019s permission, however, and restricted the structures built or maintained on burdened property to \u201c(i) farm buildings or structures and (ii) a single-family dwelling and outbuildings commonly or appropriately incidental thereto____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In 1977, the General Assembly enacted 1977 Md. Laws ch. 883, which is the source of \u00a7 2-513. In the 1977 Act, the Legislature \u201cremovfed] from the Code the form of the easement,\u201d and instead \u201cestablished] criteria for easements.\u201d Easements under the 1977 Act were to \u201cprovide that residential subdivision for commercial purposes is not permitted.\u201d 1977 Md. Laws ch. 883 \u00a7 1, at 3409 (enacting \u00a7 2-513(b)). But, the 1977 Act created the procedure by which a landowner and his children could each receive a one-acre lot for \u201cthe purpose of construction of one dwelling house intended for his or their use,\u201d and provided that this procedure \u201cdoes not constitute a residential subdivision for commercial purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During its consideration by the General Assembly, the bill that would become the 1977 Act was amended to require that only \u201cthe owner who originally sold an easement to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Foundation\u201d and that owner\u2019s children were eligible for the residential lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The subsequent history of \u00a7 2-513 is one of continuing refinement of the release scheme.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In 1981, the Legislature amended \u00a7 2-513 to require that, \u201c[b]efore any conveyance is made pursuant to this subsection, an owner shall agree with the Foundation not to subdivide any land conveyed. This agreement shall be recorded among the land records where the land is located and shall bind all future owners.\u201d 1981 Md. Laws ch. 347, at 1707.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A 1982 amendment, 1982 Md. Laws ch. 613 (enacting H.B. 420), established a maximum number and density of children\u2019s lots that could be released from an easement. The 1982 Act allowed, <em>id. </em>at 3352,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">the owner to convey, free of the easement restrictions, not more than 1 acre or less at a maximum density of not more than 1 acre for each 20 acres or portion thereof not to exceed 10 lots of 1 acre or less on any farm parcel, subject to the easement to any child of the owner for the purpose of constructing a dwelling house intended for use by that child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0S\">In addition, the 1982 amendment introduced the requirement that \u201c[t]he owner shall pay the State for the release of the easment [sic] or for the benefit of conveying free of the easement restrictions at the price per acre that the State paid the owner for the grant of the easement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requirement was the subject of a Senate Bill in the same session, <em>see </em>S.B. 95, Gen. Assem. (Md.1982), which was added to the House Bill that ultimately became the 1982 Act by amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in both chambers. <em>See </em>Bill File, H.B. 420, Gen. Assem. (Md.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Notably, the 1982 Act also provided that, upon application, \u201cthe Foundation shall release from the easement restrictions 1 acre or less of the land subject to the easement for the purpose of constructing a dwelling house for the use of the <em>only that </em>owner <em>who originally sold an easement to the Foundation </em>.... \u2019\u2019(strikeout and underlining in original, indicating amendments to the bill as originally introduced). This is the source of the language that the Foundation interprets as a restriction of use of the dwelling house to the original owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The \u201cLegislative Comment\u201d on H.B. 420, submitted by the Department of Agriculture to the House Finance Committee, explained that the purpose of the bill was to \u201calter[] the number of residential lots which may be subdivided and transferred to the children of the owner of land on which an agricultural land preservation easement has been sold____\u201d Dep\u2019t of Agrie., Legislative Comment on H.B. 420, at 1 (April 5, 1982). The Department recounted that under the then-current version of \u00a7 2-513, the owner was entitled to \u201c \u2018conveyance of one acre or less for the owner who originally sold an easement to the Foundation and for each of his children for the purposes [sic] of construction of one dwelling house intended for his or their use____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 2-513(b), as enacted by 1977 Md. Laws ch. 883). The Department explained, <em>id. </em>at 1-2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Several problems have arisen from these provisions in implementation of the program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">First, in some instances, especially where the Foundation secures an easement on a farm of smaller than average size, the permissibility for lot transfer is too great, to the extent that it may jeopardize the integrity of our preservation investment.... This amendment would place a ceiling on the number of lots which can be subdivided for children at one lot per 20 acres of land plus one lot for the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqN\">The Department also explained the rationale for the amended language in the bill that specified that the lot release was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>for \u201cthe purpose of constructing a dwelling house for the use of the <em>only that </em>owner <em>who originally sold an easement to the </em>Foundation____\u201d 1982 Md. Laws ch. 613 (strikeout and underline in original indicating amendment to bill as originally introduced). The Department said, Legislative Comment at 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab0\">Since the bill was drafted and filed, we have found an omission of language of considerable importance which should be restored to the language of the proposed bill. Currently, the permissibility of lot transfer is applicable only to the landowner who originally sold an easement to the Foundation. This is an important protective provision for which an amendment to H.B. 420 was provided in the House.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Thus, the legislative history of the 1982 Act suggests that the intent of the Legislature was merely to reserve to the original landowner the right to obtain lot releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Further elements of the legislative history confirm this interpretation. The bill file for S.B. 95, the Senate companion bill to H.B. 420, contains a letter from Michael I. Volk, a legislative drafting analyst for the General Assembly, to Senator John A. Cade. Letter from Michael I. Volk to Senator John A. Cade (Jan. 27, 1982). Mr. Volk wrote that he was responding to Senator Cade\u2019s inquiry: \u201cWhat happens if the child [who acquires a child\u2019s lot] dies \u2014 is the easement reinstated?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. Volk responded that \u201cthe use of the acre for the child\u2019s residential dwelling is a personal covenant that does not run with the land....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Moreover, Volk stated that \u201ca subsequent owner of the acre or house is not bound to maintain the property as a residence and may utilize it as he sees fit....\u201d <em>Id. </em>This letter also militates against the Foundation\u2019s present position that until the enactment of Chapter 498, \u00a7 2-513 imposed a perpetual restriction on the use of an owner\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In 1987, the Legislature again amended \u00a7 2-513, this time to close a \u201cloophole\u201d created by the 1982 Act.1987 Md. Laws ch. 65 (enacting H.B. 164). The substantive change introduced by the 1987 Act was to extend the 1982 Act\u2019s density <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>restriction to all owner\u2019s lots and children\u2019s lots on a burdened property, rather than merely the children\u2019s lots. The Summary of Committee Report that accompanied H.B. 164 on its favorable recommendation from the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Current law provides a loophole for owners of property on which an easement has been purchased that does not exist for the children of the landowner who has received a conveyance. A landowner with a 200-acre easement is presently permitted to convey 10 lots to his children and develop an eleventh lot for the owner\u2019s use. Two or more landowners of the same 200-acre easement could make 20 conveyances and hold 2 owners\u2019 lots. Both scenarios, allowable under current law, exceed the one-lot-per-twenty-acre limit that was intended when the agricultural easement program was initiated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">S. Econ. &amp; Envir. Affairs Cmte., Summary of Comm. Report, H.B. 164, Gen. Assem. (Md.1987), at 2. Thus, the 1987 Act closed this loophole by providing: \u201cThe total number of lots allowed to be released under this section may not exceed 10 lots of 1 acre or less at a maximum of not more than 1 lot for each 20 acres or portion thereof.\u201d 1987 Md. Laws ch. 65 \u00a7 1, at 477 (enacting \u00a7 2-516(b)(2)(i)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The 1987 Act significantly restructured \u00a7 2-513(b)(l), breaking it into several subparagraphs. It introduced language stating specifically that \u201cthe Foundation shall release [an owner\u2019s lot] free of easement restrictions only for the landowner who originally sold an easement.\u201d However, this addition, and the restructuring of the section, were only intended to \u201crestructure[ ] the current format for the sake of clarity,\u201d according to a \u201cLegislative Comment\u201d on the bill by the Department of Agriculture. <em>See </em>Md. Dep\u2019t of Agrie., Legislative Comment on H.B. 164 (Feb. 3, 1987). The Legislature apparently did not intend a substantive change by the introduction of the phrase \u201cthe Foundation shall release free of easement restrictions only for the landowner.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>A 1994 amendment, 1994 Md. Laws ch. 683 (enacting H.B. 1501), introduced the two-step process for obtaining a release. The favorable floor report for H.B. 1501 from the House Committee on Appropriations noted that the bill \u201cwas drafted ... with the intent of preventing unintended development abuse through the easement release process.\u201d H. Cmte. Appropriations, Floor Report \u2014 1994 Session, H.B. 1501, at 1. The two-step process was intended \u201cto ensure that all statutory conditions for the release are met[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">As we have seen, between the time of the parties\u2019 execution of the Deed of Easement and the Foundation\u2019s tender of the proposed Final Release, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 258 (2003) and Chapter 498 (2004). As noted, Chapter 258 created a new, alternative procedure to obtain the release of an \u201cunrestricted lot,\u201d in lieu of the owner\u2019s lots and children\u2019s lots available under the prior release scheme. According to the Foundation, Chapter 258 supports its interpretation that Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 restricted the alienability of an owner\u2019s lot. The Foundation asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">Chapter 258 ... provides further support that it was the Legislature\u2019s intent to prohibit landowners from selling or transferring an owner\u2019s lot for a dwelling released to them under the Deed of Easement. Chapter 258 allows a landowner who conveys an easement on or after October 1, 2003, to elect an \u201cunrestricted\u201d lot for a dwelling under the Deed of Easement in lieu of the restricted owner\u2019s lot. Unlike the case for the owner\u2019s lot, Chapter 258 provides that the \u201cunrestricted lot may be subdivided from the easement and sold to anyone to construct one residential dwelling ... <em>at any time.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied). If a landowner is free to transfer an owner\u2019s lot at any time, as Mr. Claggett claims, there would have been no need for the Legislature to establish an \u201cunrestricted\u201d lot right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The Foundation overlooks significant differences between the \u201cunrestricted\u201d lot release permitted by Chapter 258 and the pre-existing scheme for release of a \u201crestricted\u201d owner\u2019s lot in other sections of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513. First, under the pre-existing scheme, an owner\u2019s lot could not be released \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>any time,\u201d nor does appellant so claim. An owner\u2019s lot could not be released until the original landowner applied for a release, committed not to further subdivide the lot, and submitted a non-transferable building permit for construction of a dwelling house that was to be for that landowner\u2019s use only. <em>See </em>Ag-1999 \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2). Critically, this option was only available to the original landowner. <em>Id. </em>The parties agree that, if the original landowner sold a burdened property without having acquired the release of an owner\u2019s lot, the option to release an owner\u2019s lot would be gone forever. The option could not be transferred to a subsequent purchaser. In contrast, under Chapter 258, \u201c[i]f the property is transferred before the right to exclude the lot has been exercised, the right may be transferred with the property.\u201d Chapter 258 (enacting Agrie. \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(3)(vii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Moreover, under Chapter 258, \u201c[a]n unrestricted lot may be subdivided by the landowner from the easement and sold to anyone to construct one residential dwelling!)]\u201d Chapter 258 (enacting Agrie. \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(3)(ii)). In contrast, under Agrie. \u00a7 2-513, when a landowner applies for the release of a restricted lot, the two-step procedure ensures that only that landowner may construct a dwelling on the lot. Finally, under Chapter 258, \u201c[t]he right to the lot is taken into consideration in the appraisal of fair market value and determination of easement value[.]\u201d Chapter 258 (enacting Agrie. \u00a7 2-513(b)(3)(v)). Under the restricted lot process of \u00a7 2-513, on the other hand, the landowner must repay the State the per acre price of the owner\u2019s lot. Ag-1999 \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">There are significant differences between the procedures. Most important, the release scheme of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 does not, even under appellant\u2019s interpretation, permit the release of an owner\u2019s lot \u201cat any time.\u201d Thus, the fact that the Chapter 258 procedure permits the release of an owner\u2019s lot \u201cat any time\u201d does not militate against appellant\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Finally, the Foundation urges that Chapter 498 itself is evidence of the fact that, until Chapter 498\u2019s enactment, Ag-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>1999 \u00a7 2-513 prohibited the sale of an owner\u2019s lot to a third party at any time. The Foundation argues that the General Assembly \u201cenact[ed] Chapter 498 (HB 164) in response to the ongoing concern over the illegal transfer of owner\u2019s lots to ineligible persons <em>after a dwelling is constructed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) In support of its position, the Foundation quotes from the Senate Floor Report to H.B. 164:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">According to MALPF, most program participants understand the restrictions on the development rights that they have sold to MALPF. However, MALPF reports that sometimes there is an incentive to develop family lots for commercial profit by selling those lots to ineligible third-parties. Though the two-stage lot release process makes it difficult for the lot to be transferred to an ineligible third party before a house is constructed, a substantial incentive still exists to build a house as a speculative investment to be sold to a third-party once the house is ready for occupancy. Under current law, MALPF has no way to verify that lots are developed for legitimate purposes. This bill is intended to allow MALPF to review the subsequent transfer of family lots for five years after they have been released from the easement to verify that the transfer is legitimate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Foundation\u2019s argument is unconvincing. To be sure, \u201c \u2018subsequent legislation can be consulted to determine legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reier, </em>397 Md. at 35, 915 A.2d 970 (quoting <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 78, 854 A.2d 879 (2004)). In our view, however, this statement from Chapter 498\u2019s legislative history supports appellant\u2019s position, rather than the Foundation\u2019s. It is clear that, since the inception of the agricultural preservation easement program, the Legislature has sought to ensure that the release process will not be abused by landowners seeking to profit from residential development. Nevertheless, the quoted passage from the Senate Floor Report demonstrates that, until the passage of Chapter 498, the Foundation \u201cha[d] no way to verify that lots are developed for legitimate purposes,\u201d and that landowners were able to \u201cbuild a house as a speculative investment to be sold to a third-party once the house is ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>for occupancy.\u201d This statement is inconsistent with the proposition that Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 prohibited the sale of an owner\u2019s lot to a third party because, as the beneficiary of an agricultural preservation easement, the Foundation would have been able to enjoin such sale if the sale were prohibited by the terms of easements executed under the pre-Chapter 498 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Plainly, the Legislature frowned upon the practice of using the lot release program as a vehicle for speculative investment in residential real estate \u2014 it enacted Chapter 498 to end the practice. Yet, the fact that the Legislature enacted Chapter 498 is testament to the view that the activity, while perhaps counter to the spirit of the agricultural land preservation program, was legal until Chapter 498 became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In sum, the Foundation\u2019s interpretation of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2-513 creates unreasonable results, while appellant\u2019s interpretation harmonizes the statutory language. Moreover, the statutory history of Agrie. \u00a7 2-513 supports appellant\u2019s interpretation, rather than the Foundation\u2019s. We conclude that, until Chapter 498 was enacted, \u00a7 2-513 of the Agriculture Article permitted a landowner who obtained the release of an owner\u2019s lot, and constructed a dwelling on the lot, to sell the lot and house free of easement restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Even if any ambiguities remained, however, we would be required to resolve them in appellant\u2019s favor. As noted, the rights of the parties in this case arise from the contractual relationship established by the Easement and the Preliminary Release, the terms of which are tied to the statute. It is well established that, \u201c \u2018when the State enters into a contract with constitutional authority, it acquires rights and incurs responsibilities like those of any individuals, who are parties to such a contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mooney v. Univ. System of Md., </em>178 Md.App. 637, 645, 943 A.2d 108 (quoting <em>State v.

Rather, the two documents are subject to the same ambiguities as the statute. Paragraph (l)(b) of the Deed reproduces the language of Ag-1999 \u00a7 2 \u2014 513(b)(2), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">As a personal covenant only and one that is not intended to run with the land, the Grantee, on written application from the Grantor, shall release free of easement restrictions only for the Grantor who originally sold this easement, [an owner\u2019s lot] for the purpose of constructing a dwelling house for the use only of the Grantor....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Further, the Deed provided: \u201cThe right reserved to the Grantor under paragraph (l)(b) belongs only to the Grantor who originally sold this easement and may be exercised only by the Grantor named in the instrument.\u201d This language does not provide clarity, however; it does not illuminate the nature of the right that is reserved to the Grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The Preliminary Release stated that \u201cit is the intent of this instrument to release [the Owner\u2019s Lot] from agricultural easement restrictions set forth in the ... Deed of Easement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for the purpose of constructing a dwelling. The parties agree that this right may not be transferred to any person.\u201d The Preliminary Release also stated that it was subject to \u201cthe condition that its use be for the purpose of constructing a dwelling house for the owner\u2019s residence.\u201d Once again, this was not an explicit restriction on alienability of the Owner\u2019s Lot. At most, it restricted the dwelling house to be \u201cfor the owner\u2019s residence,\u201d but made no provision for the event that the owner might sell the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In any event, if the meaning of a contract is ambiguous, even after resort to extrinsic sources, the contract \u201c \u2018must be construed against ... the drafter____\u2019\u201d <em>Clendenin Bros., Inc. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>390 Md. 449, 456, 889 A.2d 387 (2006) (quoting <em>Sullins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 509-10, 667 A.2d 617 (1995)). <em>See also Anderson Adventures LLC v.

A person or entity generally should have primary control over the disposition of property he, she, it owns.\u201d <em>David A. Bramble, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>396 Md. 443, 460, 914 A.2d 136 (2007). In <em>Lowden v. Bosley, </em>395 Md. 58, 909 A.2d 261 (2006), the Court explained that Maryland adheres to the principle of \u201creasonable strict construction\u201d of restrictive covenants: \u201c \u2018If an ambiguity is present, and if that ambiguity is not clearly resolved by resort to extrinsic evidence, the general rule in favor of the unrestricted use of property will prevail and the ambiguity in a restriction will be resolved against the party seeking its enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 909 A.2d 261 (quoting <em>Belleview v. Rugby Hall, </em>321 Md. 152, 158, 582 A.2d 493 (1990)). In other words, in the absence of contrary extrinsic evidence, \u201can ambiguous covenant [should] be read narrowly in favor of the free alienability and use of land----\u201d <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Bowie v. Mie Properties, Inc., </em>398 Md. 657, 680, 922 A.2d 509 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">As noted, we presume that the General Assembly legislates with full knowledge of existing law and policy. <em>See Taylor v. Mandel, supra, </em>402 Md. at 131, 935 A.2d 671. And, it is established in the common law and policy of this State that, where there is ambiguity in the terms of a restrictive covenant, we must construe the terms against their drafter and in favor of the free alienability and use of land. Thus, to the extent that the Legislature left the terms of easements under the agricultural land preservation program ambiguous, we assume that the Legislature intended for the scales to tip in favor of the landowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Accordingly, because appellant executed his Deed of Easement and received his Preliminary Release before the enactment of Chapter 498, he is not required to obtain the Foundation\u2019s approval in order to transfer his Owner\u2019s Lot to a third party. Chapter 498 prospectively altered the substantive terms of agricultural preservation easements. As noted, the Foundation makes no argument that the Legislature intended for a statute that substantively altered the vested rights of landowners to have retroactive effect; it merely argues that Chapter 498 did not alter vested rights. Because we conclude otherwise, we also conclude that Chapter 498 may not be applied retroactively to appellant with respect to his Owner\u2019s Lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

The Foundation has not urged this Court to give any special deference to its interpretation of \u00a7 2-513. Nevertheless, there is authority in Maryland for the proposition that an agency\u2019s interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>statutes it administers should, \u201cin recognition of the agency's expertise in the field, [be] give[n] ... great deference unless it is in conflict with legislative intent or relevant decisional law, or is clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Economic &amp; Employment Dev. v.
