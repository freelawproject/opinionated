On appeal, Long presents three questions for our review, which we have slightly rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">1. Did the circuit court err in awarding the Elphages $114,969.87 of the foreclosure surplus proceeds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">2. Did the circuit court err in failing to consider Long\u2019s claims of breach of contract, conversion, trespass, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">3. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in granting the Elphages attorneys\u2019 fees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall vacate the judgments of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">This appeal constitutes the third chapter in the continuing saga of the parties\u2019 dispute regarding their interests in real property located at 1305 Chillum Road, Hyattsville, Maryland (\u201cthe Property\u201d). Long and the Elphages have been before this Court twice before on issues stemming from a somewhat convoluted transaction for the sale of the Property via a land installment contract (\u201cthe Contract\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court outlined the nature and the history of the transaction in <em>Long v. Elphage, </em>No. 2064, September Term 2005, slip, op., 171 Md. App. 741 (filed Oct. 12, 2006) <em>(\u201cLong I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\n<em>The Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">On July 29, 1997, the Elphages entered into a land installment contract with the original signatories, Harrison and Margaret Long (\u201cthe Longs\u201d). In 2003, the Longs assigned the Contract to Long.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the Contract, the Elphages had executed a Deed of Trust to secure a loan for their original acquisition of the Property. The balance owed by the Elphages on the Deed of Trust when they entered into the Contract with the Longs was $129,201.67. The Contract recited a total sale price of $169,201.67 and provided that the Longs would make an initial payment of $40,000 in the form of a transfer of real property owned by the Longs in Virginia. The remaining $129,201.67 was to be paid in monthly installments in amounts that would exactly track the monthly payments that the Elphages were required to pay to their lender under the terms of their Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">In <em>Long I </em>this Court noted Mrs. Elphage\u2019s testimony during the original trial, that the Longs were unable to obtain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>funds to purchase the Property outright. Therefore, the Elphages agreed to finance the sale by way of a land installment contract. The Contract required the Longs to transfer a parcel of property they owned in Virginia to the Elphages making up a $40,000 deposit on the purchase price. In addition, the Longs assumed responsibility for the monthly mortgage, escrow payments, property taxes, and for maintaining the Property as required by the Elphages\u2019 Deed of Trust. However, the Longs were to make those payments to the Elphages rather than the note holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Paragraph two of the Contract, entitled \u201cInstallment Payments,\u201d provides that the balance of the purchase price owed by the Longs equaled the balance that the Elphages owed their lender under the Deed of Trust note. The paragraph begins by reciting the existence of the Deed of Trust which required the Elphages to pay monthly installments to their lender \u201cin constant and level monthly installments of $1,029.02 each,\u201d which included payment on the principal of the loan as well as mandatory \u201cmortgage insurance, real estate taxes, and hazard insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paragraph two also explained that the Elphages\u2019 monthly payment on the Deed of Trust \u201cchanges from time to time because of changes in the amount of real estate taxes and hazard insurance premiums.\u201d It listed the following payment schedule that the Elphages were required to follow under the Deed of Trust, exclusive of real estate taxes and hazard insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">July 1,1997 through July 1,2003 $1,066.51</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">August 1, 2003 through July 1, 2023 $1,056.58</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">August 1, 2023 through June 1, 2024 $1,029.02</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">July 1, 2024 $1,022.16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">Having described the Elphages\u2019 payment obligations under the Deed of Trust in Paragraph two, Paragraph four then establishes Long\u2019s payment obligation to the Elphages. That paragraph, entitled \u201cApplication of Provisions of Deed of Trust to Purchaser\u201d, incorporated, in pertinent part, the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ment provisions from the Deed of Trust into the Contract. Specifically, paragraph four provided that \u201cPurchaser [Long] shall comply with, assume, perform, and owe Seller [the Elphages] the duties and obligations described in such paragraphs as though those paragraphs had the substitution of the following terms: (i) \u201cSeller\u201d for \u201cLender,\u201d (ii) \u201cPurchaser\u201d for \u201cBorrower,\u201d and (iii) \u201cInstallment Land Contract between Seller and Purchaser.\u201d \u201d Paragraph thirteen of the Contract accordingly stipulated that Long\u2019s monthly payment due on the first of each month was $1029.02 \u201cexclusive of hazard insurance, real estate taxes, [and] mortgage insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Paragraph three of the Contract gave the Elphages, upon default of any of the provisions of the Contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">the right to accelerate all remaining payments and require [Long] to pay immediately the full amount of the then-remaining balance of principal and outstanding interest and other charges of the Deed of Trust which have not been paid plus all costs and expenses incurred by [the Elphages] in enforcing this contract to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The Contract also provided that when 40% of the balance was paid off, the Elphages would deed the Property to the Longs.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\n<em>The Elphages\u2019 Declaratory Judgment and Breach of Contract Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In 2002, the Elphages brought a declaratory judgment and breach of contract action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the Longs, alleging that the Longs had breached the Contract by failing to pay monthly installments and failing to maintain the Property. The Elphages also sought a declaration that the assignment of the Contract from Harrison and Margaret Long to appellant was void. Although instituted in 2002, the Elphages\u2019 declaratory judgment action has run parallel to the foreclosure proceedings in the instant case but was not consolidated therein. As we noted above, the declaratory judgment action has been the subject of two prior appeals before this Court. To give consistency and clarity to the issues before us in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>case, we excerpt relevant facts and procedural history surrounding the declaratory judgment action from our opinion in <em>Long I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">The Elphages sought a declaration that the Longs were in default and no longer had any rights under the [C]ontract; that they (the Elphages) had the right to repossess the [Property; and that they \u201cshall have the right to foreclose on [the Longs\u2019] equity of redemption by judicial sale.\u201d The Elphages asked the court to enter an order requiring the Longs to release their rights to the [Property and to execute documents conveying to them any interest the Longs had in the [Property. Finally, the Elphages sought compensatory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees as \u201calternative relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Sometime later in 2004, the [Elphages] learned that the [C]ontract had been assigned to [ ] Long. On January 21, 2005, they filed a second amended complaint that added [ ] Long as a defendant and also added a count seeking a declaration that the assignment of the Contract was procured by fraud and was ineffective. The Elphages amended their prayer for relief to request, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court determine that [ ] Long had no legal or equitable interest in the [Property \u201cor, in the alternative,\u201d that they (the Elphages) had the right to bring a foreclosure action against him. They increased their compensatory damages request to $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-8\">A bench trial took place on July 27, 2005----The witnesses who testified about facts relevant to this appeal were Mrs. Elphage and [ ] Long (who was representing himself).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">[Mrs. Elphage testified that] in January 2005, [] Long failed to make any payment to the Elphages. In February 2005, he made a monthly payment that Mrs. Elphage credit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ed as the January 2005 payment. Although the Elphages\u2019 attorney sent a letter to [ ] Long, on February 14, 2005, informing him that he should make payments on the [Pjroperty to Mrs. Elphage, who would accept them, [ j Long did not do so. Nor did he respond to the \u201cNotice of Default\u201d letters of May 16, 2005, and June 15, 2005. Thus, by the time of trial, payments under the [Cjontract were six months in arrears (February through July 2005). As a consequence, Mrs. Elphage had to withdraw money from her IRA account and borrow money from her sister-in-law in order to make the monthly payments on the Property. In total, she and Mr. Elphage had had to pay $8,895 to avoid foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">On August 12, 2005, the trial court issued a written declaration of rights finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that [ ] Long had defaulted under the [Cjontract by failing to make monthly payments after January 2005; that the default made the [Cjontract unenforceable and void; that [ ] Long no longer had any legal or equitable interest in the [Pjroperty; and that the Elphages were now the fee simple owners of the [Pjroperty, free and clear of the [Cjontract. The court declined to award the Elphages any compensatory damages [or attorneys\u2019 feesj.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><em>Long I, </em>slip op. at 2-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Both Long and the Elphages appealed the judgment of the circuit court to this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Long challenged that portion of the circuit court\u2019s ruling divesting him of any rights in the Property. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The Elphages cross-appealed on the subject of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1. In an opinion issued October 12, 2006, we vacated and remanded the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 13. In doing so, we held that the Elphages could not legally repossess the Property through a declaratory judgment action. <em>Id. </em>at 11. We explained that Maryland law viewed a land installment contract as a form of a lien instrument whereby the seller in retaining legal title to the subject property maintained a \u201csecurity interest\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>property to ensure the enforcement of the contract obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Upon entering into the land installment contract, however, equitable title immediately passed to the buyer, in this case Long. <em>Id. </em>at 9,12. We then explained that the Maryland Rules stipulated that the only means of enforcing a land installment contract was through foreclosure proceedings, emphasizing that \u201c[plainly, a seller who seeks to repossess from the purchaser [of] property sold under a land installment contract only may do so by a foreclosure action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. We further noted: \u201c[T]he purpose of this procedure is to provide a mechanism whereby a purchaser would not lose the equity and interest he had built in his home in the event of a default.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (internal citation, quotation and alteration omitted) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Accordingly, we concluded that to \u201cobtain any interest greater than a security interest\u201d under the Contract, the Elphages were required to institute foreclosure proceedings against Long. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Therefore we vacated that portion of circuit court\u2019s ruling declaring the Contract void and that Long no longer had \u201cany legal or equitable interest\u201d in the Property, and declaring that the Elphages were the sole owners of the Property. <em>Id. </em>at 13. We also observed that, \u201c[a]s our decision with respect to [ ] Long\u2019s appeal has rendered the Elphages\u2019 cross-appeal moot, we need not address it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Thus, we remanded the case to the circuit court for \u201can entry of a revised declaratory decree\u201d consistent with our opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APK\">\n<em>Foreclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In the meantime, on May 1, 2006, the Bank of America, holder of the Deed of Trust note, instituted foreclosure pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ceedings on the Property. Following a foreclosure sale of the Property, after the bank had been paid in full, there were surplus proceeds totaling $233,195.93. As the equitable owner of the Property, Long filed a Petition for Surplus Proceeds from the Property, which the auditor granted. The Elphages subsequently filed an Application for Payment of Surplus Proceeds and Objections to Ratification of Auditor\u2019s Report and Objection to Petition for Payment of Surplus Proceeds by [ ] Long, claiming that they should be awarded $114,969.87 to satisfy the outstanding balance that Long still owed them on the Contract. Long filed a reply, claiming that the Elphages were seeking a double recovery on the Contract, as the debt owed on the Contract had been satisfied by the proceeds of the foreclosure sale. Long also filed a motion seeking \u201cdamages and attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d resulting from \u201cthe Elphages\u2019 improper conduct in evicting Long from [the Property] in August 2005 through self-help means and waste.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">A hearing was held on April 5, 2007. At the hearing, the Elphages argued that the references to the Deed of Trust in the Contract merely functioned as notice of the debt\u2019s existence. They asserted that because Long \u201c[k]nowingly and voluntarily assumed the risk of non-payment when he entered into the land installment contract,\u201d he was estopped from claiming the Contract as a defense to the Elphages\u2019 debt claim. Finally, the Elphages claimed that Long\u2019s failure to make monthly payments under the Contract was the actual cause of the foreclosure proceedings in the instant case as the Elphages could not afford the payments on the Deed of Trust. Thus, the Elphages concluded, because Long had \u201cunclean hands\u201d he was not entitled to surplus proceeds because his actions had caused the foreclosure action in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Long countered that \u201cthrough his equity in the [Property through this foreclosure process, [he] has in fact paid off the Elphages[\u2019] [D]eed of [T]rust,\u201d and that he was entitled to set-off and subrogation. Long also asserted a damages claim for ejectment. Long abandoned the claim, however, upon questioning from the court as to how he intended to prove damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>At the close of argument, the circuit court granted the Elphages\u2019 motion, awarding them $114,969.87 from the foreclosure proceeds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At that hearing, the Elphages also moved for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to a provision in the Contract allowing for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d accrued in the enforcement of the Contract. The court indicated that it would entertain that motion at a later date and gave the Elphages leave to submit their request in writing along with any supporting materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">On April 24, 2007, the Elphages filed a Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees with the court. In support of their motion, the Elphages submitted an affidavit from Roy I. Niedermayer, counsel to the Elphages, as well as hourly billing records and a list of expenses. A hearing was held on the attorneys\u2019 fees motion on July 11, 2007. At the hearing, the Elphages submitted a list of \u201cProfessional Services\u201d listing the type of services their lawyers had provided, the lawyer performing the service, the date the services was provided, as well as the time spent. The Elphages also submitted a list of expenses they accrued from 2005 through 2007. Additionally, Roy Niedermayer, the Elphages\u2019 lead counsel, testified as to the work involved in the Elphages\u2019 case, as well as the reasonableness of the fees assessed, as detailed in the Elphages\u2019 exhibits. In total the Elphages requested $37,497.98 for attorneys\u2019 fees<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that they had accumulated in various proceedings against Long to enforce the Contract since 2005. At the end of the hearing, the circuit court awarded them precisely that amount. An order was issued reflecting the court\u2019s ruling on August 20, 2007. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Further facts and details of the proceedings will be described throughout this opinion as may be necessary for our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Did the circuit court err in awarding the Elphages $114,969.87 of the foreclosure surplus proceeds?</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Long asserts that the circuit court erred in awarding $114,969.87 of the foreclosure proceeds to the Elphages because its ruling is based on the incorrect premise that the Contract created a separate debt owed by Long to the Elphages distinct from that the Elphages owed to the bank on the Deed of Trust.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Long argues that the court\u2019s interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tion of the Contract as establishing two separate and distinct debts is contrary to the \u201cexpress written terms of the [Contract.\u201d Specifically, Long points to paragraph four of the Contract, which stipulates that Long \u201cwould comply with, assume, perform, and owe the Elphages the duties and obligations, including payment obligations as set forth in certain paragraph of the deed of trust.\u201d He also notes that at trial, Mrs. Elphage testified that the Longs \u201cassumed responsibility for the monthly mortgage and escrow payments ... [which] were to be made to the Elphages.\u201d Finally, Long claims that to make it clear that the debt under the Contract and the Deed of Trust were the same, the Contract \u201cgave the Elphages the right, upon default by [Long] ... to accelerate all remaining payments and require [Long] to iediately [sic] pay the full amount of the remaining balance of the principal and interest under the deed of trust note.\u201d Thus Long concludes, because \u201cLong assumed the Elphages\u2019 payment of the Deed of Trust loan, [ ] Long fulfilled his obligations under the [Contract when the debt secured by the foreclosed Deed of Trust was paid from the foreclosure proceeds in the present case.\u201d Therefore the Elphages have no right under the Contract to the foreclosure proceeds at issue in the instant case. Although we reach the conclusion that the circuit court erred in its award to the Elphages, we arrive at that result by a different path than the one suggested by Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Our interpretation of a written contract on review is <em>de novo. State v. Philip Morris Inc., </em>179 Md.App. 140, 152, 944 A.2d 1167 (2008). \u201cAs a fundamental principle of contract construction, we seek to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the contracting parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We primarily look to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u201clanguage of the contract itself\u2019 to determine the intent of the parties. <em>Bennett v. Wright, </em>167 Md.App. 291, 295, 892 A.2d 1164 (2006). Finally, when \u201cascertaining the true meaning of a contract, the contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\u201d <em>State v. Philip Moms, </em>179 Md.App. at 152-53, 944 A.2d 1167 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">To understand the nature of the subject transaction it is worthwhile to discuss the evolution of land installment contracts and their place among available real estate financing methods. Historically, land installment contracts were a land financing arrangement that resembled a leasing arrangement. <em>Spruell v. Blythe, </em>215 Md. 117, 121, 137 A.2d 183 (1957). Generally entered into to circumvent government imposed rent control standards governing residential leases, land installment contracts required a minimal down payment and outlined a payment scheme of \u201csubstantial weekly or monthly payments\u201d towards the purchase price of the property. <em>Id. </em>The buyer would take possession of the dwelling and at the end of an agreed period of time, if all the payments had been made, the seller would convey title to the buyer. <em>Id. </em>Although the buyer would make payments on the contract, his payments did not count towards equity in the property. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, if the buyer did not fulfill the conditions of the land installment contract, the seller retained the right to eject the buyer and repossess the property. <em>Sidhu v. Shigo, </em>61 Md.App. 61, 68, 484 A.2d 1033 (1984). This process resulted in the ejected buyer being left without any equity, despite having made substantial payments toward the purchase of the property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The General Assembly sought to remedy such harsh results by enacting the Land Installment Contract Act of 1951 (codified as Md.Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Real Property Article (\u201cR.P.\u201d)). <em>Hudson v. Maryland State Housing Co., </em>207 Md. 320, 114 A.2d 421 (1955); <em>Russ v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>Barnes, </em>28 Md.App. 691, 329 A.2d 767 (1974). The Land Installment Contract Act (\u201cAct\u201d) recast the contractual relationship between buyer/purchaser and seller/vendor to be akin to a seller-financed sale. <em>See, e.g., R.P., </em>\u00a7 10-101(b)(l) (defining a land installment contract as a financing arrangement where the \u201cvendor agrees to sell an interest in property to the purchaser and the purchaser agrees to pay the purchase price in five or more subsequent payments exclusive of the down payment, if any[.]\u201d); R.P. \u00a7 10-101(b)(2) (stipulating that in a land installment contract the seller/vendor only \u201cretains title as security for the purchaser\u2019s obligation.\u201d); R.P. 10-103(d) (\u201cNo vendor may place or hold any mortgage on any property sold under a land installment contract in any amount greater than the balance due under the contract, nor may any mortgage require payments in excess of the periodic payments required under the contract.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In a traditional seller-financed transaction, the seller conveys the property and takes back a mortgage or deed of trust securing a promissory note for the credit extended to the buyer. David A. Thompson, 4 Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 100.02 If the buyer defaults on the loan, the seller can foreclose on the deed of trust. <em>See id. </em>(comparing traditional land installment contract to mortgage and noting that unlike mortgagees, a seller in a land installment contract financing arrangement is not bound by rules governing foreclosure upon default) If there is any equity in the property remaining after the lender is paid, the buyer is entitled to its benefit. <em>See id. </em>(comparing land installment contract and mortgages and noting that \u201c[t]he buyer, unlike the mortgagee, cannot force the sale of the property and have the proceeds applied to the debt and the excess refunded.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Similarly, under the Act, the seller in a land installment contract holds bare legal title to the property solely as a lien to secure the balance of the contract payments. R.P. \u00a7 10-101(b)(2). As we observed in <em>Long I, </em>Maryland law considers a land installment contract a form of a lien instrument. <em>Long I, </em>slip. op. at 10 (citing Md.

The buyer takes the seller\u2019s place in the underlying obligation and the lender then looks primarily to the buyer for satisfaction of the debt. <em>Wright v. Wagner, </em>182 Md. 483, 489, 34 A.2d 441 (1943).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That is not what the parties provided in the Contract before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Although the Contract states that the buyer will \u201cassume\u201d the seller\u2019s duties under the deed of trust, the lender was not a party to the transaction. Instead, the Contract provided that the installments to be paid by Long to the Elphages would be identical to installments that the Elphages were required to pay under the mortgage debt to their lender.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">As we noted in <em>Long II, </em>there were \u201ctwo distinct debts, albeit in precisely the same amount, owed to two distinct creditors and secured by two distinct instruments, one a deed of trust and the other a land installment contract.\u201d Nevertheless, the express language of the Contract, including, by incorporation, most of the -substantive portions of the Deed of Trust, make it clear that the parties intended the payments from Long to be passed through the Elphages to their lender. The only consideration intended to flow to the Elphages under the Contract consisted of the $40,000 down payment, via transfer of a parcel of property owned by the Longs and the ultimate retirement of the Elphages\u2019 loan with Bank of America. Although the Contract recited the existence of the Deed of Trust, the Contract did not require Long to pay the contract price <em>plus </em>the balance of the deed of trust loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The land installment Contract created a lien against the Property to secure the unpaid portion of the sales price, which was equal to the balance owed by the Elphages to their lender. By analogy to a seller-financed transaction, the credit extended by the Elphages to Long would consist of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>portion of the deed of trust obligation that the Elphages were to pay each month. <em>See 4 Thompson on Real Property </em>\u00a7 100.02 (David A. Thomas ed., 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">After Long defaulted under the Contract, the Elphages made a number of payments to their lender for which they did not receive an equivalent amount from Long. Specifically, as we noted in <em>Long I, </em>Mrs. Elphage testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">[B]y the time of trial, payments under the [Contract were six months in arrears (February through July 2005). As a consequence, Mrs. Elphage had to withdraw money from her IRA account and borrow money from her sister-in-law in order to make the monthly payments on the Property. In total, she and Mr. Elphage had to pay $8,895 to avoid foreclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Long I, </em>slip. op. at 7. To that extent, the Elphages disbursed monies against the credit that they had extended to Long. However, the Elphages did not pay off the entire balance of the deed of trust loan. In fact, the entire unpaid balance as well as all of the fees, costs and commissions associated with the foreclosure were satisfied out of the equity owned by Long in the Property. The only deficit experienced by the Elphages as a result of Long\u2019s default is the difference between what they paid their lender and what Long paid them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The trial court\u2019s award of $114,969.87 to the Elphages has the effect of paying them the entire contract price even though Long satisfied their debt to Bank of America from the equity in his Property. The Contract did not contemplate such a windfall. As stated above, the Contract provided that the Elphages would receive nothing more than the $40,000 down payment and retirement of their Deed of Trust debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Therefore, the Elphages are, at most, entitled to the amount that they paid to the lender as a result of Long\u2019s default plus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in enforcing the Contract, as provided by paragraph three of the Contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly we shall vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand for the court to determine the payments made by the Elphages that were not reimbursed by Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Did the circuit court err in failing to consider Long\u2019s claims of breach of contract, conversion, trespass, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Long argues that the circuit court erred at the April 5, 2007 hearing when it failed to allow Long to prove claims for breach of contract, conversion, trespass, punitive damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. Upon review of the record, however, we conclude that Long has not preserved that issue for appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">At the April 5, 2007 hearing before the circuit court, Long raised claims for damages resulting from what he contended was an improper \u201cself-help eviction\u201d by the Elphages. Specifically, Long\u2019s counsel stated to the court: \u201cSo we\u2019re also claiming damages that we\u2019d like to seek against the Elphages. Between the fair market value and the liquidation price as well as the damages that result of the self-help eviction.\u201d The following relevant colloquy between Long\u2019s counsel and the court then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">THE COURT: How are you proving that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">[COUNSEL FOR LONG]: I\u2019m sorry, how am I proving? THE COURT: The damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">[COUNSEL FOR LONG]: The damages we can \u2014 well, we would be proving the fair market value because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">THE COURT: How [are] you, how [are] you proving that? [COUNSEL FOR LONG]: The, the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">THE COURT: How are you proving that? Today, we\u2019re dealing with the surplus and you\u2019re telling me you[ ] \u2014 have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>a claim and you want me to adjudicate that claim for damages as to the self-help eviction and the (indiscernible) the loss of value for some period of time, but how are you, how are you going to prove that today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">THE COURT: If you don\u2019t have damages to prove, there\u2019s no need to argue that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">[COUNSEL FOR LONG]: No, Your Honor. The only thing that we\u2019re seeking then, is, is that the Elphages are not entitled to their claim because of the right of set-off and subrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Because Long conceded at the April 5, 2007 hearing that all he was arguing for was Long\u2019s entitlement to all of the surplus proceeds, any other claims were abandoned. See Md. Rule 8-131(a); <em>Montgomery County Council v. Leizman, </em>268 Md. 621, 631, 303 A.2d 374 (1973) (\u201cWe shall not undertake a review of this aspect of the case because the appellees have not discussed it in their brief and at argument counsel stated unequivocally that it had been abandoned.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in denying Long\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Did the circuit court abuse its discretion in granting the Elphages attorneys\u2019 fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">At the hearing below, after the circuit court awarded them $114,969.87 from the foreclosure proceeds, the Elphages moved for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to Paragraph three of the Contract allowing for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d accrued in the enforcement of the Contract. The Elphages requested attorneys\u2019 fees for two periods of time: \u201cJanuary 2003 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>October 2005,\u201d for the declaratory judgment and breach of contract action and \u201cJanuary 2007 through the present,\u201d for the foreclosure surplus proceedings. At a hearing held on July 11, 2007, the circuit court granted the motion, awarding the Elphages $37,497.98 for attorneys\u2019 fees that they had incurred in various proceedings to enforce the Contract since 2005. In awarding the Elphages attorneys\u2019 fees, the circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">I see no reasonable, legal, or equitable reason why the [c]ourt should not award the attorneys\u2019 fees as requested. I\u2019ve heard arguments, I\u2019ve taken the arguments into consideration. I believe the $37,497.98 is fair and reasonable based upon the testimony I\u2019ve heard and based upon what has gone on in this case. And I\u2019ve read the Court of Special Appeals decision, and it \u2014 apparently the amount of work that was put into this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">And I know the question was continuing to be asked as to whether or not the fees were reasonable in light of a basic foreclosure case, but there has not been anything based [sic] ... case involving the parties in this case or in these proceedings. This is not a regular run-of-the-mill breach of contract declaratory judgment, nor foreclosure case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">[T]he [c]ourt will in fact award to the Elphages the amount of $37,497.98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Long argues that the circuit court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees for 2003 through 2007 was an abuse of discretion because it was based on insufficient evidence, as the attorney time sheets submitted into evidence did not include time records from \u201cJanuary 2003 to January 2006.\u201d Furthermore, Long asserts, the award of attorneys\u2019 fees for Elphages\u2019 declaratory judgment action was not reasonable because the Elphages were unsuccessful in their claim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>In reply, the Elphages contend that the trial court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees was based on \u201ccompetent and material evidence in the form of a Statement of Services, an affidavit from [Niedermayer] ... and testimony by [Niedermayer] at the hearing.\u201d Accordingly, the Elphages conclude, the circuit court\u2019s award was reasonable. We disagree for the following reasons.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u201c[A]s a general rule the question of attorneys\u2019 fees is a factual matter which lies within the \u2018sound discretion of the trial judge\u2019 and will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Develop. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>100 Md.App. 441, 452, 641 A.2d 977 (1994) (internal quotation omitted). Maryland follows the American rule of attorneys\u2019 fees, which \u201cstands as a barrier to the recovery, as consequential damages, of foreseeable counsel fees incurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>enforcing remedies for\u2019 breach of contract.\u201d <em>B &amp; P Enter. v. Overland Equip. Co., </em>133 Md.App. 583, 620-21, 758 A.2d 1026 (2000) (internal quotation omitted). When attorneys\u2019 fees are based on a contractual right, the paying party is entitled to have the amount of fees and expenses proven by competent evidence and with the certainty ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages. <em>Maxima, </em>100 Md.App. at 452-53, 641 A.2d 977. The burden of proof lies upon the party seeking fees. <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 641 A.2d 977. The sufficiency of the evidence presented as to attorneys\u2019 fees must be more than simply the number of hours worked, but less than a line by line analysis of services rendered. In <em>Maxima, </em>100 Md.App. at 453-54, 641 A.2d 977, we articulated, in relevant part, \u201cthe detail required and the quantum of information that the prevailing party must provide\u201d to meet his or her burden:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">A fee is not justified by a mere compilation of hours multiplied by fixed hourly rates or bills issued to the client; [ ] <em>a request for fees must specify the services performed, by whom they were performed, the time expended thereon, and the hourly rates charged; </em>[ ] it is incumbent upon the party seeking recovery to present detailed records that contain the relevant facts and computations undergirding the computation of charges; [] without such records, the reasonableness, <em>vel non, </em>of the fees can be determined only by conjecture or opinion of the attorney seeking the fees and would therefore not be supported by competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Once presented with these facts, however, the trial court still must evaluate the reasonableness of the fee request. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 641 A.2d 977. In <em>Maxima, </em>we also explained that the trial court\u2019s analysis must take into consideration the criteria set forth in Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">100 Md.App. at 454-55, 641 A.2d 977 (quoting Md. Rule 1.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">As an initial matter,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we conclude that the Elphages failed to meet their burden of production as to \u201cthe services performed, by whom they were performed, the time expended thereon, and the hourly rates charged\u201d <em>Maxima, </em>100 Md.App. at 453-54, 641 A.2d 977, for attorneys\u2019 fees for January 2003 through December 2004. In their motion and at trial, the Elphages offered into evidence three exhibits detailing the amount of time counsel had spent on enforcing the contract: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(1) Affidavit of Roy I. Niedermayer in Support of Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees; (2) hourly log of \u201cProfessional Services\u201d from January 6, 2005 through April 5, 2007, listing the service performed, the attorney performing the service, the time spent, and the date the service occurred; and (3) summary chart of Professional Services for both of those time periods. Additionally, Niedermayer testified at trial as to the expenses incurred in enforcing the contract and the court heard testimony of an expert \u201cin the field of law and legal rates and services provided in the Maryland suburban area.\u201d Regarding the time spent on enforcing the contract from January 2003 through December 2004, Niedermayer\u2019s affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">\u25a0 From January 2003 through December 2004, while I was a sole practitioner, I expended a total of 20.2 hours of legal time performing legal services for the Elphages to enforce the terms of the ... [cjontract entered into between them and Arthur Long. Such legal services were necessary to represent the Elphages and litigate this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">From January 2003 through October 2005, my associate, Katharine O. Porwick and I expended a total of 126.9 hours of legal time performing legal services for the Elphages to enforce the terms of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Similarly, the summary sheet offered in evidence by the Elphages merely stated that Niedermayer and Porwick spent 126.9 hours enforcing the Contract \u201cFrom January 2003 through October 2005\u201d and listed their hourly rates of $275.00 per hour (Niedermayer) and $180.00 per hour (Porwick). At trial Niedermayer reiterated the contents of his affidavit, testifying that he had expended \u201capproximately 20\u201d hours on the Elphages\u2019 case as a solo practitioner. We do not agree with the Elphages\u2019 contention that this evidence met their burden of production.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Our opinion in <em>B &amp; P Enterprises </em>is instructive. There, the appellee, a commercial lessee brought suit against the appellant, a lessor, alleging breaches of lease in connection with relocation of vehicle storage lot. 133 Md.App. at 599, 758 A.2d 1026. The circuit court found in favor of the appellee, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to a provision in the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 758 A.2d 1026. Before the circuit court, the appellee \u201coffered a bill for services of trial counsel\u201d which \u201csimply listed the attorneys\u2019 total number of hours.\u201d The appellee did not offer proof as to the type of services rendered or to the necessity of those services in the litigation. Id. Upon review of the record before the trial court, we vacated and remanded the court\u2019s decision because the appellee \u201cfailed to present sufficient evidence to satisfy the factors articulated in <em>Maxima </em>or those derived from the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 758 A.2d 1026. We reasoned that a mere \u201ccompilation of hours multiplied by fixed hourly rates\u201d would not satisfy the burden of production articulated in <em>Maxima. Id. </em>at 630, 758 A.2d 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The same shortcoming exists in the evidence of billings from January 2003 through December 2004 in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Like the appellee in <em>B &amp; P Enterprises, </em>the Elphages merely presented a \u201ccompilation of hours multiplied by fixed hourly rates,\u201d <em>see id., </em>noting that Niedermayer had spent approximately 20 hours on their case during that time. <em>See id. </em>This was clearly \u201cin contravention of the principles espoused in <em>Maxima </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly we conclude that the Elphages did not meet their burden of production on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees accrued from January 2003 to December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Next, we note that in analyzing the evidence before it, the trial court did not apply the reasonableness factors articulated in Rule 1.5 that we espoused in <em>Maxima. </em>In reaching its conclusion, the trial court focused only on \u201cthe amount of work that was put into this case\u201d as detailed in the testimony, as well as the Elphages\u2019 billing records and our opinion in <em>Long I. </em>Among the factors set out in Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 that the trial court failed to consider were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">(1) the time and labor <em>required, </em>the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill <em>requisite </em>to perform the legal services properly; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">(4) the amount involved and the <em>results </em>obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>(Emphasis added) See <em>Maxima </em>100 Md.App. at 454-55, 641 A.2d 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Appellees sought to enforce their contractual rights by pursuing a declaratory judgement action, a method that was wholly ineffective to accomplish their primary goal. As we described in <em>Long I, </em>the only available process to enforce a land installment contract is through a foreclosure, which appellees never pursued. The only portion of the declaratory judgment action that reached a substantive conclusion was decided in favor of Long.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In addition, the two prior appeals to this Court were decided unfavorably to the Elphages. The trial court should have taken into consideration that a significant portion of the Elphages\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees were accumulated in connection with this unsuccessful litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Accordingly, we shall vacate the trial court\u2019s award as to attorneys\u2019 fees and remand for that court to apply the appropriate standards and determine what, if any, attorney\u2019s fees the Elphages may be entitled to recover.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY VACATED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">APPELLEES TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-14\">.

The portions of our opinion in <em>Long I </em>that determine the ownership interests in the Property and the validity of the declaratory judgment action constitute our decisions on \"questions of law\u201d that are binding in future proceedings. <em>Id. </em>However, our recounting of the facts and proceedings before the lower court described in the factual history section of our opinion does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>not constitute our holding, but merely recites the facts for the parties' understanding.

As the Court of Appeals has recently reiterated, \u201cit is clear that, in Maryland, dicta not adopted as a final determination may not serve as the binding law of the case.\u201d <em>Garner v. Archers Glen Partners, Inc., </em>405 Md. 43, 57, 949 A.2d 639 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">Appellant also mentions <em>res judicata </em>and <em>collateral estoppel </em>in passing but did not argue the application of those doctrines to the instant case. Accordingly, we will not address those matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\">.

Under a land installment contract, the buyer needs only to satisfy the seller that he is creditworthy. See R.P. \u00a7 10-101 (noting that parties to a land installment contract are the buyer of the property and the seller of the property). In the instant case, the buyer was obligated to pay the same installments that the sellers were required to pay their lender, at the interest rate established by the deed of trust note three years earlier.

As we explain <em>infra, </em>pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Contract, allowing for, upon default, \u201c[plurchaser to pay ... all costs and expenses incurred by Seller in enforcing this contract ... including reasonable attorneys' fees\u201d the Elphages may also be entitled to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b44-14\">.

By finding that Long did not preserve the issue for appeal, we intimate no opinion as to whether he would be precluded from litigating these claims in a proper forum. Although the question is not before us, it may be questionable whether the <em>in personam </em>claims alleged by appellant in the circuit court can be litigated in an <em>in rem </em>action for distribution of foreclosure proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\">. Long concedes that the Elphages would be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with the foreclosure action if the trial court's order in that matter is affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">. Long also contends that the Elphages are precluded from raising the issue of attorneys' fees for litigation expenses from January 2003 to October 2005 because these fees related to litigation expenses incurred in the declaratory judgment action. Stressing that the circuit court refused to impose attorneys\u2019 fees in that action, Long contends that the court's decision is a final judgment for purposes of <em>res judicata. </em>That contention is legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>bars the \u201csame parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim, or any other claim arising from the same transaction or series of transactions and that could have been-but was not-raised in the first suit.\u201d <em>Lizzi v. Wash. Met. Area Transit Auth., </em>384 Md. 199, 206, 862 A.2d 1017 (2004) (internal quotations and alteration omitted). Accordingly, if a judicial body has issued a final judgment on the merits of a claim, <em>res judicata </em>prevents a subsequent tribunal from deciding that issue or any other issue that could have been raised in the prior proceeding. <em>North American Specialty Insurance Company v. Boston Medical Group, </em>170 Md.App. 128, 137, 906 A.2d 1042 (2006). If, however, on appeal, the appeal based on the circuit court\u2019s judgment is dismissed as moot, the decision of the circuit court no longer has preclusive effect. <em>Campbell v. Lake Hallowell Homeowners Ass\u2019n., </em>157 Md.App. 504, 526, 852 A.2d 1029 (2004). That is precisely what occurred in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Long I, </em>we declined to address the Elphages\u2019 cross-appeal on attorneys\u2019 fees because our decision to vacate the trial court\u2019s declaratory judgment \"rendered the Elphages' cross-appeal moot.\u201d <em>Long I, </em>slip. op. at 13. Accordingly, because the 2005 order of the circuit court with respect to attorneys' fees was not a final judgment, the Elphages were not barred by <em>res judicata </em>from requesting attorneys\u2019 fees for litigation expenses incurred in that action in the foreclosure proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b49-13\">. In their motion, the Elphages asked for attorneys\u2019 fees for two time periods: \u201cJanuary 2003 through October 2005,\u201d for the declaratory judgment and breach of contract action and \u201cJanuary 2007 through the present,\u201d for the foreclosure surplus proceedings. In their original motion filed in April 2007, the Elphages' log of Professional Services included hours spent in connection with the supersedeas bond and discussing settlement which took place in March 2006. The log of Professional Services they submitted at trial however, did not include that time. Also, the list of expenses submitted included expenses incurred in 2006. However, the Elphages did not request fees for that time period. At the hearing Niedermayer testified that the hours and expenses the Elphages submitted \"from the date of January 2003 through October 2005 represents the period from the initial suit through the conclusion of the appeal.\u201d The appeal, however, was concluded in October 2006, when we issued <em>Long I. </em>It is not clear whether the discrepancies are \"slips of the tongue\u201d or substantive inconsistencies. As we are remanding the issue of attorneys' fees to the circuit court, it is not necessary for us to resolve this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\">.
