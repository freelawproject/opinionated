Burnett was killed, but Hardy survived. Following a trial in April of 2006, a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted Rodney Edward Brown, appellant, of first-degree and second-degree assault on Hardy. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2002, 2007 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-202 &amp; 3-203 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). In addition, the jury convicted appellant of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, <em>see </em>C.L. \u00a7 4-204, as well as wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 4-203. However, Brown was acquitted of the murder of Burnett and the attempted murder of Hardy. The court sentenced appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 45 years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">On appeal, Brown poses three questions, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">I. Was the evidence sufficient to prove that the weapon used in the shooting of Mr. Hardy was a \u201chandgun,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 4-201 of the Criminal Law Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">II. Was the evidence sufficient to prove that Mr. Hardy suffered serious physical injury, as that term is defined in \u00a7 3-201 of the Criminal Law Article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">III. Was the evidence sufficient to support the Appellant\u2019s conviction given the controverted and recanted identification testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the handgun convictions and affirm the assault convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On the night of June 18, 2005, Tory Burnett was killed in a hail of gunfire. His friend, Jermaine Hardy, was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Dr. Karin Sands, a fellow in forensic pathology with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, testified that Burnett was shot three times, one of which \u201cinjured abdominal organs like the pancreas and the intestines as well as blood vessels in the pelvis.\u201d She explained that only one bullet was recovered from the victim\u2019s body; it was found in the abdomen. Burnett\u2019s other two injuries \u2014 to the knee and to the forearm\u2014 were \u201cthrough and through,\u201d meaning that the bullets \u201cexited\u201d the body. Dr. Sands opined that Burnett died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds, and the manner of death was homicide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Hardy testified that, as he and Burnett were sitting in the kitchen of Burnett\u2019s home on the evening of June 18, 2005, the back door \u201ccame flying open\u201d and \u201ca dark skinned guy he was like the first one, he came in or whatever and he said you all know what it is, and I turn[ed] to run____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hardy recalled that \u201c[s]ome shots started ringing off ... maybe two or more,\u201d an d he retreated to the basement of the house, where he had previously seen a gun. Hardy stated: \u201cI ran down there. At first I was going to hide and then I remembered there was a gun in the basement so I looked for it and I found the gun under the cushion and just waited right there by the side of the steps.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>According to Hardy, one of the assailants pursued him into the basement. Hardy said: \u201cAs he started coming down the steps I started shooting.\u201d Hardy claimed that he fired \u201c[pjrobably about four or five [shots], something like that\u201d at his assailant. But, when asked whether he actually shot the intruder during the altercation, Hardy responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t really say.\u201d Hardy indicated that the assailant did not continue down the stairs; \u201c[t]hey shot back [at Hardy] a couple of times and they ran back up.\u201d Hardy never saw the face of his assailant, explaining that he saw \u201ctjjust his legs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">After the intruder ascended the stairs, Hardy said he heard a voice say \u201ccome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d Hardy returned upstairs and saw the back of a \u201ctall, slim\u201d man leaving through the rear door. He also found Burnett lying mortally wounded on the dining room floor. Hardy secured the back door and then exited from the front door to retrieve the truck he was using. While he attempted to help Burnett into the truck, Burnett collapsed. As Hardy attempted to give Burnett mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, he heard noises at the back door. Hardy recalled: \u201c[W]hen I heard that noise I just \u2014 my instinct was to run. So I took and ran towards the front door and some more gunshots rang off and I heard some glass break over top of my head.\u201d Hardy ran a few blocks to North Avenue, where he flagged down a hack and had the driver drop him off at a vacant house in the Waverly neighborhood, where he had previously lived; he stayed there until dawn. Hardy did not testify as to whether he was injured during the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Through his attorney, Hardy contacted the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office four days after the incident. Hardy testified that he had been afraid to come forward for fear that he might be criminally charged for his own use of a firearm and his flight from the scene. Accompanied by his attorney, Hardy met with police and gave an oral statement, which was not recorded. Nor did he sign a statement. Several days later, on June 29, 2005, Hardy met with Baltimore City Police Detective Robert Dohony, without counsel. The meeting began with an unrecorded \u201cpre-interview,\u201d which was followed by a tape-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>recorded interview. During the \u201cpre-interview,\u201d Dohony showed Hardy a photographic array consisting of six photographs, including one of appellant. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now during this meeting you discussed the shooting with the detective, didn\u2019t you? [HARDY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And you were telling him what you saw, what occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">[HARDY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay, and he showed you a photo array, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">[HARDY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did he ask you any questions regarding that photo array?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">[HARDY]: Yeah, he just asked me if any of them looked familiar to me or whatever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did there come a time that the detective asked you to pick someone out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">[HARDY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And how did he go about doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-15\">[HARDY]: Okay, while I was there he asked me if anybody \u2014 did any of them look familiar. I told him no except for this one guy that was my friend.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> So it was a couple of moments of silence and he said what about this guy right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>here. He said not even this guy right here. He said with the description you gave me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Which one was he pointing to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiK\">[HARDY]: To what\u2019s his name Rodney, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And that\u2019s a picture of Mr. Brown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">[HARDY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And show us how he was telling that, what was he doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">[HARDY]: He was sitting beside me and I was looking at the pictures just like this. I told him I recognized the one guy. I said yeah none of these don\u2019t look like they could be the guy. So he said what about this guy right here. He said you sure because he\u2019s been shot. Then that\u2019s how I found out that Rodney got shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you ever see Rodney before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Hear his name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-13\">[HARDY]: No.... I never saw him before in my life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Hardy testified that he then \u201crode with it. I said he do look kind of familiar with the description that I gave you. [The detective] told me it was a DNA case so I knew this guy wasn\u2019t going to get convicted.\u201d Hardy testified that he signed his name above the photograph of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">According to Hardy, during the taped interview that followed, the police asked him \u201cif they pointed out anybody in the lineup.\u201d He explained: <em>\u201cI </em>said no because I wasn\u2019t going to sit there in their house and tell the Homicide detectives that yes you made me point him out right in their face. I was scared to do that.\u201d Over defense objection, the signed photo array was admitted into evidence .<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>At trial, however, Hardy repudiated his pre-trial identification of appellant. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: [D]id there come a time you spoke to a member of my office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">[HARDY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Why did you make that call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATY\">[HARDY]: Because I knew that [appellant] didn\u2019t do it so I wanted to let you know \u2014 I wanted to try to get in touch with his attorneys or whoever was representing him to let them know that I\u2019m ready to come forward and let them know that he didn\u2019t do it, that he didn\u2019t do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did anyone from my office come to you first to tell you to call us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: You did that all by yourself? [HARDY]: Did that by myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, in the taped interview that you gave to the detective ... do you recall using the words it looks like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">[HARDY]: Yeah, I could have used it, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you remember using words most likely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">[HARDY]: I don\u2019t remember using most likely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you ever, ever say that\u2019s him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s the man who shot me? [HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s the man who killed my friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Here today standing here looking at that man, is that the man you saw\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u2014 in the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-19\">[HARDY]: That\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-20\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is that the man who shot your friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-21\">[HARDY]: That\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-22\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is that the man who shot you? [HARDY]: That\u2019s not him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-23\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Has anyone threatened you to say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-24\">[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-25\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Has anyone contacted you to say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>[HARDY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Has anyone paid you to say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">[HARDY]: No, I wish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Detective Dohony acknowledged that Hardy\u2019s photo line-up identification had been made prior to the taped interview. He testified that the purpose of conducting an unrecorded \u201cpreinterview\u201d is to \u201cmake sure that [interview subjects] know what\u2019s happening, that they\u2019re comfortable in the office, make sure that we\u2019re both on the same page, that the facts are straight, and they fully understand why they\u2019re down there. It\u2019s just a general conversation.\u201d According to Dohony, during the pre-interview he showed Hardy the photo array and asked him to identify any photos that depicted the intruders. Detective Dohony claimed that Hardy selected appellant\u2019s photo in six seconds, without prompting. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: In either the first or your second discussion with Mr. Hardy did you ever tell Mr. Hardy to identify anyone as the perpetrator of this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">[DOHONY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever point at one of those six photographs and tell him just pick one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">[DOHONY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">[PROSECUTOR]: Pick that one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">[DOHONY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever offer him some money to pick someone out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-15\">[DOHONY]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: Let\u2019s talk about the actual showing Mr. Hardy of that photographic lineup. Step-by-step how did that occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-17\">[DOHONY]: After, you know, he knows that he\u2019s there to see a photo lineup. I have the photo lineup with me. We\u2019re sitting in an interview room at a table together. There\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>paragraph that I read to him prior to showing him the photo lineup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Read that to the ladies and gentlemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmQ\">[DOHONY]: This group of photographs may or may not contain a picture of the person who committed the crime now being investigated. Keep in mind that hairstyles, beards and mustaches can be easily changed. Also photographs may not always depict the true complexion of a person. The complexion may be lighter or darker than shown in the photo. When you\u2019ve looked at all of the photos tell me whether or not you see the person who committed the crime. Do not tell any other witnesses that you have or have not identified anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: How long does it take for [Hardy] to say anything about what he\u2019s looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">[DOHONY]: He identified on this. In six seconds he identified the picture [of appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right, the picture of \u2014 which picture is this, one through six?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">[DOHONY]: It would be number six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: And is that the picture of the suspect you may have developed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">[DOHONY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Detective Dohony was called to the scene of Burnett\u2019s house at about 12:40 a.m. on June 19, 2005. He found numerous shell casings and live rounds, and saw blood inside and outside of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Dohony testified that Hardy\u2019s truck was recovered at the scene, and the police traced it to the owner, Shaneka Brooks, who is the mother of Hardy\u2019s daughter. Ms. Brooks told Dohony \u201cabout her boyfriend [i.e., Hardy] who contacted her and said that he was also shot during this incident.\u201d Moreover, Dohony testified that Hardy told him that he had been shot in the upper thigh during the incident. Dohony also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>identified a photograph, State\u2019s Exhibit No. 14, as a picture of Hardy\u2019s right leg taken four days after the attack, when Hardy was first interviewed by the police. Over defense objection, Dohony stated that the photograph depicted a bullet wound. Dohony also identified several other crime scene photographs, including two depicting blood in Ms. Brooks\u2019s truck, on the driver\u2019s seat (State\u2019s Exhibit No. 12), and on the inside of the driver\u2019s side door (State\u2019s Exhibit No. 13).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Detective Dohony suspected that one of the assailants might have been injured. Accordingly, he notified other officers to check area hospitals for incoming gunshot victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Officer Maurice Avance testified that on the night of the attack, he responded to the emergency room at the University of Maryland Hospital to interview a person who had presented with a gunshot wound to the foot. The wounded person was identified as appellant. Officer Avance personally observed appellant\u2019s wound, and described it in his notes as a \u201csmall gunshot wound.\u201d Officer Avance had employees of the police crime lab take pictures of appellant\u2019s injuries, which were introduced in evidence. Avance also advised police dispatch that he had a shooting victim at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">According to Officer Avance, appellant identified himself at the hospital as \u201cDonte Brown.\u201d \u201cDonte Brown\u201d told Officer Avance that he had been dropped off at the hospital by his brother, \u201cRodney Brown.\u201d Appellant claimed that from about 10:80 p.m. until 2 a.m. he was with two friends at a bar called Maccio\u2019s. Brown recounted to Avance that, as he was leaving the bar, he witnessed someone being held up at gunpoint, and during this robbery the gunman confronted appellant and shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>him in the foot. Brown, who had only one shoe, told Avance that his missing shoe had been left at the scene of the alleged robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Avance told Brown to remain at the hospital for further questioning. Brown was supposed to undergo an X-ray examination, according to Avance. However, appellant left the hospital when Avance was out of the room, before he had the X-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Detective Daniel Nicholson was assigned to investigate the shooting that was reported by appellant. He testified that the area of the alleged shooting as reported by appellant was canvassed, but no physical evidence was found that indicated that a shooting had taken place. Nor were there any reports of a shooting. The police were also unable to locate appellant\u2019s shoe. Further, he determined that there was no \u201cDonte Brown\u201d who lived at the address given to Officer Avance by appellant. But, he determined that a \u201cRodney Brown\u201d lived at a nearby address.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Appellant was arrested on July 14, 2005, in connection with the shootings of Burnett and Hardy. He gave a tape recorded statement to the police, which was played for the jury, in which he repeated the essentials of the story he had told Avance while at the hospital. He denied any culpability in the attack on Burnett and Hardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">James Wagster, an expert in \u201cfirearms examination,\u201d testified regarding the analysis of the ballistics evidence recovered from the scene. He analyzed the one bullet that was recovered from Burnett\u2019s body, as well as several bullets, bullet fragments, cartridge cases, and live cartridges that were recovered from the scene.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In all, he found \u201cthree different caliber, either cartridges or bullets.... \u201d In particular, Wagster noted that the calibers were 7.62 x 39 cartridge cases, which are \u201cmost common[ly]\u201d used in rifles but also in some handguns; .45 caliber bullets, which are \u201cmostly\u201d used in handguns but can also be used in \u201csome carbines\u201d; and .41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>caliber bullets, which, to his knowledge, are only used in handguns. Wagster described a .44 caliber handgun as \u201ca very large caliber gun\u201d and \u201cone of the more powerful handguns \u2014 \u201d He acknowledged that a .45 is not as \u201cpowerful\u201d as a .44. Nevertheless, a .45 caliber bullet is \u201ca large diameter bullet,\u201d and he agreed that either a .44 or .45 caliber bullet \u201cwould do a lot of damage\u201d if it hit a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Wagster concluded that at least three weapons had been involved. However, because no weapons were recovered, including the weapon used by Hardy, no weapons could be matched to the ballistics evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The State called Rana Santos as an expert in DNA analysis. She stated that appellant could not be identified as the source of any of the thirteen items of DNA evidence recovered from the scene. Santos testified, however, that appellant could not be \u201cexcluded\u201d as a possible contributor to a tissue swab from sunglasses found at the scene, which contained the mixed DNA of at least three unidentified individuals. She also testified that neither the decedent (Burnett) nor appellant could be excluded \u201cas possible contributors to this mixture.\u201d Further, she stated that such an inconclusive test result did not establish that the tissue found on the pair of mirrored sunglasses was Brown\u2019s. Thus, the State did not produce any DNA evidence linking Brown to the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, appellant moved for acquittal on the grounds of insufficiency of evidence. The trial court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Antonio Mitchell, a neighbor of Burnett, was the sole witness for the defense. He testified that he informed police who were canvassing for witnesses that he saw three or four men with slim builds running out of a house on Holbrook Street, but he did not see them carrying weapons. After Mitchell\u2019s memory was refreshed by reading the notes of the police officer who had interviewed him, he testified that one of the men had walked \u201cmaybe ... a little slower____Could have been injured but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>At the close of the defense case, appellant renewed his motion for acquittal. The court again denied the motion. Thereafter, the jury acquitted appellant of all charges relating to Tory Burnett\u2019s murder, and of the attempted murder of Hardy, but convicted him of first-degree and second-degree assault of Hardy, as well as two handgun charges.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AnA\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Appellant asserts three grounds for the reversal of his convictions, all of which are challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. He asserts that the evidence was insufficient to show: (1) that Hardy was attacked with a \u201chandgun\u201d; (2) that Hardy suffered a \u201cserious physical injury\u201d; and (3) that appellant could be identified as the perpetrator of the assault on Hardy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Before addressing these contentions, we pause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>consider the standard of review in a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In reviewing a claim of legal insufficiency, we must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

Wagster analyzed one bullet that was recovered from Burnett\u2019s body and five bullets, a bullet fragment, a lead fragment, six fired cartridge cases, and two live cartridges that were recovered from the scene. He concluded that the ammunition was of three different calibers, and therefore that at least three weapons had been used.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">The bullet recovered from Burnett\u2019s body and one of the cartridge cases recovered from the scene (exact location unspecified) were caliber \u201c.45 AUTO.\u201d Additionally, Wagster\u2019s report, which was introduced in evidence, stated that the bullet recovered from Burnett\u2019s body and the bullet fragment recovered from the basement sink \u201cbear similar rifling class characteristics however no positive identification or elimination could be made due to mutilation of [the bullet fragment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The other five cartridge cases and one of the live cartridges recovered from the scene (exact locations unspecified) were caliber \u201c7.62 x 39mm (M43).\u201d According to the report, the live cartridge had \u201ca firing pin strike on the primer.

Therefore, appellant argues that the ballistics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>evidence could not allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hardy\u2019s assailant used a handgun, rather than a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Appellant cites <em>Beard v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 410, 423 A.2d 275 (1980), and related cases, for the proposition that in order to convict appellant of the two handgun offenses the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the weapon used to shoot Hardy did not fall within the statutory exceptions to the definition of a \u201chandgun.\u201d Claiming that the State failed in its proof, appellant reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">Mr. Wagster testified that the bullets and casings found at the scene [included] 7.62 x 39 caliber bullets, used mainly in rifles.... No expert testimony was introduced as to what, if any, type of bullet allegedly hit Mr. Hardy. No medical record was introduced as to the size of Mr. Hardy\u2019s alleged gunshot wound. Even Mr. Hardy, the only eyewitness of the crime, could not identify or remember what kind of weapon was used to attack him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">Despite the presence of multiple 7.62 x 39 caliber bullets and casings found at the scene, the State failed to introduce any evidence to refute the quite realistic possibility that a rifle was used to shoot at Mr. Hardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The State contends that the issue is not preserved for review. It points out that appellant made no argument in support of his motion for judgment of acquittal that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the weapon used was a \u201chandgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, the defense argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">With regard to the weapons charge. We\u2019ll for the purpose of argument we\u2019ll concede that a handgun was used. <em>We\u2019ll concede that Mr. Burnett, only Mr. Burnett was shot with a handgun. However, we won\u2019t concede that it was Mr. Broum. </em>The reason why is there is no direct evidence linking or no evidence linking Mr. Brown to any weapon. <em>There is no gun. </em>There\u2019s no fingerprints. There\u2019s no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>GSR<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark> and there\u2019s no testimonial evidence that Mr. Brown was there or even the shooter. So the record is completely devoid of evidence with that count. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The following excerpts of the argument of counsel on appellant\u2019s motion for judgment are also relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The circumstantial evidence is not legally sufficient. <em>We have no handguns recovered. </em>We don\u2019t even have the handgun recovered that the victim allegedly shot [appellant] with. That defies imagination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">So there is no evidence as to that, and again, that would be the same thing with the attempted robbery <em>and again with the wear, carry, and transport the same argument. No evidence </em>\u2014 no <em>evidence of recovery of a gun, </em>no evidence that Mr. Brown was the shooter. <em>The record is completely devoid of any evidence with regard to Mr. Broum that would be in there or using a gun. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right, now, finally with the weapons charges counsel has conceded, of course, that a handgun was used. There is no reasonable debate on that. Obviously, counsel stated that it wasn\u2019t his client that used it, but again, based on the light most favorable to the State and all of the evidence from the stand and obviously particularly from Mr. Hardy, that handguns were used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">As indicated, appellant conceded that Burnett was shot by a handgun. However, he expressly denied agency and was, in fact, acquitted on the murder and gun charges in connection with Burnett. But, the issue is whether Hardy was shot with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>a handgun; appellant insists that no evidence linked him to a handgun in connection with the attack on Hardy. In this regard, Brown notes that he never conceded the use of a handgun in regard to the charges involving Hardy. We agree with appellant that he did not waive the contention that the State failed to prove the use of a handgun in the assault on Hardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Even if preserved, the State disputes appellant\u2019s contention, arguing that the evidence established that the weapon used in the shooting of Hardy was a handgun. It asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">[S]ince all three types of ammunition found at the crime scene could be fired from a handgun, there was sufficient evidence before the jury that Brown, found by the jury to be the criminal agent, used a handgun in perpetrating this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">Additionally, Wagster informed the jury that none of the bullets recovered at the scene were interchangable. In other words, a .45 caliber bullet could not be fired from a 7.62 by 39 calibrated weapon. According to Hardy\u2019s testimony, on the evening of the crime, he ran to the basement of the residence and retrieved a .44 or .45 caliber revolver. Hardy waited by the basement steps with the gun he found. Hardy told the jury that his assailant came part way down the basement steps, and he could only see the assailant\u2019s legs. At that moment, Hardy began shooting his weapon at the assailant. His assailant shot back, and then retreated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJP\">The State claims that the evidence was sufficient to show that Hardy\u2019s assailant used a handgun. It asserts, without citation to any authority: \u201c[SJince all three types of ammunition found at the crime scene could be fired from a handgun, there was sufficient evidence before the jury that Brown, found by the jury to be the criminal agent, used a handgun in perpetrating this crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Further, the State observes that Wagster\u2019s report indicates that two \u201clead bullets of approximately .41 caliber\u201d were recovered from the \u201cbasement steps\u201d and \u201cunder the basement steps.\u201d Because Hardy testified that his assailant shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>at him in the basement, and because Hardy also testified that he used a weapon that was a .44 or .45, the State maintains that \u201cthe other gun being discharged in the basement by the assailant was <em>arguably </em>a .41 caliber.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It continues: \u201c[A]ccording to Wagster\u2019s testimony, a .41 is a handgun round. Thus, Wagster\u2019s testimony, coupled with the report, provide sufficient circumstantial evidence\u201d to conclude that Brown \u201cused a handgun as he shot at Hardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In a number of cases, including <em>Beard, supra, </em>47 Md-App. 410, 423 A.2d 275, cited by appellant, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have held that evidence to support a conviction for a handgun crime is insufficient unless a jury can find beyond a reasonable doubt that the weapon used met the statutory definition of a \u201chandgun.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Beard, </em>47 Md.App. at 412, 414, 423 A.2d 275 (evidence was insufficient to show that weapon was a handgun, where witness described gun in bag as \u201cbig ... brown ... rusty [and] old,\u201d but did not further describe gun or testify as to size of the bag that contained the gun); <em>Pharr v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 615, 632-33, 375 A.2d 1129 (holding evidence insufficient to show that weapon was a handgun, where witness described a \u201csilver handgun\u201d but defendant\u2019s confession described a \u201csilver blank gun,\u201d and no weapon was produced at trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 742 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A challenge to whether a weapon meets the statutory definition of a handgun most frequently arises in cases in which the weapon in question is not recovered and thus not produced at trial. Nevertheless, tangible evidence in the form of the weapon is not necessary to sustain a conviction; the weapon\u2019s identity as a handgun can be established by testimony or by inference. <em>Couplin v.

It points out that only .45 and .41 caliber ballistics specimens were recovered from the basement. Moreover, because Hardy testified that he thought the weapon he used was either a .44 or .45, the State reasons that Hardy\u2019s assailant \u201carguably\u201d used a .41 caliber weapon and, according to Wagster, the .41 is exclusively a handgun round. Therefore, the State insists that it may reasonably be inferred \u201cthat Brown, who the jury determined was the criminal agent, used a handgun as he shot at Hardy.\u201d However, Wagster did not testify as to the caliber of weapon used by Hardy\u2019s assailant. Nor did Hardy testify as to the type of weapon used by the assailant, even to say whether it was a handgun. Moreover, the State did not suggest this interpretation of the evidence to the jury in summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We have not uncovered any reported cases in Maryland that directly address whether, in the absence of any descriptive witness testimony identifying the weapon as a handgun, and in the absence of production of the actual weapon, a jury can permissibly infer that a weapon was a handgun, based on ballistics evidence recovered at the scene. Under appropriate circumstances, we are satisfied that ballistics evidence may give rise to such an inference. In this case, however, we conclude that such an inference cannot be properly drawn from the evidence so as to satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In <em>Woods v. State, </em>315 Md. 591, 556 A.2d 236 (1989), the Court of Appeals concluded that ballistics evidence from a crime scene was sufficient to establish the use of a handgun. In that case, however, a handgun was found at the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>home and produced at' trial. The ballistics evidence was used to connect the bullets found at the scene to the defendant\u2019s weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 622-23, 556 A.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Maryland jurisprudence on the \u201cpenknife exception\u201d to the dangerous weapons statute, C.L. \u00a7 4-101, is instructive, because such cases present issues similar to those that arise under the handgun statutes. With limited exceptions, Maryland prohibits a person to \u201cwear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person,\u201d C.L. \u00a7 4-101(c)(1), or to \u201cwear or carry a dangerous weapon ... openly with the intent or purpose of injuring an individual in an unlawful manner.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 4-101(c)(2). Several types of knives are classified as weapons under the dangerous weapons statute. <em>See </em>C.L. \u00a7 4 \u2014 101(a)(5)(i). But, \u201cpenkni[ves] -without a switchblade\u201d are specifically excepted from the definition of a \u201cweapon.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 4-101(a)(5)(ii)(2). In <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 113 n. 13, 387 A.2d 762 (1978), the Court held that the term \u201cpenknife,\u201d which is not a defined term in the statute, \u201cencompass[es] any knife with the blade folding into the handle, some very large.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">As with handgun cases, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have determined that a defendant could not be convicted of violating the dangerous weapons statute where the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant\u2019s weapon was not a penknife. <em>See, e.g., Bacon, </em>322 Md. at 146-49, 586 A.2d 18; <em>Washington v. State, </em>293 Md. 465, 474-75, 445 A.2d 684 (1982) (evidence was insufficient to show that knife was not a penknife, where knife was not introduced into evidence, and was described only as a \u201c \u2018long silver knife\u2019 \u201c and a \u201c \u2018sharp pointed object\u2019 \u201d); <em>Mackall, </em>283 Md. at 103-113, 387 A.2d 762; <em>Stanley v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 45, 56-57, 701 A.2d 1174 (1997) (evidence was insufficient to show that knife was not a penk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>nife, where \u201cState offered no evidence to contradict\u201d evidence showing that knife was, in fact, a penknife), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, </em>351 Md. 733, 720 A.2d 323 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><em>Mackall, </em>a penknife case, is noteworthy. There, the Court held that there was insufficient evidence that a knife used by the defendant was not a penknife, where the knife was only seen by some of the witnesses, who merely described it as a \u201cknife,\u201d without elaboration. <em>Mackall, </em>283 Md. at 109 &amp; n. 8, 111, 387 A.2d 762. In the absence of an unequivocal eyewitness description, the <em>Mackall </em>Court considered whether the use of a non-penknife could be inferred from the nature of the wounds inflicted on the victims in the defendant\u2019s knife attack. According to the testimony of a police officer who responded to the scene, the wounds suffered by the victims included the following: \u201c\u2018a sharp instrument wound, a clean-cut wound, approximately four inches across the back of his neck fairly deep\u2019 \u201c \u2018a cut on her left arm which required stitches and was also a sharp instrument wound\u2019 and \u201c \u2018a laceration on the nose where the tip of the nose was removed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 387 A.2d 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Court held that this evidence could not support the inference that a non-penknife was used. It stated, <em>id. </em>at 113, 387 A.2d 762:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">We summarily reject the State\u2019s notion that the nature of the wounds \u201cwould at least raise the inference that a pen knife was not used,\u201d so that the evidence was sufficient to negate the exception. Although the wounds as described may be \u201cunquestionably consistent with the use of a knife other than a penknife,\u201d they are also consistent with the use of a penknife.... The inference the State proposes would not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the weapon used was not a penknife without switchblade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Here, the calibers of the bullets, like the knife wounds in <em>Mackall, </em>are evidentiary byproducts of the weapons that were used. Under the <em>Mackall </em>Court\u2019s reasoning, if such evidence is consistent with weapons that fall into both the prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and non-prohibited categories, it is not sufficient to support the inference that a prohibited weapon was used. In this case, both the 7.62 x 39 caliber bullets and the .45 caliber bullets can be fired from either handguns (prohibited) or rifles (not prohibited); the 7.62 x 39 caliber bullet is primarily a rifle round. Under <em>Mackall, </em>therefore, the bullet calibers alone cannot support the inference that a handgun was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument also encompasses an even more direct analogy to <em>Mackall. </em>He asserts: \u201cNo expert testimony was introduced as to what, if any, type of bullet allegedly hit Mr. Hardy. No medical record was introduced as to the size of Mr. Hardy\u2019s alleged gunshot wound.\u201d In the section of appellant\u2019s brief devoted to whether the State proved a \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d discussed <em>infra, </em>appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">Based on the evidence adduced at trial, it is unclear whether or when Mr. Hardy was shot. No gun was ever found and the State failed to produce any medical evidence to bolster its argument that the mark on Mr. Hardy\u2019s leg [shown in a photograph admitted to evidence] was actually a gunshot wound he suffered during the altercation that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Mr. Hardy did not testify at all as to the extent of his injury or the condition of his alleged gunshot wound at the time of his testimony. The State, over the Appellant\u2019s objection, introduced into evidence the pictures of Mr. Hardy\u2019s right leg that were taken when Mr. Hardy met with Detective Dohony on June 22, 2005 [four days after the attack]. Detective Dohony, despite the fact that he is not a medical expert,- testified that these pictures depicted a gunshot wound to Mr. Hardy\u2019s leg. There was no evidence that Mr. Hardy ever received medical treatment for the alleged injury following the attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">By analogy to <em>Mackall, </em>even assuming that the evidence was sufficient to prove that Hardy suffered a gunshot wound, there is no evidence to determine whether the wound was inflicted by a handgun or by a rifle. Based on the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the nature of Hardy\u2019s wound, like the victims\u2019 wounds in <em>Mackall, </em>cannot support the inference that the injury was inflicted by a handgun, or that the weapon which inflicted it did not fall into a statutory exception to the weapons charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">To be sure, when we review a criminal conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, we draw all rational inferences that arise from the evidence in favor of the State. But this precept does not license an appellate court to indulge in rank speculation. \u201cIf upon all of the evidence, the defendant\u2019s guilt is left to conjecture or surmise, and has no solid factual foundation, there can be no conviction.\u201d <em>Taylor v. State, </em>346 Md. 452, 458, 697 A.2d 462 (1997). As we observed in <em>Dukes v. State, </em>178 Md.App. 38, 47-48, 940 A.2d 211, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 64, 949 A.2d 652 (2008):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Maryland courts have long draw a distinction between rational inference from evidence, which is legitimate, and mere speculation, which is not. <em>See, e.g., Benedick v. Potts, </em>88 Md. 52, 55, 40 A. 1067 (1898) (\u201c[A]ny ... fact ... may be established by the proof of circumstances from which its existence may be inferred. But this inference must, after all, be a legitimate inference, and not a mere speculation or conjecture. There must be a logical relation and connection between the circumstances proved and the conclusion sought to be adduced from them.\u201d). In <em>Bell v. Heitkamp, </em>126 Md.App. 211, 728 A.2d 743 (1999), we endorsed the following test to distinguish between inference and speculation: \u201c \u2018where from the facts most favorable to the [party with the burden of proof] the nonexistence of the fact to be inferred is just as probable as its existence (or more probable than its existence), the conclusion that it exists is a matter of speculation, surmise, and conjecture, and a jury will not be permitted to draw it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 728 A.2d 743 (quoting <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. Hicks, </em>25 Md. App. 503, 524, 337 A.2d 744, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 750 (1975)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Here, the inference that the State would have us draw from the evidence, i.e., that Hardy\u2019s assailant was armed with a .41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>caliber handgun, cannot legitimately be drawn. This is because, even from the facts most favorable to the State, \u201c \u2018the nonexistence of the fact\u2019 \u201d that Hardy\u2019s attacker used a .41 caliber handgun \u201c \u2018is just as probable as its existence (or more probable than its existence)____\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>126 Md.App. at 224, 728 A.2d 743 (citation omitted). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The State\u2019s syllogism proceeds as follows: (1) Hardy believed he was armed with a .44 or a .45; (2) only .45 and .41 caliber ballistics evidence was found in the' basement; therefore'(3) Hardy must have been armed with a .45 and thus his assailant was armed with a .41, i.e., a handgun. But, the extant evidence does not allow that conclusion to be drawn beyond a reasonable doubt. The sole bullet recovered from Burnett\u2019s .body was .45 caliber. Neither party suggests that Hardy shot Burnett. Therefore, at least one of the assailants must have been armed with the .45. This undercuts the State\u2019s theory that Hardy, and not his assailant, was armed with a .45.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Moreover, the .41 caliber bullets recovered from the basement were located on or under the basement steps, which was the area of the basement at which Hardy was shooting. In contrast, the single bullet fragment recovered from the basement that bore \u201csimilar rifling class characteristics\u201d to the .45 caliber bullet found in Burnett\u2019s body was found in the basement sink. Diagrams of the crime scene, entered into evidence, showed that the sink was located directly across from the stairs, behind where Hardy was standing. This suggests that the person who was shooting at Hardy used a .45 caliber bullet. Thus, the evidence tends to support an inference contrary to what the State urges: that it was Hardy who was armed with a .41 and his assailant who was armed with a .45. And, as we have seen, Wagster stated that handguns and carbines can both chamber a .45 bullet. Of import here, a carbine is not a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">As to Hardy\u2019s statement that he was armed -with a .44 or .45, upon which the State\u2019s syllogism rests, Hardy explicitly qualified this statement, testifying that the weapon was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>his, that he had no experience with firearms, and that although the weapon \u201cmight have been a .44 or a .45,\u201d he wasn\u2019t \u201creally sure.\u201d Hardy also specifically stated that he would not be able to tell the difference between a .44 and a .45.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The evidence did not support the inference that Hardy\u2019s assailant was armed with a .41 caliber weapon; it was just as probable that Hardy\u2019s assailant was armed with a .45 and that Hardy was armed with a .41, rather than vice versa. Although the evidence did not preclude the proposition that Hardy was armed with a .45, the jury would have had to engage in conjecture in order to conclude that Hardy wielded a .45 and that his assailant wielded a .41.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We recognize that, even if Hardy\u2019s assailant was armed with a .45 caliber weapon, the .45 is primarily a handgun round, according to Wagster. Thus, even if Hardy\u2019s assailant\u2019s weapon was .45 caliber, it is likely that the weapon was a handgun. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore that Wagster indicated that the .45 is not exclusively a handgun round. Because no weapon was placed in evidence, there was no eyewitness testimony of any kind describing the type of weapon that was used as a handgun, and the victim\u2019s wounds cannot eliminate the possibility that the assailant used a rifle rather than a handgun, we look to the ballistics evidence. We find no support in our case law for the proposition that a person may be convicted of a handgun offense based on ballistics evidence that is consistent with use of either a handgun <em>or </em>a firearm that is not a handgun under C.L. \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>201(c), even if the more likely use was of a handgun. Here, based on the ballistics evidence, the jury could not have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hardy\u2019s assailant used a weapon that met the statutory definition of a handgun. Therefore, appellant\u2019s two handgun convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Appellant contends that his assault convictions must also be reversed. He argues that \u201ca rational juror could not have found that Appellant committed the crime of first degree assault on Mr. Hardy because the State failed to establish that Mr. Hardy suffered any serious physical injuries,\u201d as that term is statutorily defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The State counters that the contention is not preserved. It cites appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal, in which his counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">I\u2019m going to pose to the court that [Hardy] was never shot and the reason for that is we have no medical record. We have no medical record for Mr. Hardy. The State wants everybody to believe that somebody gets shots [sic] immediately goes to the hospital. Mr. Hardy never went to the hospital that we know of there because there\u2019s no evidence of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">According to the State, appellant \u201cnow advances an entirely different theory on the sufficiency of evidence with respect to his first degree assault charge: that, \u2018the State failed to establish that Mr. Hardy suffered any serious physical injuries.\u2019 \u201c The State\u2019s position appears to be that an argument that there are no <em>serious </em>physical injuries is distinct from an argument that there are no injuries at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Although we disagree with the State\u2019s claim as to preservation, appellant\u2019s claim fails on the merits. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">Assault in the first degree is prohibited by C.L. \u00a7 3-202(a), and may be committed in alternative ways. The statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>1. A person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">2. A person may not commit an assault with a firearm, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">(i) a handgun, antique firearm, rifle, shotgun, short-barreled shotgun, or short-barreled rifle ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(ii) an assault pistol ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(iii) a machine gun ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">(iv) a regulated firearm....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201cSerious physical injury\u201d is defined in C.L. \u00a7 3-201(d):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cSerious physical injury\u201d means physical injury that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">(1) creates a substantial risk of death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">(2) causes permanent or protracted serious:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">(i) disfigurement;<footnotemark>[20]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">(ii) loss of the function of any bodily member or organ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">(iii) impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">Appellant contends that the evidence submitted at trial to establish that Hardy was injured consisted solely of Detective Dohony\u2019s testimony that Hardy and Hardy\u2019s girlfriend told Dohony that Hardy had been injured, and the photograph that Dohony identified as being a picture of a gunshot wound to Hardy\u2019s thigh. He notes that Hardy did not testify as to his injuries, and Dohony identified the photo over appellant\u2019s objection that Dohony\u2019s lack of medical expertise disqualified him from identifying the picture as depicting a gunshot wound. Appellant also states that no evidence of Hardy\u2019s medical treatment was introduced. Further, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">Based on the evidence adduced in the trial, it is unclear whether or when Mr. Hardy was shot. No gun was ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>found and the State failed to produce any medical evidence to bolster its argument that the mark on Mr. Hardy\u2019s leg was actually a gunshot wound he suffered during the altercation that night. Absent evidence that the alleged attack caused any impairment to Mr. Hardy\u2019s leg, or that the mark Mr. Hardy sustained did not heal or fade by the time of the trial, this Court must reverse the conviction for first degree assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Brown elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">[T]he State failed to produce any evidence as to the condition of Mr. Hardy\u2019s scar <em>at the time of the trial </em>\u2014 the State failed to inquire, and Mr. Hardy did not testify, as to the state of the scar. It is quite possible that Mr. Hardy\u2019s scar had healed or disappeared by the time of Mr. Hardy\u2019s testimony before the jury, thereby precluding a conviction on the basis of a permanent, protracted blemish or scar____ Without the medical records, medical testimony, or any evidence of the scar in evidence before the jury at the time of the trial, a rational juror could not have found that Mr. Hardy suffered any serious physical injuries during the night of the incident. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">We reject appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence did not show whether or when Hardy was shot. A photograph of Hardy\u2019s gunshot wound to his right leg was taken by the police on June 22, 2005, four days after the shooting. It was admitted into evidence. Detective Dohony testified that the injury depicted in the photograph was a gunshot wound. Moreover, the day after the shootings, Detective Dohony spoke with Hardy\u2019s girlfriend, Shaneka Brooks. She informed Dohony that Hardy had told her that he was shot during this incident. Further, Detective Dohony testified that Hardy told him during the interview that he thought he had been shot at Burnett\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">Nevertheless, even assuming that appellant is correct that a \u201cserious physical injury\u201d was not established, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u201cserious physical injury\u201d is not necessary for a conviction for first-degree assault. Under C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 202(a)(2), any assault with a \u201cfirearm\u201d qualifies as first-degree assault. And, all firearms, including those excepted from the definition of \u201chandgun,\u201d are included. Appellant does not contend that the attack on Hardy did not involve a firearm. But, even if he did, Hardy\u2019s testimony and the ballistics evidence already reviewed would be sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Further, C.L. \u00a7 3-202(a) permits conviction for first-degree assault based on an attempt to cause \u201cserious physical injury,\u201d not merely a completed injury. <em>See Lamb v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 422, 429, 613 A.2d 402 (1992) (crime of \u201cassault\u201d includes attempted battery), <em>cent. denied, </em>329 Md. 110, 617 A.2d 1055 (1993); C.L. \u00a7 3-201(b) (\u201c \u2018Assault\u2019 means the crimes of assault, battery, and assault and battery, which retain their judicially determined meanings.\u201d). Thus, even if Hardy had not been struck in the attack, the evidence would be sufficient to support his attacker\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault based on Hardy\u2019s undisputed testimony that his assailant intentionally shot at him. The intent requirement of assault in either the attempted-battery-with-a-firearm variety or the attempt-to-cause-serious-physical-injury variety can be amply inferred from the assailant\u2019s shooting at Hardy. <em>Chilcoat v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 394, 403, 843 A.2d 240 (when considering whether a defendant is guilty of first-degree assault, \u201cthe jury may \u2018infer that \u201cone intends the natural and probable consequences of his act\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 Md. 675, 851 A.2d 594 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Finally, appellant urges us to reverse his convictions, claiming the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that he \u201cwas at the crime scene.\u201d According to appellant, \u201ca reasonable jury could not have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Brown was one of the intruders who broke into the house and assaulted Mr. Hardy.\u201d Appellant argues: \u201cIn this case, the State presented a largely circumstantial case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>relying heavily upon equivocal, unreliable identification by a single eyewitness.\u201d Although the signed photo array was admitted into evidence, appellant maintains that the pre-trial identification was not sufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s criminal agency to support his conviction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In particular, appellant asserts: \u201cMr. Hardy ... recanted his previous identification and testified during the trial ... that Mr. Brown \u2018is not the man [who] shot [him].\u2019 \u201c Thus, Brown maintains that \u201cthe State\u2019s only direct evidence of Appellant\u2019s presence at the crime scene is [a] recanted claim by a person formerly fearful of his own criminal exposure----\u201d Noting that Hardy is \u201cthe only living eyewitness to the crime,\u201d appellant adds: \u201cThere is no evidence that [appellant] knew either victim. There is no evidence he had any motive to attack them. There is no weapon tying him to these crimes. There is no ballistic evidence, no fingerprint placing him at the crime scene.\u201d In his view, Hardy\u2019s testimony \u201cwas too inconclusive, contradictory and uncertain to establish\u201d that appellant committed the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In addition, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">Based on the record, it is clear that Mr. Hardy never was certain as to the identification of the intruders. His story is simply too inconsistent to be believed by any rational juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">Mr. Hardy never made a positive identification of anyone in this matter----At most, Mr. Hardy said in his photo array police interview, eleven days after the attack, that Appellant \u2018could have been\u2019 one of the intruders. Of course, the critical fact remains that shortly before the trial and during it, Mr. Hardy admitted that even this equivocal statement was the fruit of suggestive police comments in an intimidating setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The State relied upon its DNA evidence to overcome the manifest weakness of the identification testimony. Yet, the DNA evidence in this record should give no such comfort____[T]he DNA analyst established only the possibility that Appellant\u2019s DNA may have been recovered from a piece of crime scene evidence. The expert acknowledged that she could not reach a certain conclusion on this quantum of evidence \u2014 and she never established that her analysis even assessed the possibility that Mr. Hardy, the surviving victim, might have been the actual source of the partial DNA match she described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Appellant concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">In this case, where the jury declared itself deadlocked, and then reached finality only with an apparent compromise, it is obvious that the risk of conviction existed even if the proofs and the theory of the case were not compelling. Yet, there, the evidence did not suffice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">Viewing the evidence in [the] light most favorable to the State, there was insufficient credible evidence establishing Mr. Brown\u2019s presence at the Burnett house beyond a reasonable doubt; therefore, this Court must reverse his conviction on all charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The State counters: \u201cIn presenting this ... claim, Brown is essentially requesting this Court to relitigate his case and make determinations on matters such as the credibility of Hardy, which is improper.\u201d The State summarizes the evidence presented at trial, which included Hardy\u2019s prompt identification of Brown in a photo array; Hardy\u2019s testimony that he did not know whether he shot his assailant; Brown\u2019s presentation at the hospital on the date in question with a gunshot wound to the foot, a missing shoe, and an explanation that could not be corroborated; his use of a false name; and his departure from the hospital before treatment, and despite having been instructed to remain.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The State dismisses Brown\u2019s reliance on Hardy\u2019s recantation, asserting: \u201cGiven that the victim identified Brown as the criminal agent in a photographic array, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s determination that Brown was present at the crime scene.\u201d It adds (internal citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">Hardy\u2019s recantation simply forced the jury to weigh the credibility of Detective Dohony versus Hardy. By its verdict, the jury obviously rejected Hardy\u2019s recantation and determined that Detective Dohony\u2019s testimony had more credibility. This is not surprising given the [evidence] supporting Brown\u2019s guilt____In short, by his appeal, Brown seeks to have this Court insert itself as the factfinder and second-guess witness credibility determinations made by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Appellant concedes that the testimony of a single eyewitness may be sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 184, 502 A.2d 496 (1986). Nevertheless, he argues that \u201cthere are limits to this general rule.\u201d Because Hardy, at trial, contradicted his pretrial identification of Brown, appellant contends that Hardy\u2019s testimony \u201cwas too inconclusive, contradictory and uncertain to establish\u201d appellant\u2019s culpability. Appellant seeks support for his position in <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 337, 201 A.2d 683 (1964), in which the Court of Appeals held that the \u201ctestimony of [a] witness, who was the only person that testified as to any overt act on the part of the appellant, was so contradictory that it lacked probative force and was thus insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts required to be proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In our view, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Kucharczyk </em>is misplaced. In that case, the lone witness to the alleged crime was \u201ca mentally deficient 16-year-old boy [with] a full scale I.Q. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>56____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 201 A.2d 683. On the stand, the witness gave directly conflicting answers to the same repeated question. <em>Id. </em>at 337-38, 201 A.2d 683. The Court held that such testimony, wherein \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>witness says in one breath that a thing is so, and in the next breath that it is not so ... is too inconclusive, contradictory, and uncertain, to be the basis of a legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 201 A.2d 683 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The testimony of the lone witness in <em>Kucharczyk </em>was <em>internally </em>inconsistent. In this case, there was no internal inconsistency in Hardy\u2019s trial testimony. Rather, Hardy\u2019s trial testimony contradicted his prior identification of appellant in a photo line-up; Hardy was unequivocal in his claim at trial that appellant was not his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 556-58, 276 A.2d 214 (1971), the Court of Appeals held that a witness\u2019s testimony, which wholly contradicted the statement the witness gave to the police, was not barred by <em>Kucharczyk. </em>The <em>Wilson </em>Court explained: \u201cThe jury was well aware of the prior inconsistent statement of the witness ... and was faced with judging her credibility in the light of such inconsistency. That, of course, is a task for the jury rather than the appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 276 A.2d 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Writing for this Court in <em>Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 83, 93-97, 294 A.2d 123 (1972), Judge Moylan exhaustively described the limits of the so-called <em>\u201cKucharczyk </em>doctrine.\u201d The Court noted that, \u201c[djespite the limited utility of the doctrine, the life of <em>Kucharczyk </em>has been amazing for the number of occasions on which and the number of situations in which it has been invoked in vain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 294 A.2d 123. Of import here, in reciting a variety of situations in which citation to <em>Kucharczyk </em>was inapposite, we began with the example that <em>\u201cKucharczyk </em>does not apply simply because a witness\u2019s trial testimony is contradicted by other statements which the witness has given out of court.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(eight supporting citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Almost thirty years later, in <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000), the Court of Appeals again rejected the extension of <em>Kucharczyk. </em>Quoting <em>Bailey\u2019s </em>dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>quisition on <em>Kucharczyk, id. </em>at <em>544-46, 754 </em>A.2d 1030 the Court observed: \u201cFrom the time that Judge Moylan wrote <em>Bailey </em>to date, no opinion of this Court or of the Court of Special Appeals has encountered a set of facts that justified applying the <em>Kucharczyk </em>approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 754 A.2d 1030. And, we are unaware of any such opinion in the intervening years between <em>Pittman </em>and this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In sum, <em>Kucharczyk </em>\u201cis clearly distinguishable from [a] case [in which] the State\u2019s witness told but one consistent story at the trial.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 119, 127, 300 A.2d 218, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 763 (1973). It \u201chas no application where [witness] testimony is [merely] inconsistent with an out of court statement.\u201d <em>Alexander v. State, 4 </em>Md.App. 214, 218, 242 A.2d 180, <em>cert. denied, </em>251 Md. 747 (1968).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Rejection of the analogy to <em>Kucharczyk </em>does not end our inquiry. The question remains whether there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s conviction, notwithstanding Hardy\u2019s unequivocal testimony at trial that appellant did <em>not </em>attack him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">As noted, Hardy made a pre-trial photographic identification. Maryland Rule 5-802.1 (2008) expressly permits the substantive admission of certain prior statements made by a witness who testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination, as was Hardy here. In pertinent part, the rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">(iii) A statement that is one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Here, the jury was entitled to consider Hardy\u2019s pre-trial identification of appellant from a photo array of six photos. Hardy admitted at trial that he had identified appellant in the array, but claimed that his reason for doing so was that the detectives had asked specifically about appellant\u2019s picture, and Hardy \u201crode with it,\u201d because he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to sit there in their house and tell the Homicide detectives that yes you made me point him out right in their face. I was scared to do that.\u201d However, Detective Dohony disputed Hardy\u2019s version of events with respect to the identification. He explicitly testified that, during the unrecorded \u201cpre-interview,\u201d Hardy indicated, without hesitation or equivocation, that appellant was the shooter.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Appellant does not contend that Hardy\u2019s pre-trial identification was inadmissible. The fact that the jury was presented with evidence that appellant was the perpetrator, in the form of Hardy\u2019s pre-trial photo identification and Dohony\u2019s testimony, as well as evidence that he was not the perpetrator, in the form of Hardy\u2019s trial testimony, made the issue of identification a credibility question for the jury. Put another way, Hardy\u2019s recantation at trial simply required the jury to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. The jury was entitled to credit Hardy\u2019s pre-trial identification of appellant as the assailant, as well as Dohony\u2019s version of the events pertaining to that identification, and to discredit Hardy\u2019s account at trial. <em>See Owens v. State, </em>170 Md.App. 35, 102, 906 A.2d 989 (2006) (\u201c[I]t is the jury\u2019s task to resolve any conflicts in the evidence and assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>399 Md. 388, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>924 A.2d 1072 (2007), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1064, 169 L.Ed.2d 813 (2008). Moreover, the jury clearly considered the other probative evidence, which included Hardy\u2019s testimony that he fired several shots at his assailant; appellant\u2019s presentation at the hospital on the night in question, with a gunshot wound; Brown\u2019s fabrication of a robbery; Brown\u2019s use of a false name at the hospital; and Brown\u2019s sudden departure from the hospital, before treatment and despite having been told by the police to remain at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to substitute Brown\u2019s view of the evidence for that of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED AS TO USE OF A HANDGUN AND WEARING, CARRYING, AND TRANSPORTING A HANDGUN.

Given that Hardy indicated that he might not be able to distinguish a .44 from a .45, we point out that the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 57 .41 Magnum, the revolver for which the .41 caliber handgun round was developed, is very similar in appearance to Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s Model 24 Magnum revolver, the .44 caliber handgun which achieved notoriety in popular culture as the iconic weapon wielded by Clint Eastwood\u2019s cinematic character \"Dirty Harry.\u201d <em>See </em>Dean K. Boorman, The History Of Smith &amp; Wesson Firearms 10, 118-19 (2002). As noted, Hardy testified unequivocally that he fired a revolver.

Appellant has not cited <em>Gibbs v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 35, 253 A.2d 446 (1969).
