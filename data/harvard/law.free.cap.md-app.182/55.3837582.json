Kroll, appellant, against Barbara G. Fisher, appellee, in the Circuit Court for Allegany County. Appellee is the personal representative of the estate of Mary D. Kroll (\u201cMs. Kroll\u201d), and prior to Ms. Kroll\u2019s death, appellee acted as attorney-in-fact for Ms. Kroll. In his complaint, appellant alleged appellee committed fraud against Ms. Kroll and requested an accounting of Ms. Kroll\u2019s estate. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and the circuit court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">On appeal, appellant raises the following issues, which we have rephrased: (1) whether the circuit court erred by granting summary judgment prior to the completion of discovery; and (2) whether the circuit court erred by declaring that only the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate may file an action for an accounting of the decedent\u2019s finances prior to the decedent\u2019s death, when the personal representative also acted as the decedent\u2019s attorney-in-fact, notwithstanding the conflict of interest arising from such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On April 19, 2007, appellant filed a complaint for an accounting against appellee in the circuit court. Appellant is the nephew of Ms. Kroll, who died on December 8, 2006. Prior to Ms. Kroll\u2019s death, appellee acted as Ms. Kroll\u2019s attorney-in-fact, having been appointed by power of attorney dated March 30, 2004. On December 14, 2006, probate proceedings commenced in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Allegany County on the estate of Ms. Kroll (\u201cthe estate\u201d) in the form of a small estate petition for administration. Under Ms. Kroll\u2019s last will and testament, appellee was appointed personal representative of the estate. On January 25, 2007, appellee filed in the orphans\u2019 court an information report on Ms. Kroll\u2019s estate along with other estate administration forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">In appellant\u2019s complaint, appellant alleged appellee had been \u201chandling the financial affairs for the Estate of Mary D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Kroll as well as handling her financial affairs prior to her passing away.\u201d Appellant alleged that \u201con numerous times and dates,\u201d appellant had \u201creceived information regarding the Estate\u2019s finances which [had] made [appellant] concerned as to whether the Estate\u2019s finances [were] being handled properly.\u201d Appellant alleged appellee had denied repeated requests from appellant to provide an accounting or documentation of appellee\u2019s handling of the estate\u2019s finances or her handling of Ms. Kroll\u2019s finances prior to her death. Appellant alleged that he was a beneficiary of the estate and an \u201cinterested party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Appellant alleged fraud on the part of appellee, and requested that the court order an \u201cindependent accounting or audit\u201d of Ms. Kroll\u2019s estate. Appellant requested that if any \u201cmalfeasance\u201d was discovered through the accounting, that appellee be held responsible for \u201crestitution, attorney\u2019s fees, accounting fees, court costs and interest,\u201d and any further relief that may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On May 23, 2007, appellee answered appellant\u2019s complaint. In the answer, appellee alleged she did not have knowledge or information regarding appellant\u2019s allegation that she had mishandled the finances of Ms. Kroll\u2019s estate, and appellee neither admitted nor denied the allegations. Appellee denied that she committed fraud. In response to appellant\u2019s request for an accounting of the estate, appellee alleged that \u201can accounting of receipts and disbursements\u201d was being prepared and would be \u201ctimely filed with the Register of Wills.\u201d Appellee requested that appellant\u2019s complaint be dismissed, and that appellee be awarded costs and any further relief that may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">On May 31, 2007, appellant filed requests for interrogatories and the production of documents from appellee. On June 1, 2007, appellee filed requests for interrogatories and the production of documents from appellant. On June 19, 2007, appellant was scheduled to depose appellee, but appellant postponed the deposition because appellee had not answered appellant\u2019s written discovery requests. Appellant was deposed by appellee on June 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On July 10, 2007, appellee filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss due to lack of standing.\u201d In the motion, appellee argued appellant, as a beneficiary of the estate, did not have standing to file the action for an accounting. Appellee argued the \u201cproper procedure to be followed by the beneficiary is to move to have the Personal Representative disqualified for conflict of interest [in orphans\u2019 court] and to have an independent Personal Representative appointed to evaluate\u201d whether to proceed with a cause of action. Appellee asserted the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s claim, and requested that the case be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On July 25, 2007, appellant filed a response to appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In the response, appellant argued that appellee was \u201cfiling frivolous and/or premature motions in an effort to avoid answering discovery and providing requested documents.\u201d Appellant asserted the relevant time period in the case was the period prior to Ms. Kroll\u2019s death, when appellee was acting as Ms. Kroll\u2019s attorney-in-fact and when appellee, as a fiduciary, was legally responsible for utilizing Ms. Kroll\u2019s assets according to Ms. Kroll\u2019s interests. Appellant asserted that as \u201ca family member and heir,\u201d he was an interested party and he had standing to file a complaint for an accounting. Appellant requested that appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss be denied, and that appellee be ordered to answer discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On August 24, 2007, the circuit court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. At the hearing, the court asked counsel for appellee whether appellant had been granted \u201csome sort of bequest\u201d in Ms. Kroll\u2019s will, and counsel for appellee responded: \u201che received seventeen percent.\u201d The court also asked counsel for appellee whether an accounting of Ms. Kroll\u2019s estate had been filed yet in the orphans\u2019 court, and counsel for appellee responded an accounting had not been filed, and that it was not yet due.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On September 13, 2007, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint. In its opinion, the court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>under Maryland Code (2001 Repl.Vol., 2007 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 2-102 to 2-108 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article (\u201cE.T\u201d) and Maryland Rule 6-113, the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s complaint. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">[Appellant\u2019s] claim is that funds belonging to Mary Kroll were mismanaged by [appellee] prior to Mary Kroll\u2019s death. If that is true, [appellee], who as attorney in fact had a fiduciary duty to Mary Kroll (and now as personal representative to the Estate of Mary Kroll), may have been liable to Mary Kroll prior to her death and now to her Estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">Under Maryland law, [appellee], as personal representative, already has a duty to file an inventory and accounting in Mary Kroll\u2019s Estate. The inventory includes \u201c[d]ebts owed to the decedent by the personal representative.\u201d [E.T. \u00a7 7-201(6)]. Failure to abide by her obligation is cause for removal by the <em>Orphans\u2019 Court. </em>[E.T. \u00a7 6-306]. In fact, as an interested person, [appellant] could argue to the Orphans\u2019 Court that it is in the best interest of the Estate that he be appointed personal representative. Obviously, whomever the Orphans\u2019 Court appointed Personal Representative as [appellee\u2019s] successor could pursue the accounting against [appellee] on behalf of the Estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">The bottom line at this point is that the Orphans\u2019 Court is the entity having jurisdiction over [appellant\u2019s] complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Appellant raises two contentions on appeal: first, appellant argues the circuit court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint prior to the completion of discovery. Second, appellant argues the court erred in holding that only the personal representative could pursue an action for an accounting of the estate, considering the \u201cbuilt in conflict\u201d arising from the circumstance that appellee had acted as attorney-in-fact for Ms. Kroll and is now personal representative of the estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>As a result of this circumstance, appellant argues appellee will not cooperate in divulging documents regarding Ms. Kroll\u2019s finances prior to Ms. Kroll\u2019s death, and appellant will have insufficient evidence to challenge appellee as personal representative in orphans\u2019 court. Appellant argues he has \u201cno other mechanism to investigate the matter,\u201d and contends the circuit court should have allowed the case to proceed past discovery and then entertained any motions. Appellant asks this Court to reverse the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u201cThe proper standard for reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>171 Md.App. 254, 264, 909 A.2d 1087 (2006) (quoting <em>Britton v. Meier, </em>148 Md.App. 419, 425, 812 A.2d 1082 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The circuit court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint based upon its conclusion that the orphans\u2019 court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim and that appellant\u2019s claim should be made in orphan\u2019s court. Appellant has not argued why jurisdiction over his complaint is proper in circuit court instead of orphans\u2019 court, and appellant has not cited any cases showing that the circuit court has, or should exercise, jurisdiction. Through our research, we found several cases where circuit courts sitting as equity courts were held to have jurisdiction over claims related to the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate, instead of orphans\u2019 court \u2014 but only where the orphans\u2019 court lacked power to grant a complete and adequate remedy. <em>See Shapiro v. Ryan, </em>233 Md. 82, 87-88, 195 A.2d 596 (1963) (\u201cThe principle is firmly established in the law of this State that when the Orphans\u2019 Court is unable to afford a complete and adequate remedy, equity will assume jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>Tribull v. Tribull, </em>208 Md. 490, 503, 119 A.2d 399 (1956) (holding \u201cthe inadequacy of the powers of the Orphans\u2019 Court may be sufficient\u201d to place jurisdiction over cases involving administration of a decedent\u2019s estate in equity court); <em>Boland v. Ash, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>145 Md. 465, 474, 125 A. 801 (1924) (explaining \u201cin the absence of special and unusual circumstances which render the powers of the orphans\u2019 court insufficient to afford adequate relief,\u201d a court of equity will not assume jurisdiction of the estate of a decedent). It is not a question of standing, but one of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In this case, the orphans\u2019 court does not lack power to grant the remedy appellant seeks, which is an equitable accounting of Ms. Kroll\u2019s finances prior to her death and during the period that appellee acted as her attorney-in-fact. The orphans\u2019 court has the power to order such an accounting because appellee\u2019s management of Ms. Kroll\u2019s finances prior to her death is relevant to appellee\u2019s duties as personal representative of the estate. <em>See </em>E.T. \u00a7 2-102 (\u201cThe court may conduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent.\u201d); E.T. \u00a7 2-104 (\u201cThe Maryland Rules for the summoning of a witness, and for depositions and discovery, apply to all actions.\u201d); Maryland Rule 6-461(a) (\u201cDiscovery in accordance with the rules in Title 2, Chapter 400 is available in any court proceeding on a contested matter.\u201d); E.T. \u00a7 2-103 (\u201cThe court has the same legal and equitable powers to effectuate its jurisdiction, punish contempts, and carry out its orders, judgments, and decrees as a court of record with general jurisdiction in equity.\u201d); E.T. \u00a7 6-306(a) (\u201cA personal representative shall be removed from office upon a finding by the court that he: ...; (4) Has mismanaged property; ...; (6) Has failed, without reasonable excuse, to perform a material duty pertaining to the office.\u201d); E.T. \u00a7 7-101(a) (providing personal representative is a fiduciary; that he is under a general duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of the will and the estate of decedents\u2019 law; that he shall use the authority conferred upon him by the estate of decedents\u2019 law, by the terms of the will, by orders in proceedings to which he is a party, and by the equitable principles generally applicable to fiduciaries); E.T. \u00a7 7-201(6) (providing that within three months after personal representative\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>pointment, personal representative shall prepare and file an inventory of property owned by the decedent at the time of his death; and such inventory shall include debts owed to the decedent by the personal representative).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appellant may file a claim in orphans\u2019 court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking appellee\u2019s removal as personal representative for failing to discharge her obligations and, in that context, request discovery and an order requiring her to account for the management of the decedent\u2019s assets prior to the decedent\u2019s death. The orphans\u2019 court has the power to rule on these requests,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore, because the orphans\u2019 court does not lack power to grant a complete and adequate remedy in this case, the circuit court did not err in refusing to assume jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Additionally, assuming there was mismanagement of Ms. Kroll\u2019s finances prior to her death, the recovery of such funds would go directly to the estate, not to appellant. The recovery of funds for the estate of a decedent ordinarily lies within the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Tribull:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Primarily, of course, the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate is committed to the Orphans\u2019 Court.... \u201cSo long as assets can be found, which properly belong to the estate of the decedent, which have not been brought in and accounted for, the estate is not fully closed. * * * if * * * there be assets which he [the executor] has not returned, or assets which can be recovered, which he has not recovered, it is not only within the power and jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to require the executor to discharge his duty, but it is the plain duty of the court to compel him.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">208 Md. at 499-500, 119 A.2d 399 quoting <em>Wilson v. McCarty, </em>55 Md. 277, 280 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude the circuit court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint prior to the completion of discovery on the basis that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
