The disputed area also includes a portion of a concrete boat ramp that straddles the common boundary. Linda Ann Senez, appellant, is the owner of 341 Worton Road (the \u201cSenez Property\u201d); Ann and Steve Collins, appellees, own 339 Worton Road (the \u201cCollins Property\u201d). Both properties front on Norman Creek, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, and each contains a single family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In September 2004, appellees filed a quiet title action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, and also alleged claims, <em>inter alia, </em>of trespass and nuisance. Appellant filed a counterclaim based on adverse possession. Following a bench trial in 2006, the court ruled in favor of appellees as to most of their claims, including adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On appeal, appellant presents one issue: \u201cWhether the circuit court erroneously denied the appellant\u2019s adverse possession claim despite the evidence of twenty-three years of hostile possession and the absence of any clear and unequivocal acts by the appellees to challenge her exclusive, hostile possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">For the reasons that follow, we answer in the affirmative and shall therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Appellant purchased the Senez Property on November 22, 2000, and began to live there immediately. Her predecessors in title, Arthur L. and Joan E. Myers (\u201cthe Myers\u201d), had previously acquired the property on April 6, 1981, and lived there continuously for approximately nineteen years and seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Appellees purchased the Collins Property on August 14, 2000, from the estate of George Cook, who had owned the property with his wife, Madeline Cook (\u201cthe Cooks\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Cooks had acquired the property on August 7, 1973. In October 2000, appellees tore down the existing house on the property and commenced construction of a new home. As a result, they did not begin living on the property until late July 2001. Thus, although appellees purchased the Collins Property before appellant acquired the Senez Property, appellant was already living on her property before appellees moved into theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">At the time the parties purchased their respective properties, the properties were separated by a concrete retaining wall (the \u201cWall\u201d), which did not precisely track the property line. The Wall, approximately 115 feet long, extended almost the entire length of the boundary between the properties, beginning some 75 feet from Worton Road and terminating at the point where the Wall met a concrete sea wall, or bulkhead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>which separated the Collins Property from Norman Creek. A survey of the Senez Property, which was conducted for appellant by Bryan R. Dietz, and which was later admitted at trial as a joint exhibit (the \u201cDietz Survey\u201d), showed that approximately 35 feet before meeting the sea wall, the Wall diverged from the boundary line. Between that point and the sea wall, according to the Dietz Survey, the Wall sat entirely on the Collins side of the property line. As a result, a narrow strip of the Collins Property was located on the Senez side of the Wall. That narrow strip between the Wall and the boundary line is the area of land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The disputed area contains part of a concrete boat ramp that extends past the sea wall, providing access from the Senez Property to Norman Creek. The boat ramp is entirely on the Senez side of the Wall. But, because the Wall does not follow the boundary, a portion of the boat ramp falls on the Collins side of the property line. In the disputed area, the elevation of the ground on the Senez side of the Wall is a few feet higher than the elevation on the Collins side. As noted, the Wall was a retaining wall; it maintained the properties at their differing elevations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On September 29, 2004, appellees filed suit against appellant, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief, on the grounds of trespass, continuing trespass, private nuisance, quiet title, and invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In relevant part, appellees contended that they owned \u201cone half of a boat ramp which straddles the parties' properties,\u201d and that appellant had \u201c[installed a wood fence between the properties, which fence not only encroaches on the Collins Property but at the south end of the Collins Property, also blocks access by [appellees] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to that part of the Collins Property which includes the shared boat ramp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In her Answer, appellant contended that she \u201cpresently owns the entirety of the boat ramp by adverse possession.\u201d She also denied \u201cthe allegation that any portion of the fence encroaches upon the Collins Property insofar as she presently owns the property in question by adverse possession.\u201d Then, on November 8, 2004, appellant filed a \u201cCounterclaim for Title by Adverse Possession and Bill to Quiet Title.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She alleged that \u201cthe Senez Property is ... marked at its boundary with the Collins Property by a one-foot wide block wall and a wooden privacy fence,\u201d and that she \u201cand her predecessors in title for more than the prescriptive period of twenty (20) years have maintained the lawn, erected and/or maintained fencing and/or the aforedescribed block wall and/or have otherwise exercised actual peaceable possession\u201d of the disputed area. Further, appellant contended that her predecessors\u2019 possession, as well as her own, had been \u201cactual, open, notorious, exclusive and hostile, and that said possession has been continuous and uninterrupted,\u201d thus satisfying the requirements for adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The matter was heard by the circuit court, sitting without a jury, in December 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of the parties testified at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>At trial, the court received into evidence as a joint exhibit the <em>de bene esse </em>deposition testimony of Arthur Myers, the prior owner of the property acquired by appellant. In his deposition, Mr. Myers stated that he purchased the property with his wife in 1980, but did not secure a boundary survey at that time. Mr. Myers recalled that the Wall (or a predecessor to it) was already in place when he purchased the property now owned by appellant. He did not know who originally constructed the Wall, however. Mr. Myers did not realize that the Wall did not track the property line, and he assumed that the Wall was situated on his neighbors\u2019 side of the boundary. According to Mr. Myers, in the late 1980\u2019s a portion of the original Wall fell down; the Cooks had the Wall rebuilt in the same footprint, at their own expense, with a better foundation and \u201cweep holes\u201d to allow drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Throughout the time the Myers owned what is now the Senez Property, both when the original Wall existed and after the construction of the replacement Wall, the Myers maintained the property up to the Wall, doing yard maintenance and the like. According to Mr. Myers, the Cooks never objected to his maintenance of the property up to the Wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Mr. Myers recounted that he constructed the boat ramp while he lived at the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Mr. Myers did not obtain a boundary survey at that time, he claimed that he never received any complaints that the boat ramp encroached on the Cooks\u2019 property. Mr. Myers never expanded the ramp, and had no need to perform significant maintenance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In addition, Mr. Myers constructed a wooden sea wall, or bulkhead, across the eastern side of his property, fronting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Norman Creek. At the same time, he constructed a wooden bulkhead on the Cooks\u2019 side of the boat ramp, extending to the concrete sea wall along the east side of what is now the Collins Property. He explained that, due to erosion from the creek, \u201cwe were losing property.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Myers testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">The only discussion I had with George [Cook] was when I was gonna build the bulkhead the water had started eroding around his bulkhead and I say, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tie it into your bulkhead so the water can\u2019t get down there.\u201d You see, it was undermining his bulkhead, so that\u2019s why, if you see that there\u2019s some curve in this when I brought it back to meet his bulkhead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Mr. Myers allowed many neighbors to use the boat ramp, \u201cwith permission.\u201d In particular, he recalled that he allowed various neighbors to use the ramp during a period in which \u201cthe local [public] ramp closed, and until it was opened again, I allowed them to come down and put their boats in.\u201d According to Mr. Myers, this use was infrequent, and \u201canyone [who] would launch their vessel from [his] ramp did so after first securing [Mr. Myers\u2019s] permission.\u201d Mr. Myers was emphatic that the ramp \u201cwas not open to the public [such] that they could wander down [the] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">With regard to the Cooks, however, Mr. Myers asserted that there was no formal \u201cunderstanding.\u201d In his words, \u201cI\u2019m a neighbor and I offered it.\u201d Mr. Myers also assisted the Cooks with launching boats from the ramp. When asked whether he recalled seeing anyone from the Cook family ever cross the Wall and use the boat ramp, Mr. Myers said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it if they did.\u201d Mr. Myers indicated that, \u201cto his recollection,\u201d after appellees purchased the Collins Property \u201cthey never used\u201d the ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Shortly before Mr. Myers sold his property to appellant in 2000, he obtained a survey of the property, to ensure that a fence he intended to construct on the southern boundary of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>property (i.e., the opposite side from the Collins Property) correctly followed the property line. The surveyor informed Mr. Myers that, on the northern side of his property, there was \u201cabout a foot difference\u201d between the Wall and the actual property line, such that the Wall was \u201ca foot back from the property line onto 33 9,\u201d i.e., the Collins Property. Mr. Myers said that his primary interest was the correct placement of the fence on the southern side of the property, rather than the northern property line, but he placed the survey in the materials shown to prospective buyers of his property. He commented that \u201canybody who was buying it could look at that survey and figure it for themselves what they wanted to do with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Ann Collins testified that she and her husband purchased the Collins Property in August 2000. The Myers were their next-door neighbors until appellant purchased the Senez Property and moved in around Thanksgiving of 2000. Appellees did not move in immediately, however, because they were replacing the existing house on their property with a new one. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said that she visited the property often, particularly to do gardening. She claimed that, before the existing house was demolished in October 2000, she was there \u201calmost every day. And then, on the weekends Steve and I would go down and spend two nights there. We got a blow-up mattress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Ms. Collins maintained that she frequently used the boat ramp. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: How many times did you use the boat ramp between, well, between let\u2019s say, the time you moved in and the time your house was completed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">[MS. COLLINS]: Well, when Mr. Myers was there it was much easier, we just jumped over the wall. We used it as a launch for our swimming. We had a canoe or, at least, some people brought a canoe out of the water all the time, my children, my friends, Shirley, we went swimming there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: When you say you jumped over the wall, you mean the retaining wall you believe is on your property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">[MS. COLLINS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Okay. At that time was there \u2014 you were talking about Mr. \u2014 when Mr. Myers was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">[MS. COLLINS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: At that time there was no fence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">[MS. COLLINS]: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Did Mr. Myers give you permission to use the boat ramp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">[MS. COLLINS]: There was never any question about permission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: So you didn\u2019t ask permission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\">[MS. COLLINS]: Absolutely not.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: You told [the judge] earlier you \u2014 you and Mr. Myers got along very well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">[MS. COLLINS]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: You used the boat ramp frequently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">[MS. COLLINS]: Yes, because the house wasn\u2019t built, we didn\u2019t have any furniture. We would go over there and sit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">According to Ms. Collins, before appellant moved into the Senez Property in November 2000, appellant hired a contractor to erect a wooden fence that ran along the Wall, sitting just on the Senez side of the Wall. Ms. Collins recalled that before appellant constructed the fence, the two discussed its location. Ms. Collins said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-18\">When we were down there planting she called me towards the fence or towards the wall and said, can my fence follow the wall instead of the property line? And I said, hum, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>can\u2019t answer that because my husband and I own the property jointly, we\u2019ll have to talk about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Nevertheless, Ms. Collins maintained that the fence was \u201cabsolutely\u201d constructed without appellees\u2019 permission. At trial, Ms. Collins was asked: \u201cAfter the fence was constructed and you became aware of it, did you have any conversations with Ms. Senez about the fence?\u201d Collins responded: \u201cYes, we did.\u201d She continued: \u201c[Appellant] said we did not say no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Mr. Collins corroborated his wife\u2019s testimony as to this point. He denied that they gave Ms. Senez permission to build the fence. Mr. Collins recalled: \u201cWe were [asked for permission to build the fence] and, unfortunately, we did not respond quick enough for her. Um, when we returned to the property the fence was in place.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Ms. Collins admitted that both before and after the fence was erected, she maintained the Collins Property only up to the Wall; the Myers, and later appellant, maintained the property on the other side of the Wall. Despite the concerns about the fence, Ms. Collins testified that until April 2004, appellees and appellant had a cordial relationship, which included possessing keys to each other\u2019s homes. They would also socialize together and take care of each other\u2019s pets, as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Moreover, Ms. Collins claimed that appellees and their children continued to use the ramp after appellant moved into the Senez Property; they launched their canoe from the ramp \u201cseveral dozen\u201d times. At some point after appellant initially constructed the fence, however, she extended it along the Wall towards the water, with wire fencing, purportedly to keep her dogs in her yard.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the fence was extended, it was no longer possible for appellees to cross between the two properties at the end of the Wall to gain access to the ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>According to Ms. Collins, appellant\u2019s property suffered storm damage as a result of Hurricane Isabelle in 2003. As a result, appellant had to replace a railroad-tie retaining wall on her property that ran parallel to the Wall and supported a terraced yard adjacent to the house on the Senez Property. Appellant rebuilt the railroad-tie wall higher than its original, and constructed a fence or railing atop it, which blocked appellees\u2019 view down Norman Creek from their property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Ms. Collins also testified that appellant regraded the area between the replaced terrace wall and the Wall, such that more water would run off onto appellees\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Ms. Collins admitted that she and her husband began to inquire with various permitting authorities as to whether appellant had acquired the necessary permits to erect the replacement terrace wall. At that point, in April or May of 2004, the relationship between the neighbors began to sour. At some point (Ms. Collins did not specify a date), appellant constructed a wooden gate across the boat ramp, supposedly to keep her dogs from entering the water. At another point, according to Ms. Collins, appellant \u201cslurried concrete in the water\u201d to make the boat ramp longer and wider.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">For reasons that Ms. Collins did not explain, at some point appellees used concrete to block the weep holes in the Wall. This ultimately caused a portion of the Wall to fall down in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Although appellant\u2019s perspective was significantly different, appellant agreed with appellees about many matters. She testified that, at first, she and appellees \u201cbecame friends.\u201d She \u201cinvited them to [her] house to have drinks, occasionally, out on the deck. Watched fireworks together down on the lower level of the property. Exchanged keys to the house so in the event [she] got home late they could let [her] dog out,\u201d and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>According to appellant, she hired a contractor to erect the fence along the Wall prior to final settlement on the Senez Property with the Myers. At the time she decided to construct the fence, she had not yet met appellees. She explained that after she hired the contractor, \u201cthe contractor talked about possibly putting [the] fence ... up on top of the [W]all,\u201d rather than alongside it, so as to \u201celiminate that small space between the fence and the [W]all.\u201d She claimed that she \u201cmentioned\u201d this possibility to appellees, who did not respond affirmatively or negatively, and there was \u201cno further conversation.\u201d Accordingly, she \u201cjust decided to put the fence ... right next to the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Appellant recounted that \u201cMrs. Collins occasionally asked for permission to come to the boat ramp to feed the ducks or geese with her granddaughter,\u201d and appellant granted permission. According to appellant, appellees never requested to launch a boat from the ramp, nor objected when she repaired the ramp. She testified that she extended the ramp further into Norman Creek, but did not widen it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">According to appellant, in late April of 2004, appellees complained that her construction of the terrace wall and terrace fence blocked their view of the water. She recalled that she met with appellees on May 9, 2004, a date which she remembered because it was her father\u2019s birthday, \u201cand that\u2019s when Mr. Collins told [her] that half the boat ramp was his.\u201d Appellant stated: \u201cI was a little surprised because I had assumed my property line had gone to the wall----\u201d According to appellant, she offered to purchase the sliver of land, but said that the parties first would have to obtain a boundary survey to establish the property line. She recalled that Mr. Collins made her a counter-offer: \u201c[H]e told me if I take the boathouse down, if I give him permission to take the boathouse down and pay for it, he would gift me the piece of property.\u201d According to appellant, Mr. Collins had told her on previous occasions that he considered her boathouse an \u201ceyesore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Appellant declined Mr. Collins\u2019s offer, and at that point their relationship deteriorated. She stated: \u201cAfter that, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>became quite heated, with Baltimore County coming out to the property, pulling permits, putting a stop order.\u201d She recounted that on approximately a dozen occasions she met with various county, state, and federal permitting agencies as a result of complaints lodged against her by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On cross-examination, appellant was asked whether she asked appellees\u2019 permission to install the initial fence she erected along the Wall. She responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">No, I did not ask permission. I discussed with them, putting the fence on top of the wall to minimize and reduce four inch space [sic] between the wall and the fence, and it was only in a passing thought as to what to do. I never heard back from them. I really didn\u2019t pursue it. I thought it was just as easy for me to put in \u2014 in the ground and probably cheaper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">At the close of the hearing, the court made an oral ruling, granting judgment in favor of appellees on their trespass, possession, and quiet title claims, but awarding no damages. The court also denied appellant\u2019s adverse possession claim. On December 20, 2006, the court entered its \u201cFinal Judgment,\u201d which it followed, <em>sua sponte, </em>on December 21, with an \u201cAmended Final Judgment\u201d to correct the inadvertent omission of a provision it had dictated in open court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u2022 Appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Alter/Amend Judgment, or in the Alternative, Motion for New Trial\u201d on January 2, 2006, seeking reconsideration of the court\u2019s ruling on the issue of adverse possession, and seeking further clarification of the court\u2019s order relating to ownership of the boat ramp. She contended that the terms of the court\u2019s order had inadvertently created an \u201ceasement by implication\u201d with respect to the boat ramp. Appellees opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">In response, the court issued its \u201cSecond Amended Final Judgment\u201d on February 23, 2007, in which it clarified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>language of its order relative to the boat ramp, but otherwise denied the motion. In this ruling, as to appellee\u2019s possession of property and quiet title claims, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">4. Judgment on Count IV (possession of property) is hereby entered in favor of [appellees] and against [appellant] in that [appellant] is hereby ORDERED, absent an agreement by the parties to the contrary, to remove any gate or fence blocking access by the parties for the enjoyment and use of the boat ramp presently located on the east side of 339 and 341 Worton Road at Norman Creek. [Appellees] own approximately fifteen (15%) percent of the boat ramp on the side closest to their property; [appellant] owns the remaining eighty-five (85%) percent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">5. Judgment on Count V (quiet title) is entered in favor of [appellees] and against [appellant] in that the 291 square foot area ... shall remain the property of [appellees].... [F]urther, [appellant] shall remove the fence presently existing on [appellees\u2019] property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Further, the court said: \u201cJudgment on the Counter Claim (for title by adverse possession) is hereby entered in favor of [appellees].\u201d As to appellees\u2019 trespass claims, the court awarded judgment in appellees\u2019 favor, without damages. But, the court entered judgment in favor of appellant as to appellees\u2019 claims of nuisance and invasion of privacy, as well as their claim to title by adverse possession over an area of land other than the disputed area on appeal. The court also denied appellees\u2019 request for a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The court accompanied the Second Amended Final Judgment with a written \u201cMotions Ruling\u201d concerning appellant\u2019s motion to alter or amend. The court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">Under Maryland law, to obtain title to property, the person claiming adverse possession must prove actual, open, notorious and visible, exclusive, hostile and continuous possession of the claimed property for at least 20 years. <em>Bratton v. Hitchens, </em>43 Md.App. 348, 405 A.2d 333 (1979); <em>Blickenstaff v. Bromley, </em>243 Md. 164, 220 A.2d 558 (1966).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In 1981, when the Myers took title to 341, a concrete wall existed along the property line of 341 and 339. The wall fell sometime in the 1980\u2019s and was rebuilt by Cook (owner of 339) in the original wall\u2019s foot print. The wall sat partly on 339, and partly on 341, crossing the boundary line at one point. Myers installed a boat ramp which sat on both properties. In addition, Myers had a bulkhead installed across the waterfront of 341 to the boat ramp. Myers maintained the property on the 341 side of the wall, including the boat ramp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">Myers granted permission to neighbors to use the property between Myers\u2019 house and the wall, including the boat ramp, to access the waterfront to launch boats, in part, because a local boat ramp had closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">The Cooks, including their son-in-law used the boat ramp. As a result, the Court does not infer that Mr. and Mrs. Myers\u2019 possession of 341 and use of the property in dispute was adverse to the Cooks. When [appellees] purchased 339, they too used the boat ramp, as did [appellant] when she purchased ,341. At the time [appellant] purchased her property, [appellee] had already used the boat ramp to launch canoes and to feed ducks. Thus, by using their property, [appellees] were in possession of their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Initially, the parties were friendly. It is unfortunate for both sides that their friendship has not continued. The Court found [appellees\u2019] testimony that they had never asked permission to use the boat ramp credible. The Court did not find credible [appellant\u2019s] testimony that [appellees] asked her for permission. Nor does the Court accept the suggestion that [appellees] were required to file suit to assert their ownership of the property in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[Appellant] added a gate to the boat ramp to prevent her dogs from going into the water on the ramp. [Appellees], who also have dogs, did not object to the addition of the gate. The Court did not view the gate as evidence sufficient to deprive the [appellees] of their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>From the time she acquired 341 in November 2000, [appellant] maintained the boat ramp and the property on her side of the wall. Most of the boat ramp is on [appellant\u2019s] property; maintaining the boat ramp is clearly in her best interest. Neglecting to maintain one side of it, the small portion which is on [appellees\u2019] property, could result in collapse or other failure of the ramp. [Appellant\u2019s] maintenance of the small sliver of area in front of the wall as well as the ramp were not, in the Court\u2019s view, sufficient evidence of control to deprive [appellees] of their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">In his deposition testimony, Arthur Myers testified that he always cooperated with his neighbors, the Cooks. While it is true that he mowed the grass in the area now in dispute, he did not appear to view his actions as an assertion of control or dominion over the area. At best, Myers\u2019 actions toward the property in dispute indicate use or \u201cactual possession\u201d of the property in question but nothing more. When he decided to sell 341, Myers commissioned a survey of the property. The survey shows the property line and area in dispute. Myers included the survey with the documents he provided to all prospective buyers including [appellant]. Contrary to the testimony of [appellant], Myers said that he showed a copy of the survey to [appellant] when he was selling 341 to her.<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Myers\u2019 testimony is clear that he and the Cooks were friendly throughout the years they were neighbors. There is no evidence in the record that there was any adversity or hostility between them. Although no ill-will is required, there must be some proof. Myers believed when the wall was built, and then rebuilt, that it was on his property. There is no evidence that his use of the area was \u201cexclusive.\u201d The neighbors were friendly, and cooperative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[Appellant] argues that when Myers\u2019 ownership is added to her ownership, she has met the 20 year requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Myers owned his property for 19 years and 7 months. But during the last few months of his ownership, [appellees] acquired 339 Worton and used the boat ramp. Myers did not testify he gave them permission; and, [appellees] testified they never asked. The pages from Myers\u2019 desposition transcript cited by [appellant] for the proposition that Myers \u201cgranted permission\u201d to [appellees] do not make that statement. <em>[Appellees\u2019] use of the area in dispute destroys the claimed 20 years period required for [appellant] to establish her adverse possession claim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">The Court was not persuaded that the fact that [appellees] did not move into their residence at 339 full-time until the year after purchase helps [appellant\u2019s] claim. The testimony was uncontradicted that [appellees] made frequent visits to 339 Worton for recreation, boating and supervision of the demolition and construction. Further, there was persuasive testimony that [appellee] Ann Collins used the boat ramp before and after residing at 339 Worton. Use of the boat ramp without seeking permission by [appellee] was the equivalent of asserting an ownership interest or dominion over the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">In sum, the Court was not persuaded that [appellant] met her burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to establish adverse possession of the area in dispute. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The issue here is whether the court erred in concluding that appellant did not acquire title to the disputed area by adverse possession.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court recently discussed the doctrine of adverse possession in <em>Yourik v. Mallonee, </em>174 Md. App. 415, 422, 921 A.2d 869 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cAdverse possession is a method whereby a person who was not the owner of property obtains a valid title to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>property by the passage of time.\u201d <em>Md. Civ. Pattern Jury Instr. </em>2:1 (MPJI-Civ.). \u201cA number of policy justifications for the doctrine of adverse possession have been advanced.\u201d Herbert T. Tiffany &amp; Basil Jones, <em>Tiffany Real Property, </em>Neighbor \u00a7 6:2 (1975, through Sept. 2006) (hereafter cited as <em>\u201cTiffany\u201d). </em>Most commonly, \u201ccourts justify the existence and application of adverse possession\u201d for one or more of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">First, there is a societal interest in \u201cquieting\u201d title to property by cutting off old claims. Second, there is a desire to punish true owners of land who neglect to assert their proprietary rights. Third, there is a need to protect the reliance interests of either the adverse possessor or others dealing with the adverse possessor that are justifiably based on the <em>status quo. </em>Last, an efficiency rationale, asserting a goal of promoting land development, seeks to reward those who will use land and cause it to be productive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The elements of adverse possession are well settled: \u201c \u2018To establish title by adverse possession, the claimant must show possession of the claimed property for the statutory period of 20 years.... Such possession must be actual, open, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>notorious, exclusive, hostile, under claim of title or ownership, and continuous or uninterrupted.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Pines Cmty. Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 13, 36, 939 A.2d 165 (2008) (citation omitted); <em>see also, e.g., E. Wash. Ry. v. Brooke, </em>244 Md. 287, 294, 223 A.2d 599 (1966); <em>Bishop v.

Staubitz, </em>300 Md. 60, 67, 475 A.2d 1185 (1984); <em>see Hungerford v. Hungerford, </em>234 Md. 338, 340, 199 A.2d 209 (1964); <em>Porter v.

We have said: \u201cIn evaluating a claim, the pertinent inquiry is whether the claimant has proved the elements \u2018based on the claimant\u2019s \u201cobjective manifestation\u201d of adverse use, rather than on the claimant\u2019s subjective intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter, </em>126 Md.App. at 276, 728 A.2d 755 (quoting <em>Barchowsky v. Silver Farms, Inc., </em>105 Md.App. 228, 241, 659 A.2d 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 301, 666 A.2d 1236 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Broadly, the elements of adverse possession can be placed in three groups: possession must be (1) actual, open and notorious, and exclusive; (2) continuous or uninterrupted for the requisite period; and (3) hostile, under claim of title or ownership.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We shall address these three categories of elements, <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The first group of elements concerns the requirement that possession be actual, open and notorious, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>exclusive. For the purpose of this case, all of these elements essentially collapse into the requirement of actual use. The element of \u201copen and notorious\u201d pertains to the concept of constructive notice to the title owner. Possession \u201cmust be visible and notorious, so that the owner may be presumed to have notice of it.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Mason, </em>30 Md. 409, 414 (1869). However, actual notice to the owner is not required. \u201cPossessory acts of dominion over land may be sufficient to charge the record owner with knowledge that the land is adversely possessed.\u201d <em>Miceli v. Foley, </em>83 Md.App. 541, 561, 575 A.2d 1249 (1990) (citing <em>Blickenstaff v. Bromley, </em>243 Md. 164, 220 A.2d 558 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u201cExclusive possession means that the claimant must possess the land as his own and not for another.\u201d <em>Orfanos Contractors, Inc. v.

But, \u201cthe character, location, and use of lands vary, and the type of possessory acts necessary to constitute actual possession in one case may not be essential in another.\u201d <em>Blickenstaff, </em>243 Md. at 171, 220 A.2d 558. Therefore, \u201cthe court must consider the character and location of the land and the uses and purposes for which the land is naturally adapted.\u201d <em>Orfanos Contractors, </em>85 Md.App. at 129, 582 A.2d 547; <em>see also Goen v.

As we said in <em>Porter, </em>126 Md.App. at 277, 728 A.2d 755, \u201cacts sufficient to demonstrate possession of wild, undeveloped forest may fall short of the activity needed to establish possession of developed property.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Blickenstaff, </em>243 Md. at 171, 220 A.2d 558, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">\u201cIt is sufficient if the acts of ownership are of such a character as to openly and publicly indicate an assumed control or use such as is consistent with the character of the premises in question. The standard to be applied to any particular tract of land is whether the possession comports with the ordinary management of similar lands by their owners, and if so, it furnishes satisfactory evidence of adverse possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">(Quoting 3 Am.Jur.2d, Adverse Possession, \u00a7 14); <em>accord Mauck v. Bailey, </em>247 Md. 434, 441, 231 A.2d 685 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Appellant suggests that the circuit court \u201cconceded that Mr. Myers was in \u2018actual possession\u2019 of the disputed property.\u201d She claims that her maintenance and improvement of the disputed area was \u201cequivalent\u201d to that of the Myers, and contends that the circuit court \u201cinexplicably concluded that such actions \u2018were not, in the Court\u2019s view, sufficient evidence of control to deprive [appellees] of their property.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">According to appellant, the Myers maintained the property up to the Wall (i.e., on land titled at the time to the Cooks); constructed the boat ramp; and maintained the waterfront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>north of the ramp by installing the wooden bulkhead. She asserts that she \u201cexercised further control over the disputed property,\u201d which belonged to the Cooks, \u201cby erecting a ... privacy fence along the existing Wall, improving the boat ramp with a gate, [and] maintaining the boat ram p.... \u201d In her view, the actions that she and the Myers took with respect to the disputed area are \u201cnearly identical\u201d to those in <em>Blickenstaff </em>which, according to the Court of Appeals, constituted actual possession. Moreover, she maintains that the court\u2019s \u201ccurious observation that Appellant\u2019s action[s] were undertaken in her best interest is of no consequence in this regard, as the actions of <em>any </em>possessor of land are generally exercised in furtherance of the possessor\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Appellees dispute appellant\u2019s characterization of the circuit court\u2019s decision, commenting: \u201cAppellant\u2019s brief reads as though the trial court had found that but for the reentry on the land by Appellees, Appellant\u2019s predecessor in title would have perfected an adverse possession claim.\u201d They assert: \u201cAs a matter of fact, what the trial judge concluded ... is that \u2018At best, Myers\u2019 actions toward the property in dispute indicate use or \u201cactual possession\u201d of the property but nothing more.\u2019 \u201d However, appellees do not pursue the point, insisting instead that \u201cwhether Mr. Myers\u2019 possession of the 291 square feet was adverse is immaterial to an adverse possession analysis here because the requisite 20 years period was interrupted\u201d when appellees reentered the land after their purchase. Appellees also concede that appellant has had actual possession at least since she constructed the \u201cprivacy fence\u201d running along the Wall. They recognize that this \u201ceffectively ousts [appellees] from exercising dominion over that portion of their titled real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In our view, the circuit court seemed to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Myers had actual possession of the disputed area. The court found the following facts as to the Myers: \u201cMyers installed a boat ramp which sat on both properties. In addition, Myers had a bulkhead installed across the waterfront of 341 to the boat ramp. Myers maintained the property on the 341 side of the wall, including the boat ramp.\u201d As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>appellant, the court found that she \u201cadded a gate to the boat ramp to prevent her dogs from going into the water on the ramp,\u201d and that, \u201c[f]rom the time she acquired 341 in November 2000, [appellant] maintained the boat ramp and the property on her side of the wall.\u201d The court discounted these findings, however, reasoning that appellees, \u201cwho also have dogs, did not object to the addition of the gate,\u201d and that \u201c[m]ost of the boat ramp is on [appellant\u2019s] property; maintaining the boat ramp is clearly in her best interest. Neglecting to maintain one side of it, the small portion which is on [appellees\u2019] property, could result in collapse or other failure of the ramp.\u201d The court concluded that none of appellant\u2019s maintenance activities were \u201csufficient evidence of control to deprive [appellees] of their property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We disagree. In our view, appellant\u2019s maintenance of the disputed area and the boat ramp was a paradigmatic example of the type of use that the cases have recognized as establishing actual possession. Both the Myers and appellant engaged in a course of use, maintenance, upkeep, and improvement upon the disputed area that was consistent with the \u201c \u2018ordinary management\u2019 \u201d that one would expect the owner of such land to undertake. <em>BlicJcenstaff, </em>243 Md. at 171, 220 A.2d 558 (citation omitted). Both the Myers and appellant engaged in basic yard work and maintenance over the disputed area. Mr. Myers constructed the boat ramp in its entirety, and constructed the wooden bulkhead along the north side of the boat ramp, entirely within the disputed area, to prevent erosion of the land. After appellant purchased the property from the Myers, she constructed a privacy fence bordering the disputed area and a gate to prevent her dogs from using the boat ramp to enter the creek. She also repaired and extended the boat ramp by pouring additional concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">In <em>Blickenstaff, </em>243 Md. 164, 220 A.2d 558, upon which appellant relies, the land in issue was a \u201csmall parcel\u201d of \u201cscrubby, brush land\u201d adjacent to a farm. <em>Id. </em>at 166-69, 220 A.2d 558. The Blickenstaffs, who claimed title by adverse possession, \u201cclear[ed] brush ... cut[ ] bean poles ... fell[ed] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>large trees ... and ... plant[ed] and maintained a] flower bed\u201d on that property. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 220 A.2d 558. The circuit court did not find that they were entitled to the disputed land, based on adverse possession. The Court of Appeals reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 220 A.2d 558. Noting that \u201cthere was never an assertion of ownership of the subject parcel by [title] owners,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 172, 220 A.2d 558, the Court concluded that the acts of the adverse possessors, \u201cwhen the character and location of the small parcel are considered, were sufficient to comport with the ordinary management of similar lands by owners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, it reversed the circuit court and held that the Blickenstaffs satisfied all the elements to obtain title by adverse possession. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 220 A.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Miceli v. Foley, supra, </em>83 Md.App. 541, 575 A.2d 1249, also provides guidance. In that case, a landowner sued neighboring landowners who allegedly trespassed on the southwestern and northwestern boundaries of his property. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 575 A.2d 1249. The circuit court found that each of the neighbors had adversely possessed the respective land in dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 575 A.2d 1249. As to the southwestern neighbor, the Court observed that the adverse possessor \u201cconsistently maintained and mowed the parcel up to the fence line,\u201d and \u201cused the land to gather firewood and as a playground for [his] children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 575 A.2d 1249. \u201cFurther,\u201d we said, \u201cno evidence was produced that such uses are inconsistent with the nature of the residential property or with other uses in the neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s finding that the adverse possessor \u201cassumed the requisite dominion and control over the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court also upheld the finding of actual possession with respect to the northwestern neighbors, who \u201cadded to the planting on the [disputed property] with ground cover and perennial flowers. They also maintained the greenery. The grass was mown, leaves raked, and plants pruned. Brambles and poison ivy were sprayed to prevent their encroachment onto the back yard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 575 A.2d 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In contrast, we upheld a finding that a putative adverse possessor did not have actual possession in <em>Barchowsky, su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>pra, </em>105 McLApp. 228, 659 A.2d 347. There, the possessor made only \u201coccasional use of the lane ... for walking, horseback riding by her daughter, or picking up branches and chasing off trespassers....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, 659 A.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Peters v. Staubitz, </em>64 Md.App. 639, 498 A.2d 661 (1985), is particularly persuasive, given its factual similarity to the case at bar. In that case, as here, a fence between two waterfront properties did not track the property line, leaving a small sliver of Peters\u2019s waterfront property on Staubitz\u2019s side of the fence. <em>Id. </em>at 641, 498 A.2d 661. Staubitz\u2019s use of the disputed land included construction of a \u201cbulkhead\u201d and a wooden \u201cboat landing\u201d at the river that bounded the land, as well as planting of trees and construction of a boathouse and fire pit. <em>Id. </em>at 645-46, 498 A.2d 661. We commented that \u201c[t]he evidence amply supports\u201d the court\u2019s finding that Staubitz actually possessed the portion of the disputed land containing these features. <em>Id. </em>at 646, 498 A.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We find no support in any of our cases for the principle apparently adopted by the circuit court, i.e., that an adverse claimant\u2019s possessory acts might lose their possessory character if the acts also benefit the adjacent lands that the adverse claimant holds by title. The circuit court cited no authority for this proposition, nor do appellees. It would be a difficult rule to apply, particularly in cases such as this, in which adverse possession arises from a misplaced wall or fence, such that the disputed land and the land held by title are contiguous and are part of the same enclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Indeed, the case law tends to support the opposite view: When an adverse claimant has used the disputed land in the same manner as adjacent land she owns by title, such acts are, if anything, <em>further </em>evidence of actual possession. For instance, in <em>East Washington Railway, supra, </em>244 Md. at 295, 223 A.2d 599, the Court of Appeals said that \u201c[t]he evidence clearly indicated that plaintiff\u2019 adversely possessed a strip of disputed property, because she had \u201clived on and farmed the property which included the strip of land in question for more than twenty years,\u201d and \u201c[t]he strip was enclosed into the rest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>of the farm by a fence which was continuously maintained ... [and][t]he strip was used as a part of the farm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Similarly, in <em>Miklasz v. G.W. Stone, Inc., </em>60 Md.App. 438, 483 A.2d 382 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 570, 489 A.2d 1129 (1985), the Court found it \u201cdifficult to envision a more complete appropriation of or possessory dominion over disputed land,\u201d where the adverse claimant had performed a variety of possessory acts, including \u201cfilling] in a swamp that covered approximately one acre of land, plant[ing] grass and shrubs in the area which was used for recreational purposes ... [and tearing] down two dilapidated small dwellings....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 483 A.2d 382. \u201cWith respect to the filling and maintenance of the swamp area,\u201d the trial court had said that the adverse claimant\u2019s intent was \u201c\u2018to protect their property....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[w]ith reference to the buildings which [the claimant] tore down,\u201d the trial court had said that \u201c \u2018they did that on their own as a gratuitous act, not with the intent of obtaining title by adverse possession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected the reasoning of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In contrast, in <em>Goen v. Sansbury, supra, </em>219 Md. 289, 149 A.2d 17, the Court determined that \u201cthere were no acts of ownership for years after 1925,\u201d over a disputed area adjacent to land that the adverse claimants held by title. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 149 A.2d 17. In that case, the Court recognized that \u201cfrom 1925 to ... 1954, none of the [adverse claimants] even went on the disputed area, and there [was] no doubt that after 1925 it grew up in brush and that it was a completely wooded area at the time of the trial and had been for many years before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295,149 A.2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that both the Myers and appellant had actual, open, notorious, and exclusive use of the disputed land in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We next address the requirement of continuity. As noted, under C.J. \u00a7 5-103, an adverse claimant must possess the land continuously for the statutory period of twenty years. In this context, we first attend to the issue of tacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>When, as here, no single adverse possessor has held the property in question for the statutory twenty-year period, the court must consider whether successive periods of adverse possession may be tacked together to meet the requisite duration. Tacking will only be permitted where there is privity of estate between the successive adverse possessors. The Court explained in <em>Gore v. Hall, supra, </em>206 Md. at 491, 112 A.2d 675:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">It is unquestionable that where different persons enter upon land in succession without any privity of estate, the last possessor is not allowed to tack the possession of his predecessors to his own, so as to make out a continuity of possession sufficient to bar the entry of the owner. The reason for this rule is that the possession of the one is not that of the other, because the moment the first occupant quits possession, the constructive possession of the owner is restored, and the entry of the next occupant constitutes him a new disseisor. On the other hand, where there is privity of estate between the successive parties in possession, the possession of such parties may be tacked so as to make the twenty years required by the Statute of Limitations. The law is clear that such privity may be created by a sale and conveyance and possession under it as well as by descent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Moreover, even where privity exists between successive possessors, it must be privity of estate <em>in the adversely possessed land. </em>Thus, \u201c[generally the rule is \u2018that possession cannot be tacked to make out title by prescription where the deed by which the last occupant claims title does not include the land in dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Pines Cmty. Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>173 Md.App. 13, 48-49, 917 A.2d 1129 (2007) (quoting <em>Louis Sachs &amp; Sons v.

Scheben, </em>233 Ky. 139, 25 S.W.2d 57 (1930), which, like the instant case, involved a dispute over \u201ca small triangular parcel of land.\u201d <em>Freed, </em>246 Md. at 302, 228 A.2d 421. The <em>Freed </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201cThe testimony shows that the fence now maintained has been there for more than 15 years and that it replaced a rail fence maintained on substantially the same location for forty years. The transfer of possession of a strip of land occupied by the grantor, although without title, which is inclosed with and used as part of the land described in the deed, is not affected by its omission from the description in the deed. In such cases the possession of the grantor and that of the grantee is continuous, and there is such privity of contract between them that the period of possession by each must be added in ascertaining the total period of adverse possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\"><em>Freed, </em>246 Md. at 302, 228 A.2d 421 (quoting <em>Howind, </em>25 S.W.2d at 58).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In this case, the Myers, appellant\u2019s predecessors in title to the Senez Property, held title for nineteen years and seven months \u2014 -just shy of twenty years. Given that the Wall enclosed the disputed area within the Senez Property, and from the facts adduced at trial, we are satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>possession of the Myers, followed by the possession of appellant, satisfied the standards for tacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The question remains whether the Myers\u2019 and appellant\u2019s possession of the Senez Property was <em>continuous </em>for the requisite twenty-year period. Of import here, \u201c[t]he running of the statutory period may be interrupted by the owner\u2019s entry on the land.\u201d <em>Miceli, </em>88 Md.App. at 556, 575 A.2d 1249. This Court addressed the subject of reentry by a landowner extensively in <em>Rosencrantz, supra, </em>28 Md.App. 379, 346 A.2d 237. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cAll the authorities agree that an entry, to have [the] effect [of interrupting the statutory period], must be an actual entry upon some part of the land within the period of limitations, and must evince that it is made with the clear and unequivocal intent to invade and challenge the right of the holder of the adverse possession and to retake possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">... \u201c[T]he running of the statute is interrupted by the owner\u2019s entry on the land, if, and only if, this is made openly and under claim of right, with a clearly indicated purpose of taking possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">... \u201cA mere physical entry by the owner is not enough, for, in order to defeat another\u2019s adverse possession, the owner\u2019s entry must clearly indicate to the occupant that his possession is invalid and his right challenged. It must be open and notorious and bear on its face an unequivocal intention to take possession, and must be made under such circumstances that, by the use of reasonable diligence, the occupant may ascertain the right and claim of the entrant. The entry, it has been declared, must equal in dignity and character that required to initiate an adverse possession, that is, it cannot be accidental, casual, secret, or permissive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cIn all cases, however, the intent, as expressed, or evidenced by acts of ownership, is that which governs the effect of the entry. The mere act of going upon the land is not enough. The owner must assert his claim to the land or perform some act that would reinstate him in possession, before he can regain what he has lost. The conduct claimed by an owner to work an interruption of adverse possession must be such as would put an ordinary prudent person on notice that he actually has been ousted. Not every act by the owner on the land interrupts actual adverse possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 388-90, 346 A.2d 237 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In this case, appellant describes the continuity of possession as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">During his 19 years, 7 months of residence, Mr. Myers believed the disputed property to be his and exercised dominion and control over that property such that his possession was actual and exclusive, without recognition of any other person as a record owner.... Upon the transfer of title to 341 to Appellant, Appellant immediately asserted her ownership of the disputed property by building a 48\" privacy fence along the existing Wall, the construction of which was not contested by Appellees. In or about July 2001, 20 years, 3 months after Mr. Myers took title to 341 and began the adverse possession of the disputed property, Appellees took up residence at 339. They subsequently made no assertion of ownership of the disputed property, including the boat ramp, despite Appellant\u2019s improving the boat ramp and installing a gate thereon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Appellees vigorously dispute appellant\u2019s characterization of the facts. Indeed, they stake virtually their entire appellate argument on the proposition that, \u201cduring the period of Myers\u2019 ownership of 341 Worton Road, Appellees had entered on the land ... sufficient that, \u2018by using their property, [Appellees] were in possession of their property.\u2019 \u201d Appellees assert: \u201cWhether Appellees entered on the land and did so in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>a sufficient manner to destroy Myers\u2019 assumed adverse possession of the disputed parcel will be the central question to be addressed as the Court considers the matter at bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Appellees reject appellant\u2019s \u201ccontention that because Appellees did not take up permanent residence at 339 Worton Road until after their house was finished (perhaps July or August of 2001), they could not have asserted dominion until that time or shortly thereafter.\u201d They rely on the circuit court\u2019s finding that appellees</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">made frequent visits to 339 Worton for recreation, boating and supervision of demolition and construction. Further, there was persuasive testimony that [appellee] Ann Collins used the boat ramp before and after residing at 339 Worton. Use of the boat ramp without seeking permission by [appellant] was the equivalent of asserting an ownership interest or dominion over the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Further, appellees cite Ms. Collins\u2019s testimony that \u201cwhen Mr. Myers was there it was much easier, we just jumped over the wall. We used it as a launch for our swimming. We had a canoe or, at least, some people brought a canoe out of the water all the time, the children, my friends, Shirley, we went swimming there.\u201d Moreover, they consider it significant that, according to Ms. Collins, appellees never asked permission of Mr. Myers, nor did Mr. Myers attempt to exclude them.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In addition, appellees rely on <em>Miceli, supra, </em>83 Md.App. 541, 575 A.2d 1249. They quote it for the proposition that \u201ca court will consider the character of the land and the purposes to which it is adapted\u201d in determining \u201cwhether a particular use is sufficient to constitute dominion over the land....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556, 575 A.2d 1249. Appellees ask, rhetorically: \u201cIndeed, what could be more an assertion of dominion over a boat ramp than to openly launch a boat from it, swim from it, feed geese from it, and invite friends and family to do so as well?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Av5\">The circuit court agreed \"with appellees. It was of the view that, \u201c[a]t the time [appellant] purchased her property, [appellees] had already used the boat ramp to launch canoes and to feed ducks. Thus, by using their property, [appellees] were in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>possession of their property.\u201d Moreover, the court found that the Cooks used the boat ramp and, as a result, it did not \u201cinfer that Mr. and Mrs. Myers\u2019 possession of 341 and use of the property in dispute was adverse to the Cooks.\u201d The court concluded that appellees\u2019 \u201cuse of the area in dispute destroys the claimed 20 years period required for [appellant] to establish her adverse possession claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As we see it, the circuit court misapplied the relevant law. As we have noted, \u201c \u2018[t]he mere act of going upon the land is not enough. The owner must assert his claim to the land or perform some act that would reinstate him in possession, before he can regain what he has lost.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosencrantz, </em>28 Md.App. at 390, 346 A.2d 237 (citation omitted). Thus, it was incorrect for the circuit court to conclude that any use of the property was equivalent to possession. Instead, \u201cthe owner\u2019s entry must clearly indicate to the occupant that his possession is invalid and his right challenged.... The entry, it has been declared, must equal in dignity and character that required to initiate an adverse possession....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 346 A.2d 237.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Appellees\u2019 actions of reentry did not rise to the level contemplated by the case law. In order to retake possession, an owner must engage in \u201c[p]ossessory acts of dominion over [the] land.... \u201d <em>Miceli, </em>83 Md.App. at 561, 575 A.2d 1249. As noted, \u201c \u2018[t]he standard to be applied to any particular tract of land is whether the possession comports with the ordinary management of similar lands by their owners ....\u2019\u201d <em>Blickenstaff, </em>243 Md. at 171, 220 A.2d 558 (citation omitted). Appellees\u2019 recreational use of the boat ramp has none of the characteristics of maintenance, upkeep, and improvement of land that Maryland courts have recognized as evincing possession. Rather, appellees\u2019 use of the boat ramp was more akin to the occasional, recreational horseback riding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that was held to be insufficient to establish possession in <em>Barchowsky, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 241, 659 A.2d 347. Moreover, appellees\u2019 conduct was unaccompanied by any clear indication of a purpose to retake the land. They did not interrupt the running of the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Our conclusion accords with decisions from other jurisdictions. In <em>Otto v. Cornell, </em>119 Wis.2d 4, 349 N.W.2d 703 (1984), as in this case, the parties were next door neighbors. For many years, <em>Otto </em>\u201cmaintained a fence on what he believed was the southern boundary of his lot and the northern boundary\u201d of the Cornells\u2019 property. <em>Id. </em>at 705. He later removed the fence and replaced it with \u201cfour maple trees to mark the boundary,\u201d and thereafter maintained his property up to the trees for well over twenty years. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the Cornells discovered that the property line lay \u201cbetween .7 feet and 7.2 feet north of the line on which Otto had planted the trees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Wisconsin appellate court upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that Otto had acquired the disputed area by adverse possession, despite the Cornells\u2019 alleged reentries on the land. <em>Id. </em>at 706. The Wisconsin court said, <em>id. </em>(emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS8\">The Cornells made no notorious reentry to dispossess Otto until after his adverse possession had been established.... <em>The trial court may ... have considered the Cornells\u2019 alleged activities, such as raking leaves and their children playing on the disputed strip, to be casual reentries. </em>It was not necessary for Otto to treat the disputed property more protectively than he treated [his own lot] to satisfy the requirement of exclusivity. He was not required to be belligerent if his neighbors happened to step across a particular line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"><em>Lilly v. Lynch, </em>88 Wash.App. 306, 945 P.2d 727 (1997), presents a factual situation akin to the case at bar. It involved a dispute between adjoining landowners over ownership of a boat ramp that straddled the property line. <em>Id. </em>at 729. The <em>Lilly </em>court reviewed earlier Washington cases, including <em>Frolund v. Frankland, </em>71 Wash.2d 812, 431 P.2d 188 (1967), <em>overruled on other grounds by Chaplin v. Sanders, </em>100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Wash.2d 853, 676 P.2d 431 (1984). In <em>Frolund, </em>another factually similar case, the Washington Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdA\">\u201c[T]he evidence reveals that the children of the parties, as well as those of other neighbors, played about and over the various neighborhood beach areas with no more than the usual parental approval and restraint, and that the parties themselves occasionally, socially, and casually visited back and forth, and sometimes assisted one another in the performance of various work projects, e.g., beaching the swimming raft for winter storage. Such conduct, under the circumstances, denotes neighborliness and friendship. It does not amount to a subordination of defendants\u2019 adverse claim to the disputed wedge----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><em>Lilly, </em>945 P.2d at 732 (quoting <em>Frolund, </em>431 P.2d at 192; <em>Lilly\u2019s </em>emphasis omitted). As to the case before it, the <em>Lilly </em>Court recognized that \u201c[ujncontroverted evidence shows that [the title owner of the disputed area] regularly used the ramp____\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>945 P.2d at 733. But, the court concluded that this usage did not interrupt the adverse claimant\u2019s possession, reasoning that \u201cit is likely a true owner would have allowed a friendly neighbor to use the ramp regularly without asking permission each and every time. As in <em>Frolund, </em>it is possible that this was the kind of use commonly allowed in the area, \u2018a neighborly accommodation\u2019 rather than \u2018shared occupancy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Finally, we come to the third group of elements: Possession must be hostile, under claim of title or ownership. \u201cHostile\u201d is a term of art in the law of adverse possession. As we recently explained in <em>Yourik, supra, </em>174 Md.App. at 429, 921 A.2d 869:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">Maryland courts have long recognized that the hostility necessary to make an occupancy or use adverse \u201cdoes not necessarily import enmity or ill will.\u201d <em>See Hungerford, </em>234 Md. at 340, 199 A.2d 209.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">Rather, the term \u201chostile\u201d signifies a possession that is adverse in the sense of it being \u201cwithout license or permission,\u201d and \u201cunaccompanied by any recognition of ... the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>real owner\u2019s right to the land.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing 4 <em>Tiffany, supra, </em>\u00a7 1142); <em>Mavromoustakos v. Padussis, </em>112 Md.App. 59, 65, 684 A.2d 51 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 718, 690 A.2d 524 (1997). The type of \u201crecognition of right\u201d that destroys hostility is not mere acknowledgment or awareness that another claim of title to the property exists, but rather, <em>acceptance </em>that another has a <em>valid right </em>to the property, and the occupant possesses subordinately to that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>See also Blickenstaff, </em>243 Md. at 174, 220 A.2d 558; <em>White, </em>173 Md.App. at 49, 917 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">As noted, a claimant has the burden to prove title by adverse possession. <em>Costello, </em>300 Md. at 67, 475 A.2d 1185. But, once a claimant has made a satisfactory showing as to open, continuous use for the statutory period, \u201c[t]he burden then shifts to the landowner to show that the use was permissive.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Hook, </em>347 Md. 380, 392, 701 A.2d 397 (1997); <em>see White, </em>173 Md.App. at 49, 917 A.2d 1129; <em>Washington Land Co. v. Potomac Ridge Development Corp., </em>137 Md.App. 33, 58, 767 A.2d 891, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Hagerstown v. Wash. Land Co., </em>364 Md. 462, 773 A.2d 514 (2001). In <em>Yourik, </em>174 Md.App. at 428-29, 921 A.2d 869, we said: \u201cIn establishing the hostility of a particular use, a showing that the use has been made \u2018 \u201copenly, continuously, and without explanation for twenty years,\u201d\u2019 justifies a presumption that such use was adverse.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Moreover, in cases such as this, the existence of a visible boundary such as the Wall may be some evidence of adverse possession. The Court explained in <em>Rogers v. Burnopp, </em>263 Md. 357, 363, 283 A.2d 367 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201c[W]here the visible boundaries have existed for the period set forth in the Statute of Limitations, title will vest in the adverse possessor where there is evidence of unequivocal acts of ownership.... [I]t is immaterial that the holder supposed the visible boundary to be correct or, in other words, the fact that the possession was due to inadvertence, ignorance or mistake is entirely immaterial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(Quoting <em>Tamburo v. Miller, </em>203 Md. 329, 336, 100 A.2d 818 (1953)); <em>see Mauck, </em>247 Md. at 441-42, 231 A.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In <em>Costello v. Staubitz, supra, </em>300 Md. 60, 475 A.2d 1185, the Court established general principles that a court must use in determining the evidentiary value of a \u201cvisible line of demarcation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">1) The existence of a visible line of demarcation ordinarily does not constitute evidence of adverse possession when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">a) it was created by a record owner, for the record owner\u2019s own purposes, within the record owner\u2019s land; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atr\">b) it was created by a party claiming title by adverse possession for the purpose of claiming the visible line of demarcation as a boundary only if it is in fact coincident with the actual boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">2) The existence of a visible line of demarcation ordinarily constitutes some evidence of adverse possession when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">a) it was created by a party claiming title by adverse possession for the purpose of claiming the visible line of demarcation as a visible boundary delineating the extent of the claimed adverse possession; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">b) there is no evidence to show by whom and for what purpose the line of demarcation was created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 73, 475 A.2d 1185 (internal citations omitted). And, as we have seen, \u201c[i]n evaluating [an adverse possession] claim, the pertinent inquiry is whether the claimant has proved the elements \u2018based on the claimant\u2019s \u201cobjective manifestation\u201d of adverse use, rather than on the claimant\u2019s subjective intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter, </em>126 Md.App. at 276, 728 A.2d 755 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe evidence offered in this case proves that neither Appellant nor her predecessor in title ever acknowledged that Appellees or their predecessors in title were record owners of the disputed property.\u201d Noting the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]here is no evidence in the record that there was any adversity or hostility\u201d between the parties\u2019 respective predecessors in title, appellant maintains that the meaning of \u201chostile\u201d in the adverse possession context \u201cfocuses upon the adverse possessor\u2019s treatment toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>land\u201d </em>and insists that this meaning \u201cis contrary to [the circuit court\u2019s] erroneous focus on the cordial relationship between Mr. Cook and Mr. Myers.\u201d Indeed, appellees do not even address the issue of hostility in their brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">Myers\u2019 testimony is clear that he and the Cooks were friendly throughout the years they were neighbors. There is no evidence in the record that there was any adversity or hostility between them. Although no ill-will is required, there must be some proof. Myers believed when the wall was built, and then rebuilt, that it was on his property.... The neighbors were friendly, and cooperative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The court\u2019s equation of \u201cfriendly,\u201d \u201ccooperative\u201d relations between the neighbors as evidence against hostility constitutes legal error as to the element of hostility. Moreover, the court\u2019s statement that \u201cthere must be some proof\u2019 suggests that the court misconceived the applicable burden, which had shifted to appellees to demonstrate that either the Myers\u2019 or appellant\u2019s use was merely permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Furthermore, this case falls into category \u201c2(b)\u201d in the <em>Costello </em>criteria: There was no evidence as to who originally constructed the Wall, or for what purpose. The Wall was already in place when the Myers took possession of their property. Thus, the existence of the Wall itself was some evidence of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">There was scant evidence in the record from which the court could have concluded that the use by appellant and Myers was <em>not </em>hostile to the owners of the Collins Property. In his deposition testimony, Mr. Myers described his use of the disputed area, by which he treated it as his own, maintaining and improving it, and giving permissive use of it to neighbors. In the main, appellant\u2019s conduct was equally indicative of possession hostile to appellees. But, there was testimony that, if believed, could be indicative of non-hostile possession: the disputed testimony of Ms. Collins, who testified that appellant asked her, before she built the privacy fence, \u201ccan my fence follow the wall instead of the property line?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>As we have seen, appellant denied asking this question,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the court made no findings of fact to resolve whose version of the exchange was accurate. Nevertheless, it is undisputed that appellant subsequently proceeded to build the fence along the Wall, without permission from appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">To be sure, appellant\u2019s construction of the fence was a hostile, non-permissive use of the disputed area. But, given the fact-intensive nature of an adverse possession claim, findings of fact on the issue of whether appellant sought appellees\u2019 permission are important to the determination of whether appellant\u2019s possession was hostile. We elaborate.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Writing for this Court in <em>Yourik v. Mallonee, supra, </em>174 Md.App. 415, 921 A.2d 869, Judge Adkins exhaustively addressed the meaning of the hostility requirement. As the <em>Yourik </em>Court explained, the requirement of hostility may be proved by showing, in the words of R.P. \u00a7 14-108(a), that possession was either \u201cunder color of title\u201d or \u201cunder claim of right.\u201d There is no \u201c \u2018hostile\u2019 circumstance that could not be adequately characterized by one of these two terms.\u201d <em>Yourik, </em>174 Md.App. at 427, 921 A.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">As to the first term, \u201c \u2018[c]olor of title is that which in appearance is title, but which in reality is not good and sufficient title.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 921 A.2d 869 (citation omitted). \u201cUnder color of title\u201d describes a situation in which a claimant bases a claim to land on an instrument that appears to give title \u2014 an instrument that, while actually defective in some manner, is \u201c <em>\u2018prima fade </em>good in appearance [so] as to be consistent with the idea of good faith on the party entering under it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The case at bar does not concern a claim under color of title, and neither did <em>Yourik. </em>Rather, the bulk of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>discussion in <em>Yourik </em>was devoted to answering \u201cwhether one who acknowledges that another holds a recorded deed to the disputed property may establish the requisite hostility \u2018under claim of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 921 A.2d 869. Such an occupancy falls into the category of a \u201cclaim of right,\u201d which means \u201cthat the occupancy rests on the claimant\u2019s demonstrated \u2018intention to appropriate and hold the land as owner, and to the exclusion, rightfully or wrongfully, of every one else.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428, 921 A.2d 869 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In this regard, the <em>Yourik </em>Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 428-30, 921 A.2d 869 (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">In establishing the hostility of a particular use, a showing that the use has been made \u201c \u2018openly, continuously, and without explanation for twenty years,\u2019 \u201d justifies a presumption that such use was adverse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">[T]he term \u201chostile\u201d signifies a possession that is adverse in the sense of it being \u201cwithout license or permission,\u201d and \u201cunaccompanied by an recognition of ... the real owner\u2019s right to the land.\u201d <em>See Hungerford v. Hungerford, </em>234 Md. 338, 340, 199 A.2d 209 (1964) (citing 4 Herbert T. Tiffany &amp; Basil Jones, Tiffany on Real Property \u00a7 1142 (1975, through Sept. 2006)); <em>Mavromoustakos v. Padussis, </em>112 Md.App. 59, 65, 684 A.2d 51 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 718, 690 A.2d 524 (1997). The type of \u201crecognition of right\u201d that destroys hostility is not mere acknowledgment or awareness that another claim of title to the property exists, but rather <em>acceptance </em>that another has a <em>valid right </em>to the property, and the occupant possesses subordinately to that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The <em>Yourik </em>Court also quoted with approval from the <em>Restatement (First) of Property, </em>stating, 174 Md.App. at 440-41, 921 A.2d 881 (emphasis added and omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cTo be adverse it is not essential that a use ... be made either in the belief or under a claim that it is legally justified. \u25a0 <em>It is, however, necessary that the one making it shall not recognize in those as against whom it is claimed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>to be adverse an authority either to prevent or to permit its continuance. </em>It is the non-recognition of such an authority at the time a use is made which determines whether it is <em>adverse.... A use which is not made in recognition of and in submission to a present authority to prevent it or to permit its continuance is adverse </em>though made in recognition of the wrongfulness of the use and, also, of the legal authority of another to prevent it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In <em>Yourik, </em>the putative adverse possessor was a mother who \u201ctook over\u201d her son\u2019s house after the son moved out of the house and defaulted on the mortgage. <em>Id. </em>at 418, 921 A.2d 869. For well over twenty years, the mother lived in or rented out the home, made mortgage payments until the debt was paid in full, and paid all taxes, utilities, and expenditures for upkeep. <em>Id. </em>Notably, the mother admitted that record title to the house remained in her son\u2019s name. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 921 A.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The <em>Yourik </em>Court rejected the view that the mother\u2019s acknowledgment that her son held record title was fatal to her adverse possession claim. Instead, the determining factor was whether the mother \u201c \u2018recognize[d] in [the son] an authority either to prevent or to permit [the] continuance\u2019 \u201d of her possession. <em>Id. </em>at 430, 921 A.2d 869 (quoting <em>Restatement (First) of Property; </em>emphasis omitted). Judge Adkins explained: \u201cThe dispositive question that [the son] begs by declaring that [his mother\u2019s] acknowledgment equates to such recognition is whether she believed that [her son] could prevent her from occupying [the house], or that it was by [the son\u2019s] authority that she exercised ownership rights there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 921 A.2d 869. The Court noted that \u201cthe trial court found that [the mother\u2019s] occupancy was not permissive, given that [she] did not \u2018ask [the son\u2019s] permission to do anything, because [she] didn\u2019t think [she] had to....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 921 A.2d 869 (quoting trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In this case, Ms. Collins\u2019s account of her conversation with appellant, if believed, may be seen as an acknowledgment by Senez of the Collins\u2019 superior right to the disputed area, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>which would defeat the hostility required for adverse, possession. On the other hand, appellant\u2019s version of the conversation (that she informed appellees but did not seek their permission to locate the fence on the Wall), coupled with her conduct in erecting the fence without appellees\u2019 permission, would not evince such an acknowledgment. Interpretation of the legal effect of such a conversation is contingent on the precise facts of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On the record before us, there is a dispute of fact as to the nature of the conversation between appellant and appellees. Because the circuit court did not resolve the conflict, and instead resolved the question of hostility on a legally erroneous ground, we must vacate the judgment and remand to the circuit for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED.

Appellees' nuisance and invasion of privacy counts were grounded in allegations that, as the neighbors\u2019 relationship deteriorated, appellant placed hostile signage and video cameras on the Senez Property facing the Collins Property. In rulings that appellees do not contest, the court awarded judgment in appellant's favor on these counts. We need not discuss these allegations further, as they are not germane to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">.

Subsequently, appellant voluntarily dismissed National City as a counter-defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. Days before trial, appellees filed an Amended Complaint, which added claims of adverse possession against appellant, relating to a separate portion of land closer to the properties' western boundary at Worton Road, where the Wall again crossed the property line as surveyed, in this instance crossing onto the Senez Property and leaving a sliver of the Senez Property on the Collins side of the Wall. Appellant responded the next day with a Motion to Strike Amended Complaint as untimely. At the outset of trial, the court heard argument on the motion. It subsequently denied the motion to strike, concluding that it was \u201ceasier to resolve this issue.\u201d The court later denied appellees' adverse possession claim. Appellees have not challenged that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. Some of the testimony related to issues that are not contested on appeal.

It is not clear when the ramp was built. Throughout Mr. Myers\u2019s deposition, he often misstated the year of an event.
