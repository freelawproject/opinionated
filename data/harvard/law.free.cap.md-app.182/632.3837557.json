(\u201cOxon Park\u201d), appellees, Rivers sued to recover for injuries he sustained while attempting to flee from a fire in the entryway of the apartment building in which he resided. Appellees owned and operated the building. Because the fire was started by a serial arsonist, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County concluded that appellees were not negligent and granted summary judgment to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">Appellant has noted two appeals in connection with the litigation (No. 516 and No. 1870, September Term, 2007), which have been consolidated for briefing and argument. As to appeal No. 516, appellant presents the following four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u25a0 1. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that there are no genuine disputes as to any material facts and that the Appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">.2. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that there was no duty of care owed to Mr. Rivers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">3. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that Mr. Rivers must prove that Appellees were aware of criminal activity similar to the arson that occurred at Mr. Rivers\u2019 apartment building on June 19, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">4. Did the Trial Court Err in Granting Appellees\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that even if the [appellees] were in violation of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Code, as alleged, Mr. Rivers must prove it was likely the [appellees] could have prevented the arsonist from starting the fire in the entryway by adhering to the fire code?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Appeal No. 1870 pertains to the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to enforce a settlement agreement. In his brief, appellant advises that, \u201c[a]fter further consideration, Mr. Rivers hereby withdraws his request that this Court consider the issues surrounding the enforcement of any settlement.\u201d Appellant has not presented any argument as to the merits of No. 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">For the reasons that follow, as to appeal No. 516, we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings. As to appeal No. 1870, we shall dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 8-504(a)(5) &amp; 8-602(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">In the early morning hours of June 19, 2003, an arsonist set fire to the bottom level of the stairwell in an apartment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>building located at 2619 Southern Avenue in Temple Hills (the \u201cProperty\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Property, originally constructed in the 1940s, was part of Oxon Park Apartments, an apartment complex in Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) that is owned and managed by appellees. Appellant lived on the second floor of the Property, in Apartment 202. At the time of the incident, appellant was getting ready for work and noticed smoke coming into his apartment over and under the door to his unit. When appellant opened the door, he saw thick, black smoke in the hall. He woke his wife, told her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>get dressed, and called 911. Appellant was informed by the dispatcher that the fire had already been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Because smoke was entering the apartment, appellant and his wife decided to escape from the building by way of the building\u2019s only stairwell. Appellant descended the stairs first. When appellant reached the landing, his legs caught fire. He pushed his wife back up the steps and ran outside the building, where he attempted to extinguish the fire on his legs by rolling on the ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to appellant, when the paramedics arrived, about fifteen to twenty minutes later, \u201c[t]hey cut my pants, and when I looked down, you could see the skin rolled up on my legs.... They couldn\u2019t get my tennis shoes off because they melted to my skin.\u201d Appellant sustained severe burns to both legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On December 19, 2005, appellant filed a \u201cComplaint\u201d against Hagner in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, containing a single count of negligence. An \u201cAmended Complaint,\u201d adding Oxon Park as a defendant, was filed on June 16, 2006. Appellant alleged that appellees \u201cfailed to provide or maintain smoke and fire alarms in working order so that [its] tenants would be provided sufficient warning to exit in the event of a fire.\u201d Further, he alleged that, on the date of the fire, \u201cmeans of egress at the Oxon Park Apartment complex were obstructed; the smoke detector in [appellant\u2019s] apartment was missing; [and] fire extinguishers were not available in the corridors.\u201d According to appellant, appellees owed numerous duties, including \u201cmaintaining] ... a safe and unobstructed egress by which tenants would be provided a safe and clear passage from the building in the event of ... a fire\u201d and \u201cobeying] all local, state, and federal regulations and standards concerning the maintenance [and] management ... of the subject premises.\u201d According to appellant, appellees\u2019 breach of these duties was the proximate cause of his injuries, which included \u201csevere and permanent injuries to his body ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>permanent scarring ... medical expenses ... lost income from his employment, and ... pain and discomfort....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFs\">On March 5, 2007, appellees filed a \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment\u201d and a supporting \u201cMemorandum of Fact &amp; Law.\u201d They argued that, based on the undisputed facts, appellees \u201ccannot be held liable for the causes of action asserted by [appellant] because the [arson] was not foreseeable and, therefore, [appellees] owed [appellant] no duty whatsoever to prevent the [arson].\u201d Appellees also contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">In order to impose a duty on a business premises owner, requiring that he protect individuals upon his premises from the intentional criminal acts of third parties, it must be shown that the incident from which the case arises was foreseeable. Proof of foreseeability requires evidence that the defendant knew or should have known that highly similar criminal activity against persons or property had occurred on the premises previously---- [T]he test as to whether a particular event is foreseeable is determined by evidence of prior, similar crimes committed against individuals lawfully on the defendant\u2019s premises, or the premises itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">The determination of whether a particular incident was foreseeable, thereby creating a duty on the part of the defendant, is a question of law for the court. Here, there is absolutely no evidence of any prior incidences of arson occurring in Mr. Rivers\u2019 apartment building, or even in the apartment complex known as the Oxon Park Apartments, from which a court could deem that this fire, started by a serial arsonist, was foreseeable. Furthermore, no similar incidents were cited by [appellant] in his Amended Complaint, or were testified to at any depositions. Therefore, in the absence of proof of any such prior similar incidents, there can be no duty imposed upon [appellees] whereby they should have precluded the occurrence. Accordingly, [appellees] are entitled to summary judgment. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>In his \u201cOpposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d appellant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">[Appellees\u2019] Motion requests judgment be entered as a matter of law in this case because, they claim, there is an absence of proof of any prior similar incidents and, therefore, there can be no duty imposed upon the [appellees] whereby they should have precluded the occurrence.... The basis for their request for judgment is misplaced.... [T]he facts establish a violation of a statute and a prima facie case of negligence. [Appellees\u2019] negligence is based on their violation of the fire code, not any breach of duty to protect against third party actors as alleged by the [appellees] ----When viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the [appellant], there are sufficient facts and reasonable inferences that can be drawn there from, to support his negligence claim. Therefore, [appellant] respectfully requests that [appellees\u2019] Motion be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Appellant attached several exhibits to his \u201cOpposition,\u201d including the deposition, affidavit, and report of Bernard \u2022Schwartz, a professional engineer and certified fire investigator. Schwartz inspected the Property on behalf of appellant and opined that appellees were negligent for violating the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Prevention Code (\u201cFire Code\u201d), codified at Prince George\u2019s County Code (2003), \u00a7 11-251 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cCounty Code\u201d). In particular, he opined that the Property did not have two separate exits, as required by the Fire Code, and this violation was a proximate cause of appellant\u2019s injuries. The following excerpt from Schwartz\u2019s deposition is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: [With respect ... to the number of exits, your testimony is the building only had one and that would have been the front door to the apartment building; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">[SCHWARTZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: In your opinion, what measure should have been taken by the owner or manager of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>apartment building to bring the building in compliance with [the Fire Code]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">[SCHWARTZ]: Well, one would be to provide a second exit, but there are other provisions that are acceptable to the code, which could also have been implemented, and that\u2019s basically a matter of choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: [A]re you aware of any Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department or other authority which ever indicated to the owner of manager of the apartment building that they were in violation of a code, and that they needed to do one of several options as it appears in [the Fire Code]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">[SCHWARTZ]: I have seen no reports which specifically state that they were in violation of that criteria by the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: With respect to Section 31.2.4, do you believe, to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, that the building which Mr. Rivers was in qualified for any of the four exceptions listed under that section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8eu\">[SCHWARTZ]: At the time of the fire, no, I do not believe it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: How about presently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzT\">[SCHWARTZ]: I did not do a detailed analysis, so presently I still believe it does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: [C]an you briefly state for the record what your opinion is with regard to whether or not [appellees] were negligent as of the date of the occurrence with failing to have more than one exit in the building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">[SCHWARTZ]: Yes, I believe that the codes mandate that two exits be provided. There was only one exit provided, and I believe that the failure to have a second exit was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>directly related to the injuries received by Mr. Rivers, that he was forced to exit the building through the only ... method available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Appellant also attached the deposition of appellees\u2019 expert, Stephen Olenick, who opined at his deposition that appellees did not violate the Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you agree that the fire code, in effect in Prince George[\u2019]s County in June, 2003, required this particular building to have two separate exits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGr\">[OLENICK]: I do not agree with that.... [The Fire Code], basically, states that ... if you have a building ... that[ ] ... was built in the '40s, [it] was grandfathered in. That, if the Fire Chief \u2014 and remember, they were inspecting this every year, at least. If they don\u2019t have a problem with this layout, it\u2019s ... a legal design to have just the one exit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... [H]ave you seen any information which suggests ... that in the opinion of a Fire Chief or his authorized representative, the lack of two separate exits did not constitute a distinct hazard of life or property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">[OLENICK]: Yes.... I believe ... it is implied in each and every one of the inspection reports that we\u2019ve received from PG County, that they inspected the building. At no time were they ever cited for only having one exit. And, in fact, even after the fire, they were required to put in manual pull stations. They were required to fix up two smoke detectors that were missing in apartments. But, they still did not cite them or ask them to put a second exit in. Clearly, the approval was implied, through those inspections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Have you seen any documents in this case which suggests the management company, or the owner, applied for a variance from the fire code in Prince Georges [sic] County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>[OLENICK]: I have not. Although, I wouldn\u2019t really expect one.... On existing construction, I wouldn\u2019t ... expect to see that type of paperwork.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">As noted, appellant also submitted as exhibits the affidavit and report of Schwartz. In his affidavit, Schwartz summarized the conclusions of his report, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">At the time of the subject fire, the apartment building in which Mr. Rivers resided and was injured was considered \u201can existing building\u201d under the Code. This building was also considered a four-story building under the Code. The Code required that this building have two exits, remotely located from each other. Remotely located from each other means, among other things, accessible by separate paths of travel and that they must be arranged to minimize the possibility that more than one has the potential to be blocked by any one fire. There were recognized alternatives under the Code whereby the subject building, in lieu of having two exits, would have been in compliance with only one exit if it contained a supervised automatic sprinkler system throughout, if it had a smoke-proof enclosure, or an outside stairway accessible to all living units. This building had only one exit, and met none of the recognized exceptions. Therefore, within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, the building was maintained in violation of the fire code in Prince George\u2019s County at the time of the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">... I disagree with [Olenick\u2019s] opinion that [appellees] were in compliance with the Fire Code pursuant to Section 11-252 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code. That part of the Code states the non-compliant conditions may be permitted to continue \u201conly if, in the opinion of the Fire Chief or his authorized representative, they do not constitute a distinct hazard to life or property.\u201d I have seen no evidence in this case which demonstrates that the [appellees\u2019] noncompliance with the fire code at the time of the fire was permitted by the Fire Chief or his authorized representative, nor have I seen any evidence the [appellees] applied for a Variance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>contemplated under Section 11-294 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code. In addition, ... requirements for existing buildings can be modified by the authority have [sic] jurisdiction (ie.[sic] The Fire Chief or his authorized representative) but only where it is clearly evident that a reasonable degree of safety was provided. Again, I see no evidence the [appellees] ever sought any type of modification of the requirements of the Code or a determination that a reasonable degree of safety was provided in the opinion of the Fire Chief or his authorized representative. (Internal citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">At the motion hearing on April 5, 2007, appellees\u2019 counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">In every context of a third-party criminal act, the law\u2019s the same. You have to establish, if you\u2019re going to sue the business proprietor for negligence, a similar act or acts previously that are highly like the one that you\u2019re suing about in order to establish foreseeability. There\u2019s no exception .... If you\u2019re going to hold [a] business owner liable, you[\u2019ve] got to show that it happened before so that they\u2019re on notice of a likelihood of it happening again____ I\u2019ll concede everything they say for purposes of today\u2019s motion. It doesn\u2019t change that element that they have to establish. They\u2019ve got to show that it happened before. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">In response, appellant\u2019s counsel contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">[I]t doesn\u2019t matter how this fire started, whether it was ... someone falling asleep with a cigarette, an intentional act, a faulty piece of equipment that started a fire. They had an obligation to be in compliance with the fire code, and they were not in this case, and as a result, my client was forced out of the only exit available when they\u2019re required under the fire code to have two separate exists [sic] remotely located from each other with two separate paths of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">Your Honor, ... because you have a violation of a statute, that\u2019s a prima facie ease[ ] of negligence and all we\u2019ve got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>[to] show is that violation was a proximate cause of the injury and in this case if two separate exists [sic] were available to my client, he wouldn\u2019t have had to go out the only one that was blocked by the fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Subsequently, the court issued a \u201cMemorandum and Order of the Court\u201d (the \u201cOrder\u201d), granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">In this case, the fire that caused [appellant\u2019s] injuries was started by the criminal act of a serial arsonist. The evidence fails to suggest that [appellees] were aware of criminal activity similar to the arson that occurred on June 19, 2003 on the premises of the Oxon Park Apartment building. Therefore, [appellees] were not under a duty to protect [appellant] against such acts. Furthermore, <em>whether or not the acts or omissions that [appellant] mentions constitute a violation of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Code, it is highly unlikely that [appellees] could have affected the arsonist from starting the fire in the entry way by adhering to the fire code. </em>Therefore, the Court concludes that there are no genuine disputes as to any material facts and [appellees] are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Appellant noted an appeal on May 7, 2007 (No. 516, September Term, 2007). On the same day, appellant filed a \u201cMotion to Stay Time for Appeal,\u201d asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">[Appellant] has filed Notice of Appeal in order to preserve his appellate rights. However, [appellant] also seeks a reconsideration of the Court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment and the Court\u2019s consideration of the settlement agreement reached between the parties. In order to preserve the time for [the] court to consider these two matters, the [appellant] moves the Court to stay the time for [appellant] to appeal it\u2019s [sic] Order granting judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>On May 16, 2007, appellant filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration\u201d of the summary judgment Order. The court denied appellant\u2019s Motion to Stay Time for Appeal on May 17, 2007, and, after a hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration, it denied that motion on September 7, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On review of a grant of summary judgment, we \u201creview the record in the light most favorable to [appellant as] the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d <em>Educ. Testing Serv. v. Hildebrant, </em>399 Md. 128, 140, 923 A.2d 34 (2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f) (2008). Thus, the first task for the reviewing court is to determine whether a dispute of material fact exists; \u201cwhere such dispute is absent ... we proceed to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hill v. Knapp, </em>396 Md. 700, 711, 914 A.2d 1193 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\u201cA material fact is a fact that, depending on how it is decided by the trier of fact, will affect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Mandl v. Bailey, </em>159 Md.App. 64, 82, 858 A.2d 508 (2004); <em>see also Arroyo v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>381 Md. 646, 654, 851 A.2d 576 (2004). Put another way, if the court does \u201cnot rest [its] decision\u201d upon a particular factual ground, \u201cany dispute as to facts relating [to that ground] is not a dispute with regard to a material fact and does not prevent the entry of a summary judgment----\u201d <em>Daniel v. Kensington Homes, Inc., </em>232 Md. 1, 13, 192 A.2d 114 (1963). Ordinarily, on review of a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court may \u201c \u2018uphold the grant of a summary judgment only on the grounds relied on by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., </em>174 Md.App. 681, 711, 923 A.2d 971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(2007) (citations omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>403 Md. 367, 942 A.2d 722 (2008) .</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">In this case, the court granted summary judgment on the ground that the fire was unforeseeable as a matter of law because it was set by an arsonist. Therefore, in the court\u2019s view, it was immaterial whether appellees complied with the Fire Code: Even if they did not comply, the court reasoned, they had no duty to protect appellant from the arsonist\u2019s intentional criminal acts. As we shall explain, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Appellant argues that appellees\u2019 alleged violations of the Fire Code breached a duty owed to him and caused his injuries. He states: \u201cMr. Rivers does not allege in this case that the Appellees had a duty to protect him from the criminal actions of the arsonist. Rather, the duty alleged is a duty to maintain Mr. Rivers\u2019 apartment building in a safe condition and ... a statutory duty to comply with the fire code.\u201d Appellant relies on <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 483, 869 A.2d 837 (2005), in which the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">The law in this State regarding the breach of a statutory duty remains the same today as it has for over ninety years. To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action based on the breach of a statutory duty, a plaintiff must show \u201c(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Brooks [v. Lewin Realty III, Inc.], </em>378 Md. [70,] 79, 835 A.2d 616 [ (2003) ]. \u201cProximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">If a landlord of property ... fails to maintain the premises in a safe condition and someone whom the Code was designed to protect ... is injured as a result of the landlord\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>failure to maintain the premises [in compliance with the applicable statutes], the plaintiff will have successfully established a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. It will then be incumbent upon the finder of fact to determine whether the landlord\u2019s actions were reasonable under all of the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In appellant\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he cause of the fire is irrelevant. The fact that it was started by a criminal act rather than a negligent act is also irrelevant.\u201d He asserts: \u201cSurely, Mr. Rivers, a tenant in this building, was a member of the class of persons the fire code was designed to protect.\u201d According to appellant, \u201cthe injury was of the type the ordinance was undoubtedly intended to prevent. Simply put, the potential for the outbreak of fires is the specific emergency for which provisions of the fire code are enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Appellees counter that \u201cbusiness proprietors such as the Appellees are not the insurers of the safety of their tenants.\u201d They summarize their view of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">In order to impose a duty on a business premises owner, requiring that he protect individuals upon his premises from the intentional criminal acts of third parties, it must be shown that the incident from which the case arises was foreseeable. Otherwise, no duty arises. Proof of foreseeability requires evidence that the defendant knew or should have known that highly similar criminal activity against persons or property had occurred on the premises previously. Only prior criminal acts actually occurring on the same premises are relevant in making a determination of whether the defendant was under a duty to keep the premises safe under the circumstances alleged in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Appellees cite <em>Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 359 A.2d 548 (1976), as well as several other cases, in support of the proposition that \u201cthere is no special duty imposed upon the landlord to protect his tenants against crimes perpetrated by third parties on the landlord\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 359 A.2d 548. Rather, as the Court said in <em>Scott, </em>a landlord owes its tenants \u201cthe duty of reasonable and ordinary care to keep the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>premises safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 359 A.2d 548. The Court explained that the foreseeability of a third person\u2019s criminal acts is a factor in determining whether the duty of ordinary care requires the landlord to protect its tenant from harm: \u201cIf the landlord knows, or should know, of criminal activity ... he then has a duty to take <em>reasonable </em>measures, in view of the existing circumstances, to eliminate the conditions contributing to the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 359 A.2d 548 (emphasis in original). But, said the Court, <em>id.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">[sjince the landlord can affect the risk only within his own premises, ordinarily only criminal acts occurring on the landlord\u2019s premises, and of which he knows or should have known (and not those occurring generally in the surrounding neighborhood) constitute relevant factors in determining, in the particular circumstances, the reasonable measures which a landlord is under a duty to take to keep the premises safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Seeking to apply <em>Scott </em>and its progeny to the case at bar, appellees argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">The Appellant here argues that the Appellees had a duty to prevent his injuries by virtue of the existence of the building code provisions to which he cites.[ ] That argument puts the cart before the horse since the applicable law is clear that before a duty can be imposed upon the Appellees under the circumstances presented here, there must be a showing of foreseeability. Foreseeability is a prerequisite to the existence of a duty in any negligence case. In the absence of foreseeability, there is no duty to act or to refrain from acting. In turn, when a plaintiff seeks to impose liability on a defendant for the intentional criminal acts of a third party with whom the defendant had no relationship, the plaintiff must prove that highly similar acts occurred at the premises of the defendant prior to the incident which gives rise to the litigation in order for a jury question to arise as to the issue of foreseeability. Thus, absent proof of similar acts or events, there is no duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Rejecting appellant\u2019s reliance on the statutory obligation imposed by the Fire Code, appellees reason: \u201cNo duty is created simply by the existence of a statute.\u201d They also assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">Appellant failed to produce any evidence of any prior criminal incidents similar in nature to that which occurred at Mr. Rivers\u2019 apartment building. That evidence was crucial to generating an issue on foreseeability. In the absence of any such evidence, the defendants owed the plaintiff no duty whatsoever to protect him from the crime which underlies this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We first consider the applicable statutory scheme. As part of its Fire Code, the County has adopted the \u201cLife Safety Code,\u201d also known as \u201cNFPA 101,\u201d a standard body of fire protection regulations promulgated by the National Fire Protection Association. <em>See </em>County Code, \u00a7 ll-253(a)(l) (incorporating NFPA 101). At the time of the fire, the 1994 edition of the Life Safety Code was in effect in the County. <em>See </em>Prince George\u2019s County Res. No. CR-36-1996 (adopted July 23,1996).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The purpose of the Life Safety Code is \u201cto provide minimum requirements, with due regard to function, for the design, operation, and maintenance of buildings and structures for safety to life from fire and similar emergencies.\u201d NFPA 101 (1994 ed.), \u00a7 1-2.1. More particularly, \u201c[a]s related to fire safety, the objective of [the Life Safety Code] is to protect the occupants not intimate with the initial fire development from loss of life and to improve the survivability of those who are intimate with the fire development.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1-2.2. The Life Safety Code \u201capplies to both new construction and existing buildings,\u201d and provides \u201cspecific provisions for existing buildings that might differ from those for new construction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 1-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>As a \u201cfundamental requirement,\u201d the Life Safety Code mandates, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 2-8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">Two means of egress, as a minimum, shall be provided in every building or structure, section, and area where size, occupancy, and arrangement endanger occupants attempting to use a single means of egress that is blocked by fire or smoke. The two means of egress shall be arranged to minimize the possibility that both might be rendered impassable by the same emergency condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In addition, the Life Safety Code requires that, \u201c[w]here exits are not immediately accessible from an open floor area, safe and continuous passageways, aisles, or corridors leading directly to every exit shall be maintained and shall be arranged to provide access for each occupant to at least two exits by separate ways of travel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 5-5.1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As the building in issue was constructed in the 1940s, the particular requirements of the Life Safety Code relating to existing buildings are also relevant. In an existing building, the Life Safety Code requires that \u201c[e]very living unit shall have access to at least two separate exits remotely located from each other----\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 19-2.4. The Life Safety Code provides four exceptions to this requirement. First, a living unit in a building may have access to only a single exit if the exit is dedicated to the living unit (or, in some circumstances, shared with only one other unit), and other conditions apply. <em>Id. </em>Second, a building may have only a single exit if it contains \u201can approved, supervised automatic sprinkler system,\u201d and complies with other conditions. <em>Id. </em>Third, a single exit is permitted for a building of three stories or less under certain conditions. <em>Id. </em>Finally, \u201c[a] building of any height with not more than four living units per floor\u201d is permitted to have a single exit if the exit is \u201ca smokeproof enclosure or outside stair,\u201d and there is no more than twenty feet of travel distance between the entrance door of each unit and the exit. <em>Id. </em>Of import here, the parties agree that the Property did not conform to any of the exceptions set forth in NFPA 101, \u00a7 19-2.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>At the outset, we reject appellees\u2019 contention that a duty of care is not created \u201csimply by the existence of a statute.\u201d To the contrary, \u201c[a] duty may be, and often, is prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 358, 744 A.2d 47 (2000), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 72, 835 A.2d 616 (2003); <em>see Joseph v. Bozzuto Mgmt. Co., </em>173 Md.App. 305, 345, 918 A.2d 1230 (2007). Appellees\u2019 reliance on <em>Scott, supra, </em>278 Md. 160, 359 A.2d 548, is also misplaced. <em>Scott </em>involved a wrongful death suit brought against a landlord by the relatives of a tenant who was shot to death by unknown persons in the landlord\u2019s parking garage. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 359 A.2d 548. Notably, there was no applicable statute that established a duty of care. The Court\u2019s holding was \u201ca subsidiary of the broader rule that a private person is under no special duty to protect another from criminal acts by a third person, <em>in the absence of statutes, </em>or of a special relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 359 A.2d 548 (emphasis added). And, with the exception of <em>Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 642 A.2d 219 (1994), which we shall discuss in more detail, <em>infra, </em>in the other cases cited by appellees none of the defendants violated an applicable statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Thus, the cases on which appellees rely were subject to the general rule, articulated by the <em>Scott </em>Court, that \u201ca private person is under no special duty to protect another from criminal acts by a third person.... \u201d <em>Scott, </em>278 Md. at 166, 359 A.2d 548. But, where a relevant statute provides the applicable duty of care, the rule is otherwise. As the Court ruled in <em>Polakoff, supra, </em>385 Md. at 476 n. 5, 869 A.2d 837, \u201c[t]he standard for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence in a statutory-based negligence action is different from the general standard for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence in cases that are not governed by a statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The principle has been long recognized. In <em>Flaccomio v. Eysink, </em>129 Md. 367, 380, 100 A. 510 (1916), the Court stated that \u201cviolation of a statute ... is itself sufficient to prove such a breach of duty as will sustain a private action for negligence.\u201d We elucidated the distinction in <em>Moore v. Myers, </em>161 Md.App. 349, 868 A.2d 954 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">To prevail in a typical negligence action, one must show \u201c(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d But, \u201cwhere there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, ... the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u2018is prescribed by the statute\u2019 or ordinance and that the violation of the statute or ordinance itself is evidence of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 363, 868 A.2d 954 (citations omitted); <em>see also, e.g., Polakoff, </em>385 Md. at 475-76, 869 A.2d 837; <em>Horridge v.

As the Court explained in <em>Brown, </em>357 Md. at 359, 744 A.2d 47, once the violation of a statute is shown, \u201c[pjroximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent. It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Accord Gourdine v. Crews, </em>405 Md. 722, 955 A.2d 769 (2008); <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d 616; <em>Moore, </em>161 Md.App. at 365, 868 A.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The plaintiff need not show that the defendant had knowledge of the statutory violation (although the statute itself might require knowledge in order to establish a violation). <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 80, 835 A.2d 616. Notably, while \u201c[t]he majority of state courts treat the violation as negligence <em>per se ... </em>Maryland is among the minority of states that treat the violation simply as evidence of negligence.\u201d <em>Joseph, supra, </em>173 Md.App. at 329, 918 A.2d 1230. Thus, once the plaintiff has presented a <em>prima facie </em>case, by introducing \u201cevidence that the violation of the statute proximately caused the plaintiffs injury,\u201d the defendant\u2019s negligence becomes a question for the fact finder. <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d 616. At that point, \u201c[t]he trier of fact must ... evaluate whether the actions taken by the defendant were reasonable under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>McQuay v. Schertle, </em>126 Md.App. 556, 730 A.2d 714, <em>cert. denied, </em>356 Md. 18, 736 A.2d 1065 (1999), illustrates the analysis a court must perform to determine whether \u201cthe plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>357 Md. at 359, 744 A.2d 47. In <em>McQuay, </em>126 Md.App. at 563, 730 A.2d 714, a motorist was killed \u201cwhen an eight ton tractor load of wood pulp fell on the parked car in which she was sitting, crushing it.\u201d The accident took place on the grounds of the Dundalk Marine Terminal. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 730 A.2d 714. The tractor from which the wood pulp fell was being driven between two sheds, along a set of railroad tracks on an industrial road within the terminal. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 730 A.2d 714. The decedent, Wozniak, had parked her car at \u201ca point parallel to and immediately adjacent to the railroad track,\u201d near one of the sheds, while her boyfriend, who worked at the terminal, went into the shed to pick up his paycheck. <em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 730 A.2d 714. The car was in the path of the tractor that was operating along the tracks and carrying a wide load. <em>Id. </em>When the tractor\u2019s operator saw the car, \u201c[h]e applied his brakes and managed to bring his ... tractor to a halt without hitting the car. The sudden stop caused the tractor to tilt forward, however, and the wood pulp cargo toppled onto the car, crushing it and killing ... Wozniak instantly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 730 A.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The question before the <em>McQuay </em>Court was whether the jury was appropriately charged to consider whether Wozniak was contributorily negligent. In that regard, the <em>McQuay </em>Court noted, <em>id. </em>at 570, 730 A.2d 714:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">When the accident occurred, Ms. Wozniak\u2019s car was situated nine feet from a fire hydrant, one foot from one of the sets of railroad tracks on the industrial road, and in the general vicinity of [a] faded \u201cNo Parking Any Time\u201d sign affixed to the west wall of [the shed]. It was also across the industrial road from [a] large warehouse on which a second \u201cNo Parking Any Time\u201d sign was posted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Wozniak had allegedly violated three traffic regulations by parking her car where she did: (1) a \u201cregulation prohibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>parking within 15 feet of a fire hydrant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 578, 730 A.2d 714; (2) a \u201cregulation prohibiting parking \u2018[wjithin 50 feet of the nearest rail or railroad, except in designated parking areas,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 581-82, 730 A.2d 714 (quoting regulation); and (3) a regulation forbidding parking in posted \u201cno parking\u201d areas. <em>Id. </em>at 585-86, 730 A.2d 714. The <em>McQuay </em>Court reiterated that the violation of a statute may be evidence of negligence only \u201c \u201cwhen it causes harm to a person within the class of persons the statute seeks to protect and the harm is the kind that the statute was designed to prevent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 730 A.2d 714 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The Court then considered the purpose of the three regulations. It determined that neither Wozniak\u2019s violation of the fire hydrant regulation nor of the generic \u201cno parking\u201d regulation was a cognizable proximate cause of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 581, 586-87, 730 A.2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">As to the fire hydrant regulation, the Court reasoned: \u201c[T]he purpose of the fire hydrant parking regulation ... is to provide access to water in case of fire and is not to protect people in Ms. Wozniak\u2019s ... position from injury on the roadway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 730 A.2d 714. Moreover, \u201cthe distance in feet from the point at which Ms. Wozniak stopped her car and the nearest fire hydrant had no bearing on the happening of the accident, except in the most random and attenuated way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 730 A.2d 714. The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 580-81, 730 A.2d 714 (citations and footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">To be sure, had Ms. Wozniak diligently eliminated all points within a 15 foot radius of the fire hydrant in choosing a spot to park, her car would not have been in the ... tractor\u2019s path____Accordingly, her failure to park at a point that was not more than 15 feet from the fire hydrant may have been a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of the accident-just as the fact that she drove to the marine terminal that day at all was such a cause \u2014 in that, \u201cbut for\u201d that conduct, the accident would not have happened. It was not, however, a legally cognizable cause of the accident____[T]he proximity of her car to the fire hydrant ... was irrelevant to the occurrence of the accident. It would be unfair under that circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to permit the jury to draw a legally meaningful link between Ms. Wozniak\u2019s violation of the fire hydrant regulation and her death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Similarly, the Court rejected Wozniak\u2019s parking in violation of the generic \u201cno parking\u201d signs as evidence of contributory negligence, stating, <em>id. </em>at 586, 730 A.2d 714:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">It is clear from the configuration and setting of the loading dock and [the shed], to which the \u201cNo Parking Any Time\u201d signs were affixed, and the locations of the signs on those buildings, that they are posted to promote ease of access to the buildings, not to protect drivers or occupants of vehicles on the adjacent roadway from injury or death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">However, the Court reached a different conclusion regarding the regulation prohibiting parking within 50 feet of a railroad. In the Court\u2019s view, that regulation was \u201cintended in part to protect occupants of parked cars from serious injury and death that can ensue when parked cars interfere with the movement of vehicles that occupy the rails. This purpose applies whether the vehicle in question is a train or another vehicle using the rail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 730 A.2d 714. Accordingly, the Court determined that violation of the railroad parking regulation could be considered as evidence of contributory negligence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\"><em>Manor Inn, supra, </em>335 Md. 135, 642 A.2d 219, upon which appellees rely, is also illuminating. In that case, an employee of a hotel, Manor Inn, \u201cparked a laundry van [on the hotel property] leaving it unattended, with the doors unlocked and the keys in the ignition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 642 A.2d 219. The van was stolen by an opportunistic thief, and \u201c[approximately thirty minutes later, [the thief] negligently drove the van into [a] car, which was stopped at a stop sign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 642 A.2d 219. The insurer of the car that was struck sued Manor Inn, contending that the hotel employee\u2019s negligence in leaving the vehicle unattended was a proximate cause of the accident. <em>Id. </em>To establish the employee\u2019s negligence, the insurer cited a provision of the Maryland Code which provided that \u201c \u2018a person driving or otherwise in charge of a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>vehicle may not leave it unattended until the engine is stopped, the ignition locked, the key removed, and the brake effectively set.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 642 A.2d 219 (quoting statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The Court considered the purpose of the statute, which it said was \u201c \u2018to protect against a theft of or tampering with a motor vehicle and to prevent [motor vehicles] from moving under their own momentum should the brakes fail.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 642 A.2d 219 (citation omitted). The Court reasoned that the employee\u2019s violation of the statute was a proximate cause of the theft, commenting: \u201cLeaving the keys in the ignition of a motor vehicle increases significantly the chances of that vehicle being stolen----[I]t is patent that it was reasonably foreseeable that, by leaving the keys in the ignition, a thief would take the van.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 642 A.2d 219. But, the Court explained, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">It is not so clear, however, that the thief would drive negligently, and even more unclear that, in doing so, he or she would injure the plaintiff. Consequently, while the negligence of Manor Inn clearly was the proximate cause of the theft of the van, it does not follow that that causal relationship continued from the moment of the theft to the moment of the impact between the van and [the] car. [The thief s] conduct in taking the van was not \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d; indeed, it was highly predictable. On the other hand, the manner in which he drove the van, and its consequences, were \u201chighly extraordinary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In this case, appellees\u2019 expert, Stephen Olenick, opined that, despite appellees\u2019 non-conformance with the requirements of NFPA 101, appellees did not violate the Fire Code. He based his opinion on County Code, \u00a7 ll-252(a), which provides that the Fire Code</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">shall apply to existing conditions as well as to conditions arising after the adoption thereof, except that conditions legally in existence at the adoption of [the Fire Code] and not in strict compliance therewith may be permitted to continue only if, in the opinion of the Fire Chief or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>authorized representative, they do not constitute a distinct hazard to life or property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In Olenick\u2019s view, the fact that the Property had been inspected by County fire inspectors on several occasions and had not been cited for noncompliance with NFPA 101 \u00a7 19-2.4 demonstrated that, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, the Property\u2019s noncompliance did not constitute \u201ca distinct hazard to life or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In contrast, appellant relied below upon County Code, \u00a7 11\u2014 294, which governs the procedure to obtain a variance from the Fire Code. Section 11-294 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Upon application in writing, the Fire Chief or his authorized representative is authorized and empowered, when there are practical difficulties or circumstances of undue hardship involved in the implementation and enforcement of the provisions of [the Fire Code], to make such interpretative decisions and qualifications as shall ensure substantial compliance with its terms and avoid the imposition of undue hardship provided that the spirit of [the Fire Code] shall be observed, public safety secured and substantial justice done. The particulars of such variances, when granted or allowed, and the decision of the Fire Chief thereon, shall be entered upon the records of the Bureau of Fire Prevention and a signed copy shall be furnished the applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Appellant maintained that a decision of the Fire Chief or his authorized representative to permit a particular departure from the Fire Code on the grounds that it does \u201cnot constitute a distinct hazard to life or property,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 ll-252(a), must be made in writing according to the variance procedure described in County Code, \u00a7 11-294. Appellant asserted that there was no record that appellees received a variance for the Property\u2019s non-conformance with \u00a7 19-2.4 of the Life Safety Code. Therefore, appellant reasoned that \u00a7 ll-252(a) of the County Code does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">On appeal, appellees continue to press their interpretation of the Fire Code, reasoning that the Code \u201crequires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Appellees retrofit the building with a second exit only if ordered to do so by the fire marshal.\u201d They contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\">In this case, the building was inspected every year and absolutely no mention was made of the need for additional measures with regard to fire safety. The Fire Chief of Prince George\u2019s County determined that the Appellee\u2019s building was not in violation of any fire code provisions, and therefore did not \u201cconstitute a distinct hazard to life or property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Given the posture of the case, this Court is not empowered to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the interpretation of the Fire Code, nor to make the antecedent factual determinations as to whether the County Fire Chief actually found that it was permissible for the Property not to comply with the Life Safety Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, on a grant of summary judgment we ordinarily may \u201c \u2018uphold the grant of a summary judgment only on the grounds relied on by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pulte Home Corp., supra, </em>174 Md.App. at 711, 923 A.2d 971 (citations omitted). Here, the circuit court granted summary judgment on the ground that the fire was the intentional act of an arsonist and, because appellees were not aware of \u201ccriminal activity similar to the arson,\u201d they \u201cwere not under a duty to protect [appellant] against such acts ... <em>whether or not the acts or omissions that [appellant] mentions constitute a violation of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire </em>Code....\u201d (Emphasis added.) We shall assume, as the circuit court seemed to do, that appellees were in violation of the Fire Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>It is patent that appellant is within the class of persons that the Fire Code seeks to protect, and that the injuries he suffered are the kind the Fire Code is intended to prevent. The purpose of the two-exit requirement of the Life Safety Code is to obviate the danger of an apartment building\u2019s \u201coccupants attempting to use a single means of egress that is blocked by fire or smoke.\u201d NFPA 101, \u00a7 2-8. That is exactly what allegedly occurred in this case. It was eminently foreseeable that, if a fire, whatever its origin, blocked the single exit to the Property, the occupants would be burned as they attempted to escape via that exit. That is the precise contingency the two-exit requirement is intended to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Despite the existence of the statutory scheme, appellees insist that the fire in this case was not foreseeable because it was set intentionally by a third party. In several cases, Maryland courts have rejected a defense based on lack of foreseeability of a particular fire, when it was the conditions on the property that enabled the fire to injure the plaintiffs, regardless of its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\"><em>Collins v. Li, </em>176 Md.App. 502, 933 A.2d 528 (2007), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Pittway v. Collins, </em>403 Md. 304, 941 A.2d 1104 (2008), is particularly relevant. In that case, two children were killed, and three others injured, in a house fire that began in a windowless basement room where the five children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>were sleeping. The fire was \u201ccaused by a candle ... which was being used during an area-wide electrical outage caused by severe thunderstorms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 933 A.2d 528. The decedents were the overnight guests of the Chapmans, tenants of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 933 A.2d 528. The parents of the victims sued the Chapmans\u2019 landlords, the Lis, along with several other defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 933 A.2d 528. As to the Lis, the plaintiffs alleged that the relevant local rental ordinances \u201cprohibited the use of the enclosed basement room[ ] as [a] sleeping area[ ] due to the lack of proper emergency egress and smoke detectors in the immediate vicinity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 565, 933 A.2d 528, and that the Chapmans used the room as a bedroom \u201cin reliance on the Lis\u2019 representations that the enclosed room[ ] could be used as [a] sleeping area[ ]____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565-66, 933 A.2d 528. The evidence also made \u201cclear that, for at least several minutes, the boys tried unsuccessfully to escape----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 933 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The circuit court granted the Lis\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that the Chapmans\u2019 negligence in leaving the candle burning was a superseding cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We reversed, stating: \u201cQuintessentially, the potential for the outbreak of fires is the specific emergency for which provisions requiring that there be emergency egress from residential dwellings are enacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 933 A.2d 528. Thus, \u201c[njotwithstanding that the Lis might not have anticipated the Chapmans\u2019 specific acts of negligence, the negligent acts of the Chapmans were clearly within the general field of danger as proscribed\u201d by the rental ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 933 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Orfanos v. Athenian, Inc., </em>66 Md.App. 507, 505 A.2d 131 (1986), is also instructive. There, \u201ca fire erupted at the Athenian Restaurant ... substantially damaging both the restaurant furnishings and equipment and the buildings in which they were housed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 505 A.2d 131. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>building\u2019s owners sued their tenants, the restaurant owners, arguing that the restaurant owners allowed grease to accumulate \u201cin the ventilation system serving the cooking units [which] contributed to the spread and ferocity of the fire and therefore was proximate cause of the ultimate damage suffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 505 A.2d 131. The circuit court entered judgment in favor of the restaurant owners, reasoning that \u201cbecause [the landlords] failed to show how the fire started, they failed in their burden of proving the requisite element of foreseeability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 505 A.2d 131. We rejected this conclusion, however, stating: \u201cProof of foreseeability does not depend on proof of how the fire started.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We elaborated: \u201cIt is reasonably foreseeable that a fire can start in the kitchen of a restaurant; such fires are not infrequent. Although the precise cause of a particular fire may be unusual, improbable, even unpredictable, the general danger is apparent and therefore foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518, 505 A.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Appellees seek to distinguish this case from <em>Collins </em>and <em>Orfanos </em>on the ground that the fire in this case was the intentional, criminal act of a third party, while the fires in the cited cases were the result <em>of </em>negligence. In the context of the claims asserted here, this is a distinction without a difference. Indeed, the cause of the fire is the proverbial red herring. As appellant aptly states: \u201cThe jury could reasonably conclude, based on the evidence presented, that Appellees should have foreseen the danger to their tenants posed by fire, regardless of how the fire was started. The risk of fires is reasonably foreseeable.\u201d Similarly, in the words of the <em>Collins </em>Court, 176 Md.App. at 572, 933 A.2d 528, a fire code is \u201cdesigned, not just to protect residents from fires ignited by acts of God and where there is no human error, but from <em>fires regardless of origin.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">As we see it, appellees and the circuit court misapprehended the nature of appellant\u2019s claim, which was not based on a duty, if any, to prevent the arsonist from setting the fire, but rather on a duty to maintain the Property so as to minimize the danger to its occupants from fires that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>occur. In appellant\u2019s words, \u201c[t]his is not a negligent security case.\u201d For this reason, the circuit court\u2019s statement that \u201cit is highly unlikely that Defendants could have affected the arsonist from starting the fire in the entryway by adhering to the fire code\u201d was beside the point. A building owner who fails to comply with a fire code runs the risk that, if a fire should occur \u2014 regardless of the cause \u2014 an occupant will be injured as a result of the building\u2019s statutory non-compliance. In such a case, the owner\u2019s liability does not arise from failure to prevent the fire from occurring. Rather, the question is whether the occupants\u2019 inability to escape from the fire was the foreseeable result of the owner\u2019s statutory noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><em>Manor Inn, </em>cited by appellees, demonstrates that injuries stemming from a third party\u2019s intentional, criminal act may be the foreseeable result of negligence. In that case, as noted, a hotel employee left a van unattended and unlocked with the keys in the ignition, in violation of an applicable statute. A thief stole the van, and while driving it, subsequently struck another vehicle. To be sure, the relationship between the statutory violation and the <em>traffic accident </em>was so attenuated that the hotel was not liable for the accident. But, the <em>Manor Inn </em>Court explicitly stated that \u201cthe negligence of Manor Inn clearly was the proximate cause of the <em>theft of the </em>van.... \u201d <em>Manor Inn, supra, </em>335 Md. at 160, 642 A.2d 219 (emphasis added). The risk that the van might be stolen was a foreseeable consequence of violating the unattended vehicle statute. In this case, the risk that appellant might be injured while attempting to escape a fire in the building was a foreseeable consequence of failure to comply with the provisions of the Fire Code at issue. The nature and foreseeability of this risk is no different, whether a given fire is set intentionally or unintentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Although we have not found a reported Maryland case discussing whether a landlord who does not comply with a fire code may be liable for injuries resulting from an intentionally-set fire, our conclusion is consistent with the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions. <em>Concord Florida, Inc. v. Lewin, </em>341 So.2d 242 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>348 So.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>946 (Fla.1977), cited by appellant, is particularly persuasive. In that case, \u201ca madman ran in the front door of the crowded Concord Cafeteria ... threw a five gallon container of gasoline on the floor, lit a match to the gasoline and then ran away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. The cafeteria caught fire and \u201cmany patrons ... were burned [or otherwise] injured in their chaotic attempts to flee the burning building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The owner of the cafeteria had failed \u201cto provide ample emergency fire exits ... to clearly designate the location of the present fire exits and ... to provide a reasonably safe place for its patrons \u2014 all in violation of the [local] Fire Prevention and Safety Code.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">In the tort suit that followed, the cafeteria owner argued that the \u201ccriminal act of the madman\u201d was an intervening cause of the patrons\u2019 injuries, but the Florida court disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 243-44. In reasoning we find instructive, the <em>Concord </em>Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 245:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">[T]he risk created here was not that of an arsonist or madman <em>setting fire </em>to a building, per se, but rather, the risk of <em>fire, </em>itself. In failing to adequately protect its patrons from fire by providing proper safety measures such as emergency exits and signs indicating the location of said exits, [the cafeteria owner] assumed the foreseeable risk that fire might someday trap its patrons leaving them without an escape route. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Numerous cases are to similar effect. <em>See, e.g., Mozer v. Semenza, </em>177 So.2d 880, 883 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1965) (where hotel guests were injured in arson, \u201c[t]he scope of [hotel\u2019s] duty to maintain reasonably safe premises does not include a duty to foresee a particular fire, but it does include a duty to reasonably guard against the risk of fire\u201d); <em>Williams v. Johns, </em>157 Mich.App. 115, 403 N.W.2d 516, 518-19 (1987) (where origin of arson was combustible material stored by landlord in stairwell, landlord \u201cknew or should have known that someone might accidentally or intentionally start a fire in the combustible material\u201d); <em>Burns v. Prop. Servicing Co., </em>276 S.W.2d 177, 181 (Mo.1955) (\u201c[I]t was wholly immaterial whether the fire in question had its origin in accident, act of God, negligence or wilful, intentional and wrongful conduct; ... when the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>dant ... failed to provide a fire escape in compliance with the statute it could reasonably have foreseen that a fire might occur in the building which would cause injury to a tenant.\u201d); <em>Derboven v. Stockton, </em>490 S.W.2d 301, 305 &amp; 316-18 (Mo.Ct. App.1972) (where tavern exit door opened inward, rather than outward, contrary to fire code requirement, and the bodies of patrons who were killed attempting to escape arson in tavern were found \u201c \u2018piled\u2019 against the ... door,\u201d statutory violation was evidence of tavern owner\u2019s negligence); <em>Ohio Fair Plan Underwriting Ass\u2019n v. Arcara, </em>65 Ohio App.2d 169, 417 N.E.2d 115, 119-21 (1979) (where owner of vacant house violated housing code by failing to \u201csecure[ ] and board[ ] up [house] to prevent vandals or arsonists from entering,\u201d owner\u2019s liability for damage to neighboring house caused by arson originating in owner\u2019s vacant house was question for the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Indeed, appellees have not cited any case to the contrary. We have found one, <em>Zanders v. Lambert, </em>514 So.2d 617 (La.Ct.App.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>515 So.2d 1109 (La.1987), but it is both distinguishable and unpersuasive. In that case, the Louisiana court determined that an apartment building owners\u2019 failure to comply with fire code requirements could not be introduced as evidence of the owners\u2019 negligence in a wrongful death suit brought by the survivors of tenants killed by the act of an arsonist. <em>Id. </em>at 617-19. Some of the fire code regulations cited by the plaintiffs did \u201cnot apply to the defendants\u2019 building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620. Moreover, under the facts of that case, the \u201carsonist intended to set fire to an entire side of the apartment building____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. The court reasoned: \u201cIt could reasonably be concluded that if there had been a second stairway, the arsonist would have set fire to that means of escape also.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, appellees have advanced no evidence that the arsonist in this case intended to set multiple fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Most important, the <em>Zanders </em>Court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe cause of the fire and resulting deaths was arson, not the lack of a second stairway,\u201d <em>id., </em>is unconvincing, as this case illustrates. Under the alleged, facts of this case, a fact-finder could decide that appellant would not have been injured while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>escaping the arson but for the fact that the fire blocked the sole exit to the building. As we have seen, it is precisely this eventuality that the two-exit provision of the Fire Code is intended to guard against. The existence of the Fire Code is a reflection of the fact that residential fires are foreseeable; the County enacted the Fire Code to require owners of apartment buildings to provide for the safety of their tenants in the event of fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In sum, we have little difficulty in concluding that the undisputed facts alleged by appellant stated a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. In granting summary judgment to appellees on the ground asserted by appellees, the circuit court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN CASE NO. 1870.

The account of the undisputed material facts regarding the fire is drawn from a deposition of appellant submitted as an attachment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and to appellant\u2019s opposition to the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b659-5\">. The arson in this case was one of many linked to Thomas A.
