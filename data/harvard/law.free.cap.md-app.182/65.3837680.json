Oltman, Sr., appellant, for committing a crime of moral turpitude. Oltman was convicted of federal misdemeanor charges stemming from his forgery of Ritalin prescriptions and his fraudulent filling of those prescriptions for an adult son who was no longer a covered dependent under Oltman\u2019s military medical plan. In <em>Oltman v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>162 Md.App. 457, 487-88, 875 A.2d 200, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 125, 883 A.2d 915 <em>(2005)(Oltman I), </em>this Court held that Oltman\u2019s convictions qualified as crimes of moral turpitude within the meaning of Md.Code (1981, 2005 RephVol., 2007 Cum.Supp.), sections 14-404(b) and 15-314 of the Health Occupations Article (HO), because fraud was an essential element of both crimes and Oltman signed a plea agreement explicitly acknowledging that he obtained the prescriptions \u201cby fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">This appeal arises from Oltman\u2019s petition for reinstatement two years after revocation. The Board denied reinstatement and ordered that Oltman may not re-apply for three years. Oltman petitioned for judicial review of that decision, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>plaining that his request was not considered by the full Board or an administrative law judge, and that it is premised upon a finding that Oltman lied to the Pennsylvania Board of Medicine, but he was never allowed a contested hearing on that allegation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss Oltman\u2019s petition for judicial review, on the ground that the court does not have jurisdiction to review a reinstatement decision by the Board. Oltman noted this timely appeal, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">I. Does a circuit court have statutory jurisdiction to entertain a petition for judicial review of a Board decision to deny reinstatement of a PA certificate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">II. Did the Board have standing to file a motion to dismiss Oltman\u2019s petition for judicial review, [even though] the Board failed to file a response to the petition in accordance with Md. Rule 7-204?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Answering \u201cno\u201d to the first question and \u201cyes\u201d to the second, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Oltman, a retired naval officer, was employed as a PA under contract with the United States Navy. In that capacity, he used a Navy physician\u2019s computer to forge prescriptions for his son\u2019s medication, even though he knew that his son\u2019s age made him ineligible for Navy physicians\u2019 services. Oltman then filled the forged prescriptions for free at a Navy pharmacy, even though he knew that his son also was not eligible for such prescription benefits. In addition, Oltman obtained prescriptions from Navy physicians on several occasions from 1997 through 1998, without a physical examination and without notifying the doctors of his son\u2019s ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The Navy pursued misdemeanor criminal charges against Oltman. He pleaded guilty and was convicted in federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of obtaining the prescriptions fraudulently. The Navy terminated Oltman, revoked his military PA privileges, and reported the crimes to the Board. After a contested case hearing, the Board revoked Oltman\u2019s PA certificate in 2003. This Court affirmed that decision in <em>Oltman I, </em>162 Md.App. at 488, 875 A.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In May 2005, Oltman petitioned the Board for reinstatement. Pursuant to its standard procedures for reinstatement petitions, the Board obtained Oltman\u2019s written answers to its written questions, and a reinstatement panel of the Board subsequently met with Oltman and counsel. The panel considered the request in light of Oltman\u2019s criminal and disciplinary history. In particular, the panel reviewed time sheets from the Prison Health Services showing that Oltman had continued his PA practice for 42 days after the August 11, 2003 revocation, despite the Board\u2019s instruction to immediately cease practice and return his PA certificate. Furthermore, the reinstatement panel also considered the Pennsylvania Board of Medicine\u2019s 2005 denial of Oltman\u2019s application to practice as a PA in that State. The Pennsylvania decision reflected that, in the administrative hearing on his Pennsylvania application, Oltman contradicted his prior admissions in the Maryland revocation hearing, by claiming that he \u201cwas not aware that his son was no longer eligible for dependent benefits\u201d at the time he obtained the prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The reinstatement panel determined that Oltman did not establish grounds for reinstatement, because his conduct after the 2003 revocation demonstrated continuing lack of honesty, integrity, and remorse, as well as a failure to understand \u201cthe Board\u2019s serious view of his crimes\u201d or to accept \u201cresponsibility for his actions.\u201d In a Final Order, the Board denied reinstatement and stated that it would not entertain another reinstatement application from Oltman for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Oltman petitioned for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, citing as jurisdictional grounds \u201cMaryland Rule 7-202.\u201d The Board moved to dismiss Oltman\u2019s petition, arguing that Rule 7-202 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>does not confer jurisdiction to review an administrative agency\u2019s decision, and that none of the regulatory statutes governing PAs authorizes judicial review of a decision denying reinstatement. After a hearing, the court agreed with the Board and dismissed Oltman\u2019s petition. Oltman noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">No Statutory Jurisdiction Authorizing Judicial Review Of Reinstatement Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Title 15 of the Health Occupations Article governs physician assistants. Section 15-314 authorizes revocation of a PA certificate, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 15-315 of this subtitle, the Board, on the affirmative vote of a majority of its members then serving, may ... revoke a certificate if the certificate holder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">(1) Fraudulently or deceptively obtains or attempts to obtain a certificate for the applicant or certificate holder or for another individual;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">(2) Fraudulently or deceptively uses a certificate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">(3) Violates any provision of this title or any regulations adopted under this title or commits any act which could serve as the basis for disciplinary action against a physician under \u00a7 14-404 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">(4) Performs delegated medical acts beyond the scope of the certificate not within a delegation agreement approved by the Board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-14\">(5) Performs delegated medical acts without the supervision of a physician----(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">We turn then to [\u00b6] section 14-404, the provision in the Medical Practice Act (MPA) authorizing disciplinary action against physicians for enumerated reasons. As incorporated into [\u00b6] section 15-314, subsection 14-404(b)(l) permits revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>cation on the basis of \u201ccertified docket entries\u201d showing a conviction (whether after trial or a plea of guilty or <em>nolo </em>contendere) for \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude!.]\u201d As detailed in <em>Oltman I, </em>Oltman\u2019s federal convictions qualified as crimes of moral turpitude, meriting revocation of his PA certificate. <em>See Oltman I, </em>162 Md.App. at 488, 875 A.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">[\u00b6] section 15-315 establishes procedural rights in PA disciplinary proceedings, including those resulting in revocation due to convictions for crimes of moral turpitude.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It provides for both a hearing and an appeal on the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">(a) (1) <em>Opportunity for hearing. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided under \u00a7 10-226 of the State Government Article, before the Board takes any action under \u00a7 15-314 of this subtitle, the Board shall give the individual against whom the action is contemplated an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">(2) The hearing officer shall give notice and hold the hearing in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(3) The Board may administer oaths in connection with any proceeding under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">(4) At least 14 days before the hearing, the hearing notice required under this subtitle shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(b) (1) <em>Appeals. </em>\u2014 Any certificate holder who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Board under this subtitle may not appeal to the Board of Review but may take a direct judicial appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">(2) The appeal shall be as provided for judicial review of the final decision in Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article----(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In the 2003 revocation proceedings, Oltman was afforded the appropriate contested case hearing and judicial review. The question raised by Oltman in this appeal is whether he is likewise entitled to such a hearing and judicial review in connection with his 2005 petition for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The circuit court agreed with the Board that it \u201cdoes not have the jurisdiction to entertain a petition for judicial review from the denial of a ... petition for reinstatement\u201d of a PA certificate. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">It is a completely different process when there is a revocation. In other words, when somebody has a certificate and there is a[n] action for revocation that encompasses a proprietary interest that the certificate holder has and deprivation of that certificate cannot be done without some measure of due process and that\u2019s why the statutes allow for a judicial review from that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">But, once somebody has, as a result of contested hearings, appeals and other activity, lost the certificate it has been revoked. He no longer has a proprietary interest. He has nothing at this point other than what the Board grants him as a measure of grace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">I think the fact that there are no standards set out in the statute also suggests that it\u2019s purely a discretionary ... decision with the Board. There is nothing that a [c]ourt would have before it to determine whether or not the Board exercised discretion appropriately or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">There are no statutory standards. There\u2019s no guidelines that say ... so long as somebody meets certain standards they can come back and practice. So I think that is also indicative of the fact that it is purely a matter of grace on the part of the Board and it is not subject to judicial review____ [UJnless there is some statutory authority for judicial review[,] administrative agencies have a certain number of activities that they can engage in that are not subject to judicial review.... I don\u2019t find that either Title 14 or Title 15 of the Health Occupations Article or any other law that I\u2019ve been able to locate has created any such right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to file for judicial review from a denial of a petition for reinstatement after a revocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Oltman argues that the court erred in concluding that it lacked statutory jurisdiction to review denial of his petition for reinstatement. We agree with the reasoning of the circuit court and are not persuaded otherwise by Oltman\u2019s arguments that he is entitled to judicial review of the Board\u2019s reinstatement decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As a threshold matter, we observe that Md. Rule 7-202 does not authorize judicial review of administrative decisions. Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure explicitly applies to \u201cjudicial review of ... an order or action of an administrative agency, where judicial review is authorized by statute[.]\u201d Md. Rule 7-201(a)(emphasis added). This is consistent with the well-established principle that, \u201cin order for an administrative agency\u2019s action properly to be before ... any court[ ] for judicial review, there generally must be a legislative grant of the right to seek judicial review.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 273, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005). Thus, there is typically no right to judicial review of an administrative decision unless that right is established by statute. <em>See, e.g., Urbana Civic Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Urbana Mobile Village, Inc., </em>260 Md. 458, 462-63, 272 A.2d 628 (1971)(court had \u201cno jurisdiction to entertain an appeal\u201d from county commissioners\u2019s decision because \u201ca provision for such judicial review [was] conspicuously absent\u201d from enabling statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">We agree with the circuit court that none of the statutes applicable to Oltman\u2019s reinstatement petition establishes a right to judicial review. The PA Act itself does not authorize such review. Although [\u00b6] section 15-315(b)(l) permits \u201c[a]ny certificate holder who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Board under this subtitle\u201d to \u201ctake a direct judicial appeal[,]\u201d Oltman was no longer a \u201ccertificate holder\u201d at the time the Board denied his petition for reinstatement. When the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, we need not \u201cengage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>NationsBank, 365 </em>Md. 166, 181, 776 A.2d 645 (2001). Section 15-101 cross-defines \u201ccertificate\u201d as \u201ca certificate issued by the Board to a physician assistant under this title\u201d and \u201cphysician assistant\u201d as \u201can individual who is certified under this title[.]\u201d [\u00b6] \u00a7 15 \u2014 101(d), -(m). As a result of the 2003 revocation proceedings, Oltman lost not only his \u201ccertificate,\u201d but also his status as a \u201ccertificate holder\u201d and \u201cphysician assistant,\u201d and thus lost the right to judicial review afforded under section 15 \u2014 315(b) to those who hold such a property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by Oltman\u2019s argument that language in [\u00b6] section 15-308 supports his interpretation of \u201ccertificate holder\u201d as encompassing an individual whose PA certificate has been revoked for crimes of moral turpitude. Nothing in section 15-308 guarantees the contested case hearing and judicial review sought by Oltman. This section pertains only to proceedings to reinstate a PA certificate that expired on its own terms because the PA \u201cfailed to renew it for any reason[.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Nothing in the language or history of this provision suggests that it applies to a person whose PA certificate has been revoked for misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In our view, section 15-308 actually supports the contrary proposition that the appeal rights granted to \u201ccertificate holders\u201d under section 15 \u2014 315(b) do not extend to former PAs whose certificates have been revoked for misconduct. By identifying an individual \u25a0 who is entitled to invoke the reinstatement provisions of section 15-308 as \u201ca physician assistant who has failed to renew the certificate,\u201d the legislature demonstrated that it knows how to distinguish a PA certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>holder from a former certificate holder. Thus, we may not ignore the General Assembly\u2019s selection of the unqualified term \u201ccertificate holder\u201d to identify persons entitled to the hearing and appeal rights afforded under section 15-315. For that reason, the circuit court correctly concluded that the right of judicial review afforded to \u201ccertificate holder[s]\u201d under section 15 \u2014 315(b) does not extend to former certificate holders such as Oltman.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">We also agree that judicial review of a reinstatement decision is not authorized by any of the MPA provisions that have been expressly incorporated by reference into the PA Act. <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-409, \u00a7 15-314, \u00a7 15-315. [\u00b6] section 15-315(d) provides that \u201c[a]ll of the findings and orders of the Board that relate to physician assistants are subject to the provisions of Title 14, Subtitle 4 of this article.\u201d Thus, a petition for reinstatement of a PA certificate is subject to the reinstatement provisions for physicians set forth in [\u00b6] section 14-409. In turn, section 14-409 permits the Board to \u201creinstate the license of an individual whose license has been suspended or revoked,\u201d but does not explicitly provide for judicial review of a reinstatement decision. <em>See </em>[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-409(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Neither is such authorization for judicial review contained in [\u00b6] section 14-408, which governs administrative and judicial review of decisions concerning physician licenses. Instead, section 14-408(a) states that those \u201caggrieved by a final decision ... in a contested case, as defined in the Administrative Procedure Act may ... [ajppeal that decision to the [Physician] Board of Review\u201d and \u201c[t]hen take any further appeal allowed by the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d (APA), <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1984, 2004 RepLVol., 2007 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (SG). Thus, we must look to the APA to determine whether a request to reinstate a PA certificate or a physician\u2019s certificate qualifies as a \u201ccontested case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Section 10-222 of the APA contains the same \u201ccontested case\u201d requirement found in the MPA and incorporated by reference into the PA Act. It provides in pertinent part that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>person who \u201cis aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision as provided in this section[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) A \u201ccontested case\u201d is statutorily defined to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">a proceeding before an agency to determine:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">(i) a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">(ii) the grant, denial, renewal, revocation, suspension, or amendment of a license that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(l) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The APA itself, however, \u201cdoes not grant the right to a hearing. The right must come from another source such as a statute, a regulation, or due process principles.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Md. Waste Disposal, </em>323 Md. 641, 652, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Accordingly, in order to determine whether Oltman has a right to judicial review of the Board\u2019s reinstatement decision as a result of procedural provisions in either the APA or the MPA, as incorporated by the PA Act, we must first determine whether there is any statute that required the Board to conduct a hearing before it ruled on Oltman\u2019s petition. To answer this question, we must return to the PA Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">[\u00b6] section 15-315(a)(l) provides that \u201cbefore the Board takes any action under \u00a7 15-314 ... the Board shall give the individual against whom the action is contemplated an opportunity for a hearing before a hearing officer.\u201d Section 15-314, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>however, governs only proceedings to \u201creprimand [a] certificate holder or suspend or revoke a certificate if the certificate holder\u201d has committed one of the enumerated acts, including \u201cfraudulently or deceptively us[ing] a certificate^]\u201d (Emphasis added.) Notably, section 15-314 does not mention reinstatement proceedings. Moreover, as discussed above, there are clear definitions of \u201ccertificate\u201d and \u201ccertificate holder\u201d that exclude a former PA whose certificate has been revoked for misconduct. Under the unambiguous terms of sections 15-314 and 15-315, therefore, Oltman was not entitled to a hearing on his petition for reinstatement, and therefore the reinstatement proceeding is not a \u201ccontested case\u201d for which judicial review is available. <em>Cf. Holmes v. Robinson, </em>84 Md.App. 144, 150-51, 578 A.2d 294 (1990)(proceeding in which inmate was denied reinstatement to a work release program was not a \u201ccontested case\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 501, 583 A.2d 275 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Having no statutory right to a hearing, Oltman is entitled to a judicial review only if a hearing was constitutionally required in these circumstances. We begin \u2014 and in this instance end \u2014 the procedural due process analysis by asking whether Oltman \u201cwas deprived of a protected property interest.\u201d <em>See City of Annapolis v. Rowe, </em>123 Md.App. 267, 276, 717 A.2d 976 (1998). To establish such a deprivation in this professional licensing context, Oltman must show that he has a vested interest in the reinstatement of his certificate, even after it was revoked for misconduct. This he cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">To be sure, Oltman had a protected property interest in his PA certificate before it was revoked. <em>Cf. Stillman v. Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline, </em>291 Md. 390, 405, 435 A.2d 747 (1981)(\u201cThe right to practice medicine is a property right of which a physician cannot be deprived without due process of law\u201d). But Oltman received the full panoply of hearing and judicial review protections during the revocation proceedings. Once his PA certificate was properly revoked, Oltman no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>longer had a property interest to protect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the Board had discretion to grant or deny reinstatement of the certificate. Indeed, such discretionary authority \u201cdefeats [any] claim of a property interest.\u201d <em>Security Mgmt. Corp. v. Baltimore Co., </em>104 Md.App. 234, 246, 655 A.2d 1326, <em>cert. denied, </em>339 Md. 643, 664 A.2d 886 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1115, 116 S.Ct. 917, 133 L.Ed.2d 847 (1996); <em>see also Bloch v. Powell, </em>348 F.3d 1060, 1069 (D.C.Cir.2003)(Supreme Court decisions \u201cmake discretion the touchstone of the due process analysis in the property context\u201d); <em>Biser v. Town of Bel Air, </em>991 F.2d 100, 104 (4th Cir.), (\u201cif [an] ... agency has \u2018any significant discretion\u2019 in determining whether a permit should issue, then a claimant has no legitimate claim of entitlement, and, hence, no cognizable property interest\u201d for due process purposes); <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 864, 114 S.Ct. 182, 126 L.Ed.2d 141 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Accordingly, Oltman is a former certificate holder who is aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision that he cannot become a current certificate holder. There is no language in the PA Act or the APA requiring a contested case hearing or judicial review for such persons. We hold that the circuit court correctly concluded that it lacks statutory jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s denial of Oltman\u2019s petition for reinstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Board\u2019s Standing To Move For Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Md.

No other allegations are necessary.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(b) Preliminary Motion. <em>A person may file with the response a preliminary motion addressed to standing, venue, timeliness of filing, or any other matter that would defeat a petitioner\u2019s right to judicial remew. </em>Except for venue, failure to file a preliminary motion does not constitute waiver of an issue. A preliminary motion shall be served upon the petitioner and the agency. (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Oltman contends that the Board lacked standing to file its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, because it was required to file a response to his petition for judicial review either before or at the same time it moved to dismiss that petition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Md. Rule 7-202 clearly contemplates what happened here, <em>ie., </em>that the Board may challenge a petitioner\u2019s right to obtain judicial review of its decision via a \u201cpreliminary motion.\u201d Nothing in the language or history of the rule suggests that the right to file such a preliminary motion is contingent on the Board simultaneously filing a separate response to the merits of the petition for judicial review. Moreover, reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the rule to create such a contingency defies common sense. Here, the Board\u2019s filing of a motion to dismiss adequately demonstrated that the Board \u201cintends to participate in the action\u201d in order to contest the right to judicial review. \u201cNo other allegations are necessary.\u201d Md. Rule 7-202(a). Once the Board prevailed on its motion, there was no longer any action for judicial review and therefore, no reason for the Board to file another response for the illogical purpose of indicating an intent to participate in a dismissed case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-12\">. Given our decision regarding jurisdiction and standing, we do not review the merits of these findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">. In contrast, [\u00b6] section 15-313 governs Board proceedings that result in denial of a certificate, rejection of a delegation agreement, or modification of such an agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. [\u00b6] section 15-308, governing reinstatement of an expired PA certificate, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">The Board, in accordance with its regulations, shall reinstate the certificate of a physician assistant who has failed to renew the certificate for any reason if the physician assistant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">(1) Meets the renewal requirements of \u00a7 15-307 of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">(2) Pays to the Board the reinstatement fee set by the Board; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">(3) Submits to the Board satisfactory evidence of compliance with the qualifications and requirements established under this subtitle for certificate reinstatements.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">. We note that the term \"contested case\u201d is further defined to exclude \"a proceeding before an agency involving an agency hearing required only by regulation unless the regulation expressly, or by clear implication, requires the hearing to be held in accordance with this subtitle.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-202(d)(2). Oltman does not contend that there is such a regulation requiring a hearing on his petition for reinstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. Our conclusion is consistent with decisions cited by the Board for the proposition that the former holder of a professional license does not have the requisite property interest to invoke due process protections. <em>See, e.g., Burkhalter v. Tex. Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>918 S.W.2d 1 (Tex.Ct.App.1996) (\"Since appellant's license has been revoked, we cannot say that substantive due process rights attach to non-existent property\u201d); <em>Limongelli v. N.J. State Bd. of Dentistry, </em>137 N.J. 317, 645 A.2d 677, 682 (1993) (former dentist whose license had been revoked for criminal misconduct did not have a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to reinstatement under due process principles); <em>Flanzer v. Bd. of Dental Examiners of Cal., </em>220 Cal.App.3d 1392, 271 Cal.Rptr. 583, 586 (1990) (\"an applicant for reinstatement ... is not in the position of an untried newcomer, but a fallen licentiate\u201d); <em>Keeley v. Pa. Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>93 Pa.Cmwlth. 291, 501 A.2d 1155, 1158 (1985) (\"once [a] license has, been revoked, ... that individual is stripped of whatever property interest he possessed in the license through a procedure consistent with the individual due process guarantees\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\">. Oltman does not argue that the court had inherent jurisdiction. <em>Cf. Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 277, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005)(court's \u201cinherent power of judicial review of administrative decisions ... is extremely limited\u201d). Nor did he seek the equivalent of \"administrative mandamus\u201d relief. <em>Cf </em>Md. Rules 7-401 <em>etseq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
