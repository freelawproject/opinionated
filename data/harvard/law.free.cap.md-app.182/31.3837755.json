On December 4, 2004, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) upheld the finding of the Department and signed an order allowing the Department to \u201cidentify ... [Mrs. Owens] as an individual responsible for indicated child neglect in a central registry and in other files.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In response to the ALJ\u2019s findings, Mrs. Owens filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, but that court, for reasons not here material, dismissed her petition. This Court, in an unreported decision filed November 29, 2006, reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the circuit court. On remand, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Mrs. Owens filed a second appeal, in which she advances three arguments, viz: (1) the ALJ erred when he denied her motion to dismiss the Department\u2019s finding of neglect because the Department failed to complete its investigation -within 60 days as required by a Maryland statute; (2) the ALJ erred when he found that Mrs. Owens had accepted responsibility for the care, custody, and supervision of Sandy; and (3) there was a lack of substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mrs. Owens ordered Sandy to leave her home in September 2001 and, therefore, there was no evidentiary basis for the ALJ\u2019s finding of indicated child neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">An ALJ conducted a hearing on October 28, 2004, concerning Mrs. Owens\u2019 alleged neglect of Sandy. At the hearing three witnesses testified: (1) Patrick Emecheta, an employee of the Department; (2) Mrs. Owens; and (3) Derrick A. Owens, Mrs. Owens\u2019 husband. In addition, the Department introduced into evidence thirty-three pages from its file con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>cerning the investigation into the allegation that Sandy had been neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Sandy was born in March, 1986 and is now twenty-two years old. She was abandoned by her mother, Tiffany, when she was an infant. Sandy\u2019s father has been in prison for most of Sandy\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">From the time Sandy was three months old until she was twelve, she lived with her paternal grandmother and step-grandfather in North Carolina. Sandy\u2019s paternal grandmother died when she was twelve. Thereafter, she continued to live with her step-grandfather for about two years. Sandy was never adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">In 1999, when Sandy was thirteen years old, she gave birth, in North Carolina, to a daughter. To further complicate matters, at about the same time, Sandy\u2019s step-grandfather became ill with prostate cancer and could no longer look after Sandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In December 1999, Mrs. Owens\u2019 sister, Dinicia McNeal, received a call from an elderly aunt who lived in North Carolina. The caller told Ms. McNeil that someone had to come to North Carolina immediately or else Sandy and her infant daughter would be turned over to the North Carolina\u2019s Department of Social Services and would be put in foster care. Ms. McNeil called Mrs. Owens and told her of Sandy\u2019s plight. The next morning, Mrs. Owens, her husband, and Ms. McNeil left for North Carolina. In Mrs. Owens\u2019 words, she and her sister made the trip because \u201cwe were the only family [Sandy] had.\u201d After the threesome arrived in North Carolina, they picked up Sandy at her step-grandfather\u2019s house and then picked up Sandy\u2019s baby at a \u201ccare-giver\u2019s house.\u201d Next, without contacting North Carolina authorities, Mrs. Owens, her husband, and Ms. McNeil took Sandy and her baby to Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. When they arrived in Maryland, Mrs. Owens and Ms. McNeil \u201cjointly\u201d decided that Ms. McNeil would take care of the infant and Mrs. Owens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>would take care of Sandy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Thereafter, Sandy moved into the home of Mrs. Owens and her husband in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Also living in the house were the Owens\u2019 two pre-teen daughters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mrs. Owens thereafter obtained a letter from Sandy\u2019s incarcerated father (Mrs. Owens\u2019 brother) that authorized Mrs. Owens to enroll Sandy in the Prince George\u2019s County school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">For the next two years (approximately), Mrs. Owens and her husband provided Sandy with a good home. In return, Mrs. Owens received $300.00 per month from the Department-starting in January, 2000. Nevertheless, Mrs. Owens did not profit from caring for Sandy because she voluntarily paid the $300.00 to Ms. McNeil in order to help the latter pay for daycare expenses for Sandy\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In late August or early September, 2001, when Sandy was fifteen and one-half years old, Sandy left Mrs. Owens\u2019 house and went to live with a neighbor named Tina Latamore. The reason Sandy left was a matter of dispute at the hearing before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Mr. Emecheta testified that the Department received a report that Mrs. Owens had put Sandy out of the house because she had broken into the Owens\u2019 home five times. Mr. Emecheta was assigned to investigate the report of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">On September 11, 2001, Mr. Emecheta went to the home of Ms. Latamore, the person with whom Sandy had been staying for about a week. Ms. Latamore advised that she had temporarily taken Sandy in because Mr. and Mrs. Owens had kicked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Sandy out of the house. Ms. Latamore advised that although she had provided Sandy with a temporary place to stay and with food, she was no longer willing to care for her. The next day, September 12, 2001, Mr. Emecheta interviewed Sandy, who told him that she had been living with Mrs. Owens and her husband but that they would not let her back into their home. According to Mr. Emecheta, on the same day, September 12, 2001, he spoke with Mrs. Owens and her husband. Mrs. Owens advised that she had taken Sandy in at the request of a North Carolina Social Service Agency because Sandy\u2019s grandparents had died. At the time Mrs. Owens had taken Sandy into her care, the whereabouts of Sandy\u2019s mother were unknown and Sandy\u2019s father was incarcerated. Both Mr. and Mrs. Owens said that Sandy was out of control and had broken into their house four or five times. Mrs. Owens also told Mr. Emecheta in his September 12th interview that although she had taken care of Sandy for the past two years, she would not take her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Mr. Emecheta also interviewed Sandy\u2019s mother, Tiffany, who said that she thought that Sandy\u2019s grandparents had adopted Sandy. Mr. Emecheta researched that point and found that there was no record of an adoption in North Carolina. Tiffany further advised Mr. Emecheta that even though she was Sandy\u2019s biological mother, she did not know her daughter and did not want to take her in because to do so would disturb the peace of her new family. The \u201cnew\u201d family included a husband and five children.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">According to Mr. Emecheta\u2019s testimony, he had four sources upon which he based his conclusion that Mrs. Owens had \u201ckicked out\u201d Sandy from her home about a week before his interview with appellant on September 12, 2001. Those sources were: Ms. Latamore, Sandy, Mrs. Owens, and Mr. Owens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Mr. Emecheta further testified that he met with Mrs. Owens and her husband for a second time on October 4, 2001, at a CINA (Child in Need of Assistance) hearing held at the courthouse in Prince George\u2019s County. During that conversation he told Mrs. Owens that he would not charge her with neglect if she would agree to take Sandy back into her care. Mrs. Owens refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Mrs. Owens and her husband testified that they did not kick Sandy out of their home. Instead, Sandy, on her own volition, started to spend more and more time at Ms. Latamore\u2019s home. According to the Owens\u2019 account, Sandy would stay at the neighbor\u2019s house in the company of her boyfriend, William, age seventeen. Sandy sometimes stayed with Ms. Latamore for several nights in a row. Mrs. Owens further testified that she and her brother had contacted the Department earlier in September 2001 and asked what options were available in order to give Sandy \u201csome help.\u201d The Department advised that there was an independent living program that might be available but they needed to bring Sandy to the Department so that it could be determined whether she was eligible for that program. Mrs. Owens attempted to take Sandy into the Department but Sandy refused to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Mrs. Owens also testified that on September 5, 2001 she, her husband, and her brother (Michael Adams) went across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the street to Ms. Latamore\u2019s house. They paid this visit because Sandy had failed to come home the previous evening. Ms. Latamore was at work. Their knock on the door was answered by Sandy\u2019s boyfriend. The boyfriend advised that Sandy \u201cwasn\u2019t coming out and wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d Mrs. Owens then summoned the police. The police arrived at Ms. Latamore\u2019s house but the officers were unsuccessful in getting Sandy to come out.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Both Mrs. Owens and her husband contradicted Mr. Emecheta\u2019s testimony that he had talked to them on September 12, 2001. According to the Owens\u2019 testimony, they only talked to Mr. Emecheta once and that was at the October 4, 2001, CINA hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The Sixty Day Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The Department received its first report of suspected neglect concerning Sandy on September 5, 2001. The Department\u2019s investigation was not completed until January 25, 2002, which was 142 days after receipt of the first report of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Maryland Code (2004), Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d), section 5-706 reads, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u00a7 5-706.

According to appellant, because of the mandatory nature of the requirement, dismissal of the neglect charge \u201cwas the appropriate sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The ALJ rejected Mrs. Owens\u2019 request to dismiss for the following reasons: (1) no penalty is attached for the Department\u2019s failure to abide by the 60-day time limit to conduct the investigation pursuant to COMAR 07.02.07.09;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>was not deprived of her right to appeal; and (3) appellant suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Many Maryland appellate decisions have wrestled with the meaning and effect of the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in various statutes. Judge Thomas Hunter Lowe, speaking for this Court in <em>Pope v. Secretary of Personnel, </em>46 Md.App. 716, 420 A.2d 1017 (1980), provided a good summary of the case law as of 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u2014the trend\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">The word \u201cshall\u201d has probably occupied the erudition of the Court of Appeals more than any other single term. In recent years the Court of Appeals has with increasing rigidity applied the principle of statutory construction that use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is presumed mandatory. <em>Hirsch v. Dept. of Nat\u2019l Resources, </em>288 Md. 95, 416 A.2d 10 (1980); <em>In re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 410 A.2d 586 (1980); <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 384 A.2d 709 (1978); <em>United States Coin &amp; Currency v. Dir., </em>279 Md. 185, 367 A.2d 1243 (1977); Moss <em>v. Director, </em>279 Md. 561, 369 A.2d 1011 (1977); <em>Bright v. Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., </em>275 Md. 165, 338 A.2d 248 (1975). A practical qualifying pressure valve \u2014 \u201cunless the context of the statute would indicate otherwise\u201d \u2014 is invariably adhered to a recitation of that principle. <em>See, e.g., Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A.2d 718 (1974); <em>Ginnavan v. Silverstone, </em>246 Md. 500, 505, 229 A.2d 124 (1967).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>While the context of fewer and fewer statutes \u201cindicate otherwise,\u201d one of the contextual factors relied upon, \u201cthought not controlling,\u201d <em>to hold the use of \u201cshall\u201d directory is when a statute provides no penalty for failure to act within a prescribed time. See Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, supra </em>at 533, 325 A.2d 718; <em>but see In re James S., supra. </em>The case law provides very little in the nature of when or how to prognosticate where the exception should overcome the presumption. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>for example, acknowledged a statute governing the assignment of criminal cases for trial in which the term \u201cshall\u201d was held to be directory in <em>Young v. State, </em>266 Md. 438, 294 A.2d 467 (1972), for the reason that the Legislature had not explicitly provided the extreme sanction of dismissal for administrative noncompliance. 285 Md. at 316, 403 A.2d 356. By having enacted a rule using the identical language of the statute which also lacked explicit sanctions, the Court of Appeals decided in <em>Hicks </em>that in the context of its rule, \u201cshall\u201d was intended to be mandatory. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">There is, however, a thread of continuity in one line of cases perceived and commented upon by Judge Smith writing for the Court in <em>In re James S., supra. </em>Since 1908, the Court of Appeals has stood firmly upon the premise that Art. IV, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution is directory only when it admonishes that the Court of Appeals \u201cshall\u201d file its opinions within three months of argument. <em>McCall\u2019s Ferry Co. v. Price, </em>108 Md. 96, 113, 69 A. 832 (1908). Similarly, a like provision for the circuit courts has been consistently interpreted as directory and not mandatory. <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Hirsch, </em>274 Md. 368, 374, 335 A.2d 108 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1012, 95 S.Ct. 2638, 45 L.Ed.2d 676 (1975); <em>Davidson v. Katz, </em>254 Md. 69, 78, 255 A.2d 49 (1969); <em>Pressley v. Warden, </em>242 Md. 405, 406-407, 219 A.2d 25 (1966); <em>Myers v. State, </em>218 Md. 49, 51, 145 A.2d 228 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 945, 79 S.Ct. 731, 3 L.Ed.2d 678 (1959); <em>Suttleman v. Bd. of Liq. Lic. Com\u2019rs., </em>209 Md. 134, 140, 120 A.2d 388 (1956); <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360, 46 A.2d 607 (1946). These cases were discussed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Judge Smith in <em>Resetar v. State Bd. of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 399 A.2d 225 (1979), while giving similar consideration to a county board of education mandate upon itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cThe Board shall ... render a decision ... within thirty (30) days....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">The thread apparent in each of these cases which continued to digress from the contemporary trend, is that the directory duty imposed is on the \u201carbiter of the controversy\u201d as opposed to the adversary. <em>In re James S., supra </em>at 708, 410 A.2d 586.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 420 A.2d 1017 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">More recently in <em>Woodfield v. West River Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>395 Md. 377, 388-90, 910 A.2d 452 (2006), the Court of Appeals focused on the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in Maryland Code (2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 2(B), section 16-101(e)(3). In <em>Woodfield, </em>the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">Unless extended by the court for good cause, the local licensing board\u2019s decision made under subsection (a) of this section <em>shall </em>be affirmed, modified, or reversed by the circuit court within 90 days after the record has been filed in the court by the local licensing board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">In <em>Woodfield, </em>Judge Wilner, speaking for the Court, said: We shall consider first the issue of whether the circuit court lost jurisdiction or authority to render a decision once the 90-day period specified in \u00a7 16 \u2014 101(e)(3) of Art. 2B expired. As an alternative ground for holding that authority was not lost, a majority of the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the statute was \u201cdirectory\u201d rather than \u201cmandatory.\u201d We shall not decide the issue precisely on that basis, because, though certainly traditional, <em>the mandatory/directory approach to determining the consequences of a failure to comply with a statutory command is an artificial one that addresses the appropriate question in a circular fashion. </em>In <em>Tucker v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 295, 297-98, 598 A.2d 479 (1991), which dealt with a somewhat similar matter \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>failure of a judicial panel to render a decision within the time set in a statute \u2014 the Court of Special Appeals observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">\u201cIn dealing with statutory commands, including time provisions such as these, courts often speak in terms of whether they are \u2018mandatory\u2019 or merely \u2018directory\u2019____ The suggestion implicit from such an analysis is that, if the command is \u2018mandatory,\u2019 some fairly drastic sanction must be imposed upon a finding of noncompliance, whereas if the command is \u2018directory,\u2019 noncompliance, will result in some lesser penalty, or perhaps no penalty at all. That, indeed, is really the issue. When a legislative body commands that something be done, using words such as \u2018shall\u2019 or \u2018must,\u2019 rather than \u2018may\u2019 or \u2018should,\u2019 we must assume, absent some evidence to the contrary, that it was serious and that it meant for the thing to be done in the manner it directed. In that sense, the obligation to comply with the statute (or rule) is both mandatory and directory. <em>The relevant question in such a case is whether the sanction sought for noncompliance is an appropriate one.\u201d See also Thanos v. State, </em>332 Md. 511, 522, 632 A.2d 768 (1993); <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 82, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001); <em>Gorge v. State, </em>386 Md. 600, 613, 873 A.2d 1171 (2005), quoting with approval from <em>Tucker.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">The <em>Tucker </em>Court noted that this Court had essentially adopted that view, with respect to commands found in the Maryland Rules, in its promulgation of Maryland Rule 1-201. The court observed that, although Rule l-201(a) applies only to the construction of the Maryland Rules, the standards espoused in it are equally applicable to statutory commands, and that \u201c[e]ven when applying a \u2018mandatory/directory\u2019 standard, the <em>courts have essentially looked to the context of the enactment and ultimately to the legislative intent in determinating what, if any, sanction to impose for noncompliance.\u201d Tucker v. State, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 298, 598 A.2d at 481. Thus, \u201c[i]f the legislative body has provided a sanction for noncompliance, its intent is clear, and that sanction, if lawful, i.e., constitutional, has ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>been applied[,]\u201d but \u201c[i]f no clear sanction has been provided, <em>the court has attempted to discern the overall purpose of the statute and then determine which, if any, sanction will best further that purpose.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 910 A.2d 452 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Similar to the situation presented in <em>Woodfield, </em>in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the statute at issue does not provide a sanction for noncompliance \"with the 60 day requirement. Therefore, we shall look to the overall purpose of the statute to determine whether dismissal would further the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Section 5-706 of the Family Law Article is found under subtitle 7, which is entitled Child Abuse and Neglect. Section 5-702, which sets forth the legislative policy and the purpose of subtitle 7, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">The purpose of this subtitle <em>is to protect children who have been the subject of abuse or neglect </em>by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">(1) mandating the reporting of any suspected abuse or neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">(2) giving immunity to any individual who reports, in good faith, a suspected incident of abuse or neglect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">(3) <em>requiring prompt investigation of each reported suspected incident of abuse or neglect;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">(4) causing immediate, cooperative efforts by the responsible agencies on behalf of children who have been the subject of reports of abuse or neglect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-13\">(5) requiring each local department to give the appropriate service in the best interest of the abused or neglected child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">The expressed purpose of the 60 day provisions set forth in FL \u00a7 5-706(g)(2) is to protect children by attempting to ensure that after a report of neglect or abuse comes to the attention of the Department, more then 60 days should not elapse before a report is completed by the Department. Nothing in the subtitle indicates that its purpose is to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>persons charged with neglect or abuse. Instead, as stated in section 5-702, the purpose is to protect neglect and abuse victims. This last point was emphasized in <em>Horridge v. St. Mary\u2019s County Department of Social Services, </em>382 Md., 170, 854 A.2d 1232, (2004) where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">The duties imposed on DSS by FL \u00a7 5-706 and the implementing regulations of the Department of Human Resources ... require a prompt investigation of <em>each </em>reported incident of child abuse. The duty to act is mandatory; the steps to be taken are clearly delineated; and, <em>most important, the statute makes clear in several places that the sole and specific objective of the requirement is the protection of a specific class of children-those identified in or identifiable from specific reports made to DSS and those also found in the home or in the care or custody of the alleged abuser. </em>This is not an obligation that runs to everyone in general and no one in particular. It runs to an identified or identifiable child or discrete group of children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The Department bolsters its argument that dismissal is an inappropriate sanction by accurately setting forth the relevant legislative history of FL \u00a7 5-706(g), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">In 1966, the General Assembly first legislated a ten-day timeframe for local departments to complete child abuse investigations. The stated purpose of this legislation was to ensure that there would be no delays in the local welfare department providing services, including petitioning the Court to remove the child from his or her home, based on the findings. <em>See </em>1966 Laws of Maryland ch. 221. The law provided no appeal rights, and thus could not have been enacted to confer procedural rights on appellants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">In 1986, when the legislature extended the timeframe for making a final report to sixty days (thirty days with a possible thirty-day extension), it did so to \u201callow investigators to complete full and accurate reports regarding <em>child abuse investigations.\u201d See </em>1986 Laws of Maryland ch. 200; Senate Judiciary Proceedings Committee, Summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Committee Report on HB 390 at p. 2. Delegate Hixon, who introduced the bill, noted that \u201cHB 390 <em>mil require the reporting agency to give immediate and continued attention to each case, but allow them the necessary time to complete a thorough and accurate report.\u201d </em>She noted the \u201ctragedy\u201d of child abuse and neglect in Maryland, stating that HB 390, while addressing just one aspect of the problem, was \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d Testimony on HB 390 at 2. <em>In 1987, the timeframes were made applicable to investigations of child neglect as well as child abuse. </em>1987 Laws of Maryland ch. 635 at pp. 2950-2951.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Insofar as it concerns legislative history, Mrs. Owens\u2019 brief is also accurate when she states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">In 1987, Senate Bill 708 consolidated the Child abuse and Child neglect subtitles into one new subtitle, \u201cSubtitle 7. Child Abuse and Neglect.\u201d <em>See </em>1987 Md. Laws, ch. 635. The purpose for the consolidation was twofold. First, the consolidation was to \u201cbring the obligations imposed upon both professionals and nonprofessionals to report suspected instances of Child abuse and neglect into <em>parity.\u201d See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee: Bill Analysis, Senate Bill 708, p. 3. Second, the Maryland Senate wanted to change the previous direction to local departments to \u201cpromptly and thoroughly investigate reports of suspected neglect,\u201d and replace it with the specific requirements as applied to investigations of suspected abuse. The new Subtitle 7 included section 5-706, investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Addressing the legislative intent of section 5-706(g)(2), appellant\u2019s argument, in a nutshell, is as follows: inasmuch as the General Assembly used the word \u201cshall\u201d in regard to the time limit for the completion, by the Department, of its investigation of child abuse and neglect, the General Assembly must have intended that dismissal was the appropriate sanction for noncompliance. In support of this argument, appellant cites only two cases: <em>In re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 410 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>A.2d 586 (1980) and <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In <em>State v. Hicks, </em>the Court of Appeals was required to interpret Maryland Rule 746, which required that \u201ca trial date shall be set no later then 120 days after the appearance or waiver of counsel or after the appearance of defendant before the court.\u201d 285 Md. at 312, 403 A.2d 356. The rule did not provide a sanction for noncompliance. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held in <em>Hicks </em>that the time requirements in Rule 746 were mandatory and required dismissal of the charges for noncompliance, in the absence of an expressed waiver by the defendant or extraordinary good cause found by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18, 403 A.2d 356. In reaching this conclusion, the Court examined the purpose of the rule and concluded that it was \u201cintended to ... put teeth into a new [statute] governing the assignment of criminal cases for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318, 403 A.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In <em>In re James S., supra, </em>the Court of Appeals examined a provision of the Juvenile Delinquency Act requiring that a delinquency petition \u201cshall be filed within 15 days after the receipt of a referral from the intake officer.\u201d 286 Md. at 703, 410 A.2d 586. Notwithstanding the absence of a sanction in the statute, the Court held that failure to meet the 15 day deadline required the sanction of dismissal of the petition. <em>Id. </em>at 713-14, 410 A.2d 586. The Court of Appeals reached its decision after noting the similarity of the operative words of the statute to those of many statutes of limitations set forth in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In light of the aforementioned similarity in language, the Court said: \u201cNo one would contend seriously that the language of these limitations statutes is directory rather then mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 410 A.2d 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In the case of <em>In re Keith W., </em>310 Md. 99, 527 A.2d 35 (1987), the Court dealt with the requirements of Maryland Rule 914, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">An adjudicatory hearing shall be held -within sixty days after the juvenile petition is served on the respondent unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>a waiver petition is filed, in which case an adjudicatory hearing <em>shall be held within thirty days after the court\u2019s decision to retain jurisdiction at the conclusion of the waiver hearing. </em>However, upon motion made on the record within these time limits by the petitioner or the respondent, the administrative judge of the county or a judge designated by him, for extraordinary cause shown, may extend the time within which the adjudicatory hearing may be held. The judge shall state on the record the cause which requires an extension and specify the number of days of the extension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 101-02, 527 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Keith W., a juvenile, was charged with drug offenses but was not tried within the time limits set forth in Rule 914. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 527 A.2d 35. Keith W. moved for dismissal of the juvenile petition. The motion was denied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The <em>In re Keith W. </em>Court commenced its discussion by acknowledging that the language of Rule 914 and the rule at issue in <em>Hicks </em>contained nearly \u201cidentical language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 527 A.2d 35. The Court added, however, that \u201cit did not necessarily follow that a violation of each rule justifies an identical sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103-06, 527 A.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The Court distinguished its earlier <em>In re James S. </em>decision in the following manner: viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">Our decision in <em>James S. </em>is entirely consistent with our line of decisions that have looked to a statute\u2019s or rule\u2019s function or purpose to determine whether dismissal was an appropriate sanction for a violation thereof. When we reviewed \u00a7 3 \u2014 812(b) in <em>James S., </em>we were \u201cstruck by the similarity between the language used in [\u00a7 3 \u2014 812(b) ] and that [used] in the various limitations of actions found in Code (1974, 1979 Cum.Supp.) Title 6, Subtitle 1, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711, 410 A.2d 586. Accordingly, we concluded that \u00a7 3-812(b) was like any other statute of limitations and dismissal with prejudice was the required sanction when the statute\u2019s time limitations were not met. <em>Id. </em>at 713, 410 A.2d 586. <em>Clearly, Rule 911 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>is not a statute of limitations and, thus, James S. is inapposite.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 108, 527 A.2d 35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The cases relied upon by Mrs. Owens can be distinguished on the same grounds as those set forth in <em>In re Keith W. </em>The purpose of subtitle 7 is to protect children \u2014 not to protect persons alleged to have neglected or abused children. That purpose will not be served by dismissing charges in cases where the Department fails to complete its investigation within 60 days. Section 5-706(g) does not deal with the date for commencement of proceedings against the person alleged to have abused or neglected a child. Such proceedings are commenced pursuant to FL \u00a7 5-706.1. Therefore, it is clear that section 5-706(g) is not worded like a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d, as was the case in <em>In re James S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Lastly, we note that if the result advocated by appellant were to be obtained, it would mean that no matter what abuse or neglect had been visited upon a minor child, the Department could not list the perpetrators in its registry if the investigation was not completed within 60 days. Such an interpretation would likely damage children-not protect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For the above reasons, we hold that the ALJ was correct when he ruled that dismissal of the allegation of abuse was not required as a sanction for the Department\u2019s failure to meet the 60 day requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">The Administrative Law Judge erred when concluding as a matter of law that [Mrs. Owens] had responsibility for the care, custody, and supervision of the Child and the Circuit Court compounded the error by affirming without explanation the ALJ\u2019s finding. Whether [Mrs. Owens] was a person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of the Child is a question of law. Therefore, the reviewing court is not constrained to affirm the agency where its orders are premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Whether the circuit court should have given an explanation as to why it agrees with the ALJ has no significance in an administrative appeal like this one. Our job is to perform the same task as that performed by the circuit court. <em>See Tochterman v. Baltimore County, </em>163 Md.App. 385, 404-05, 880 A.2d 1118 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The ALJ found that Mrs. Owens was guilty of neglect of Sandy. Neglect is defined in FL \u00a7 5-701(s) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">(s) <em>Neglect. </em>\u2014 \u201cNeglect\u201d means the leaving of a child unattended or other failure to give proper care and attention to a child by any parent <em>or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of the child </em>under circumstances that indicate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">(1) that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed <em>or </em>placed at substantial risk of harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>(2) mental injury to the child or a substantial risk of mental injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In his written opinion, the ALJ said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Undeniably, [Mrs. Owens] for whatever reason, voluntarily went to North Carolina during 1999, and brought Sandy to Maryland to live with her ... family. <em>The evidence is clear that [Mrs. Owens] at least for a two-year period, had permanent care and custody of Sandy. </em>As demonstrated by [Mrs. Owens\u2019] integration of Sandy into her home by providing her food, shelter, and clothing. Additionally, [Mrs. Owens] secured the necessary documents and enrolled Sandy in the Prince George\u2019s County public school system. Clearly, [Mrs. Owens] made a commitment to care for and raise Sandy. Additionally, in view of the [a]ppellant\u2019s care of Sandy subsequent to 1999, her argument that Sandy\u2019s mother, who barely knows the child, is the responsible parent, is also unconvincing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The facts relied upon by the ALJ were all supported by substantial evidence. Mrs. Owens does not argue otherwise. Instead, she argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">The ALJ did not cite legal authority for how the three (3) factors attributed to the Petitioner caused her to have <em>responsibility </em>for the care, custody and supervision of the child as compared to the Natural Mother. The failure to cite legal authority by the ALJ constitutes a prima facie failure to apply the applicable law because Maryland appellate courts have consistently held that the natural or biological parent has the presumptive right, and by way of implication, a presumptive responsibility as compared to any third party that cannot be challenged unless there is an initial finding that the natural or biological parent is unfit. <em>(See McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005) and <em>Tedesco v. Tedesco, </em>111 Md.App. 648, 683 A.2d 1133 (1996)). In the instant case neither the Worker nor the ALJ even attempted to address the presumed fitness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Natural Mother, but rather chose to simply endorse the Natural Mother\u2019s rejection of her daughter so as to avoid any change in the mother\u2019s lifestyle. This unexplained acquiescence obviated the legal responsibility that presumptively obligates a natural parent to provide care, custody, and supervision to their child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Neither of the cases cited by appellant are apposite. Both <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>385 Md. 320, 869 A.2d 751 (2005), and <em>Tedesco v. Tedesco, </em>111 Md.App. 648, 683 A.2d 1133 (1996), are child custody cases. Neither case has anything to do with a case like this one where a relative voluntarily assumed responsibility for the care of a child when the natural parents were unwilling (like Sandy\u2019s mother) or unable (like Sandy\u2019s father) to provide care.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We fail to see why it was necessary for the ALJ to cite \u201clegal authority\u201d for his determination. The ALJ read the statute and reached the conclusion that appellant had assumed responsibility for Sandy\u2019s care based on undisputed facts. The undisputed facts showed that appellant had undertaken responsibility for Sandy\u2019s care for a period of almost two years. Appellant took Sandy into her home and treated her like a daughter, obtained permission from Sandy\u2019s father to enroll her in Prince George\u2019s County schools, cared for Sandy, attempted to discipline her, and made arrangements with governmental authorities to provide her with money for the care of Sandy and Sandy\u2019s infant daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellant stresses that she was a \u201cmodern day good Samaritan\u201d who had no \u201clegal responsibility\u201d to perform the good work she undertook. It is certainly true that prior to December, 1999, appellant had no legal responsibility to take Sandy into her home and care for her. But by her actions she voluntarily assumed that responsibility. <em>See </em>footnote 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">For the aforegoing reasons we hold that the ALJ did not err when he found that in September 2001 appellant was responsible for the care of Sandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Appellant next argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">The ALJ made a finding of fact that in early September 2001, the Petitioner\u2019s Husband ordered Sandy to leave the home, and would not allow Sandy to return to the home. The ALJ also found that the Petitioner concurred with her Husband\u2019s action. The Circuit Court affirmed again without explanation these [sic] Findings of the ALJ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">After reviewing the record, specifically the testimony of the Petitioner and her Husband, it is clear that these findings are not supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">This argument is without merit. As mentioned earlier, Mr. Emecheta testified that both Mr. and Mrs. Owens told him that they had \u201ckicked\u201d Sandy out of the house. Moreover, according to Mr. Emecheta\u2019s unobjeeted-to testimony, when he talked to Sandy and to Ms. Latamore, they both told him the same story.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">It is true that the testimony of Mrs. Owens and her husband contradicted Mr. Emecheta\u2019s testimony inasmuch as they denied having evicted Sandy from their home. But, self-evidently, it was the ALJ\u2019s prerogative to evaluate the credibility of the witness. He evidently believed Mr. Emecheta and disbelieved the Owens in this regard. Under such circumstances, the ALJ\u2019s finding that appellant had \u201ckicked out\u201d Sandy from her home and refused to provide for her needs was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">The outcome of this case is regrettable. It certainly appears that Mrs. Owens tried her best to help her niece become a law abiding citizen but, through no fault on her part, could not convince Sandy to abide by the (quite reasonable) rules of the Owens\u2019 household. If we were the fact-finders, it is entirely possible that we would have reached a result different from the one arrived at by the ALJ. But we, as appellate judges, do not find facts or evaluate the credibility of witnesses. ' Instead, our job, in cases like this one, is to: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>review the evidence presented to the ALJ and determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s factual findings; and (2) decide whether the ALJ committed legal error. Using that criteria, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">.

Appellant devotes two sentences in her brief to a contention that her rights to due process of law were violated by the Department's failure to complete its investigation within 60-days. Appellant\u2019s argument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">If the mandatory time requirement provisions of \u00a7 5-706(g)(2) are simply ignored by the [Department], the due process rights of persons such as ...
