COLLYER, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Papst Licensing GmbH <em>&amp; </em>Co. KG, a German company, sues multiple manufacturers of digital cameras for alleged infringement of two patents owned by Papst: U.S. Patent Number 6,470,399 (399 Patent) and U.S. Patent Number 6,895,449 (449 Patent). The Camera Manufacturers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have moved for summary judgment of non-infringement with respect to the devices listed in Table 15 of Papst Final Infringement Contentions. Because Papst has not alleged infringement with regard to these devices with the required specificity, the motion will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">I. FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">The invention at issue is a \u201cFlexible Interface for Communication Between a Host and an Analog I/O Device Connected to the Interface Regardless of the Type of the I/O Device.\u201d . 399 Patent, Title; 449 Patent, Title. Michael Tasler invented and patented the \u201cinterface device\u201d and later sold the Patents to Papst. The invention was never produced or used.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">The \u201cinterface device\u201d is designed to provide data transfer between a data transmiVreceive device and a computer without the need for special software; this is accomplished by telling the computer that the interface device is a transmit/re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ceive device already known to the computer (and for which the computer already has drivers, ie., software), regardless of what kind of data transmit/receive device actually is attached to the interface device. 399 Patent, Abstract; 449 Patent, Abstract; <em>see also </em>399 Patent 5:67 &amp; 6:1-22, 449, Patent 4:66-67 <em>&amp; </em>5:l-22.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By directing the computer to communicate using customary software already in the computer, the interface device can fulfill its purpose \u2014 to provide \u201ccommunication between a host device and a data transmit/receive device whose use is host device-independent and which delivers a high data transfer rate.\u201d 399 Patent 3:24-27, 449, Patent 3:20-23 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Papst alleges that certain accused devices manufactured and/or sold by the Camera Manufacturers are \u201cinterface devices\u201d that infringe Claims 1-3, 5, 7, 11, and 14 \u2014 15 of the 399 Patent and Claims 1-2. 6-9, 12-13, and 15-18 of the 449 Patent. The accused products include digital cameras, camcorders, and digital voice recorders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, Papst\u2019s Final Infringement Contentions assert that (1) the Mass Storage Class (MSC) accused devices listed in Table 12 infringe the 399 Patent; (2) the MSC accused devices listed in Table 13 infringe the 449 Patent; and (3) the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) accused devices listed in Table 14 infringe the 399 Patent. <em>See </em>Final Infringement Contentions (FICs) [Dkt. 416], Tables 12 &amp; 13 &amp; Table 14.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Papst also expressly noted that it lacked sufficient information to allege that other devices infringe, setting forth a list of such products on Table 15, titled \u201cDevices likely to be MSC Capable, PTP Capable, or both.\u201d FICs at 307-13 (Table 15). With regard to Table 15, the Final Infringement Contentions (FICs) assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">Papst has not received adequate discovery for Papst to determine if the devices in Table 15 are MSC Capable Devices, PTP Capable Devices, or both. Papst asserts that a reasonable opportunity for discovery is likely to show evidentiary support that these devices are either MSC Capable Devices, PTP Capable Devices, or both. To the extent that the devices are MSC Capable Devices, Papst asserts that a reasonable opportunity for discovery is likely to show evidentiary support that they infringe Claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, and 15 of the 399 patent, and Claims 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the 449 patent, literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents. To the extent that the devices are PTP Capable Devices, Papst asserts that a reasonable opportunity for discovery is likely to show evidentiary support that they infringe Claims 1, 3, 5, 11, and 14 of the 449 patent; literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents. To the extent that the devices are not MSC Capable Devices or PTP Capable Devices, Papst asserts that a reasonable opportunity for discovery is likely to show evidentiary support that they may infringe Claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, and 15 of the 399 patent, and Claims 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,11,12, 13,14, 15,16, 17, and 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the 449 patent, literally and/or under the doctrine of equivalents. Papst reserves the right to revise or update these contentions upon receipt of sufficient further relevant discovery from the [Camera Manufacturers].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">FICs at 307. In sum, Papst made no specific allegations against the Table 15 products; it- alleged only that discovery would likely show evidentiary support that these products are MSC and/or PTP devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The Camera Manufacturers seek summary judgment of noninfringement because Papst has not alleged infringement with any specificity whatsoever with regard to the devices set forth in Table 15, and the Court\u2019s Sanctions Opinion and Order prohibit Papst from modifying its FICs. <em>See </em>Mot. for Summ. J. Re Table 15 Devices [Dkt. 447]; Reply [Dkt. 505].</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Sanctions Opinion and Order, issued on February 8, 2011, required Papst to file infringement contentions with specificity. <em>See </em>Sanctions Op., 273 F.R.D. 339 (D.D.C.2011); Sanctions Order [Dkt. 430]. The Sanctions Order arose from Papst\u2019s failure to follow Court orders. The Court mandated that Papst revise its original infringement contentions, as Papst had filed them before the Court construed the Patents. <em>See </em>Claims Constr. Op. [Dkt. 336] (interpreting the claims in the Patents). The Court and the parties discussed the need for final contentions from Papst at a discovery status conference in August 2010. The Court chastised Papst for failing to propose focused discovery and ordered Papst to define its asserted claims and infringement contentions in light of the claims construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">I said focused discovery and what I got was a shotgun shell. I mean, everything. I do not consider that focused and I don\u2019t think that it fulfills my obligation to get this done quickly and with the least expense possible under the circumstances. So what I think we need to start with is the concept that Papst filed infringement contentions ... and hasn\u2019t changed them, hasn\u2019t indicated it wants to change them, hasn\u2019t indicated it plans or needs to change them but now says [it] need[s] a ton of discovery. I\u2019m not sure that all of your contentions can stand in light of the claims construction decision which I appreciate you don\u2019t like, it\u2019s okay. But nobody knows what they\u2019re fighting about now. Nobody can tell and you don\u2019t want to tell them, and we\u2019re not going to do it that way. I mean, you\u2019re the plaintiff. You have allegations, you need to say what they are. So the first thing is I\u2019m going to direct Papst to refile its claims contentions, its infringement contentions.... File that, then we\u2019ll know what we\u2019re arguing about. Only then can we figure out what discovery is really needed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-10\"><em>See </em>Mot. for Sanctions [Dkt. 388], Ex. A jr. of Aug. 31, 2010 Hearing) at 18-19. The Court further directed, \u201cyou have got to bring your infringement contentions up to date. People have to know what they\u2019re litigating about. And only when you do can you then say okay, this is the discovery we need for these reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. The Court told Papst that its asserted claims and infringement contentions needed to be clear cut:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">First you have to decide what your infringement contentions are. Only when you know what, what camera you\u2019re asserting [infringes] what claim and for what reason[,] can you possibly figure out what discovery you might need that you don\u2019t already have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">As a result of the status conference, the Court issued its Sixth Practice and Procedure Order (PPO) requiring Papst to file final contentions with specificity as to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>alleged infringer, each alleged infringing product, and each Patent Claim allegedly infringed. The Sixth PPO provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">2. No later than October 13, 2010, Papst shall file its Final Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions. Separately for each opposing party, this Final Disclosure shall contain the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">a. Each claim of each patent in suit that is allegedly infringed by each opposing party, including for each claim the applicable statutory subsections of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271 asserted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">b. <em>Separately for each asserted claim, each accused apparatus, product, device, process, method, act or other instrumentality (\u201cAccused Instrumentality\u201d) of each opposing party of which Papst is aware. This identification shall be </em>as <em>specific as possible. </em>Each product, device, and apparatus shall be identified by name or model number, if known. Each method or process shall be identified by name, if known or by any product, device or apparatus which, when used, allegedly results in the practice of the claimed method or process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">c. <em>A chart identifying specifically where each limitation of each asserted claim is found within each Accused Instrumentality, </em>including for each limitation that such party contends is governed by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112(6), the identity of the structure(s), act(s), or material(s) in the Accused Instrumentality that performs the claimed function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">d. For each claim which is alleged to have been indirectly infringed, an identification of any direct infringement and a description of the acts of the alleged indirect infringer that contribute to or are inducing that direct infringement. Insofar as alleged direct infringement is based on joint acts of multiple parties, the role of each such party in the direct infringement must be described;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">e. Whether each limitation of each asserted claim is alleged to be literally present or present under the doctrine of equivalents in the Accused Instrumentality; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">f. For any patent that claims priority to an earlier application, the priority date to which each asserted claim allegedly is entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Sixth PPO [Dkt. 372] &amp; 2 (adopting provisions of Rule 3-1 (N.D. Cal. Patent Local Rules)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">The Sixth PPO adopted the requirements set forth in Northern District of California Patent Rule 3-1 because that Rule was designed to \u201cmake the parties more efficient, to streamline the litigation process, and to articulate with specificity the claims and theory of a plaintiffs infringement claims.\u201d <em>Bender v. Micrel Inc., </em>Civ. No. 09-1144, 2010 WL 520513, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 6, 2010). Rule 3-1 was intended to prevent cases from \u201cstaggering] for months without clear direction\u201d by \u201cfocusing discovery on building precise final infringement or invalidity contentions and narrowing issues for <em>Markman, </em>summary judgment trial, and beyond.\u201d <em>Connected LLC v. Cisco Sys., Inc., </em>391 F.Supp.2d 526, 527 (E.D.Tex.2005). Via the language of Rule 3-1, the Court required Papst to \u201ccrystallize its theory of the case and patent claims.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Inter-Trust Tech. Corp. v. Microsoft Corp., </em>Civ. No. 01-1640, 2003 WL 23120174, at *3 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 1, 2003) (characterizing Rule 3-1). In sum, the Court ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Papst to file contentions that comported with the Court\u2019s claims constructions and that were sufficiently precise and detailed for the purpose of streamlining this already protracted litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Papst filed Final Infringement Contentions, <em>see </em>FICs [Dkt. 416], but many contentions remained vague and uninformative. Through its experienced patent lawyers, Papst blatantly disregarded the Sixth PPO. The Court took Papst to task for obfuscating its infringement theories, finding that Papst had done so intentionally as part of its strategy to extend this litigation excessively, since Papst\u2019s business <em>is </em>litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Instead of crystallizing its asserted claims and infringement contentions in this case, Papst\u2019s Final [Infringement] Contentions intentionally obfuscate Papst\u2019s infringement theories. As this Court has previously noted, Papst is in the business of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">Papst is a German company that produces no products; it acquires patents on products or methods allegedly invented by others and then searches the world for patents it might challenge for infringement. At one of the first status conferences of the MDL, when the Court queried whether this was old-fashioned \u201cclaim jumping,\u201d counsel for Papst readily agreed that it had been called worse. Of course, this is a perfectly lawful and respectable business. But it underscores that the business of Papst is litigation, not invention or production. Litigation is the business model whereby Papst, when successful, achieves royalty payments from others. As is clear from this record, the threat of litigation alone often achieves royalty payments. Mem. Op. [Dkt. 86]. While the threat of litigation alone often achieves royalty payments, the threat of never-ending discovery can induce even larger royalty payments. Frankly, this appears to be Papst\u2019s strategy in this case. The Final [Infringement] Contentions are purposefully vague; they were drafted to further Papst\u2019s intention to engage in protracted and expensive litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Sanctions Op., 273 F.R.D. at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">In addition to concealing its infringement theories, Papst purposely disregarded the Modified Claims Construction Opinion and Order. The Sanctions Opinion explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">[T]he Final [Infringement] Contentions additionally lack the requisite specificity because they repeatedly reiterate Papst\u2019s version of previously rejected claims constructions and then advance theories based on such rejected constructions. <em>See, e.g., </em>[FICs] at 33 (asserting that \u201csecond connecting device\u201d means a device for interfacing and not \u201ca physical plug or socket for permitting a user readily to attach and detach ...\u201d as construed by the Court). In this same vein, Papst also attempts to incorporate and reassert its original contentions filed May 28, 2008, before claims construction. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Such an approach bespeaks a total lack of respect for Court orders and the timely resolution of this case, but it is consistent with Papst\u2019s approach from the beginning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\"><em>Id. </em>at 344-45. Papst\u2019s failure to properly detail its infringement claims was not an innocent error; it was part of a calculated strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>For this astounding and brash failure to follow court orders, the Court imposed a reasonable sanction against Papst \u2014 requiring Papst \u201cto live with its Final [Infringement] Contentions as they stand without further modification.\u201d Sanctions Op., 273 F.R.D. at 343. Thus, the Court barred Papst from modifying the FICs and barred Papst from advancing any arguments for infringement (or against claims of noninfringement) that either (1) are not based solely on this Court\u2019s constructions of the Patents or (2) are not already set forth specifically and explicitly in the FICs. <em>See </em>Sanctions Order at 2. Further, although Papst claimed that it \u201creserved the right\u201d to accuse more products of infringement, the Court found that this claim was imprecise and limitless and that it violated the Court\u2019s orders. Sanctions Op., 273 F.R.D. at 345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Papst opposes the Camera Manufacturers\u2019 motion for summary judgment regarding the Table 15 products and seeks further discovery. <em>See </em>Opp\u2019n [Dkt. 471]; Mot. for Rule 56(d) Discovery [Dkt. 479].</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>accord Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). On summary judgment, the burden on a moving party who does not bear the ultimate burden of proof in^the case may be satisfied by making an irit\u00ed\u00e1l showing that there is an absence of ejpience to support the nonmoving party\u2019s ojge. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 <em>QMB). </em>This burden \u201cmay be discharged frjhl\u00a7howing\u2019 \u2014 that is, pointing out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s cas\u00e9.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The burden then shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. The nonmovant may not rest on mere allegations or denials, but must instead by affidavit or otherwise, present specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548; <em>see also Greene v. Dalton, </em>164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C.Cir.1999) (nonmovant must present specific facts that would enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must draw all justifiable inferences in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than \u201c[t]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence\u201d in support of its position. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. In addition, if the evidence \u201cis merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (citations omitted). Summary judgment is properly granted against a party who \u201cafter adequate time for discovery and upon motion ... fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Summary judgment can be granted in a patent case if there is no dispute over the structure of the accused products, at which point the question of infringement \u201ccollapses\u201d into the question of claim construction and may be resolved by the court. <em>Desper Prods., Inc. v. QSound Labs, Inc., </em>157 F.3d 1325, 1332-33 (Fed.Cir.1998). The burden of proving infringement rests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>on the patent holder. <em>Welker Bearing Co. v. PHD, Inc., </em>550 F.3d 1090, 1095 (Fed.Cir.2008). Thus, on summary judgment the Camera Manufacturers bear the burden of making an initial showing that there is an absence of evidence to support Papst\u2019s claim of infringement, and Papst bears the burden of presenting specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The Camera Manufacturers seek a judgment of noninfringement as to the Table 15 products. Papst complains that (1) it has insufficient information to assert specific infringement contentions as to the Table 15 devices; (2) the Camera Manufacturers should be required to provide discovery as to the mode of communication (MSC, PTP, or other) of the Table 15 devices; and (3) Papst should be permitted to supplement its contentions or, at least, the Court should decline to enter judgment regarding the Table 15 products so that Papst can sue on those items later.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">At its core, Papst\u2019s argument seeks reconsideration of the Sanctions Opinion and Order. But Papst fails to meet the standard for reconsideration. <em>See Singh v. George Wash. Univ., </em>383 F.Supp.2d 99, 101 (D.D.C.2005) (reconsideration may be permitted when a court patently misunderstood a party, made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented, made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension, or where there has been a controlling or significant change in the law or facts). Papst has not alleged, let alone shown, that the Court patently misunderstood a party, made a decision outside the issues presented, made an error of apprehension, or that a controlling or significant change in the law or facts occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Furthermore, a cursory read of the Sanctions Opinion and Order reveals that the Court did not simply \u201cexclude\u201d the Table 15 devices from this litigation, as Papst wishes it had, for the purpose of permitting Papst to amend its infringement contentions or to bring a new lawsuit against those devices. Papst was sanctioned for its failure to comply with Court orders, and the sanction requires Papst \u201cto live with its Final [Infringement] Contentions as they stand without further modification.\u201d Sanctions Op., 273 F.R.D. at 343. The Court expressly \u201cbarred [Papst] from modifying its Final [Infringement] Contentions\u201d and \u201cbarred [Papst] from advancing any arguments for infringement, or against the Camera Manufacturers\u2019 claims of noninfringement, that are not set forth specifically and explicitly in the Final [Infringement] Contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346; Sanctions Order at 2. To permit amendment of the Final Infringement Contentions against the Table 15 devices or future suit against the Table 15 devices would more than undermine the sanction, it would negate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Papst contends that it does not know whether the products listed in Table 15 communicate with a host computer in MSC mode and/or PTP mode or whether they use another mode of communication altogether,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that it should be permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ted to seek discovery of this information, which (Papst alleges) is within the exclusive control of the Camera Manufacturers. Papst moves for discovery under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Mot. for 56(d) Disc. [Dkt. 479]; Reply [Dkt. 515]. On a Rule 56(d) motion, \u201c[t]he non-moving party bears the burden of identifying the facts to be discovered that would create a triable issue and the reasons why the party cannot produce those facts in opposition to the motion.\u201d <em>Scott-Blanton v. Universal City Studios Prods. LLLP, </em>246 F.R.D. 344, 347 (D.D.C.2007), <em>aff'd </em>308 Fed.Appx. 452 (D.C.Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Papst\u2019s claim that it was \u201cunable\u201d to make specific allegations against the Table 15 devices is belied by (1) the fact that Papst made specific allegations against the numerous MSC and PTP devices listed in Tables 12,13, and 14 of the Final Infringement Contentions; and (2) prior to the date that Papst filed the FICs (January 21, 2011), the Camera Manufacturers expressly identified in interrogatory responses many Table 15 products that have MSC and/or PTP functionality. <em>See, e.g., </em>Reply, Ex. A [Dkt. 505-1] (Sept 29, 2008 Matsushita/Panasonic 2d Supp. Resp. to 2d Revised Interrog.) at 13 <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (informing Papst that models NV-GS120GC, NV-GS200GC, NV-GS300, NY-GS30EN, NV-GS3EN, NV-GS5EN (listed in Table 15 at 310) are MSC and/or PTP capable); Ex. B [Dkt. 505-1] (June 12, 2008 Fujifilm Resp. to 2d Revised Interrog.) at 26 (revealing that the FinePix Z5R camera (listed in Table 15 at 308) as \u201ccategory 3,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>PTP capable); Ex. C (Sept. 29, 2008 Victor/JVC 2d Supp. Resp. to 2d Revised Interrog.) at 34, 37 (specifying that models GC-A33, GZMG435, GZ-MG465 (listed in Table 15 at 309) are MSC and/or PTP capable).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Further, Papst\u2019s assertion that the information regarding whether the accused devices operate in MSC and/or PTP mode is in the exclusive control of the Camera Manufacturers is undermined by the wealth of information publically available on the Internet. For example, Papst asserts that it has insufficient information to determine the functionality of the Nikon D3s camera and listed this model in Table 15. FICs at 310. The Nikon website, however, shows that the D3s camera can communicate in MSC and PTP modes. <em>See </em>http://support.nikonusa.com/app/ answers/detail/a \u2014 id/4613 (last viewed June 19, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">User manuals either produced by the Camera Manufacturers in discovery or available on the Internet also reveal whether a product can operate in MSC and/or PTP mode. Papst alleges that it does not have adequate information to determine the communication mode of the Nikon L100 camera. <em>See </em>Table 15 at 310. However, the user manual for the Nikon L100, available on Nikon\u2019s website,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> indicates that this model uses PTP data transfer protocol. <em>See </em>Ex. E [Dkt. 505-1] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>(Nikon Coolpix L100 User Manual Specifications) at 44. User manuals for all of the Panasonic and JVC products sold in the United States and listed in Table 15 have been produced in discovery or are accessible online. <em>See </em>Reply at 7-8 (citing http://service.us.panasonic.com/operman/ (last viewed June 19, 2013) and http:// books.jvc.com/ (last viewed June 19, 2013)). Thus, Papst could have read the user manual for the Panasonic DMCFZ100, listed on Table 15 at 309, and determined that this product can use the MSC or PTP communication protocol. Ex. G [Dkt. 505-1] (excerpt of DMCFZ100 User Manual) at 59. Papst could have reviewed the user manual for the JVC model GZ-HD3US, listed on Table 15 at 509, which explains that the camera can be connected to a computer in MSC mode. Ex. H [Dkt. 505-1] (excerpt of GZ-HD3US User Manual) at 62. Papst also could have tested the accused products by simply attaching them to a computer. <em>See </em>Locke Decl. [Dkt. 193-3] \u00b6 24-25 (explaining that computers can detect the attachment of MSC and still image capture (PTP) devices); Papst Tutorial Slides [Dkt. 215] at 20 (depicting the typical computer screen message that appears when a camera is attached, which states \u201cFound New Hardware \u2014 USB Mass Storage Device\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Papst has made infringement allegations against the products listed in Table 15 without any factual basis whatsoever. Papst claims that it could not have determined whether those devices were MSC and/or PTP capable, but this claim is made without evidentiary support and in the face of substantial evidence to the contrary. Papst\u2019s failure to make precise allegations against the Table 15 products is not excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Having made only bald allegations against the Table 15 devices, Papst cannot demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to infringement, <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, nor can Papst present specific facts that would enable a reasonable jury to find in its favor. <em>See Greene, </em>164 F.3d at 675. Papst cannot save itself now by ignoring the Court\u2019s sanctions and demanding imprecise discovery, much of it unnecessary. Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of the Camera Manufacturers with regard to the accused devices set forth in Table 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The Camera Manufacturers\u2019 motion for summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to devices identified in Table 15 [Dkt. 447] will be granted, and Papst\u2019s motion for further discovery [Dkt. 479] will be denied with regard to the Table 15 products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Summary judgment of noninfringement will be granted in favor of the Camera Manufacturers with respect to the Table 15 devices. A memorializing Order accompanies this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. This Multi District Litigation (MDL) currently consists of First and Second Wave Cases. The \"First Wave Cases\u201d are: <em>Fujifilm Corp. v. Papst, </em>07-cv-1118; <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Papst, </em>07-cv-Y222; <em>Papst v.

PTP and MSC relate to how a device is recognized by a computer. When a user connects an accused device to a computer, depending on the mode setting for the device, the computer will recognize the device as a PTP device or as a MSC device. Some accused products are alleged to operate in both MSC mode and PTP mode. <em>See, e.g., </em>FICs, Table 12 (asserting that Fujifilm model V10 is MSC-capable); <em>id., </em>Table 14 (asserting that Fujifilm model V10 is PTP-capable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\">.

Papst insists that the devices listed in Table 15 infringe the Patents even if they are not MSC or PTP capable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">If there were another capability besides MSC and PTP for these cameras \u2014 and Papst doubts that there is one because no documents have mentioned such a third way of communicating with the host device \u2014 it, too, would likely infringe because of the similarity in functions of the Table 15 products to the functions of products listed in the other tables. Papst would need discovery from the [Camera Manufacturers] about any such heretofore unmentioned capability in order to determine the matter of infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Opp\u2019n [Dkt. 471] at 2 n. 2.
