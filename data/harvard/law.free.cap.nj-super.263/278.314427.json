Wyman Garrett on January 25, 1985, while defendant Princeton Insurance Company\u2019s (PIC) policy was in force. No claim was made until after the policy term ended and the policy was canceled for non-payment of premium. Plaintiff claims that, as a matter of law, the policy was an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy so that it covered the date of the operation. PIC contends that as the policy was a valid \u201cclaims made\u201d policy there is no coverage. There is no contention that plaintiff cannot assert the coverage issue following default by the doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The parties agree that if this were an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy, or must be treated as such, Dr. Garrett would be covered because the operation was performed during the period the policy was in force. On the other hand, if this is an enforceable \u201cclaims made\u201d policy, there would be no coverage because the claim was not filed until after the termination. An \u201coccurrence\u201d policy covers all acts occurring within the policy period regardless of when the claim is filed, while a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy provides coverage for negligent acts for which a claim is made and communicated to the carrier within the policy period regardless of when those acts occurred. <em>Zuckerman v. National Union Fire Insurance Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304, 310-11, 324, 495 <em>A.</em>2d 395 (1985). PIC\u2019s policy issued to Dr. Garrett provides that the act itself must also occur after the policy\u2019s effective date. However, under <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 495 <em>A.2d </em>406 (1985), an enforceable \u201cclaims made\u201d policy must provide retroactive coverage, or the insured must be provided with an opportunity to obtain same, so that his or her reasonable expectations are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">In prior litigation involving a different plaintiff but the same carrier and the same policy issued to Dr. Garrett, it was determined that there was coverage \u201c[wjhether the policy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>construed as an \u2018occurrence\u2019 or \u2018claims made\u2019 policy.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We specifically noted that even though the act, involving a plaintiff who was injured during a similar operation, occurred during the policy period, the non-retroactivity provision was void or unenforceable because the court could not sustain a judgment \u201cfavorable to the drafter of the offensive document,\u201d quoting <em>Sparks, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, n. 5, 495 A.2d 406. Further, we indicated that while Dr. Garrett was given the opportunity upon cancellation to purchase a \u201creporting endorsement,\u201d or \u201ctail,\u201d so that his negligence during the policy period would still be subject to coverage for a claim made thereafter, his failure to do so did not render the limitation enforceable because similar conduct did not save the policy in <em>Sparks. </em>And significantly we stated there was no showing \u201cthat Garrett specifically understood or bargained for this type of coverage____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Plaintiff insists that our decision in the prior case precludes litigation by PIC of the factual issues surrounding the purchase of the policy to show that \u201cthe terms of this policy were specifically understood and bargained for by [the insured] and that, although a policy with adequate retroactive coverage was available to him ... he specifically elected to purchase this policy with no retroactive coverage in the first year\u201d and it was therefore enforceable as a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. <em>Sparks, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, n. 6, 495 A.2d 406. Here, the trial judge found that Dr. Garrett was told of the distinctions between an \u201coccurrence\u201d and \u201cclaims made\u201d policy and opted, essentially for economic reasons, to obtain the \u201cclaims made\u201d policy without a retroactive provision and, although given the opportunity, never bought a \u201ctail\u201d after it was terminated or canceled. The judge thus found that the policy was enforceable and provided no coverage for the claim made.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>We need not decide the procedural question or accept the invitation to expand the preclusive effect of collateral estoppel principles. We so conclude because our review of the record reflects no evidence that Dr. Garrett was specifically advised of his right to purchase a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy with a retroactive provision and that he knowingly elected not to do so. In the absence of such proofs, <em>Sparks </em>mandates coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>Zuckerman, </em>the Supreme Court held that a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy limiting coverage to claims filed during the policy period is enforceable so long as the policy provides substantially unrestricted retroactive coverage. 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 321, 495 A.2d 395. However, in <em>Sparks, </em>decided the same day, the Court concluded that a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy which \u201cprovided no retroactive coverage whatsoever during its first year\u201d was not enforceable, 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 328, 495 A.2d 406, because it failed to provide coverage consistent with an insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations, and was thus violative of the State\u2019s public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 495 A.2d 406. The Court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">that where there has been no proof of factual circumstances that would render such limited retroactive coverage both reasonable and expected, a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy that affords no retroactive coverage whatsoever during its initial year of insurance does not accord with the objectively reasonable expectations of the purchasers of professional liability insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeF\">[100 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 495 A.2d 406 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In explaining the rationale behind its conclusion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">Although we held today in <em>Zuckerman v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>304 [495 A.2d 395] (1985), that a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy that fulfills the reasonable expectations of the insured with respect to the scope of coverage is valid and enforceable, the policy at issue here is substantially different from the standard \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. Indeed, St. Paul\u2019s policy combines the worst features of \u201coccurrence\" and \u201cclaims made\u201d policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the best of neither. It provides neither the prospective coverage typical of an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy, nor the \u201cretroactive\u201d coverage typical of a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy. During the first year that the policy was in force, it provided no retroactive coverage for occurrences prior to the effective date of the policy. Thus, it afforded the insured only minimal protection against professional liability claims. Only claims asserted during the policy year, based on negligence that occurred during the policy year, and that were subsequently communicated to the company during the policy year were under the umbrella of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">[100 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 495 A.2d 406.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Justice Stein continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The realities of professional malpractice, however, suggest that it would be the rare instance in which an error occurred and was discovered with sufficient time to report it to the insurance company, all within a twelve-month period. The victims of professional malpractice are frequently unaware of any negligence until their injury becomes manifest long after the error or omission was committed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">Our review of the use of \u201cclaims made\u201d policies in the professional liability field demonstrates that a policy that defines the scope of coverage so narrowly is incompatible with the objectively reasonable expectations of purchasers of professional liability coverage. We assume that there are vast numbers of professionals covered by \u201cclaims made\u201d policies who are unaware of the basic distinction between their policies and the traditional \u201coccurrence\u201d policy. <em>See Middle Dep\u2019t Inspection Agency v. Home Ins. Co., </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 55-56 [380 <em>A.2d </em>1165] (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. denied, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>234 [386 A.2d 858] (1978). However, those professionals covered by \u201cclaims made\u201d policies who do understand how their policies differ from \u201coccurrence\u201d policies would expect that in return for the loss of prospective coverage provided by \u201coccurrence\u201d policies, they would be afforded reasonable retroactive coverage by their \"claims made\u201d policies. A leading proponent of \u201cclaims made\u201d coverage has characterized this <em>quid pro quo </em>\u2014 the relinquishment of prospective coverage in return for retroactive coverage \u2014 as <em>\u201cthe essential </em>trade-off inherent in the concept of \u2018claims-made\u2019 insurance.\u201d S. Kroll, <em>supra, </em>13 <em>Forum </em>at 854 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>J. Parker, <em>supra, </em>1983 <em>Det.C.L.Rev. </em>at 27 &amp; n. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\"><em>[Sparks, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 339-40, 495 <em>A.</em>2d 406.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Hence, \u201cclaims made\u201d policies without retroactive coverage are unenforceable as such, and must be construed and enforced as \u201coccurrence\u201d policies. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 495 A.2d 406. In footnote six, however, the Court noted that \u201cclaims made\u201d policies without retroactive coverage might be enforceable in limited circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>This court has not ruled previously that \u201cclaims made\u201d policies without adequate retroactive coverage are contrary to the public policy of this state. In note 4, <em>supra, </em>we referred to the narrow circumstances in which such policies might be appropriate and valid. Accordingly, on remand the trial court should not be precluded from considering evidence tending to prove that the terms of this policy were <em>specifically understood and bargained for </em>by [the insured] and that, although a policy with adequate retroactive coverage was available to him from [the carrier], he <em>specifically elected to purchase this policy with no retroactive coverage in the first year. </em>Our holding is based on the record before us and on the assumption that, had any such evidence existed, it would have been offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">If such evidence is offered, and the trial court concludes that the evidence is sufficient to prove that although insurance contracts are normally contracts of adhesion, <em>good faith bargaining </em>in this instance took place between the parties; that the terms of this policy were specifically bargained for and understood by [the insured]; and that the policy was purchased by him in preference to a policy with adequate retroactive coverage, the trial court would then be justified in enforcing the policy as written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">[100 <em>N.J. </em>at 342-43 n. 6, 495 <em>A.</em>2d 406.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\"><em>See also Guarantee Ins. Co. v. Saltman, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6, 529 <em>A.</em>2d 995 (App.Div.) (law firm managing partner \u201cinvestigated\u201d what was best coverage and canceled another policy; subsequent carrier, not the insured, was the plaintiff seeking coverage under prior policy), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>484, 537 A.2d 1278 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The record reflects that when Dr. Garrett contacted the Britton Agency and requested information regarding medical malpractice insurance in early 1982, information was provided to him which described the alternative types of coverage available. In a letter of explanation, he was told that there were two \u201cprimary policies\u201d available \u2014 \u201coccurrence plus\u201d and \u201cclaims made.\u201d Each was generally described. The letter further indicated that coverage was available through PIC. Dr. Garrett completed an application and returned it to the agency. Dr. Garrett selected \u201cclaims made coverage\u201d for the period from \u201c4/1/82 to 4/1/83.\u201d Although the application contained a blank next to the words \u201cretroactive date,\u201d the blank was left empty. At the time Dr. Garrett applied for the policy, three and-a-half years before <em>Sparks </em>was decided, PIC did not offer retroactive \u201cclaims made\u201d policies, at least without negotiation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>or specific request of the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joseph Matt of the Britton Agency did not know if \u201canyone from Princeton Insurance Company met with Dr. Garrett to explain the different types of insurance coverage available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">By letter dated April 1, 1982, the Britton Agency informed Dr. Garrett that his \u201cclaims made\u201d policy was effective as of April 1, 1982. The policy indicated coverage \u201cfrom 4/01/82 to 4/01/83\u201d with a \u201cretroactive date\u201d of \u201c4/01/82\u201d and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">This is a \u201cclaims made\u201d Coverage Form. It only covers claims arising from the performance of professional services subsequent to the retroactive date indicated and then only to claims first made within the provisions of the Policy while this Coverage Form is in force. No coverage is afforded for claims first made after the termination of this insurance unless and to the extent that Reporting Endorsements are purchased in accordance with Condition 13 of this Coverage Form. Please review the policy carefully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The policy issued was renewable annually by payment of premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Commencing about two years after the policy took effect, there were several communications between Dr. Garrett and Matt about converting the \u201cclaims made\u201d policy to an \u201coccurrence\u201d policy and the cost differential. However, Dr. Garrett never converted his \u201cclaims made\u201d policy into an \u201coccurrence plus\u201d policy, and the Britton Agency followed normal procedure and mailed Dr. Garrett the \u201cclaims made\u201d renewal policy annually. The doctor\u2019s \u201cclaims made\u201d policy continued in full force until canceled for non-payment of premiums on July 28, 1986, effective July 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">On August 12, 1986, Matt sent Garrett confirmation that his policy had been canceled, but advising, pursuant to the policy, that he could purchase a \u201creporting-form\u201d or \u201ctail\u201d which would have \u201cextend[ed] the period for reporting of claims or suits arising from treatment rendered since 4/1/82, the initial inception date of [the] policy.\u201d The letter advised Garrett that in order to purchase the \u201ctail,\u201d \u201cfull payment of the reporting-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>form premium must be received by September 12, 1986.\u201d However, the \u201creporting-form\u201d premium was not returned, and the policy was permanently canceled. On September 12,1986, Matt advised Dr. Garrett that he should \u201c[pjlease recognize that this means that there is no coverage under this policy for any subsequent professional liability claim or suit initiated against you which results from treatment rendered during the period [from] 4/1/82 to 7/1/86.\u201d On October 22, 1986, a refund check in the amount of $26.11 was mailed to Dr. Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The evidence presented does not reflect that Dr. Garrett had any opportunity to buy a policy with retroactive protection, much less that he \u201cspecifically understood and bargained for\u201d a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy without retroactive protection or that he \u201celected to purchase [the] policy with no retroactive coverage in the first year.\u201d <em>Sparks, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 342, 495 A.2d 406. The operation occurred in 1985 during the period of coverage, and, consistent with the \u201cReporting Endorsement\u201d provision of the policy, Dr. Garrett was advised about the impact of not purchasing a \u201ctail\u201d to assure coverage for a claim, like this, subsequently made with respect to negligent conduct during the period of coverage. Nevertheless, these facts do not permit us to ignore the holding of <em>Sparks </em>where the policy offered the ability to purchase a \u201cReporting Endorsement,\u201d or similar \u201ctail,\u201d to protect against subsequent claims for negligent conduct occurring during the policy period. <em>See </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 328, 495 A.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We hold that plaintiff is entitled to proceed against PIC as if Dr. Garrett was covered on an \u201coccurrence\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We reject the position that <em>Sparks </em>does not control because it established \u201cnew law\u201d or is otherwise prospective. <em>Sparks </em>did not deal with previously established case law. Rather, it addressed significant \u201cpublic policy\u201d issues, and therefore, while the insurance policy here was issued before <em>Sparks </em>was decided, we have no hesitation in concluding that <em>Sparks </em>controls this litigation commenced thereafter. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Rutherford Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Rutherford Bd. of Educ., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>8, 21, 489 A.2d 1148 (1985). The Supreme Court in <em>Sparks, </em>unlike other cases, made no suggestion that its \u201cpublic policy\u201d decision was prospective only. <em>Compare, Accountemps v.
