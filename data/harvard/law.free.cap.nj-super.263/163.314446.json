Unlike arbitration as normally understood, so-called \u201cinterest arbitration\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not consensual arbitration but is mandated by statute in the public sector for impasse disputes between municipal public employers and police and firemen pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16, and is essentially restricted to the last final offer (unless all parties otherwise agree).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On appeal, Hillsdale argues that under the applicable standard of review the arbitration award must be vacated because: Local 207 failed to offer adequate proofs to justify an award in its favor; the award is speculative, conjectural, and contrary to the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-1 <em>et seq.; </em>and it was procured by \u201cundue means.\u201d Hillsdale contends as a result that a remand is required for a new arbitration hearing before a new arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Washington Township argues that the arbitration award affecting it should be vacated because the arbitrator failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>properly apply the factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>The Hillsdale Arbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">After the expiration of the last collective negotiation agreement <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between Hillsdale and Local 207, the parties were unable to finalize a new agreement. Local 207 filed a petition with PERC on December 17, 1990 to initiate compulsory interest arbitration. On February 1, 1991, PERC appointed Ernest Weiss as \u201cinterest arbitrator\u201d in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:16-5.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">No non-economic issues were in dispute and the parties agreed upon a three year contract to cover 1991 through 1993. Informal efforts to resolve the disputed economic issues proved unavailing. At those arbitration sessions conducted in April and May of 1991, the parties offered testimony as well as various exhibits and documents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the unresolved issues of</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>salary increases and the \u201cbanking of compensatory time,\u201d to allow \u201ctime off\u201d to be saved beyond the end of the calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Hillsdale\u2019s last offer<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> would have permitted banking of compensatory time up to eighty hours and given annual salary increases as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">1991- 7% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">1992- 6.5% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">1993- 6.2% increase</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Local 207\u2019s last \u201coffer\u201d called for banking of compensatory time up to one hundred hours and semi-annual (or \u201csplit year\u201d) incremental salary increases (which had the effect of compounding the increases twice a year):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">January 1, 1991 -5% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">July 1, 1991 -3% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">January 1, 1992 -4% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoS\">July 1, 1992 -4% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">January 1, 1993 -3% increase</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">July 1, 1993 -4% increase</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">In its post-hearing brief Local 207 emphasized to the arbitrator: the similarity between communities in Bergen County; the increases in arrests, juvenile offenses and motor vehicle offenses within the borough; that its comparability analysis of salary and non-wage benefits in \u201csimilar communities\u201d showed that Local 207\u2019s last \u201coffer,\u201d if accepted, would still be less than the Bergen County average in cost of implementation and the negotiated or awarded wage resolution for contracts covering 1991 to 1993; that awards both before and after changes in the Cap Law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were on average higher than the increase it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>sought; and that even in the Pascack Valley group of municipalities (of which Hillsdale is a part) used as a reference for comparability by the borough, Local 207\u2019s last offer position would still be below average. Local 207 also argued: Hills-dale\u2019s financial analysis was flawed; the borough\u2019s offer would result in a downward movement in salary increases which was not justified by any substantial or overriding reason; Hillsdale had the ability to pay (reinforced by expert testimony of Dr. Robert Werner, Ph.D.); and the trend within Bergen County supported Local 207\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Hillsdale stressed the failure of Local 207\u2019s presentation to consider most of the statutory criteria. It argued that Local 207 had not given reasons why its grouping of Bergen County municipalities was more comparable than the Pascack Valley municipalities; and the interest and welfare of the municipality and its citizens were furthered best by the borough\u2019s offer. Hillsdale also argued that a comparison of its last salary offer (when considered with the benefits and indirect compensation already provided) with other Pascack Valley communities demonstrated that Hillsdale police are well compensated; its offer to Local 207 was comparable to (but still higher than) salary increases given to other public employees in the municipality; the borough has a high tax rate but a low assessed valuation per capita, and is highly dependent on residential property taxes (with little vacant land remaining for new development); the consumer price index had increased 46.2% over the last nine years, while Hillsdale police salaries have increased by almost 66%; and the Hillsdale police enjoyed very stabile, secure employment, especially when compared to other types of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">After quoting the statute and restating the parties\u2019 respective last offers and positions, the arbitrator gave the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>reasons for selecting Local 207\u2019s position in his October 30, 1991 written opinion and award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">Initially it should be noted that the statutory criteria usually dissolves <em>[sic </em>] into a determination of the more reasonable offer. Rarely is a determination reached under any single criteria <em>[sic] </em>which proves dispositive of the issue in and of itself. In this case the expert testimony established to my satisfaction the Borough\u2019s ability to pay. Dr. Werner\u2019s credentials were impressive and his testimony was convincing. Undoubtedly any award of wages will have an impact on the Borough but no substantially detrimental result was proven by the Borough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Analyzing the numerous exhibits, particularly those relating to comparability \u2014 whether narrow and limited to \u201cThe Pascack Ten\u201d or viewed county-wide, leads me to the inevitable conclusion that the increases sought by the PBA are reasonable. The only issue remaining is whether it is the <em>more </em>reasonable of the two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">The Association has met that burden <em>also </em>\u2014 i.e., proving that its offer is more reasonable. A review of the comparables shows that the Association\u2019s request is modest. Although one can certainly question the level of increase in light of the current economic times, nevertheless, this is the neighborhood out there. Clearly the PBA\u2019s offer is midstream____ Had circumstances been demonstrated that would have created financial difficulties, or operational problems or any difficulty created or worsened by the award of the PBA Last Offer, then Hillsdale\u2019s offer may well have been deemed the more reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Finally, with respect to the disputed grouping comparison for comparing police salaries, the arbitrator found the county-wide group appropriate because \u201cthe bulk of the Towns [in Bergen County] are comparable and little distinction exists as to the nature of the police work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Hillsdale\u2019s resistance to the implementation of the arbitrator\u2019s award led Local 207 to seek confirmation of the award in the Chancery Division. Hillsdale counterclaimed seeking to vacate that award. In confirming the arbitration award, the Chancery Division judge opined that \u201cthe arbitrator here performed precisely those functions entrusted to an arbitrator and consigned to arbitration by the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\n<em>The Washington Township Arbitration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">The last collective negotiation agreement between Washington Township and Local 206, which expired on December 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>1990, covered twenty police officers. It provided for a maximum yearly salary of $40,069 for basic patrolmen. Two negotiating sessions (on December 14, 1990 and February 12, 1991) failed to produce a new agreement. As a result of this inability to agree on a new contract, Local 206 filed a petition for compulsory interest arbitration with PERC on March 5, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Thereafter, PERC appointed Barbara Zausner Tener as \u201cinterest arbitrator.\u201d Some matters were resolved at meetings of the parties and the arbitrator. Nevertheless, a complete settlement was not achieved and a formal interest arbitration commenced. Two additional meetings resulted in some minor issues being resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Washington Township\u2019s last offer<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>on the disputed salary issue was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">Effective July 1, 1991, a 9% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">Effective July 1, 1992, a 6% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">Effective January 1, 1993, a 6% increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Local 206\u2019s last \u201coffer\u201d was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">Effective July 1, 1991, a 9% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">Effective January 1, 1992, a 4% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">Effective July 1, 1992, a 4% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">Effective January 1, 1993, a 3% increase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">Effective July 1, 1993, a <em>4% </em>increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">Local 206 also submitted four non-economic proposals, described as:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">(1) payroll procedure: to make payroll checks available to police employees after the close of banking hours on the work day immediately preceding the regular pay day;</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">(2) police services: a procedure to govern distribution of off duty police work within the Township;!*]</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(3) maternity leave: to allow female officers an unpaid leave of up to 12 months during pregnancy without loss of seniority or benefits;[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">(4) cardiac disability: to require that a cardiac disability suffered by a police officer be considered as a work related condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In its post-hearing brief, Washington Township stressed its status as a small, residential, suburban community, with a population of approximately 9,000 people and a low crime rate. It argued to the arbitrator (as it does here) that the proper reference communities for any comparison of police contracts should be the neighboring towns of the Pascack Valley region of northern Bergen County, rather than larger and more populous municipalities such as Hackensack, Paramus, Englewood and Clifton. It also pointed to the sagging economy in the Northeast, and especially New Jersey; that other municipal employees (both union and non-union) received an annual salary increase of 4.5%; the 4.5% limit on spending increases due to the Cap Law; the effect of the interest arbitration statute has been to \u201cskew[] contract results in favor of police departments\u201d due especially to the quest for comparability; the fact that split year increases are unique to police contracts; and the non-cash pay benefits enjoyed by Washington Township police officers. The township also challenged Local 206\u2019s accounting expert\u2019s opinions concerning Washington Township\u2019s ability to pay, and opposed all of its non-economic proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Local 206 argued that: traffic, assists to other police departments, and community relations activities keep Washington Township police busy; Washington Township police\u2019s average annual salary of $40,069 is less than the average of $43,333 in its select group of Bergen County municipalities; the holiday and personal day benefits of Washington Township are below the average of other Bergen County municipalities; and the 1990 average salary of the Washington Township police is approximately $2,008 less than the average for the Pascack Valley communities which Washington Township argued were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>comparable, and would remain less under the new pay proposals of both parties. In addition, it relied on the trends of increasing police salaries in Bergen County under settlements before and after the Cap Law change; the alleged relevance of recent arbitration awards in Paramus and Wallington; the regional school district contract providing for a 9% salary increase for school teachers; and patterns and trends of settlement throughout the State. It also claimed that there was no inability to pay argument; and that its proposal would only result in a total annual cost 1% greater than Washington Township\u2019s last offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On December 11, 1991, the arbitrator rendered her written opinion and award and adopted Local 206\u2019s final economic \u201coffer\u201d and its non-economic proposal for payroll procedures.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After quoting the eight statutory criteria of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g and reciting the disputed issues, the arbitrator noted that computation of salary figures based on the competing proposals over the three-year contract period, when multiplied by twenty police officers, resulted in a difference of approximately $30,-600, with Local 206\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d (actually a demand) being the higher figure. The cost of Local 206\u2019s proposal was found to be only 1% higher overall than Washington\u2019s offer. The arbitrator noted: \u201cThe difference between the parties\u2019 economic positions is very small. [Local 206] argues that its offer is more reasonable because it more closely conforms with the terms and patterns of settlement among similarly situated Bergen County police officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The arbitrator briefly discussed the parties\u2019 respective positions on the proper groups of municipalities to be used for purposes of comparison, and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The PBA also presents a number of towns in which other arbitrators confronted by similar economic arguments have awarded increases in line with the PBA\u2019s offer. <em>If comparability is to be dispositive </em>then the patterns and trends of settlement in the <em>county </em>(and in the sector of the state) must be considered. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">She found persuasive Local 206\u2019s argument that \u201cthe trend of economic settlements, both before and after the change in budget [C]ap legislation favors its offer.\u201d Moreover, the arbitrator agreed with Local 206\u2019s assertion that the information in its pre- and post-Cap limitation chart represents the \u201c \u2018going rate\u2019 in the immediate area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The arbitrator also concluded that Washington Township had the ability to pay Local 206\u2019s proposal. She restated Washington Township\u2019s \u201csympathetic arguments\u201d regarding the depressed economy, the non-cash pay benefits enjoyed by its police, the compounding of salary increases caused by split raises, and the fiscal challenges (increased taxes, reduced property values) faced by municipalities. Notwithstanding those arguments, the arbitrator stressed that a comparison with other municipalities (in the group chosen by Washington Township) indicates that the township had the lowest base pay and was below average with respect to holiday and personal day benefits (in the group selected by Local 206).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Furthermore, the arbitrator remarked,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">The Township points to the lower economic settlements achieved by its other employee groups. While that is a factor[,] it must be conceded that municipal police are more comparable with police in other municipalities than they are with blue and white collar workers. This is especially true in small municipalities where differential (and higher) compensation for police is the general rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">In light of Washington Township\u2019s 6% offer for 1992 and 1993, the arbitrator rejected its claim that an increase in excess of 4.5% would violate the Cap Law. The arbitrator placed the burden on Washington Township to prove that it could not afford to pay the offer \u201cwhich appears to be the more reasonable in light of the relevant statutory criteria.\u201d She then found that Washington Township had not made an affirmative case in that regard. Finally she determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>On this record I conclude that the PBA\u2019s offer, which costs slightly more than the Township\u2019s, is more reasonable because it is closer to the rates and increases achieved in police units throughout the area. There is no showing that the Employer cannot afford to pay the 1% cost difference between the two officers [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">I have rejected the Employer\u2019s contention that only the towns in the small Pascack Valley region should be used for comparison. However, even within that group the PBA\u2019s offer stands up. If the group is expanded to include other similar sized towns in the region and excluding such non-comparable towns as Clifton, Paramus, and Hackensack, the PBA\u2019s offer continues to hold up as the more reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Washington Township unsuccessfully sought to vacate this award in the Chancery Division. In granting Local 206\u2019s counterclaim and confirming the arbitration award the Chancery Judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">The contention by [the Township\u2019s attorney] is that [many] of the statutory criteria, in his words, were ignored by the arbitrator. It seems to me that\u2019s a less than accurate description. Rather than using the word \u201cignored,\u201d it would seem to me more accurate to say that many of them were deemed by the arbitrator to be less significant in this case than the comparability factor that\u2019s been described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">It certainly seems clear that there was a good deal of evidence presented and discussions about ability to pay. The other primary focus was indeed comparability and how the police salaries in Washington Township compared with other municipalities. There was the usual argument put forth by the two parties with conflicting views as to what are and are not comparable municipalities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">I see no suggestion that there was any relevant information or relevant factors submitted to the arbitrator which were indeed ignored by her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">If indeed there is a pattern whereby arbitrators normally, usually, maybe invariably conclude that comparability to other police units is the most significant factor before them, I am not prepared to say that that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s a determination which is charged to the responsibility of the arbitrator in any given case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">In sum, the question of what is the decisive factor, whether it be comparability or something else, is something charged to the responsibility of the arbitrator. I believe it would be inappropriate for me to reverse this or any other determination based on my conclusion or anyone else\u2019s conclusions that undue weight was put on one rather than another factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Effective May 10, 1977 the Legislature amended the New Jersey Employer-Employee Eelations Act (the Act) (by <em>L. </em>1977, <em>c. </em>85) to provide for compulsory interest arbitration as the \u201cterminal procedure\u201d to be followed in public police and fire department negotiations with municipalities when efforts to achieve a voluntary resolution reach an impasse. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34.-13A-14 to 13A-21. <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>19.16-5.1 and 5.2. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-14 declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">It is the public policy of this State that in public fire and police departments, where public employees do not enjoy the right to strike, it is requisite to the high morale of such employees and the efficient operation of such departments to afford an alternate, expeditious, effective and binding procedure for the resolution of disputes, and to that end the provisions of this act, providing for compulsory arbitration, shall be liberally construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>See also Newark Firemen\u2019s Mutual Benevolent Ass\u2019n v.

Town of Irvington, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>271, 284, 403 <em>A.</em>2d 473 (1979), can be distinguished from grievance arbitration, where an arbitrator resolves differences concerning the \u201cinterpretation, application, or violation of an already existing contract.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the instant cases, since the issues in dispute were economic in nature and the parties were unable to agree on a settlement or an alternative terminal procedure, the respective arbitrators were \u201cconfined to a choice between: (a) the last offer of the employer on such issues as a single package and (b) the employee representative\u2019s last offer, on such issues, as a single package.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16d(2).

Notwithstanding the flexibility regarding the determination of legal issues that may be available in private sector arbitration, \u201c[i]n the context of public employment[,] an arbitrator\u2019s determinations in binding arbitration are subject to pertinent statutory criteria as well as the public interest and welfare.\u201d <em>Kearny P.B.A., Local 21 v.

Monmouth County Bd. of Social Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>442, 450, 476 A.2d 777 (1984). Implicit in the <em>Division 540 </em>case\u2019s determination that no undue delegation of authority resulted from the statute there at issue is the concept that public sector interest arbitrators, who are not accountable to the taxpayers, must adhere strictly to the statutory standards (both inherent and express) that the Court found supportive of the constitutionality of that statute. <em>See </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 251-253, 386 A.2d 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Emphasizing that subsection 34:13A-16g refers to the factors listed \u201cthat are judged relevant,\u201d both Locals 206 and 207 argue that the language of the statute is discretionary with respect to the public sector interest arbitrator\u2019s consideration of the eight factors. They essentially contend that the final judgment as to the relevancy of the statutory criteria and the reasonableness of the last offers is best left to the arbitrator for the sake of expediency and pragmatism. They further argue that not all of the enunciated criteria are of equal relevance in any given case and that the statutory language gives public sector interest arbitrators discretion to determine which factors are more relevant than others. They concede that those factors advanced by the parties, and with respect to which they submit evidence, must be dealt with by the arbitrator in determining the relevancy of the various factors. But they assert that nowhere does the statute require, expressly or impliedly, that the arbitrator take evidence with respect to each of the criteria set forth in subsection 16g, .or that substantial evidence be presented with respect to each criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>We disagree. The respondents\u2019 argument would permit arbitrators to read certain, if not most, of the criteria right out of the statute. Without proper consideration of the legislative standards, public interest arbitration may very well be an undue delegation of legislative authority. <em>Cf. Division 540, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 386 A.2d 1290; <em>Ridgefield Park Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Ridgefield Park Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>at 164, 393 A.2d 278. It may be that in public sector interest arbitrations the parties fail to present evidence on some factors. This in turn may lead the arbitrator to ignore or dismiss in a conclusory fashion the relevance of those criteria. Respondents justify this outcome by asserting that \u201c[f]ailure to raise an issue in arbitration proceedings or failure to assert an objection constitutes a waiver thereof.\u201d As between private parties such a waiver theory may be appropriate. However, the public interests at stake in public sector interest arbitration are and must be paramount and demand more attention to the statutory factors than an unsupported passing reference.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See generally Kearny P.B.A., Local 21 v. Town of Kearny, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 217, 405 A.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In short, as stated in one New York decision, \u201cto the extent the [statutory] criteria are not controverted, <em>i.e., </em>\u2018put in issue,\u2019 [arbitrators] should nevertheless elicit the position of the parties and/or pertinent facts and consider the significance of such in [their] decision.\u201d <em>City of Batavia v.

Moreover, a cursory recitation of the statutory factors should not suffice, nor would factual specificity with respect to only some of those factors be adequate. <em>See City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Yonkers v. Mutual Aid Ass\u2019n of Paid Fire Dept., </em>80 A.D.2d 597, 436 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1009, 1010 (1981). We find the reasoning of the cited decisions persuasive. Mere parroting of the words of the statute is not helpful in determining whether the arbitrator has appropriately analyzed all of the factors in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Furthermore, due to potential constitutional implications here, it is only reasonable that there be a presumption that all of the factors be deemed relevant, notwithstanding the directory nature of the statutory standards. <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 <em>A.</em>2d 473; <em>Division 540 v.

This would afford a proper basis for public interest arbitrators to make an informed decision as to relevance. As a corollary, the interest arbitrators must detail in their opinions the specific reasons why an enumerated factor is not \u201cjudged relevant\u201d in arriving at the final determination. This would also facilitate judicial review of public sector interest arbitration awards. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16f(5). We do not hold that each factor be accorded <em>equal </em>weight. We merely require that the arbitrator\u2019s award indicate what factors are deemed relevant, satisfactorily explain why a certain factor (or factors) is not relevant, and provide an analysis of the evidence on each relevant factor. It must be remembered that arbitrators not only are charged with resolution of the disputed issue, but also are required to perform the fact-finding function that is needed for purposes of meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Here, as will appear from a review of the statutory factors, neither the parties nor arbitrators sufficiently considered the statutory factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>A. </em>\u2014 Hillsdale</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The Hillsdale arbitrator\u2019s opinion and award lacks a sense of application and analysis of most of the listed factors in 16g.

The inadequacy of the arbitrator\u2019s analysis is due in part to the failure of the parties to present evidence or arguments on some of the factors and in part to the arbitrator\u2019s failure to address evidence and arguments on certain factors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">There may well be inherent difficulties in considering all of the statutory factors and then making a \u201creasonable determination of the issues,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g, when the only choice possible to be made under the statute is between \u201cthe last offer of the employer on such [economic] issues as a single package\u201d and \u201cthe employee representative\u2019s last offer, on such [economic] issues, as a single package.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16d(2). Reso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>lution of any such difficulty, however, is a matter left for legislative consideration. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the statute requires that arbitrators will make such an effort in resolving the negotiating impasse between the public employer and public employees. <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 <em>A.2d </em>473. That simply was not done here. A remand for a new arbitration before a new arbitrator not involved in either of these arbitrations is thus required.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Our observations here, and also in the Washington Township matter, are by way of example and not meant to be restrictive of the proofs which may be presented. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(l) requires consideration of the interests and welfare of the public at large, both in the area affected and in general. This factor focuses in part on the priority to be given to the wages and monetary benefits of public employees within a municipality\u2019s budget and plans. The arbitrator\u2019s opinion reveals that this factor was not given real consideration, let alone \u201cdue weight.\u201d Hillsdale\u2019s argument was not addressed. It contended: \u201c[U]nless it can be demonstrated that the salaries and benefits paid to members of the Police Department are so non-competitive as to result in deterioration of the public safety then the public interest mandates that employees be paid <em>only </em>... what a municipality can reasonably afford.\u201d The interest arbitrator simply reiterated, without analysis, the borough\u2019s position on this factor and determined that it nonetheless had the ability to pay the award.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">It might be argued that the arbitrator\u2019s brief discussion of the borough\u2019s ability to pay constituted implicit consideration of the public\u2019s interests and welfare. However, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>surely intended that there be more to consideration of the public\u2019s interest and welfare than mere financial impact vis-avis ability to pay (notwithstanding instances where evidence will inevitably impact multiple factors). Otherwise, factor (6) would be redundant. The Legislature hardly included meaningless words, particularly in view of the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16f(5) making an express ground for vacating an award the \u201cfailure to apply the factors specified in subsection g. below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Nor can it be argued that this factor was not deemed relevant to the resolution of this dispute. It is unlikely that the \u201cinterests and welfare of the public\u201d can <em>ever </em>be irrelevant when an interest arbitrator is essentially limited, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16c and d(2), to a choice between the municipality\u2019s or local unit\u2019s last offer. <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 A.2d 473; <em>Division 540, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 386 A.2d 1290. This is especially true in light of the fact that the arbitrator\u2019s award may have a profound, albeit indirect, impact on a municipality\u2019s policy decisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 296-299, 403 A.2d 473. The importance of this factor to the overall legitimacy of the award has given rise to the suggestion that arbitrators have an obligation, when weighing the public\u2019s interests and welfare, to justify the choice ultimately made. Anderson &amp; Krause, <em>supra </em>note 11, 55 <em>Fordham L.Rev. </em>at 162 (citing Robert G. Howlett, <em>Interest Arbitration in the Public Sector, </em>60 <em>Chi-Kent L.Rev. </em>815, 832 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Analysis taking this factor into account is lacking in the award, and evidence relating to it was not adequately present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>ed. Nor was consideration given to the tension between maintaining adequate police service without exorbitant price, or to the prospects for police or other municipal lay-offs. Hillsdale pointed out that (1) its equalized tax rate was one of the highest in Bergen County and in the Pascack Valley area; (2) its assessed value and value per capita are below average; and (3) there is not much space within the town for available growth and resulting new ratables.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(2) requires comparison with other employees, both public and private. The post-hearing briefs submitted to the arbitrators by the local units in both appeals reveal that most of the focus was upon police salary increases in \u201ccomparable\u201d municipalities throughout Bergen County and the municipal employer\u2019s ability to pay the award sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The arbitration award is replete with reference to comparability of police salaries, raising the not-so-subtle inference that parity is considered the goal. For example, the arbitrator suggested that Hillsdale\u2019s offer was not as reasonable as Local 207\u2019s because no justification had been offered for leaving the percentage (as opposed to actual dollars) increase in police salary below average. Yet no satisfactory reasons are given to explain why this should be so when the Legislature saw fit to include other factors for consideration. The statute also expressly calls for a comparison of the \u201cwages, hours, and conditions of employment of the employees involved\u201d not only with other employees performing similar services, but also with other public and private sector employees. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(2)(a)-(c). The arbitrator\u2019s opinion makes no reference to any other public or private employment. It thus appears that the Hillsdale arbitrator based his decision almost exclusively upon Local 207\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Hillsdale and Washington Township, as well as the various <em>amici, </em>argue that this failure to follow the statutory criteria <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pervades interest arbitration awards.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Materials submitted by <em>amicus curiae </em>Bergen Municipal Coalition indicate that overall compensation rates in state and local government had slowed to 3.5% in 1991, down from 5.3% in 1990. <em>See Kearny P.B.A. Local 21 v. Town of Kearny, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 219-220, 405 A.2d 393 (in reviewing arbitration awards, courts may look to evidence outside of the record); <em>Division 540 v. Mercer County Improvement Auth., supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 253, 386 A.2d 1290. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16f(5). This information indicates that there is data upon which to make the required statutory comparisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We may also take judicial notice of the state of the economy in recent years. The Hillsdale arbitrator gave a passing nod to reality, but felt bound to follow the trend of increases evidenced by the numerous awards and settlements presented. He said: \u201cAlthough one can certainly question the level of increases in light of the current economic times, nevertheless this is the neighborhood out there. Certainly the PBA\u2019s offer is midstream.\u201d The \u201cneighborhood\u201d and \u201cstream\u201d used by the arbitrator did not take into account other public employees and private sector employees as the statute requires. Any difficulty in comparisons required by the statute does not obviate the necessity of applying such comparisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Comparability with police salary increases in other municipalities is not the dispositive factor. Reasons must be stated for selection of any reference group and an explanation as to why comparisons with public and private employees were not undertaken as the statute facially requires. Over-reliance on comparability inevitably leads (if it has not already) to what is known as \u201cwhip-sawing\u201d or a domino effect of \u201ckeeping up with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Jones\u2019s,\u201d leaving municipalities little choice but to make last offers very close to the range sought by the employee unit if they are to have their offers even considered,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> providing that the employee unit (recognizing that at the very least it is assured of receiving the municipality\u2019s offer) does not raise its demand even higher.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The element of risk may in part explain the asserted rapid increase in police salaries compared to other salaries. But that factor is not mentioned in the arbitrator\u2019s opinion. The record contains no analysis of the risks faced by Hillsdale and Washington Township police officers, and also no comparison with risks faced by their counterparts in Hackensack, Newark, and Paterson, as well as other municipalities,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or even other types of municipal employees. The arbitrators in both cases also offered no analysis of how municipalities in the groupings selected for comparison are actually comparable. The choice of comparable communities was simplistic to the Hillsdale arbitrator: \u201c[T]he bulk of the Towns [in Bergen County] are comparable and little distinction exists as to the nature of the police work.\u201d This conclusion lacks support in substantial credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(3) requires consideration of the overall compensation package when benefits are included. Hillsdale produced charts showing breakdowns of base pay, fringe benefits (medical coverage, insurance, personal days and vacation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>pay) and other forms of compensation (such as education credit, longevity, sick pay, holiday pay, and night differential) throughout Bergen County. Beference to these items is not evident in the arbitrator\u2019s choice of Local 207\u2019s last offer position.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(4), referring to stipulations of the parties, does not appear applicable in either the Hillsdale or Washington Township matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(5) requires the interest arbitrator to consider the public employer\u2019s lawful authority. The Local Government Cap Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:4-45.2 and 45.3 (Supp.1992-1993) (the \u201cCap Law\u201d), generally prohibits municipalities from increasing their final appropriations and budget by more than \u201c5% or the index rate, whichever is less, over the previous year.\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>40A:4-45.1a (Supp.1992-1993). This is not a line item limit, but rather operates to limit the overall budget. It is a factor the interest arbitrator must take into consideration. <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 281-282, 293, 403 A.2d 473. \u201cIn compulsory arbitration settings, the arbitrator is bound by statute to take account of a municipality\u2019s Cap Law constraints prior to the rendition of such an award.\u201d <em>City of Atlantic City v. Laezza, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 268-269, 403 A.2d 465. Indeed, \u201can arbitrator\u2019s consideration of a town\u2019s Cap situation is mandated by the constitutional proscription against undue delegation of legislative authority to private individuals.\u201d <em>New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 A.2d 473 (citations omitted). <em>P.B.A., Local 29 </em>teaches that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(1), (5) and (6) all require consideration of the Cap Law constraints. 80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 A.2d 473. Failure to consider such constraints makes the arbitrator\u2019s award \u201csubject to vacation on grounds of procurement by \u2018undue means.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Atlantic City v. Laezza, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 403 A.2d 465 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:24-8(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Local 207 had charts portraying settlements and awards before and after the change in the Cap limitation as relatively consistent. Its offer was said to have been below the average of those awards. However, there was an inadequate application of the Cap Law effect related to the implication of the award on other municipal budget items. This is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(6) requires that the arbitrator consider the financial impact on the municipality, its residents and its taxpayers, whether wealthy or poor. The Hillsdale arbitrator based his award solely on the municipality\u2019s overall ability to pay an award based on Local 207\u2019s last offer.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> He in effect required Hillsdale to prove that it would suffer a \u201csubstantially detrimental result.\u201d No authority exists for such a conclusion. The arbitrator further opined that Hillsdale would have to show financial difficulties which would be created or worsened by adopting Local 207\u2019s offer. Such a standard does not appear reasonable. A municipality should not have to demonstrate it would be financially crippled before its arguments could be found to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As stated earlier, Hillsdale did discuss the local economic situation. Its argument focused upon the additional burden which would be placed on its residents in order to fund Local 207\u2019s last offer position. However, the record does not reflect the percentage of citizens on relatively fixed incomes and the impact of tax increases and other costs, considerations which the statutory listing confirms to be highly relevant. The arbitrator did not apply such considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">It does not necessarily follow that an arbitration award in favor of the employee unit will inevitably force the municipality to increase its overall amount of expenditures, even amounts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>earmarked for police costs. The public employer \u201cretains the discretion to diminish the size of its police force and limit the areas in which patrolmen will be deployed.\u201d <em>New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 288-289, 403 A.2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The next factor an interest arbitrator must apply is in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(7), the cost of living. Statistics produced by Hillsdale indicated that over the past nine years its police had salary increases which exceeded the consumer price index by approximately twenty percent. The arbitrator dismissed this factor, simply stating: \u201cThe cost of living and particularly real estate by common observation is high.\u201d No application of the factor was offered to explain why the borough\u2019s arguments were actually seen to support Local 207\u2019s proposal. Nor did the arbitrator consider or discuss the disparity between police salary increases and the consumer price index. Indeed, evidence of the relationship between the cost of living and recent salary increases for other municipal employees appears relevant under this factor, as well as under 16g(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Subsection g(8) refers to continuity and stability of employment, including seniority rights and other factors. This factor was neither considered nor applied by the arbitrator or Local 207. Any longevity differential would be relevant to analysis of this factor, as well as the factor in 16g(3). Hillsdale argued that its police force has never been reduced other than by normal attrition, and there were no \u201cgive-backs\u201d or salary freezes despite the current recession. Such evidence would seem relevant, particularly in comparison with other public employees as well as private sector employees generally. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Thus, the Hillsdale award and opinion does not withstand judicial scrutiny. The order confirming it must be reversed, the award vacated, and the matter remanded for a new arbitration hearing before a new arbitrator. <em>See Manchester Township Bd. of Educ. v. Carney, Inc., </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 277-278, 282, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>489 A.2d 682 (App.Div.1985); <em>La Stella v. Garcia Estates, Inc., </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173,177-178, 319 A.2d 274 (App.Div.1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>297, 331 A.2d 1 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\"><em>B. </em>\u2014 Washington <em>Township</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Washington Township\u2019s appeal requires a similar analysis of the interest arbitrator\u2019s award. Although the Washington Township arbitrator was more thorough in her consideration of the statutory criteria than her counterpart in the Hillsdale matter, her opinion and award lack sufficient analysis and application of certain of the statutory factors, and is, therefore, also subject to vacation. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16f(5); <em>Division 540 v. Mercer County Improvement Auth., supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 253-254, 386 A.2d 1290. This inadequacy is due in part to the failure of the parties to present evidence or arguments on some of the factors. A remand for a new arbitration is nonetheless required. Once more we note that the difficulty of the arbitrator\u2019s decision making process is compounded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g, when the choice must be made between \u201cthe last offer of the employer on such [economic] issues as a single package\u201d and \u201cthe employee representative\u2019s last offer, on such [economic] issues, as a single package.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16d(2). The arbitrator may be faced with two last offers which are in fact both unreasonable under a proper application of the statutory criteria. However, the statute in effect, and absent agreement, requires the arbitrator to choose and justify one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">A review of Washington Township\u2019s arbitrator\u2019s opinion reveals that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(1), which requires application of \u201cthe interests and welfare of the public,\u201d was apparently not applied, let alone given \u201cdue weight.\u201d Concededly, it might be inferred that the interest and welfare of the public was considered unaffected by Local 206\u2019s proposal since the arbitrator\u2019s computation indicates that the difference in the parties\u2019 packages was about $30,000.00 over the contract period.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, as previously observed, this is not sufficient. We refer to our discussion of this factor in connection with the Hillsdale award. The \u201cinterests and welfare of the public\u201d should not be irrelevant, particularly when an arbitrator, unaccountable to the electorate, decides governmental affairs in selecting one side\u2019s last offer. <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 403 A.2d 473; <em>Division 540, supra, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 386 A.2d 1290. Adequate evidence of this factor was not presented nor taken into account in the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(2) requires comparisons with the situations of other employees, both public and private. A review of the post-hearing brief submitted by Local 206 reveals that most of its focus is upon the salary increases in \u201ccomparable\u201d municipalities throughout Bergen County and the municipal employer\u2019s ability to pay the award sought. As in the Hillsdale matter, the arbitration award echoes concerns with comparability, and appears to make parity the goal. However, no satisfactory reasons are given to explain why parity should be the goal when the Legislature included other factors for consideration. The discussion in Part V. A., <em>supra, </em>is relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The arbitrator, however, essentially deleted the broader elements of the comparison factor from the statute. She said: \u201cWhile [comparison with other employee groups] is a factor it must be conceded that municipal police are more comparable with police in other municipalities than they are with blue and white collar workers. This is especially true in small municipalities where differential (and higher) compensation for police is the general rule.\u201d As noted, Washington Township, Hillsdale, and the various <em>amici </em>inform us that such reasoning pervades interest arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Notwithstanding the arbitrator\u2019s prefatory statement to the effect that \u201c[i]f comparability is to be dispositive,\u201d comparability with police salary increases in other municipalities should not be dispositive, especially absent overriding reasons for selection of the reference group and an explanation as to why comparisons to other public and private employees were deemed irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Put simply, there is insufficient reason presented in the record why Local 206\u2019s members were entitled to the percentage increases sought, while other municipal employees (both organized and unorganized) were given only a 4.5% salary increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(3) refers to the overall compensation package when benefits are included. The interest arbitrator acknowledged that Washington Township\u2019s police receive senior officer differential after seventeen years of service and a higher-than-average clothing allowance. Nevertheless, she emphasized the below average base pay and the fact that the fourteen days of holiday and personal days granted to Washington Township police are less than the average of fifteen and one-half in Local 206\u2019s reference group.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As such, the arbitrator seemed to find that the pros and cons of Washington Township\u2019s non-wage economic aspect of the overall package canceled out its relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The factor in subsection g(5) of the \u201clawful authority of the employer\u201d was discussed in our prior review of the Hillsdale award. Since the parties and arbitrator in the Washington Township appeal refer to 4.5% rather than 5% as the Cap limit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>we assume that this lower figure was the then-current index rate computed by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40A:4-45.1a (Supp. 1992-1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In rejecting Washington Township\u2019s argument that Local 206\u2019s last offer position would force the township to violate the Cap Law, the arbitrator correctly pointed out that \u201c[tjhere is ... no mandate limiting specific line items.\u201d <em>See New Jersey State P.B.A., Local 29 v. Town of Irvington, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 281-282, 403 <em>A.2d </em>473. Furthermore, the arbitrator pointed out that the township\u2019s offer of 6% increases for 1992 and 1993 appeared to undercut its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Subsection g(6) requires consideration of the financial impact on the town, its residents and its taxpayers. This factor was considered by the arbitrator solely on the municipality\u2019s ability to pay the relatively small difference between Local 206\u2019s offer and Washington Township\u2019s, which amounted to approximately $30,000 or about 1% difference in pay out costs over the three-year term of the contract. The arbitrator\u2019s opinion implies that this factor could not be weighed in favor of Washington Township unless it could prove that it could not pay. We reject this argument for the reasons discussed above under our analysis of the Hillsdale award.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The \u201ccost of living\u201d factor in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(7) does not appear to have been considered. It has relevance because evidence submitted in the Hillsdale case indicated that over the past nine years the police there enjoyed salary increases which exceeded the cost of living by approximately twenty percent. Analysis by the arbitrator on this point as to Washington Township\u2019s situation is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The factor of continuity and stability of employment in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(8) does not seem to have been considered. The senior officer differential appears relevant to an analysis of this factor, as well as that in 16g(3). Likewise, evidence relating to lay offs (if any) of police officers, as well as other public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>sector employees, might prove relevant, especially in comparison to the private sector generally. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-16g(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In sum, the interest arbitration award in favor of Local 206 cannot stand under the statutory criteria and must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The orders confirming the arbitration awards in the Borough of Hillsdale and the Township of Washington are reversed, the awards are vacated, and the matters are remanded for new arbitration hearings in accordance herewith before new arbitrators not previously involved in either of these arbitrations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\"> PERC is a tripartite commission composed of two representatives of public sector employers, two representatives of public sector employee unions and three public members. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.2.
