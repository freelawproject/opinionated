Stated differently, is the taxpayer corporation subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed by \u00a7 531 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the year 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>In an opinion reported at 60 T.C. 480 (1973), the Tax Court held that the taxpayer corporation was subject to the accumulated earnings tax for 1967. There is no appeal from that part of the Tax Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">The Commissioner determined a deficiency in the tax for taxpayer\u2019s 1968 tax year in the amount of $84,593.87. With Judge Tannenwald dissenting, the Tax Court held that the taxpayer was not subject to the accumulated earnings tax for 1968. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">Reference is made to the decision of the Tax Court for a detailed statement of the facts. For the purposes of this appeal the facts are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">GPD, Inc. (taxpayer) was incorporated in February 1954 under the laws of Michigan and has its principal place of business in that State. Continuously since its organization it has been engaged in the sale and distribution of automobile parts in Michigan and Ohio. Taxpayer holds a franchise as exclusive distributor of all Ford \u201cGenuine Parts,\u201d except engines, in the Michigan-Ohio area. The parts which taxpayer distributed to its customers, most of whom are Ford automobile dealers, come from the Ford Motor Co. and the Alma Piston Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-8\">Since taxpayer\u2019s incorporation its president and sole or principal shareholder has been Emmet E. Tracy (Tracy), who has never received compensation for services as an officer of the taxpayer corporation. Until 1959, Tracy was taxpayer\u2019s sole shareholder. In that year, he began the practice of making gifts of some of the shares he owned to exempt charities. These donated shares were redeemed from time to time by taxpayer. As a result, Tracy was not only at all times taxpayer\u2019s principal shareholder, but also held all of taxpayer\u2019s shares other than those which he had given to charities and which, at any given time, had not been redeemed. By the end of 1968, all of the shares that Tracy had given to charities during the years 1959 through 1967 had been redeemed and Tracy once again was taxpayer\u2019s sole shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">Until October 31, 1967, taxpayer\u2019s only authorized stock consisted of 50,000 shares of one-dollar par common stock. On that date, its certificate of incorporation was amended to authorize an issue of 50,000 shares of one-dollar par preferred stock and to reduce the authorized common stock to 25,000 shares without change in its par value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Taxpayer\u2019s net income before taxes for the years 1959 through 1968 ranged from a low of $159,879 for 1959 to highs of $496,636 for 1967 and $596,609 for 1968. Its after-tax net income for the same years ranged from a low of $82,343 for 1959 to highs of $248,946 for 1967 and $278,783 for 1968. It paid no dividends until 1967, when it declared cash dividends of $46,300. In 1968, it declared a cash dividend of $67,440. On December 23, 1968, its Board of Directors voted Tracy, then sole shareholder, a stock dividend of 5000 shares of one-dollar par seven-dollar cumulative preferred stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">As stated above, Tracy, then taxpayer\u2019s sole shareholder, in 1959 made the first of a series of gifts of some of the shares he owned to exempt charities and made one or more further gifts in each of the years 1960 to 1967. These gifts were mostly of taxpayer\u2019s common stock, then the only class of stock outstanding, and Tracy took deductions based upon the book value of the shares donated. The gifts, made principally to Catholic Foreign Mission, St. Mary\u2019s Church, Jesuit Seminary Guild and Guest House, Inc., aggregated 7190 shares during the years 1959 through 1967. Tracy took deductions for the gifts in the aggregate amount of $728,325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">In 1961, 1964, 1966 and 1968, taxpayer redeemed the shares that in prior years had been donated to the exempt charities, paying out during these years a total amount of $900,237 in redemption of the 7190 shares. Of this amount, $434,-460 was paid out in 1968 in redemption of the 1820 shares then outstanding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>the hands of the charitable donees. We re-emphasize that at the end of 1968, all the shares which Tracy had given to the charities had been redeemed, and he again was taxpayer\u2019s sole shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Taxpayer\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits (without giving effect to the 1968 redemption) as found by the Tax Court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-6\">December 81, 1966 $1,379,749.18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-7\">December 31, 1967 $1,582,396.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1173-8\">December 31, 1968 1,793,739.08</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">With respect to the $434,460 paid by the taxpayer for the 1968 redemption, $1820 was chargeable to its capital account and $432,640 was chargeable to its earnings and profits. When the 1968 redemption is taken into account, the taxpayer\u2019s earnings and profits as of December 31, 1968, reflect a net decrease as compared to 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-10\">The joint federal income tax returns filed by Tracy and his wife for 1967 and 1968 reported taxable income of $290,-326.46 and $283,954.85, respectively, and tax liability of $174,208 and $182,478, respectively. If taxpayer\u2019s after tax income for 1967 and 1968 had been distributed in its entirety the income tax liability of Tracy and his wife would have increased to $248,098.82 for 1967 and to $317,688.52 for 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 534(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, notification was given taxpayer on November 10, 1970, that the Commissioner proposed a notice of deficiency for 1967 and 1968, including an amount with respect to the tax on accumulated earnings imposed by \u00a7 531. Taxpayer did not file a responding statement to challenge the proposed deficiency, as permitted by \u00a7 534(c). On April 14, 1971, a notice of deficiency was mailed to taxpayer asserting deficiencies in the \u00a7 531 tax in the amounts of $79,-416.93 and $84,593.87 for 1967 and 1968, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">The Tax Court rejected taxpayer\u2019s contentions that it had accumulated earnings for the reasonable needs of its business and, accordingly, upheld the Commissioner\u2019s assessed deficiency for 1967. Taxpayer does not challenge this determination. With respect to 1968, however, the Tax Court accepted taxpayer\u2019s argument that it had no increase in its total earnings and profits for that year because of its stock redemption, and that the Commissioner erred in assessing an accumulated earnings tax against it for that year. The Commissioner appeals from the decision expunging his deficiency determination for 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-15\">By enacting the accumulated earnings tax, Congress sought \u201cto deter use of a corporate entity to avoid personal income taxes.\u201d United States v. Donruss Co., 393 U.S. 297, 303, 89 S.Ct. 501, 505, 21 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969). \u201cThe purpose of the tax \u2018is to compel the company to distribute any profits not needed for the conduct of its business so that, when so distributed, individual stockholders will become liable\u2019 for taxes on the dividends received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>citing and quoting Helvering v. Chicago Stock Yards Co., 318 U.S. 693, 699, 63 S.Ct. 843, 87 L.Ed. 1086 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-16\">Section 531 imposes an annual- tax on the accumulated taxable income of every corporation described in \u00a7 532. That section, insofar as is applicable here, makes the tax applicable to \u201cevery corporation . . . formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders ., by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\u201d Thus, two factors must be presented before the tax can be imposed: 1) the proscribed \u25a0 purpose of avoiding the income tax for its shareholders, and 2) the proscribed conduct of permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed. American Trading &amp; Production Corp. v. United States, 362 F.Supp. 801, 804 (D.Md.1972), affirmed, 474 F.2d 1341 (4th Cir.,1973). The issue in this case involves the latter of the two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-18\">The taxpayer concedes that the 1968 redemption did not reduce its accumulat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>ed taxable income as defined in \u00a7 535, and that it had such income during 1968. It is also undisputed that the 1968 stock redemption caused a net decrease in the earnings and profits for 1968 as compared to 1967.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">The Tax Court interpreted \u00a7 532 as requiring an accumulation of earnings and profits in the taxable year as a condition precedent to the imposition of the accumulated earnings tax. Since there was no accumulation during 1968, the court held the accumulated earnings tax to be improper for that year. The arguments presented to the Tax Court and its rationale for the holding can be best summarized by quoting at length from the majority opinion of that court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APlb\">\u201cRespondent takes the position that an increase in earnings and profits during the taxable year is not a requirement for imposition of the accumulated-earnings tax. Respondent argues that where the evidence shows that a taxpayer was availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders a restrictive construction of the statute would thwart the legislative purpose for the accumulated-earnings tax. In support of his position, respondent argues that the tax is levied on the \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 and not on the increase in \u2018earnings and profits\u2019 and that in 1968 petitioner had \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 as defined in section 535 even though it had no increase in \u2018earnings and profits.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-5\">\u201cPetitioner contends that although the accumulated-earnings tax is measured by' a percentage of the \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 and it had \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 as defined in section 535 for the year 1968, under section 532 the accumulated-earnings tax is imposed only on corporations formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the income tax with respect to its shareholders \u2018by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\u2019 Petitioner argues that since it distributed all of its 1968 earnings and profits in redemption of stock, it did not permit \u2018earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being * * * distributed\u2019 in that year. Petitioner contends that therefore under the plain language of section 532 it is not subject to the accumulated-earnings tax in 1968.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-9\">\u201cIn support of its position, petitioner cites our holdings in W. S. Farish &amp; Co., 38 B.T.A. 150 (1938), aff'd. 104 F.2d 833 (C.A.5, 1939); Corporate Investment Co., 40 B.T.A. 1156 (1939); American Metal Products Corp., 34 T.C. 89 (1960), affd. 287 F.2d 860 (C.A.8, 1961). In each of these cases we held that a corporation which had no increase in its earnings and profits in a particular year was not formed or availed of in that year for the purpose of permitting its earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being distributed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-10\">\u201cIn W. S. Farish &amp; Co., <em>supra </em>at 158, we stated \u2018taxable net income is purely a statutory concept, and bears no necessary relation to gains and profits subject to distribution as dividends. * * * The proscribed act is the accumulation of \u2018gains and profits\u2019 and not \u2018net income\u2019 or \u2018taxable net income.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-12\">\u201cRespondent contends that the <em>Farish </em>case is distinguishable from the instant case since under our holding in that case the taxpayer had a deficit in earnings and profits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-13\">\u201cIn Corporate Investment Co., <em>supra, </em>we held that the \u2018gains and profits\u2019 referred to in the section of the tax law imposing accumulated-earnings tax were the \u2018gains and profits of the taxable year.\u2019 In that case the taxpayer had substantial profits accumulated in years prior to the year there in issue. After discussing whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>various items, including accruals of amounts due to the taxpayer\u2019s sole stockholder and interest thereon, should be used to reduce the current year\u2019s earnings and profits to such an extent that a distribution by the taxpayer to its shareholder eliminated most of the current year\u2019s earnings and profits, we stated (40 B.T.A. at 1172):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-5\">the use of the words \u2018to accumulate\u2019 instead of some such phrase as \u2018to remain accumulated\u2019 is significant. Earnings of prior years may remain accumulated during the year but are not permitted \u2018to accumulate\u2019 during that year. If Congress had intended to penalize the corporation for accumulating a surplus in prior years or for failing to distribute such a surplus in the taxable year, it would hardly have measured the penalty by the earnings of the current year or relieved the corporation from the penalty upon condition that the earnings of the current year were distributed to or reported by the stockholders. * * * [Fn. omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-7\">\u201cIn American Metal Products Corp., <em>supra, </em>we held on facts very similar to the facts in the instant case that a corporation which had no increase in its earnings and profits for a certain year was not subject to the accumulated-earnings tax. In so holding we stated (34 T.C. at 104):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-8\">With respect to the year 1953, the balance sheet of Adler Corporation reveals that the total of its surplus and surplus reserves as of the end of the year 1953 ($657,934.74) was less than the total amount of its surplus and surplus reserves as of the end of the preceding year ($658,398.66) and, accordingly, that there was no accumulation of \u2018earnings or profits\u2019, by Adler Corporation during that year. This fact has not been called to our attention or discussed by either of the parties. It cannot, however, be ignored. As our findings indicate, this situation apparently resulted from the payment of an \u2018Additional Federal tax\u2019 which, though nondeductible in determining the \u2018section 102 net income\u2019 upon the basis of which the surtax would otherwise be computed (section 102(d)(1)(A)), is nevertheless to be considered in determining whether the corporation was \u2018availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its shareholders * * * through the medium of permitting earnings or profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\u2019 As was stated in W. S. Farish &amp; Co., 38 B.T.A. 150, 158, affd. 104 F.2d 833, \u2018taxable net income is purely a statutory concept and bears no necessary relation to gains and profits subject to distribution as dividends. * * * The proscribed act is the accumulation of \u2018gains and profits\u2019 and not \u2018net income\u2019 or \u2018taxable net income.\u2019 Each year is to be considered separately, W. S. Farish &amp; Co., <em>supra; </em>Corporate Investment Co., 40 B.T.A. 1156, 1171. Under the circumstances presented herein, section 102 is not applicable to the Adler Corporation for the year 1953. [Fn. omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-12\">\u201cRespondent does not contend that the Corporate Investment Co. and American Metal Products Corp. cases are distinguishable from the instant case but rather contends that those cases were incorrectly decided and asks that we reconsider our holding in those cases, particularly in light of the facts in the instant case. Respondent states that by managing the years in which he made gifts of petitioner\u2019s stock to charities and the years in which he had petitioner redeem that stock, Tracy, petitioner\u2019s major or sole stockholder, has been able to obtain not only the tax advantage of charitable deductions for himself far in excess of his base in the stock contributed to the charities but also if we follow our holding in American Metal Products Corp., <em>supra, </em>to have petitioner avoid the accumulated-earnings tax by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>deeming stock of a charity which is exempt from income tax on its gain from the redemption. In considering a similar argument in Corporate Investment Co., <em>supra, </em>we stated at page 1171:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-4\">Although the contracts may have avoided or delayed tax on Munroe, they do not bring section 104 into play, since their use did not serve to avoid surtax on Munroe through the medium of permitting the gains and profits of this petitioner to accumulate instead of being distributed as taxable dividends to Munroe. Mun-roe may have been tax conscious and his contracts may have been cleverly drawn to save him from tax, but still this petitioner is not subject to tax under section 104 unless the facts are within the provisions of that section, which Congress has made so definite and specific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">\u201cThe <em>Corporate Investment </em>opinion was reviewed by the Court and in a dissenting opinion, Judge Opper stated that whether the \u2018gains and profits\u2019 referred to in the statute should in the ordinary case be considered the current year\u2019s net gain, \u2018It seems obvious that Congress could not have intended the term \u201cgains and profits,\u201d whether net or gross, to mean those resulting from an artificial calculation pursuant to a clever device for frustrating the fundamental purpose of the very provision in which the term appears.\u2019 Respondent\u2019s argument that if the reduction in the current year\u2019s earnings and profits was a part of a tax-avoidance plan, the lack of an increase in such earnings and profits in a particular year should not cause the corporation not to be subject to the accumulated-earnings tax, was considered and rejected by the Court in the Corporate Investment Co. case.\u201d 60 T.C. at 489-492. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">The Commissioner contends now, as he did in the Tax Court, that the statute does not require an accumulation of earnings and profits for the year in which the tax is imposed. He asserts that the phrase \u201cpermitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d refers \u201cnot only to current profits and earnings . but, rather, to the entire amount of the corporation\u2019s undistributed profits and earnings.\u201d The Commissioner argues that this interpretation is consistent with the purpose behind the statute, the statutory scheme and the legislative history of the accumulated earnings tax provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-8\">In analyzing the accumulated earnings tax provisions, it is important to note that \u201ctaxable income\u201d and \u201cearnings and profits\u201d are separate and distinct statutory terms. Taxable income serves as a measure of the income tax and related taxes assessed against a particular taxpayer, while earnings and profits reflect a corporation\u2019s capacity to pass along tax consequences to its shareholders through distributions to them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ald-dedup-0\">\u201cEarnings and profits, as a source of dividend payments, is a statutory term. Although it is not defined in the statute, the statute does contain a number of specific rules governing the computation. As a result earnings and profits bear no exact relation either to taxable income or to earnings as determined by normal corporate accounting practice, either of which may, of course, in itself be controversial. The concept of \u2018earnings and profits\u2019 leans at one time toward the accounting standard and again toward the taxable income standard. It is clear, therefore, that \u2018earnings and profits\u2019 is much broader than \u2018taxable income.\u2019 It is an economic concept which the tax law has utilized to approximate a corporation\u2019s power to make distributions which are more than just a return of investment. In most cases the closest approximation can probably be obtained by applying the corporate accounting standard. . . . \u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 1 Mertens, The Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 9.28 (1969 ed.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>This distinction has been recognized by the Commissioner. In Revenue Ruling 70-497, 1970-2 C.B. 128, the Commissioner stated that the tax exempt interest income was not includible in accumulated taxable income as defined in \u00a7 535, but was to be included in earnings and profits for the purpose of determining whether they have been accumulated beyond the reasonable needs of the taxpayer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The accumulated earnings tax originated in the Tariff Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 114. Section 11(A)(2), 38 Stat. 166, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of this additional tax the taxable income of any individual shall embrace the share to which he would be entitled of the gains and profits, if divided or distributed, whether divided or distributed or not, of all corporations, . . . <em>formed or fraudulently availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of such tax through the medium of permitting such gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed; </em>and the fact that any such corporation, joint-stock company or association, is a mere holding company, or that the gains and profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business shall be prima facie evidence of a fraudulent purpose to escape such tax; but the fact that the gains and profits are in any case permitted to accumulate and become surplus shall not be construed as evidence of a purpose to escape the said tax in such case unless the Secretary of the Treasury shall certify that in his opinion such accumulation is unreasonable for the purposes of the business. . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">Unlike \u00a7 531, the 1913 Act taxed the shareholders directly by requiring them to include their shares of the gains and profits of the corporation as part of their taxable income. Thus, if a corporation were formed or availed of for the proscribed purpose, its gains and profits were treated as though they had been distributed. The Senate debate between Senators Borah and Williams prior to the passage of the Act indicates that the term \u201cpermitting [such] gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d refers to accumulated as well as current gains and profits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-11\">\u201cMr. BORAH. Mr. President, * *, let me put this concrete proposition. Suppose we have an automobile company, which I heard something about the other day, formed several years ago, of course, a legitimate corporation, which was not formed for the purpose of doing these things. The statement was to the effect that one individual drew down several million dollars of dividends each year. Suppose they had seen fit not to declare a dividend this year, the question which I desire to put to the Senator is, Could the Secretary of the Treasury tax that dividend which ought to have been distributed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-13\">\u201cMr. WILLIAMS. He must first proceed to consider the question whether that corporation as such has been fraudulently availed of for the purpose of permitting parties to escape this additional tax, and considering that question and deciding upon it himself he would consider whether this surplus were too large for the reasonable purposes of that business. If he concluded that the accumulations were too large for the reasonable purposes of that business, and that the fraudulent intent existed, he would then certify that, in his opinion, such accumulation was unreasonable for the purposes of the business. Whereupon it would become prima facie evidence to the fact that it was being fraudulently availed of to escape the tax, and the internal-revenue commissioner would proceed to assess the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-14\">\u201cMr. BORAH. The Senator, then, takes the position that the words \u2018availed of\u2019 would enable the Secretary of the Treasury to review the conditions of any corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-15\">\u201cMr. WILLIAMS.

Part 6, p. 5319 (63rd Cong., 1st Sess.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The Revenue Act of 1916 contained language substantially identical to \u00a7 11(A)(2) of the Act of 1913. Section 3, Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, ch. 463, 39 Stat. 758. The Revenue Act of 1919 also made no changes relevant to the issue at bar. Section 220, Revenue Act of February 24, 1919, ch. 18, 40 Stat. 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">The thrust of these sections was that the shareholders were taxed in the same manner as partners in a partnership. S.Rep.No.617, 65th Cong., 3rd Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 117, 120; H.Rep.No. 350, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 168, 177 \u2014 78. Since shareholders were to be taxed on their distributive shares of the corporation\u2019s gains and profits in the manner of a partnership and because certain stock redemptions would not reduce their distributive shares, Congress would not have intended the phrase \u201cpermitting such gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d to refer solely to current gains and profits. Otherwise, the congressional desire that the distribution be pro rata, as from a partnership, could be avoided easily by a preferential distribution that would eliminate current gains and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">Doubts about the constitutionality of levying the tax directly on the shareholders, engendered by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521 (1920), led Congress to pass the Revenue Act of 1921, \u00a7 220, Act of November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 247. <em>See </em>H.Rep.No. 350, <em>supra; </em>S.Rep.No.275, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 181, 192-93. This Act shifted the incidence of the tax from the shareholders to the corporation itself. However, the Act gave the shareholders the option of subjecting themselves to a tax on the corporation\u2019s net income. The statute continued the reference to the term \u201cpermitting [its] gains and profits to accumulate.\u201d The House and Senate Reports, <em>supra, </em>do not indicate any change in the meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">Section 220 of the Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 277, eliminated the election afforded to shareholders by the Act of 1921 of including their distributive shares of the corporation\u2019s net income in their individual returns. This option was eliminated \u201cin order to place a more effective check upon [the] evasion of surtaxes.\u201d S.Rep.No. 398, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939 \u2014 1 C.B. (Part 2) 266, 284. Again, no change in the meaning of the term \u201cpermitting its gain and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d was intended. <em>See </em>S.Rep.No.398, <em>supra; </em>H.Rep.No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939 \u2014 1 C.B. (Part 2) 241, 256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">The Revenue Act of 1926 reinstated the shareholder\u2019s option of having the corporation\u2019s gains and profits taxed to them. Section 220(e), Revenue Act of February 26, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 34. That Act provided that the corporation would be exempt from the tax if all shareholders included in their gross income \u201ctheir entire distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the net income of the corporation for such year.\u201d The Senate Report accompanying the Act stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-13\">\u201cSection 220(e): The existing law, in the case of corporations formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of a surtax by failure to distribute the earnings, imposes upon the net income of such corporations a tax of 50 per cent in addition to the regular corporation income tax. The committee recommends the addition of a provision that this tax shall not apply in any year if all the stockholders include in their gross income, and pay surtax upon, their entire distributive share, whether distributed or not, of the earnings of the corporation for such year. If the surtax is thus paid the failure to distribute the earnings has not resulted in any avoidance of tax and the reason for the imposition of the 50 per cent tax on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>corporation no longer exists. The amendment also provides that upon any subsequent distribution by the corporation out of its earnings and profits for the year in which the shareholders have thus paid the surtax, the amounts distributed to the same shareholder who paid a tax on his distributive share shall be exempt from tax.\u201d S.Rep.No.52, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 332, 348-49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\"><em>See also </em>H.Rep.No.356, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 361, 365. The Revenue Act of 1928, \u00a7 104, c. 852, 45 Stat. 814, and of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 195, as amended by Act of June 16, 1933, c. 90, Title 2, \u00a7 214, 48 Stat. 207, continued this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">In the course of the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1928, the House proposed to separate personal holding companies from other corporations for the purpose of the accumulated earnings tax so that all corporations determined to be personal holding companies would automatically be subject to the tax. The House also proposed to replace the words \u201cto accumulate\u201d with \u201cto remain accumulated.\u201d H.R. 1, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 104(c). The House Report accompanying this bill described the accumulated earnings provisions applicable to corporations other than personal holding companies as \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as its predecessors and went on to describe the proscribed activity as one to \u201cpermit profits to remain accumulated, in order to evade surtaxes.\u201d H.Rep. No.2, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939 \u2014 1 C.B. (Part 2) 384, 395-96. The Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"am3-dedup-0\">\u201cSection 104(c) is substantially the same as section 220 of the 1926 Act in its application to corporations which are not within the definition of a \u2018personal holding company,\u2019 and provides that if any corporation, other than a personal holding company, is formed or availed of to <em>permit its profits to remain accumulated, </em>in order to evade surtaxes, a tax of 25 per cent of the net income, increased by dividends and tax-free interest received, shall be imposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">The Senate rejected the distinction between personal holding companies and other corporations and reverted to the words \u201cto accumulate\u201d as used in the Act of 1926. The Senate Report does not imply that the phrase \u201cto accumulate\u201d differed from the phrase \u201cto remain accumulated.\u201d S.Rep.No. 960, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., 1939 \u2014 1 C.B. (Part 2) 409, 417, 426. The equivalency of these phrases indicates that Congress was not referring solely to current gains and profits in its description of the proscribed activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">Section 102 of the Revenue Act of 1934, for the first time, permitted a corporation subject to the tax to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders. Revenue Act of May 10, 1934, \u00a7 102, c. 277, 48 Stat. 702. Section 102(d) of the Act contained a provision substantially the same as the election provision of the previous Acts. It provided that the surtax would not apply \u201cif all the shareholders of the corporation include (at the time of filing their returns) in their gross income their entire <em>pro rata </em>shares, whether distributed or not, of the \u2018adjusted net income\u2019 of the corporation for such year.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The adjusted net income was defined in \u00a7 102(c) of the Act and reflected a deduction for dividends paid to the shareholders during the taxable year. The Committee Reports accompanying the Act do not indicate that any change in the term \u201cpermitting gains and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d was intended. Rather, the Reports indicate that the Act continued the existing law except to the extent of a revision in the surtax rate and allowance of the dividends paid deduction. H.Rep.No.704, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 554, 562-63; S.Rep. No.558, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., 1939 C.B. (Part 2) 586, 609 \u2014 10. The allowance of the dividends paid deduction indicated Congress\u2019 desire to allow dividends paid to the shareholder during the taxable year to be taken into account in determining the amount of the surtax. Only when the dividends paid deduction equaled the net income as adjusted up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>ward by \u00a7 102(c), would the corporation not be liable for the surtax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">We construe the shareholder election provisions of the 1934 Act and previous acts to be an indication of congressional disapproval of non <em>-pro rata </em>distribution as a means of evading the tax and to establish a statutory scheme exempting the corporation from the tax only when the entire amount of its adjusted net income is included pro rata in the shareholder\u2019s gross income. When such income has been included, a corporation has not been availed of for the proscribed purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The Revenue Act of 1936 changed the term \u201cgains and profits\u201d to \u201cearnings or profits.\u201d Section 102, Revenue Act of June 22, 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1676, as amended by Act of August 26, 1937, c. 817, Titles I, VI, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 601, 50 Stat. 815, 830. This change was not intended to alter the existing law, but rather to describe the fund out of which taxable dividends were paid. S.Rep.No.2156, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 678, 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">The Revenue Act of 1938 discontinued the shareholders\u2019 option of including their share of the corporation\u2019s income in favor of the consent dividend credit. Section 102, Revenue Act of May 28, 1938, c. 289, 52 Stat. 483. Again, the Committee Reports accompanying the Act do not indicate that Congress intended to change the already well established meaning of the phrase \u201cpermitting earnings or profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\u201d H.Rep. No.1860, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 728, 745-48, 750; S.Rep.No. 1567, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 1939-1 C.B. (Part 2) 779, 790-91. The House Report stated that \u201cthe bill continues the policy of levying a special tax on corporations formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the surtax upon its shareholders or the shareholders of any other corporation, as did the Revenue Act of 1936.\u201d H.Rep.No.1860, <em>supra, </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">The \u201cconsent dividend deductions\u201d of the 1938 Act was retained in subsequent Revenue Acts and forms the basis of \u00a7 561\u2019s deduction for dividends paid, including consent dividends as determined under \u00a7 565.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 562(c) excludes from the dividends paid deduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGnW\">\u201c[t]he amount of any distribution unless such distribution is pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that the former is entitled to such preference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1180-10\">The Revenue Act of 1954, c. 736, 68A Stat., continued the reference to the term \u201cpermitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.\u201d The Committee Reports accompanying the Act do not indicate that any change in the meaning of the phrase was intended. H.Rep.No.1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4017, 4077-4080, 4311-4313; S.Rep.No.1622, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 4621, 4700-4704, 4954-4958; H.Rep.No.2543, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess., 1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5280, 5309-5310. Indeed, the Senate and House Reports stated that \u00a7 532, insofar as is applicable to the issue in this case, corresponded to existing law. 1954 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4311 and 4954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">We are of the view that the legislative history and the statutory schemes of the Revenue Acts from 1913 to the present show that Congress did not intend . to require an accumulation of \u201cearnings and profits\u201d in the taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>year as a condition precedent to imposition of the accumulated earnings tax. This is evidenced by repeated efforts on the part of the Congress in amending the accumulated earnings tax provisions so as to make it more difficult to avoid the tax and by the strong .congressional policy of encouraging <em>pro rata </em>distributions as a means of avoiding or lessening the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">The Internal Revenue Code is explicit in providing that a non <em>-pro rata </em>redemption does not reduce the \u201caccumulated taxable income,\u201d and taxpayer has not disputed this point. There is no question that taxpayer had substantial amounts of income taxable under \u00a7 531 for 1968. Through the adjustments to taxable income in \u00a7 535 of the 1954 Code, Congress has effectuated its opposition to excess accumulations of earnings and profits by corporations to save their shareholders from the income tax and has made the resulting amount, i. e., accumulated taxable income, determinative of the \u25a0 issue whether or not there are current earnings and profits that are being used to avoid the tax. To hold as the Tax Court did, that an accumulation of earnings and profits during the tax year is required, would mean that Congress has frustrated the purpose behind the surtax by allowing non <em>-pro rata </em>redemptions to reduce current earnings and profits to such an extent that the corporation would not be subject to the surtax, while at the same time providing that the same redemptions have no effect on the amount of the surtax. We are unwilling to construe the statute as intending such an inconsistency. We are mindful of the admonition that courts \u201cshould construe laws in harmony with the legislative intent and seek to carry out legislative purpose.\u201d Foster v. United States, 303 U.S. 118, 120, 58 S.Ct. 424, 425, 82 L.Ed. 700 (1938). The \u201cintention of the lawmaker is to be deduced from a view of every material part of the statute.\u201d Hellmich v. Hellman, 276 U.S. 233, 237, 48 S.Ct. 244, 245, 72 L.Ed. 544 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">Section 532(a) does not of its own terms require an accumulation of eur-xent earnings and profits, nor does it require any particular amount of accumulation. The section refers to the proscribed activity of permitting earnings and profits to accumulate, and is unlike \u00a7 531 which speaks to the accumulated taxable income for the taxable year. Indeed, if the corporation were <em>formed </em>for the proscribed purpose of avoiding the income tax on its shareholders, there would be no need for an annual redetermination such as would be required if the corporation were being <em>availed of </em>for the proscribed purpose. Had Congress intended a limitation in the scope of the term \u201cpermitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed\u201d, it could have so specified as it did in \u00a7 535(c)(1)(A), which allows an accumulated earnings credit against taxable income for \u201can amount equal to such part of the <em>earnings and profits for the taxable year </em>as are retained for the reasonable needs of the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">Also, with respect to the accumulated earnings credit, the Senate Report specifically states that the amount of earnings and profits for a taxable year that may be retained for the reasonable needs of the business is determined by taking into account the amount of earnings and profits that have been accumulated in prior years. S.Rep.No.1622, <em>supra, </em>1954 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4957. If past accumulations are relevant to the propriety of current accumulations, we do not understand how they could be irrelevant in determining that the corporation was availed of for the proscribed purpose. We hold that past accumulations are highly relevant in effecting the congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">In Ostendorf-Morris Co. v. United States, 26 A.F.T.R.2d 70-5369, 70-2 U.S. T.C. 1[ 9550, pp. 84,334, 84,338 (N.D.Ohio 1968), a case involving the same issue as the case at bar, the District Court noted that the rationale and holding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>Tax Court had the effect of allowing a double accumulated earnings credit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-4\">\u201cIn a particular tax year (first year) a taxpayer determines that the reasonable needs of the business require the use of some of that year\u2019s earnings and profits for the purpose of redeeming a particular shareholder\u2019s shares. Assuming, arguendo, that this is a purpose which would not run afoul of the accumulated earnings tax provisions, the amount of earnings and profits needed for such purpose would not be subject to the accumulated earnings tax either if they were used for that purpose during the particular year or were accumulated for distribution in the subsequent year. Under plaintiff\u2019s construction of section 532, if the earnings and profits were distributed during the first year rather than accumulated, the transaction could have no bearing on the taxpayer\u2019s potential liability for accumulated earnings taxes on the subsequent year\u2019s \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019. However, if the earnings and profits were accumulated for distribution in the subsequent year, the accumulated earnings tax could not be imposed on the subsequent year\u2019s \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 if the amount of earnings and profits previously retained (for the purpose of the redemption) equaled or exceeded the earnings and profits for the year when the redemption occurred. Under the latter circumstance, it is clear that the taxpayer would be receiving the equivalent of a double credit for the earnings and profits used for the purposes of the redemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-5\">\u201cCertainly, Congress never intended such an absurd result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">The same court pointed out another unreasonable result flowing from the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-7\">\u201cSince section 532 does not speak in terms of permitting any particular amount of earnings and profits to accumulate it seems clear that even under plaintiff\u2019s construction of \u00a7 532 <em>all </em>of its \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 could have been subjected to the accumulated earnings tax if all but one cent ($.01) of its earnings and profits for the taxable year had been distributed pursuant to the redemption of Mr. Cloak\u2019s shares. On the other hand, if <em>exactly all </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s earnings and profits for the taxable year had been distributed pursuant to the redemption of Mr. Cloak\u2019s shares, <em>none </em>of the \u2018accumulated taxable income\u2019 could have been subjected to the accumulated earnings tax. In other words, under plaintiff\u2019s construction of \u00a7 532, a matter of one cent could of itself be determinative of whether the plaintiff is entitled to the refund of $105,000 in accumulated earnings taxes. Such an unreasonable result certainly was never contemplated by Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 337 \u2014 338.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">The dissenting opinion of Judge Tan-nenwald in the present case describes the reasoning of the District Court in <em>Osten-dorf-Morris </em>as \u201ctotally persuasive.\u201d 60 T.C. at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-11\"> In the case at bar, the repetitive cycles of gifts of stock to exempt charities, followed in a subsequent year by redemptions of the donated stock, demonstrate a purpose of avoiding income taxes owed by Tracy. The charitable deductions enhanced by the retention of earnings in the corporation, provided shelters against other taxable income, and the periodic redemptions of the donated stock permitted Tracy, the controlling shareholder, to retain control over the taxpayer corporation. The Tax Court found that this scheme continued, at least, through 1970, with aggregate contributions by Tracy to the Jesuit Seminary Guild of 3,600 shares ($360,000) for the years 1968 through 1970 of taxpayer\u2019s preferred stock which Tracy had received as a stock dividend in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-12\">Since the Tax Court determined that taxpayer was availed of for the proscribed purpose of avoiding the income tax on its shareholders in 1967 and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>cause the redemption of the donated stock in 1968 was a necessary feature of the method of avoiding the tax, it would appear that taxpayer was availed of for the proscribed purpose during 1968, the year of the redemption. The issues of whether accumulations are beyond the reasonable needs of the business and whether a corporation has been availed of for the proscribed purpose are, however, questions of fact. Helvering v. National Grocery Co., 304 U.S. 282, 291-295, 58 S.Ct. 932, 82 L.Ed. 1346 (1938); Kirlin Corp. v. C. I. R., 361 F.2d 818, 819 (6th Cir. 1966). Because the Tax Court\u2019s decision with respect to the 1968 accumulated earnings tax was based on an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 532(a), the case is reversed and remanded for further proceedings with respect to the 1968 assessment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">No costs are taxed.
