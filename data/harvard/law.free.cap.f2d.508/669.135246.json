He was then an employee of Appellee James Casing Crews, Inc. (James). His death occurred on a submersible drilling barge owned and manned, except for James\u2019 casing crew, by Appellant Two \u201cR\u201d Drilling Company, Inc. (Two \u201cR\u201d). The barge was then located on navigable waters in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. James and Two \u201cR\u201d were each working at the time under separate contracts with Texaco Oil Company; there was no express contractual relationship between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-19\">Cotten\u2019s beneficiaries under the Jones Act and general maritime law sued James and Two \u201cR,\u201d asserting that each was negligent and the barge unseawor-thy. James crossclaimed, seeking full indemnity for any damages which might be visited upon it and its costs and attorney\u2019s fees as well. Special findings by the jury exonerated James but impaled Two \u201cR\u201d on both heads. James had judgment against Two \u201cR\u201d for its costs, expenses and the increment of attorney\u2019s fees incurred by it in successfully resisting the claims of Cotten\u2019s beneficiaries, but not those for pressing its cross-claim. Two \u201cR\u201d appeals from the award of attorney\u2019s fees, asserting the general American rule that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable by prevailing parties in the absence of statute or contract so providing and arguing that the <em>Ryan </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> triangle exception to the general rule does not cover this case. Though both principles advanced by Two \u201cR\u201d were true, these arguments come too late in the day and other, more precisely applicable, principles would require us, as we do, to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-20\">We have no quarrel with the general rule against recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, <em>as such, </em>by a party which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>incurs them in enforcing a claim against another. It is equally well settled however, indeed it is hornbook law, that the reasonable expenses incurred by an in-demnitee in defending a claim against him may be recovered of his indemnitor \u2014 and that these expenses include attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have so held in Kel-loch v. S &amp; H Subwater Salvage, Inc., 473 F.2d 767, 771 (5th Cir. 1973), a suit for indemnity of a passive maritime tort-feasor against an active one. It would be strange indeed to hold that one who is guilty of no fault at all has no similar right. Nor are the two general principles in conflict, for in the indemnity situation the fees are recovered as reasonable and necessary expenses of defending, not qua attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant would have us hold that, though other proper expenses are recoverable, attorney\u2019s fees are not, being somehow stigmatized. We decline to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Nor is whether <em>Ryan </em>extends to our fact situation dispositive. As the court below correctly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">The Supreme Court held in Kerma-rec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlan-tique<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a shipowner owes to all who are on board, for purposes not inimical to his legitimate interests, the duty of exercising reasonable care under the circumstances. That duty of due care was extended to the stevedor-ing company as well, thus under federal maritime law, a shipowner owes a duty of due care to an independent contractor who came aboard to transact business and its breach will give rise to an independent cause of action for damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Appellant points to <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>warranty of workmanlike performance as the basis of that decision. Though that be true, we held in Tri-State Oil Tool Industries, Inc. v. Delta Marine Drilling Co.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that no contractual relationship between indem-nitor and indemnitee was necessary to recovery in circumstances like these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">It would be wrong to assess damages against a non-negligent or passively negligent shipowner for loss or injury suffered solely as the result of active negligence of another party, regardless of the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-14\">This accident occurred in navigable waters; therefore, the federal maritime law is the applicable law. Ker-marec v. Compagnie Generale Transat-lantique, 358 U.S. 625, 628, 79 S.Ct. 406, 408, 409, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959). As we have already indicated, maritime law provides for tort indemnity where there is no negligence or only passive negligence attributed to the indemni-tee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">410 F.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">Two \u201cR\u201d breached its shipowner\u2019s duty of due care owed James. That breach caused James to incur expenses in defending itself against suit by its employee, Cotten. Among those expenses were reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. James may have them of Two \u201cR\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-21\">. Ryan Stevedoring Co. v.
