The Customs Court held that the merchandise was correctly classified by the customs officials as \u201c[e]dible preparations not specially provided for (including prepared meals individually packaged)\u201d, item 182.95 TSUS. Appellants contest the classification and claim the merchandise is properly classifiable under item 182.52 TSUS as \u201c[s]oups, soup rolls, soup tablets or cubes, and other soup preparations.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-8\">We find that we have little to add to Judge Re\u2019s careful opinion below. The court heard nine of appellants\u2019 witnesses and eight of appellee\u2019s witnesses. Forty-one exhibits were introduced. The court noted that ,\u201c[e]ven on the question whether <em>saimin </em>or <em>ramen </em>is a soup, or a soup preparation, plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses were divided, and offered varying opinions of doubtful reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-9\">The Customs Court heard the witnesses, judged the credibility of their testimony and the weight to be given thereto. The judgment of the court below will not be disturbed, unless it is contrary to the weight of the evidence. Johnson v. United States, 21 CCPA 129, T.D. 46464 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
