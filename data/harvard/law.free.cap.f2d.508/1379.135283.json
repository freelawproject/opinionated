The district judge, without a jury, denied plaintiff recovery against American Airlines, Inc., holding that she failed to prove any negligence. The trial court, in deciding the case, refused plaintiff\u2019s request to apply the doctrine of res <em>ipsa loquitur </em>to air turbulence cases. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-10\">The main issues raised on appeal are (1) whether the doctrine of <em>res ipsa lo-quitur </em>formerly limited to airplane crashes <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should be extended to apply to air turbulence cases in general, and (2) whether the particular facts of this case warrant its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-14\">Under Texas law the principal requisites necessary to invoke the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>are (1) the accident would not have occurred in the ordinary course of events without negligence by the defendant, and (2) the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality. Owen v. Brown, Tex., 1969, 447 S.W.2d 883, 886; Bond v. Otis Elevator Co., Tex., 1965, 388 S.W.2d 681, 686, and authorities cited therein. See also Prosser on Torts (4th ed. 1971) \u00a7 39, p. 214. The overwhelming weight of authority has declined to invoke <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in air turbulence cases based on the absence of this first requisite.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1474-15\">However, even assuming that severe jolts in flight do not ordinarily occur without negligence by the airline, the evidence in this case suggests a credible explanation for the turbulence which involves no negligence by the airline or its employees. Two possible theories are presented as the cause of the turbulence. Plaintiff attributes the jolt to weather-produced turbulence and alleges pilot negligence in failing to warn the passengers was the cause of her injury. Based on its experts\u2019 testimony and area weather reports, defendant concludes that wing tip vortices due to passing aircraft, which the pilot could neither foresee nor avoid, produced the turbulence. Confronted with two plausible explanations, one suggesting defendant\u2019s negligence and one not, the trial court was correct in finding that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was inappropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-16\">Furthermore, the application of <em>res ipsa </em>would not change the outcome of this case. In Texas,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the doctrine op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>erates as an inference rather than a presumption of negligence, which merely shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence. The plaintiff continues to have the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. Mobile Chem. Co. v. Bell, Tex., 517 S.W.2d 245 (1974), aff\u2019g Tex.Civ.App., 502 S.W.2d 564. The trial judge\u2019s findings that plaintiff failed to prove defendant\u2019s negligence were not clearly erroneous so as to warrant our interference with his conclusion. See Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">. Cox v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 7 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 893; Citrola v.
