Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b762-27\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b762-28\">Hearings were held during Blassingame\u2019s trial \u2014 with the jury excused\u2014 to ascertain the suggestiveness <em>vel non </em>of pretrial identifications made by the two eyewitnesses produced at trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>evidence adduced during those hearings adequately supports the District Court\u2019s upholding the Texas trial court\u2019s determination the witnesses\u2019 \u201cidentification testimony was grounded on [their] independent recollection\u201d of the incident alleged in the indictment. United States v. Allen, 5 Cir., 1974, 497 F.2d 160, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Assuming, without deciding,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper, the District Court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s application was correct because the trial court sustained defense objections to the argument. No curative instructions were given, but none were proposed or asked for. The judge\u2019s sustaining the objections adequately protects Blassingame\u2019s constitutional rights \u2014 at least where he failed to seek any curative instructions. <em>See </em>Henry v. Mississippi, 1965, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408, and Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, appellant alleges police officers who testified they seized gloves<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from appellant\u2019s car perjured themselves in order to \u201ccover up\u201d an illegal search. His further allegation the prosecutor and trial judge knew of the perjury and acquiesced in it raised constitutional issues concerning which no factual hearing has been held in either the state or federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The only perjury alleged has to do with details concerning witnesses\u2019 description of the suspect, and how each of the officers learned of it. But we hold the seizure of the gloves did not follow a \u201csearch\u201d, because the gloves were in plain view on appellant\u2019s car seat. The car was parked in a lot adjacent to a tavern and there is no question the officers were lawfully on that lot. The alleged perjury was therefore irrelevant. <em>See </em>Thompson v. Stynchcombe, 5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">. At the time of the defense objection, the prosecutor did contend his argument was based on reasonable inferences from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-23\">. The officers also testified a coat was discovered, but it was not introduced into evidence. In any event, our upholding the seizure of the gloves also disposes of any issues the coat might present.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
