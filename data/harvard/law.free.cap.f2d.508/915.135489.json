After concluding that the greenhouses were \u201cbuildings\u201d as that term is used in section 48 of the Code, and therefore ineligible for the investment tax credit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the Thirups\u2019 claimed credit, and the Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Arne Thirup, 59 T.C. 122 (1972). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">During 1966, the year for which their tax liability is in dispute, the Thirups conducted their flower business through a sole proprietorship known as Pajaro Valley Greenhouses [hereinafter, \u201cPajaro Valley\u201d ]. Pajaro Valley\u2019s greenhouses were located near Watsonville, California, but the business sold its cut flowers, mainly roses and carnations, throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">In 1966, the appellants spent $79,-841.39 to build one new greenhouse (the \u201cprincipal\u201d greenhouse) and to improve several existing greenhouses by replacing, with more durable fiber glass, the polyethylene plastic that had previously formed their sides and roofs. The principal greenhouse was a completely enclosed rectangular structure, 400 feet long and 200 feet wide. Its sides and walls were sheets of corrugated fiber glass attached with special nails to a wooden frame consisting of large beams set vertically into the ground and topped with an A-shaped frame roof of lighter wood. The structure had no floor, and the appellants\u2019 flowers grew directly from the soil enclosed by the greenhouse. Panes of flat fiber glass, set on metal hinges and framed in wood, formed rows of windows at the top of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">The taxpayers designed and equipped their greenhouses to provide a total interior environment for the commercial production of flowers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The greenhouses shielded the growing plants from the outside elements, but they also did more. Their translucent fiber glass walls, windows, and roofs diffused the sunlight that fell on the flowers so that the flower stems would not bend directly toward the sun but instead would grow long and straight for the commercial market. The greenhouses were equipped with automatic temperature control systems so that when the temperature inside the structures rose above a fixed level, electric motors opened the windows to the outside. If the temperature became too cool, automatic valves in steam pipes located at different levels inside the structures opened to admit heat. Other pipes in the greenhouses carried water and liquid fertilizer to the plants, and generating devices located in each greenhouse released small amounts of carbon dioxide into the interior air. Beneath the greenhouses\u2019 soil floors were systems of steam pipes which the appellants periodically opened to sterilize the growing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">The roses and carnations growing inside Pajaro Valley\u2019s greenhouses required a substantial amount of human care. Before young plants w;ere set into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>the greenhouse floors, it was necessary for employees to turn and fertilize the soil and mix it with beneficial additives. After the plants had begun to bloom, workers harvested the carnations once, and the roses twice, each day. In addition, the workers routinely moved through the greenhouses to pull weeds, spray chemicals, prune the plants, adjust plant supports, or perform other, similar, tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Pajaro Valley employed from 20 to 25 workers in 1966, at least half of whom spent most of each workday harvesting and caring for the plants inside the greenhouses. The Tax Court found that the greenhouse workers sometimes remained inside the greenhouses for lunch and work breaks, and that during these breaks the workers often rested on tables, benches, and boxes that had been placed in the aisles between flowerbeds and along the greenhouse walls for storing tools and affording workers access to the tops of tall plants. Pajaro Valley\u2019s other employees normally worked at tasks outside the greenhouses, but during peak seasons some of the \u201coutside\u201d employees were assigned \u201cinside\u201d work. The Tax Court found that the appellants\u2019 employees spent approximately half of their aggregate working time inside the greenhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code defines the types of property eligible for the investment tax credit (known as \u201csection 38 property\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-7\">Sec. 48. (a) Section 38 Property\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-8\">(1) In General. \u2014 Except as provided in this subsection, the term \u201csection 38 property\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-9\">(A) tangible personal property, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-10\">(B) other tangible property (not <em>including </em>a <em>building and its structural components) </em>but only if such property\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-13\">(i) is used as an integral part of manufacturing, production, or extraction . . ., or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-15\">(ii) constitutes a research or storage facility used in connection with any of the activities referred to in clause (i), .. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">Here, the Commissioner agrees that the greenhouses are \u201cother tangible property\u201d under subsection 48(a)(1)(B) and that the greenhouses are \u201cused as an integral part of . production . \u201d under subsection 48(a)(l)(B)(i). The only dispute between the parties is whether the greenhouses are \u201cbuildings,\u201d which the parenthetical part of subsection 48(a)(1)(B) declares ineligible for the investment tax credit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-20\">Exercising the authority granted him by section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Commissioner has defined the term \u201cbuilding\u201d as the term is used in section 48:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-21\">Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.48 \u2014 1(e). <em>Definition of building and structural components.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-22\">(1) Buildings and structural components thereof do not qualify as section 38 property. The term \u201cbuilding\u201d generally means any structure or edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and usually covered by a roof, the purpose of which is, for example, to provide shelter or housing, or to provide working, office, parking, display, or sales space. The term includes, for example, structures such as apartment houses, factory and office buildings, warehouses, barns, garages, railway or bus stations, and stores. Such term includes any such structure constructed by, or for, a lessee even if such structure must be removed, or ownership of such structure reverts to the lessor, at the termination of the lease. Such term does not include (i) a structure which is essentially an item of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>machinery or equipment, or (ii) a structure which houses property used as an integral part of an activity specified in section 48(a)(l)(B)(i) if the use of the structure is so closely related to the use of such property that the structure clearly can be expected to be replaced when the property it initially houses is replaced. Factors which indicate that a structure is closely related to the use of the property it houses include the fact that the structure is specifically designed to provide for the stress and other demands of such property and the fact that the structure could' not be economically used for other purposes. Thus, the term \u201cbuilding\u201d does not include such structures as oil and gas storage tanks, grain storage bins, silos, fractionating towers, blast furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, coke ovens, brick kilns, and coal tipples.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In holding that the appellants\u2019 greenhouses were \u201cbuildings,\u201d the Tax Court relied on the reasoning set forth in Sun-nyside Nurseries, 59 T.C. 113 (1972),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was a companion case to <em>Thirup </em>and which also involved greenhouses. In <em>Sunnyside, </em>the Court applied two tests in deciding that the greenhouses were \u201cbuildings\u201d within section 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The first test merely involved consideration of the outward appearance of the structures: since the greenhouses looked like buildings, they must be \u201cbuildings.\u201d This test, which can be called the appearance test, is attractively simple, and it draws some support from the following sentence from the Commissioner\u2019s definition: \u201cThe term \u2018building\u2019 generally means any structure or edifice enclosing a space within its walls, and usually covered by a roof . . . .\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.48-l(e)(l). The quoted statement appears in substantially the same form in both of the Congressional committee reports on the investment tax credit. H.R.Rep.No.1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. A18 (1962) (1962-3 Cum. Bull. 405, 516); S.Rep.No.1881, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 154 (1962) (1962-3 Cum. Bull. 707, 858).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">Considering the Congressional history as a whole, however, it is hardly deniable that the intent of Congress in its creation of the investment tax credit was to encourage improvements in the quality and quantity of American industrial products. We think that the appearance test is too imprecise to achieve this Congressional purpose. We note that the other courts that recently have considered the appearance test also have rejected it. <em>See </em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. United States, 499 F.2d 1263, 1271-1272 (Ct.Cl. 1974) (large, warehouselike structures designed to control temperature and humidity for the proper aging of bourbon whiskey are not \u201cbuildings\u201d); Melvin Satrum, 62 T.C. 413 (1974) (reviewed by the full Court) (structures specially designed to provide a beneficial environment for chickens in a commercial egg-producing business are not \u201cbuildings,\u201d despite two dissenting opinions emphasizing, <em>inter alia, </em>the structures\u2019 appearance). The Commissioner himself has also declined, on occasion, to apply the appearance test. <em>See, e. g., </em>Rev.Rul. 359, 1971-2 Cum. Bull. 62 (a facility for the bulk storage of peanuts is not a \u201cbuilding,\u201d even though it looks like a building); Rev.Rul. 132, 1968 \u2014 1 Cum. Bull. 14 (same decision for a facility for the bulk storage of potatoes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">The second <em>Sunnyside Nurseries </em>test for determining whether a structure is a \u201cbuilding\u201d within section 48, that of the structure\u2019s function or use, derives from another portion of section 1.48 \u2014 1(e)(1) of the Treasury Regulations: \u201cThe term \u2018building\u2019 generally means any structure or edifice . . . the purpose of which is, for example, to provide shelter or housing, or to provide working, office, parking, display or sales space.\u201d This statement, too, appears in substantially the same form in the Congressional committee reports. H.R.Rep.No.1447, 87th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Cong., 2d Sess. A18 (1962) (1962-3 Cum. Bull. 405, 516); S.Rep.No.1881, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 154 (1962) (1962 \u2014 3 Cum. Bull. 707, 858).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The Tax Court has written that the quoted portion of section 1.48 \u2014 1(e)(1) establishes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">a functional test which limits slightly the broad scope of our common understanding of \u201cbuilding.\u201d Thus, under section 1.48 \u2014 1(e)(1) . ., the basic definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d is a structure with walls and a roof, but a \u201cbuilding,\u201d it is declared, typically provides space for certain purposes. The enumerated purposes . . . are the furnishing of shelter or housing, or of working, office, parking, display, or sales space. These purposes are exemplary and not all inclusive. But . the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d [is] limited somewhat to the functions just stated'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Robert E. Catron, 50 T.C. 306, 311 (1968) (reviewed by the full Court) (a specialized facility used solely for cold storage of apples is not a \u201cbuilding\u201d). Under the functional test, therefore, the \u201cbuildings\u201d that are excluded by the parenthetical part of section 48(a)(1)(B) are structures that provide shelter or housing or furnish working, office, parking, display, or sales space, or exist for another purpose that could be listed with the enumerated purposes without violating the constraining rule of <em>ejusdem generis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Abandoning the appearance test, the most recent authorities have adopted the functional test. <em>See, e. g., </em>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. United States, 499 F.2d 1263 (Ct.Cl. 1974); Melvin Satrum, 62 T.C. 413 (1974) (reviewed by the full Court). We thoroughly agree with this more recent approach. The functional test carves out those types of general purpose buildings, such as \u201capartment houses, factory and office buildings, warehouses, barns, garages, railway or bus stations, and stores,\u201d Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.48 \u2014 1(e)(1), that we think Congress intended to exclude from the investment tax credit. But the test preserves for the credit those specialized structures whose utility is principally and primarily a significantly contributive factor in the actual manufacturing or production of the product itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">Applying a functional test, the Tax Court found in <em>Thirup, </em>and in <em>Sunnyside Nurseries, </em>that the amount of employee activity taking place inside the greenhouses indicated that the greenhouses provided working space, one of the enumerated functions of a \u201cbuilding.\u201d In <em>Brown-Forman Distillers, supra, </em>and <em>Sat-rum, supra, </em>the courts distinguished <em>Sun-nyside Nurseries </em>on the ground that Sunnyside\u2019s employees spent more time inside the greenhouses than, respectively, Brown-Forman\u2019s employees spent inside the whiskey warehouses or Satrum\u2019s workers spent in the chicken coops.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">We find the distinction based on the <em>amount </em>of human activity unpersuasive. The proper inquiry, which goes to the <em>nature </em>of the employee activity inside the structures, is \u201cwhether the structures provide working space for employees that is more than merely incidental to the principal function or use of the structure.\u201d Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. United States, 499 F.2d 1263, 1271 (Ct.Cl. 1974). <em>See </em>Robert E. Catron, 50 T.C. 306, 316 (1968) (reviewed by the full Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">In <em>Satrum, supra, </em>employees worked in aisles between the rows of chicken cages- inside the structures to collect eggs, feed chickens, and remove droppings. Workers also spent long periods of time inside the structures removing thousands of chickens that were to be sent to market and replacing those chickens with younger birds. The Tax Court characterized these activities as \u201cmerely supportive of, and ancillary to,\u201d the purpose of the chickens and expressly found that the structures did not provide working space. 62 T.C. at 417. In our judgment, the activities of the Thirups\u2019 greenhouse employees were, without doubt, of the same supportive and ancillary nature as the activities of the workers in <em>Satrum.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That flowers may re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>quire more human care than chickens is not a sufficient reason for deciding that greenhouses are \u201cbuildings\u201d while chicken coops are not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">We conclude that under the functional test, the Thirups\u2019 greenhouses do not function as \u201cbuildings,\u201d as that term is employed in section 48. The greenhouses supply the controlled environment that is essential to the commercial production of more and finer cut flowers, a function neither enumerated in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.48 \u2014 1(e)(1) nor sufficiently similar to the enumerated functions to be within their scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The decision of the Tax Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">. The Tax Court found that the Thirups\u2019 greenhouses might be used to grow other varieties of plants but that they are not economically adaptable to any other purposes. 59 T.C. at 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">. For the investment credit to be allowed on 100 percent of the cost of \u201csection 38 property,\u201d section 46(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the useful life of the property be 8 years or more. For the purposes of the investment credit and this litigation only, the parties have stipulated that the useful life of the greenhouse components will be 8 years or more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">. <em>Sunnyside Nurseries </em>was appealed to our court, but the appeal was dismissed because of the appellant\u2019s failure to prosecute his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">. The only employee activity inside the Thir-ups\u2019 greenhouses that was not supportive to the flowers was the workers\u2019 lunch and coffee breaks. We think that activity to be insignifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>cant. There was no lunchroom or other specialized area inside the greenhouses for the breaks, and the workers rested and ate their lunch in the aisles near their work only for their own convenience. ' We note that <em>Sunny-side Nurseries </em>presented a somewhat different situation than that with which we are here concerned. There the Tax Court found that workers inside the greenhouses wrapped the pots in which plants were growing in decorative foil and then packed the potted plants into boxes for shipment. 59 T.C. 117-118. We express no opinion as to whether that additional activity justifies the Tax Court\u2019s <em>Sunnyside Nurseries </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1014-26\">. In this regard we agree with the dissenting judges in <em>Satrum </em>who believed that the human activity inside the chicken coops was comparable to the human activity inside the greenhouses in <em>Thirup </em>and <em>Sunnyside Nurseries. </em>Melvin Satrum, 62 T.C. 413, 418-419 (1974) (dissenting opinion of Dawson J., joined by Raum and Drennen, JJ.).
