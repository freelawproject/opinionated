It aptly describes our action in these appeals as/we overrule our prior holding in In re Natta, 388 F.2d 215 (3d Cir. 1968), which erroneously gave a broad interpretation to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (1952)^ It is our conclusion that the statute does not grant broad discovery authorization to the district courts in patent interference cases but limits ancillary jurisdiction to the issuance of subpoenasi as permitted by prior practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">These two appeals were argued together, and, while the fact situations differ, a common question of law governs the outcome of both cases. The relevant facts will be set out in abbreviated fashion, however, to give some background to the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Both cases arise from interference proceedings filed in the Patent Office. This is an administrative process authorized by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 (1962) to determine which of two or more applicants is the first inventor and thus entitled to a patent. The applicant first in time is called the senior party, and the other is designated the junior party. After all parties have filed preliminary statements presenting the grounds for their positions, a period of time is set by an examiner for the filing of motions. Thereafter, the Board of Patent Examiners establishes a time schedule designating when the parties must present their trial evidence by means of deposition, affidavit, or stipulation. The junior party is required to produce his evidence first, and the senior party follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">In the preliminary stages of the <em>Duffy </em>case, the junior party, Barnes, et al., filed a motion <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supported by affidavits. The motion was denied by the patent examiner, and in due course the junior party sought relief from the Commissioner of Patents. In the interim, the senior party, Duffy, applied to the district court in New Jersey . . . for subpoenas <em>duces tecum </em>to compel discovery by depositions. After argument, the district court wrote an opinion <footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> permitting discovery but limiting it to matters dealing with the veracity of the affidavits attached to the junior party\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">In the <em>Frilette </em>case, the junior party filed a request for discovery with the Patent Office pursuant to its Rule 287(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion was denied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Board as being premature since the time for filing documents by the senior party under Rule 287(a) had not yet expired. The junior party then applied to the district court in Delaware, which also denied discovery in an opinion holding that good cause had not been shown, and that the request was premature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This anomaly \u2014 permitting discovery in the district court while matters are still pending before an administrative agency \u2014 exists only in patent interferences. Generally, discovery is not available in administrative procedures. Davis, 1 Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 8.15 at 588 says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201cThe APA contains no provision for pre-trial discovery in the administrative process and, of course, the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for discovery do not apply to administrative proceedings. Therefore, in the absence of special statutory provision, and in the absence of special administrative regulation, no procedure for discovery is normally available in a federal administrative proceeding.\u201d [Footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOg\">Though there has been much criticism directed toward the absence of these procedures in administrative matters, little has been done to cure it except in the Patent Office. <em>See Davis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">' The parties in these cases assert their right to secure discovery in the district court upon the authority of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-16\">\u201cThe clerk of any United States court for the district wherein testimony is to be taken for use in any contested case in the Patent Office, shall, upon the application of any party thereto, issue a subpoena for any witness residing or being within such district, commanding him to appear and testify before an officer in such district authorized to take depositions and affidavits, at the time and place stated in the subpoena. The provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attend-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>anee of witnesses and to the production of documents and things shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This statutory provision was interpreted by this court in In re Natta, <em>supra, </em>to mean that Congress intended to include not only Fed.R.Civ.P. 45, pertaining to the attendance of witnesses and production of documents, but also the other rules of federal practice relating to discovery. The dissent by Chief Judge Seitz concluded that Congress had meant only to maintain the continuity of authority as granted to the courts under an earlier repealed statute pertaining to subpoenas and had not intended to incorporate the broad provisions relating to discovery generally. Essentially, the dissent reasoned that the courts were only to issue and enforce subpoenas in connection with the preparation of evidence for submission to the Board of Patent Interferences \u2014 the practice which had previously prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Prior to <em>Natta, </em>pretrial discovery, as such, was unknown in cases before the Board of Patent Interferences. The earlier cases of Gladrow v. Weisz, 354 F.2d 464 (5th Cir. 1965);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Natta v. Zletz, 379 F.2d 615 (7th Cir. 1967),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Korman v. Shull, 184 F.Supp. 928 (W.D.Mich.1960),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all involved instances where testimony was being prepared and subpoenas either had or could have been issued to compel production of documents. None of those cases actually involved pretrial discovery as that term is understood in the usual civil litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">The impact of the <em>Natta </em>decision was substantial. While the holding there, as in the earlier cases, applied to a situation where testimony was in progress, the dictum in that opinion was so broad that Applications were soon made and granted where pretrial discovery was sought.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because of the unique procedural posture of these cases, almost every order granting or denying discovery, no matter how routine in nature, became appeala-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ble.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ? The appellate bench thus was called upon to review, in this isolated field, discovery matters which would have been interlocutory in other fields of litigation] where they would probably never receive attention in an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"APa\">In addition to this substantial burden which was placed upon the traditional process of judicial administration, the liberalization of discovery engendered an interference all its own \u2014 one between the procedures in the Patent Office and those in the courts. The traditional timetable for submitting a case in the Patent Office and its concern for limiting the scope to relevant evidence were effectively neutralized if either party resorted to the federal courts for discovery in any or all stages in the interference proceedings. Instead of a role of \u201cco-operatively complementing\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Patent Office, the courts became the means through which the parties ranged far and wide, geographically as well as in terms of relevance, in search of evidence which, although not germane to issues in the Patent Office, might lead to other admissible evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This, of course, all took time and disrupted the schedules of the Patent Office with stays of proceedings in that agency while discovery proceeded in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Over the years the Patent Office has developed a procedure for handling these cases which required the junior party to present its evidence first. ^Discovery by the junior party in the district court pri- or to or while it presents its own case, /however^* frustrates the order of precedence which the Patent Office desires to utilize.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whether that scheduling and priority are desirable is really not relevant, because they represent a choice by the agency responsible for processing these matters. The wisdom of the procedure is not entrusted to the courisi Additional areas of conflict arose when the Patent Office ruled that certain discovery evidence which was secured in the courts would not be received in the Patent Office proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These conflicts between the Board of Patent Interferences and the court system would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>be serious enough if only one court were involved, but when several district courts and courts of appeals are concerned with different phases of the same litigation, the aggravations and delays become compounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Within the court system itself, the usual rules of confining control of the litigation to the principal forum become obscured and unworkable. Each district court has only the same interest in the outcome of the case as another. None has the decisional power in the final analysis; no one can guide and direct the parties toward some definitive goal. Although the matter ultimately will be submitted to the Patent Office, that agency cannot limit the activities or scope of discovery in the courts until that process has run its course. Interference proceedings thus lose the rudder that the court or agency which should have control over the case can provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">^Even if no discovery at all is permitted in the Patent Office, the parties are not without a remedy. They still have a right of appeal to a district court under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 14^(1952).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an appeal is <em>de novo, </em>and the full scope of discovery is permitted since the case then comes within the jurisdiction of the district court and the usual rules of procedure apply?) But in such a situation the forum district does control the case, and orders on discovery are not appealable as of right but rather are interlocutory. Since the district court is familiar with the case, it is in a position to rule intelligently and promptly on the necessity of limitation or expansion of the scope of discovery in a particular case. There is an obvious improvement in judicial efficiency by having one court control the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Thus, the broad interpretation of Section 24 adopted by this court in 1968 established a procedural system which violated such tenets of good judicial administration as centralization of the litigation, disallowance of appeals on interlocutory and collateral matters, and primary jurisdiction. All repercussions were not negative, however. Spurred, no doubt, by the effects of the <em>Natta </em>decision, the Patent Office in 1971 chose to exercise the power to promulgate its own rules of discovery under the authority granted by Congress in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 23 (1952). The Patent Office discovery rules, being limited in time and scope, are not as liberal as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but do represent an improvement over prior administrative practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The obvious disadvantages of the <em>Nat-ta </em>discovery doctrine and the advent of the Patent Office discovery rules have prompted us to reconsider our holding in that case, rather than simply to accept it as binding precedent. Despite its drawbacks, we would be bound by that rule had Congress in fact conferred such jurisdiction upon the courts, because we must recognize such jurisdiction as is granted by the legislative branch. The question is, did Congress in fact grant the jurisdiction which <em>Natta </em>thought to exist or did that conclusion come about only by erroneous construction and interpretation. We conclude that the latter is true. __</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In considering the words of fehe statute itself,/two points are readily apparent. It) does not use the word \u201cdiscovery,\u201d nor is there any effort made to incorporate all of the federal rules of procedure? /As Chief Judge Seitz pointed out in his <em>Nat-ta </em>dissent?' if Congress had meant to include discovery in its broad sense, such a substantial change in previous practice would naturally have been expected to be reflected in specific congressional recognition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Not even the most enthusias<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tic advocates of the broad discovery made possible by <em>Natta </em>assert that all of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are included by transfer under Section 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Little would be served by repeating the excellent historical analysis of Section 24 set out in the <em>Natta </em>dissent. We simply adopt it at this time as the correct interpretation of the statute noting that, as is not unknown in judicial history, the opinion which was a dissent when rendered now becomes the law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">We do not lightly overturn precedent, and <em>stare decisis </em>must be treated with respect. But when on deep and mature reconsideration it becomes apparent that an error has been made by the court, the proper step is correction. This is particularly so in a matter of procedure where no substantive rights are vested as a result of the earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We do not believe it is necessary to wait for Congress to take the corrective action because the error was judge-made and the correction should be made in the same fashion. We cannot escape the fact that what has been done is in the nature of what, in the words of Chief Justice Hughes, might be called a \u201cself-inflicted wound.\u201d We did not wait for congressional action to correct our mistake on \u201cmanufactured diversity\u201d but took that step ourselves in McSparran v. Weist, 402 F.2d 867 (3d Cir. 1968), cert. denied sub nom., 395 U.S. 903, 89 S.Ct. 1739, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969). The fact that Congress has under consideration several proposals to amend the patent statutes,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> including provisions relating to discovery, similarly should not cause us to delay setting our own house in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u00cdWe hold that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 in referring to \u201cprovisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attend-' anee of witnesses and to the production of documents\u201d refers to the matters encompassed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(a), (b), (c), (d)(2), (e) and (fp</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">The order of the district court in Fri-lette v. Kimberlin will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The motions for attorneys\u2019 fees and for dismissal of the appeals by the senior party, Duffy, will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The request by the junior party, Barnes, to impound or enjoin the use of the evidence obtained by discovery will be denied. At this stage, it is not practicable to attempt to unscramble the eggs. The question of whether the evidence is admissible in proceedings in the Patent Office or other forums is a matter for decision by the body which might be asked to consider the material. We express no views on admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">In Duffy v. Barnes, the orders of the district court of July 24, 1973 at No. 73 \u2014 1635 and of August 6, 1973 at No. 73 \u2014 1695 will be reversed, each party to bear his own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. The motion sought to amend the original application for the patent, which had listed Barnes and Preziosi as co-inventors, by deleting the name of Barnes. The purpose of the motion was to make the application for the patent consistent with the preliminary statement of the junior party which had shown Preziosi as the sole inventor,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1a\">\n<p id=\"AR3\">. The court\u2019s order was handed down on July 24, 1973, and an appeal was promptly filed in this court at No. 73 1635. A request for stay was filed on July 25, 1973 and denied on July 30, 1973. A second appeal was filed from the district court\u2019s order of August 6, 1973 at No. 73-1695 together with a motion for stay and for clarification which was denied on August 22, 1973. Yet a third motion was filed in this court on October 12, 1973, seeking impoundment of or prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by discovery. After argument, the motion was denied. Cross motions by Duffy for attorneys\u2019 fees and dismissal of the appeals were referred to the panel to which the appeals were to be assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-15\">. Pursuant to the authority granted by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 23, Patent Office Rule 287, 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.287 was enacted effective June 11, 1971.

Del. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b303-6\">. The court held that a motion under Fed.R. Civ.P. 34 to produce documents by a party under cross examination would be allowed since the same result could be obtained by a subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>The opinion did not purport to include all discovery rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">. A motion had been made by a senior party under Rule 34 for documents to use in connection with a cross examination of junior party employees on rebuttal testimony. Presentation of testimony was in process though the witness was not yet on the stand. Relying on Gladrow v. Weisz, <em>supra, </em>the court ordered production under Rule 34. Again, it seems that the material could have been secured by a subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. In this case a subpoena had been issued. By way of dictum and without any review of the history of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, the district court held that Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, 30, 34, and 45 were applicable. Subpoenas were ordered quashed because good cause had not been shown. Apparently, the subpoenas were issued in connection with presentation of testimony. However, in the later case of Korman v. Nobile, 133 U.S.P.Q. 178 (W.D.Mich.1962), the same judge in passing upon another motion in the same interference proceeding said that the broad provision of the rules relating generally to discovery did not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\">. The opinion contained the statement that \u201cThis statute manifests a clear congressional intent to make available to parties to patent interferences the broad discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d 388 F.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">In Sears, Discovery in Interferences, 53 Journal of the Patent Office Society 693 (1971), the author, one of the counsel appearing in the <em>Natta </em>cases, stated that \u201cdiscovery\u201d in proceedings before the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1937 was secured in connection with testimony to be presented as evidence at the trial. Since this evidence was in deposition form following the old equity practice, extremely wide latitude was extended to the concept of relevancy and materiality because the parties would not know in advance what rulings would be made at trial. This was a practical approach designed to avoid a remand for the taking of further testimony made necessary by unanticipated rulings at trial or on appeal and, of course,, allowed \u201cdiscovery\u201d of information arguably irrelevant and immaterial which led to other evidence of more value.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">As the author states candidly, \u201cPerhaps unfortunately, some practitioners were motivated to go much further than the <em>Natta </em>cases did, or were ever intended to go, and to seek so-called <em>\u2018pretrial </em>discovery\u2019 during the interference motion period regardless of their ultimate entitlement to present evidence in the interference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-16\">In both cases at bar, discovery was sought in advance of the time set either for testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>or discovery as permitted by the new Patent Office rules. In <em>Duffy, </em>application was not made to the Patent Office, and in <em>Frilette, </em>application had been made and refused as premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. The <em>Natta </em>case discussed here was but one of many growing out of discovery in Patent Interference 89,634. Not only was this circuit involved, but trial and appellate courts in other parts of the country were struggling with various aspects of discovery in that same interference proceeding, often at the same time. The following is a list, not warranted to be complete, of published opinions on various rulings: Montecatini Edison ..2d 633 (7th Cir. 1969); In re Natta, 410 F.2d 187 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 836, 90 S.Ct. 95, 24 L.Ed.2d 87; Natta v.

Even in the most complex antitrust litigation filed in the district court, the overwhelming majority of the matters similar to those appealed in the various patent interference cases would have been considered interlocutory and would have been concluded by the trial judge. Judge Coolahan commented on another unsatisfactory aspect in Babcock and Wilcox Co. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., 173 U.S. P.Q. 480, 481 (D.C.N.J.1972), \u201cA more undesirable plan for litigation could hardly be imagined, than that by which counsel must commute, often frantically and behind schedule, between the Patent Office and the federal district court in a time-consuming effort to exhaust discovery rights at the same time the interference trial has begun.

Thus the majority disregards the following language, first included in \u00a7 24 by the Act of July 19, 1952, c. 950, \u00a7 1, 66 Stat. <em>795:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThe provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attendance of witnesses and to the production of documents and things shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The plain or ordinary meaning of words used in a statute is applied in its construction. See Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass\u2019n, 390 U.S. 459, 465, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 20 L.Ed.2d 30 (1968); Malat v. Riddell, 383 U.S. 569, 571, 86 S.Ct. 1030, 16 L.Ed.2d 102 (1966); Hughes v.

In addition to the plain meaning of the present statutory language, an analysis of the previous language and amendments thereto contradicts the majority\u2019s position. The applicable statutory language, as contained in Title 35 U.S.C. prior to the July 1952 Act, and the substitute language in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 are set out as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>35 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>54 prior to July 19, </em>1952_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">\u201cThe clerk of any court of the United States, for any district or Territory wherein testimony is to be taken for use in any contested ease pending in the Patent Office, shall, upon the application of any party thereto, or of his agent or attoi'ney, issue a subpoena for any witness residing or being within such district or Territory, commanding him to appear and testify before any officer in such district or Territory authorized to take depositions and affidavits at any time and place in the subpoena stated. But no witness shall be required to attend at any place more than forty miles from the place where the subpoena is served upon him; <em>and the provisions of section 647, of Title 28 </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>relating to the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\"><em>First paragraph of 35 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 <em>24 after July 19,1952</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">\u201cThe clerk of any United States court for the district wherein testimony is to be taken for use in any contested case in the Patent Office, shall, upon the application of any party thereto, issue a subpoena for any witness residing or being within such district, commanding him to appear and testify before an officer in such district authorized to take depositions and affidavits, at the time and place stated in the subpoena. <em>The provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attendance of witnesses and to the production of documents and things shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-16\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>The reference to Rule 45 was effectively-contained in the statute prior to the 1952 Act. Not only did the amending language alter this reference, but it also referred for the first time to the \u201cprovisions of the . . . Rules relating to . the production of documents and things.\u201d These exact words were used in the title of Rule 34 as it existed in 1952. The title to this Rule, as amended in 1946,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> read as follows in 1952:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201cRule 34. Discovery and Production of Documents and Things for Inspection, Copying, or Photographing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">As opposed to this title, the titles and subtitles of Rule 45 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">\u201cRule 45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">\n<em>\u201cSubpoena</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">\u201c(a) For Attendance of Witnesses; Form; Issuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">\u201c(b) For Production of Documentary Evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-15\">\u201c(c) Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-16\">\u201c(d) Subpoena for Taking Depositions; Place of Examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-17\">\u201c(e) Subpoena for a Hearing or Trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-18\">\u201c(f) Contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">According to the plain meaning of the words used in (a) 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, as amended in 1952, and (b) Rules 34 and 45, it seems clear that the words \u201cthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d referred at least to Rule 34 as well as Rule 45. Otherwise, Congress could have retained the wording of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 54, merely substituting \u201cFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45\u201d for \u201csection 647 of Title 28.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">A. <em>Frilette Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">In the <em>Frilette </em>case, during the preparations-for-testimony stage, prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>commencement of the junior party Fri-lette\u2019s taking of testimony, Frilette filed a motion for discovery with the Board of Patent Interferences under Patent Office Rule 287(c), seeking certain information from Kimberlin. The Board of Patent Interferences denied the motion in a decision dated January 17, 1973, on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the motion under 287(c) for additional discovery was premature \u201csince the time for service of documents and lists by Kimberlin ., the senior party, under Rule 287(a) has not closed and in view of the fact that it is therefore not known what documents and lists will be served . .</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Frilette also filed in the district court a motion to compel discovery under F.R. Civ.P. 37. In this motion, Frilette sought substantially the same discovery sought in the Patent Office, and requested an order compelling Kimberlin (1) to designate certain witnesses under F.R. Civ.P. 30(b)(6), (2) to answer certain interrogatories under F.R.Civ.P. 33, (3) to produce documents under F.R.Civ.P. 34, and (4) to admit certain facts under F.R. Civ.P. 36. A hearing on this motion was held before the district court, and, in an Opinion and Order dated May 15, 1973, the district court denied the motion. See Frilette v. Kimberlin, 358 F.Supp. 493 (D.Del.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Frilette appeals from this denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The district court, in denying Frilette\u2019s motion to compel discovery,' stated that the law as previously enunciated should no longer prevail because of the recent occurrence of two events: (1) the 1970 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which eliminated the good cause requirement as a prerequisite to Rule 34 document requests, and (2) the introduction by the Patent Office in June 1971 of the discovery provisions of Rule 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">With respect to the 1970 amendments, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cSince the good cause requirement was apparently a factor in the federal courts\u2019 willingness to interpret \u00a7 24 broadly, this Court is unable to conclude that \u00a7 24 would have received a similar construction absent this safeguard. In such circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to continue to impose a good cause requirement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">358 F.Supp. at 495-496. The district court went on to conclude that Frilette had not made a showing of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">With respect to the recent introduction by the Patent Office of the discovery provisions of Rule 287, the district court stated that the absence of any discovery mechanism in the Patent Office prior to the promulgation of Rule 287 had been a significant factor in the federal courts\u2019 willingness to give 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 a broad reading and to assume jurisdiction over discovery matters in interference proceedings. The district court felt that the introduction of the Patent Office discovery rules \u201cappear[s] to reflect the Patent Office\u2019s efforts to construct a discovery process which embodies the good cause requirement cited\u201d in such cases as In re Natta, <em>supra, </em>and that Rule 287 might, therefore, require a redefinition of the federal courts\u2019 role in granting discovery in interference proceedings under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">Based upon the above two considerations, the district court announced the following limitation on its role in interference discovery cases arising under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">\u201cWhile a federal court cannot abrogate its responsibility to assume jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, it must not blind itself to the ancillary, supportive role, it is designed to fulfill in interference matters. Until the Patent Office has had a reasonable opportunity to implement its discovery procedures and has demonstrated the parameters within which they will be administered, the courts are in no position to evaluate the potential efficacy of the procedures and the possibility that the courts will be able to assume a secondary role in discovery. In light of these general considerations, the Court must scrutinize Frilette\u2019s partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ular discovery requests in light of the issues before the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">358 F.Supp. at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Frilette\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that, in light of the elimination by Congress in 1970 of the good cause requirement as a prerequisite to the grant of discovery under F.R.Civ.P. 34, the district court erred in judicially imposing a good cause requirement upon a party seeking discovery in an interference proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Specifically, Frilette claims that the district court\u2019s resurrection of the good cause requirement, on the ground that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 would have received a different construction by this court in <em>Natta </em>and other courts absent the good cause safeguard, has no basis in logic. First, Frilette notes that good cause is not, and never was, a requirement of any of the discovery rules except F.R. Civ.P. 34, and that courts have granted discovery in patent interferences under such other discovery rules without regard to good cause. <em>See, e. g., </em>Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., 54 F.R.D. 474 (D.N.J.1971) (motion to compel discovery under F.R.Civ.P. 37). Secondly, Frilette contends that the reasons for the. 1970 amendment of F.R. Civ.P. 34, eliminating the good cause requirement, apply with equal force whether the parties seeking discovery are parties to a Patent Office interference or litigants in a different type of civil proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, Frilette contends that the application of a different standard to the scope of discovery under the Federal Rules when the interference is pending before the Patent Office would not only impair the Patent Office\u2019s quest for truth but also necessarily increase the number of suits in the district courts under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146 after decisions of the Board of Patent Interferences since, as the district court in the instant case noted, \u201con appeal to the district court from a decision by the Board of Patent Interferences, the movant may be entitled to broad discovery under the Federal Rules without any showing of good cause or other particular reason for the requested discovery.\u201d 358 F.Supp. at 498 n. 7. Thus, Frilette argues, losing parties in interference proceedings are more inclined to bring a civil action under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 146 if broader discovery is available in such civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">I agree with these contentions and accordingly would hold that the district court erred in judicially imposing a good cause requirement upon discovery in patent interferences under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24. In 1970, Congress saw fit to permit the removal of the good cause requirement from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to become effective, and I perceive no logical reason why courts should carve an exception to such legislative action with respect to patent interferences. The district court, in resolving Frilette\u2019s request for discovery in the instant case, should have considered the same factors that it would consider in resolving a discovery request in any other civil proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">One further aspect of this case requires discussion. As stated above, the district court, in addition to requiring Frilette to show good cause, stated that the Patent Office\u2019s recent promulgation of Rule 287 rendered distinguishable the <em>Natta </em>case and other cases which provided for broad discovery in the federal courts under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24. Reasoning that the presence of Rule 287 might require a restructuring of the federal courts\u2019 role under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 and enable federal courts to assume a more limited, secondary role in interference discovery matters, the district court proceeded to \u201cscrutinize Frilette\u2019s particular discovery requests in light of the issues before the Patent Office.\u201d 358 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>at 496. The district court then noted, in denying Frilette\u2019s motion, \u201cthat under Rule 287(a) and (c), Frilette\u2019s discovery directed to Kimberlin\u2019s case in chief is premature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498. The district court did not make clear, however, whether its denial of Frilette\u2019s motion was based solely upon Frilette\u2019s inability to show good cause or also upon the Patent Office\u2019s prior denial of Frilette\u2019s motion as premature under Rule 287(a) and (c). Because of this uncertainty, I would remand to the district court for reconsideration of Frilette\u2019s discovery motion and, if necessary, clarification of its reasons for denial of such motion, in light of my belief that the district court erred in requiring Frilette to show good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Accordingly, I would not attempt to resolve definitively in this appeal the issue of what effect Patent Office Rule 287 has upon the availability of discovery under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, particularly where the Board of Patent Interferences has denied a motion under Patent Office Rule 287 requesting the same discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I have, however, substantial doubt as to whether the presence of Rule 287 compels a narrowing of the federal court\u2019s broad role in interference discovery proceedings under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24. Several factors underlie this doubt. First, on its face, Rule 287 provides for only limited discovery in the Patent Office. Under Rule 287(a), discovery is available prior to the testimony period solely for the purpose of determining the matters upon which the opponent will rely, not those which might build an affirmative case for the discovering party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, Rule 287 does not provide for discovery as broad in scope as the discovery which may be provided by a district court under \u00a7 24. Secondly, Congress, presumably well aware of the conflict between the availability of broad discovery under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 and the traditional order of proof procedure of interference proceedings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> repeatedly refused to amend 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 to eliminate this conflict prior to the adoption of Rule 287 in June 1971.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Finally, the language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 is mandatory, and it is questionable whether the Patent Office\u2019s promulgation of a narrow discovery rule can restrict the force and effect of such language. I believe that the district court should take the above factors into account in reconsidering Frilette\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As a final matter, I reject the contention of appellee Kimberlin that the district court order denying Frilette\u2019s discovery motion was conditional rather then final, and that it was, therefore, not an appealable final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. See Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Foster Wheeler Corp., 415 F.2d 777 (3d Cir. 1969). In my view, the district court order was intended to be a final disposition of Frilette\u2019s motion for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">I would vacate the May 15, 1973, district court order and remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with the foregoing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">B. <em>Duffy Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">As stated in Judge Adams\u2019 opinion, I agree that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Duffy to proceed with discovery relating to whether Barnes and Preziosi filed their patent application fraudulently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Circuit Judge ADAMS concurs in the statutory analysis set forth in this opinion and in the application of that analysis to the Frilette case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\">. I do not disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s statement that the language of the majority in In re Natta, 388 F.2d 215 (3d Cir. 1968), gave an unjustifiably broad interpretation to the 1952 amendment to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-17\">.

Congress might have hesitated to cite in \u00a7 24 a single rule of procedure, since the rules are not statutes and thus not subject to the closest congressional control over content and wording. Nevertheless, no reason, appears why Congress would have failed to specify the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to <em>subpoenas </em>had the intent been to limit the reference to Rule 45. Also, the legislative history of the 1952 Act shows that Congress changed the language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 as it first appeared in a draft bill to provide that \u201cthe provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to <em>the attendance of witnesses and to the production of documents and things </em>shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d H.R.9133 was introduced in the 81st Congress on July 17, 1950, and this bill was reintroduced in revised form in the 82nd Congress as H.R.3760, which became the Patent Act of July 19, 1952 (P.L. 593, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., c. 950; 66 Stat. 792). H.R.9133 contained this language in the last half of the last sentence of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-24\">\u201c . . . and the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-26\">When this bill was reintroduced in revised form in the 82nd Congress as H.R.3760, the last sentence of the first paragraph of proposed 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 had been changed to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-27\">\u201cThe provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and things shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-28\">The result of the many suggestions from the Patent Bar and the public concerning H.R. 9133 and the reintroduction of this bill in revised form in the 82nd Congress as H.R. 3760 is contained in House Report No. 1923, May 12, 1952. This history reveals the substitution for the words \u201cthe issuance of subpoenas duces tecum\u201d of the words \u201cthe attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and things,\u201d which is the language appearing in the 1952 Patent Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">.

I have some additional observations, however, regarding the respect a court should accord its earlier decisions, particularly a decision such as <em>Natta, </em>and regarding the practical effects that the holding announced today by the majority will have on interference litigation in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">Section 24 was enacted in 1952. In 1968 this Court, in <em>Natta, </em>interpreted the intent of Congress, as expressed in the statute, as follows: \u201cThis statute manifests a clear congressional intent to make available to parties to patent interferences the broad discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Natta </em>Court\u2019s construction of section 24 conformed to pri- or interpretations by the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Seventh<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Circuits and by the District Courts for the Western District of Michigan<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Northern District of Oklahoma.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequent to our decision in <em>Natta, </em>the same interpretation has been adopted by the Courts of Appeals for the Tenth<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Second<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Circuits, and by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Courts for the District of Columbia<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the District of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And this Court has applied its <em>Natta </em>interpretation of the statute on a number of occasions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Indeed, no court of appeals has adopted a narrower reading of section 24 than that set forth in <em>Natta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The parties to these appeals who would have us upset our decision in <em>Nat-ta </em>contend that the adoption of discovery procedures by the Patent Office in 1971 necessitates a reversal of this Court\u2019s interpretation of a congressional statute enacted in 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The basic issue before this Court is whether an intermediate federal appellate court that has for approximately seven years adhered to one interpretation of the congressional intent embodied in section 24 may properly adopt a new interpretation of that statute because of the actions of an administrative agency and the Court\u2019s present views regarding the optimal allocation of jurisdiction in the federal system. I believe that an appropriate respect for the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and for the separation of judicial and legislative functions should preclude such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\"><em>Stare decisis </em>is one of the fundaments of our legal system. All lawyers, I suppose, are familiar with the classic words of Lord Coke, \u201cThe knowne certaintie of the law is the safetie of all.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, this aphorism is emblazoned on the walls</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">of some of our most prestigious law schools.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The knowledge that a tenet of law, once decided, will remain constant permits the public to order their lives in reliance upon the prior decisions of the court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, observance of the precept of <em>stare decisis </em>advances the efficient administration of the judicial system. More significantly, a court\u2019s adherence to its earlier decisions encourages public confidence in the legal system by providing evidence that the court\u2019s holdings are the product of principled and carefully reasoned consideration and that the courts dispense equal treatment to all litigants similarly situated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As Justice Brand\u00e9is observed, \u201cStare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right . . . . This is</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as it can in the case before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">The constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers lends added significance to the principle of stare decisis in the area of statutory construction. In deciding <em>Natta </em>in 1968, this Court was called upon to construe the congressional intent expressed in section 24. Our interpretation then became an integral part of the statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> When a court has once determined the meaning Congress intended its words to carry, the court has completed its judicial function. Ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>sent amendment, the legislative intent is not altered by time. Therefore, excepting extraordinary circumstances, a court, in altering its interpretation of the meaning to be derived from the words of the statute, encroaches on the power of Congress to enact or amend legislation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">Of course, when this Court first interprets a statute, then the statute becomes what this Court has said it is. Such an initial interpretation is proper, and unavoidable The Court undertakes the task of interpretation, however, not because the Court has any special ability to fathom the intent of Congress, but rather because interpretation is unavoidable in the decision of the case before it. When the law has been settled by an earlier case then any subsequent \u201creinterpretation\u201d of the statute is gratuitous and neither more nor less than an amendment: it is no different in effect from a judicial alteration of language that Congress itself placed in the statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">If in construing a statute a court has misapprehended the intention of Congress, the error is susceptible to correction by the legislature. If this Court has failed to perceive the intent of Congress, or has interpreted a statute in such a manner as to thwart the legislative purpose, Congress may change it. \u201cThe lessons of experience are not learned by judges alone.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Statutory constructions are, in this respect, dissimilar from constitutional precedents, where the only alternative to overruling a judicial interpretation is the cumbersome procedure of constitutional amendment. Courts should therefore exercise greater restraint in overruling statutory as distinguished from constitutional precedents.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Additionally, when, as in the case before us, the allegedly erroneous statutory interpretation has been made by a court of appeals, Supreme Court review provides an additional remedy for an unsound construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">A federal court should be particularly circumspect in setting aside its construction of a statutory provision which is still under review by Congress. In the interim since our decision in <em>Natta, </em>numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made in Congress to amend section 24. For example, prior to the Patent Office\u2019s promulgation of Rule 287, bills were introduced in 1968<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> 1969<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and 1971<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> seeking to amend the final sentence of the first paragraph of section 24 so as to provide that \u201cthe provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and things shall apply to contested cases in the Patent Office <em>insofar as consistent with [Patent Office] regulations.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) Other legislation introduced during the same period, however, proposed no changes in section 24.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Bills introduced since the promulgation of Rule 287 have offered a number of resolutions of the dual system of discovery available in the Patent Office and in the district courts. S. 2930<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and H.R. 11868 <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u2014 like the bills introduced in 1968, 1969 and 1971 \u2014 provide that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure should apply to cases in the Patent Office only \u201cinsofar as consistent with Patent Office regulations estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lished under section 23 of this title.\u201d On the other hand, S. 1321<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and S. 2504,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> although limiting the district court\u2019s jurisdiction in Patent Office cases, would require the Patent Office to provide discovery procedures substantially the same as those available in the district courts under <em>Natta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">These various unsuccessful attempts to modify section 24 provide no clear signal that in <em>Natta </em>this Court erred in con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>staling the legislative intent underlying that provision. Further, since some of these proposals are still under consideration by Congress, we should be wary of infringing on the authority of the legislative branch by seeking to accomplish by judicial fiat what Congress has contemplated doing, but so far has declined to do, through amendatory legislation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The social benefits derived from adherence to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>and from the separation of the judicial and legislative powers mandate that a court cast aside its prior interpretation of statutory language only in extraordinary circumstances. In the present case, Judge Van Dusen\u2019s comprehensive discussion of the legislative history demonstrates that the <em>Natta </em>court\u2019s interpretation was certainly not unreasonable. In addition, the Natta opinion has not been undercut by subsequent decisions. Nor does <em>Natta </em>conflict with any previous, overriding, more fundamental policy of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The majority opinion in this case offers two justifications for overruling <em>Natta. </em>The first is the Patent Office\u2019s adoption of a rule providing limited discovery in the Patent Office. Nothing in section 24, however, makes the district court\u2019s jurisdiction dependent on the failure of the Patent Office to adopt discovery procedures. Moreover, the promulgation of a rule by an administrative agency subsequent to the enactment of section 24 could hardly alter the legislative intent embodied in the statute. Judicial estimation of the legislative purpose should not turn on the vagaries of an administrative agency in first rejecting, then accepting, and possibly again rejecting a procedural device. In addition, the statutory grant of authority under which the Patent Office adopted Rule 287 <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> predates this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Natta. </em>Recent recognition by the Patent Office of the practice of discovery, therefore, would not seem to justify a reversal of this Court\u2019s established reading of section 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The second justification advanced by the majority for redefining the congressional will underlying section 24 is what the majority regards as an undesirable burden on judicial administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>brought about by broader discovery. The majority asserts that allowing Patent Office litigants discovery in the district courts increases the caseload in those courts. Also, since any discovery order becomes an appealable decision,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the courts of appeals are confronted with a spate of questions which in ordinary federal litigation would be considered interlocutory and therefore not subject to appeal. Furthermore, the majority states that there is no centralized control over the discovery proceedings, since an independent action may be brought in each district in which discoverable evidence is located. Concededly the above consequences flow in some degree from section 24, as interpreted in <em>Natta. </em>But jurisdiction in the federal courts is controlled by Congress, not by the judiciary. Courts may not refuse to exercise jurisdiction granted by statute even though such exercise might place additional burdens on the courts, and even though the courts may not agree with the procedures thus sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Assuming, arguendo, that the inefficiencies generated by the <em>Natta </em>construction of section 24 exist and that they are as pernicious as they are portrayed by the majority, they may be remedied by Congress. The judiciary is not alone in possessing the insight to recognize impediments to efficient judicial administration. Also, the judicial branch is not as well equipped as the legislature to investigate the problem and to evaluate the potential resolutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The majority has apparently concluded that since some modicum of discovery is now available in the administrative agency, the federal judicial system would be operated most efficiently by removing, for all practical purposes, patent discovery proceedings from the district courts. But the majority\u2019s conclusion rests solely on its own theorization. The Court has no empirical evidence regarding the extent of the saving of judicial resources which could be achieved without discarding <em>Natta. </em>For instance, the courts may be able to reduce the volume of patent discovery litigation by clearly indicating that in the exercise of their discretion the district courts will refuse to grant discovery which is or will be available in the Patent Office unless the party seeking discovery can show substantial need for the discovery in the district court rather than in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Nor does the record contain any evidence whether, accepting the <em>Natta </em>construction, discovery litigation could be reduced by imposing costs or other sanctions on recalcitrant parties. In addition, litigants dissatisfied with the outcome of interference litigation in the Patent Office may initiate a trial de novo in the district court,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> where the full discovery provisions of the Federal Rules will, of course, be applicable. There is, however, no data available regarding the relative impact the majority\u2019s holding will have in reducing the judicial resources devoted to discovery in Patent Office cases as compared with the increase in district court time which will be expended on the de novo trial of interferences. Also, this Court does not possess the means to assess the extent to which this construction of the discovery available will alter the outcome of interference litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Thus, neither the adoption of discovery procedures by the Patent Office nor the prospect of relief from the burden placed on the courts by the necessity of deciding discovery issues in administrative interference proceedings would appear to vindicate a reconsideration of the interpretation of section 24 that until today had been accepted by every Court of Appeals that had addressed the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Even were the proposed justifications for reconsidering <em>Natta </em>more substantial, I would pause before repudiating that decision because of the effect the majority\u2019s ruling will have on the availability of discovery in proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Patent Office. The essence of the discovery provided by Rule 287(a) is that each party must provide his adversary with a copy of each document in his possession on which he intends to rely in presenting his case, and reasonable access to each \u201cthing\u201d on which he intends to rely, as well as a list of the witnesses he intends to call. Under 287(c) during the period for the preparation of testimony or thereafter a party may, upon a showing \u201cthat the interest of justice so requires,\u201d obtain additional discovery within the scope of the discovery rules of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if the materials sought are within the control of the adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">These Patent Office discovery procedures are in several notable respects more restricted than those available under the Federal Rules. First, the automatic discovery \u2014 discovery of right \u2014 applies only to that evidence on which the movant\u2019s adversary intends to rely. There is no discovery of materials which may bolster the movant\u2019s own case except at the discretion of the Board of Patent Interferences. In contrast, the Federal Rules make discovery of both supportive and detrimental evidence equally available.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Second, in order to obtain discretionary discovery a party must demonstrate that \u201cthe interest of justice requires\u201d that he have access to the material. On the other hand, the Federal Rules require only that the material sought be \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The standard that \u201cthe interest of justice so requires\u201d appears to be a <em>more demanding test </em>than the requirement of \u201cgood cause\u201d formerly contained in Rule 34,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and even stricter than the requisite showing of \u201csubstantial need\u201d for the disclosure of \u201cwork product.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">Third, the <em>scope of the materials </em>which Rule 287 authorizes the Board of Patent Interferences to order divulged may not be as broad as that available under section 24, as interpreted by <em>Natta. </em>It is doubtful whether Rule 287 provides for discovery relating to issues beyond the merits of the interference proceeding itself. In Duffy v. Barnes, for instance, the district court concluded that Rule 287 did not authorize discovery pertaining to existence of fraud in the filing of a patent application since a motion to have the application stricken pursuant to Patent Office Rule 56 <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> is not within the ambit of an interference proceeding. At least under the trial judge\u2019s view of the scope of Rule 287, therefore, the majority\u2019s holding today will foreclose a party from obtaining discovery regarding the existence of fraud in the filing of a patent application.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">Fourth, Rule 287 is more restrictive than the Federal Rules as to the <em>time </em>when discovery may be obtained. Rule 287(a) does not require the junior party to furnish the senior party with the specified discovery materials until after the close of the period set by the Board of Interferences for the consideration of motions. Then the senior party need not provide his materials to the junior party until the junior p\u00e1rty has completed taking his testimony-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">It is obvious, therefore, that the non-discretionary discovery under 287(a) will be of no use to the junior party in preparing his case-in-chief. Also, discovery may not be obtained under 287(c) until after the close of the motions period. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Under the majority\u2019s reading of section 24, therefore, which would confine the parties to discovery through the administrative proceeding, there is no device by which a litigant may obtain discovery of evidence which is expected to become unavailable before the commencement of discovery in the Patent Office under Rule 287. Nor may a party obtain discovery earlier than 287 allows even though such accelerated discovery would materially accelerate termination of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Fifth, Rule 287 provides only for discovery of information that is under the control of one of the parties. Thus the majority\u2019s reading of section 24 deprives litigants of the benefit of pretrial disclosure of relevant information that may be in the hands of <em>non-parties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Aside from the much narrower scope given discovery by the majority\u2019s ruling, another serious defect is apparent. In overruling <em>Natta, </em>the majority rejects the construction of section 24 which, as previously noted, has been accepted by every court of appeals that has considered the question. Therefore the extent of discovery available to Patent Office litigants will hereafter depend upon the fortuity of the location of the evidence sought to be discovered, since only within the Third Circuit will discovery be confined to the limited discovery available administratively. This lack of homogeneity among the courts of appeal may result in serious injustice where disclosure of one party\u2019s evidence is controlled by the law of this Circuit, while divulgence of that of the adversary party is governed by the decisions of another Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Therefore, on the basis of the considerations set forth above and the statutory interpretation explicated by Judge Van Dusen, I would adhere to the interpretation of section 24 propounded in <em>Natta. </em>There remains, therefore, only the application of that construction of the statute to the facts of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">I concur in Judge Van Dusen\u2019s discussion of the proper resolution of Frilette v. Kimberlin. In view of the majority\u2019s holding today, an extensive discussion of how I would resolve <em>Duffy </em>under this Court\u2019s previous decision in <em>Natta </em>would serve no useful purpose. Suffice it to say therefore, that I find no abuse of discretion<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> by the district court in allowing Duffy to proceed with discovery related to whether Barnes and Preziosi filed their patent application fraudulently.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">Circuit Judge VAN DUSEN concurs in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\">. 388 F.2d 215 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b312-13\">. 388 F.2d at 217.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b312-14\">.

It might be argued that the majority\u2019s action here in overturning its own interpretation of a federal statute is similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s conduct in Boys Markets v. Local 770, Retail Clerks Union, 398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970). However, there are two significant distinctions between the situation presently before this Court and that in <em>Boys Markets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">First, in <em>Boys Markets </em>Justice Brennan reasoned that the intervening decision in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, 390 U.S. 557, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968), had undermined the Court\u2019s previous construction of the interrelationship between the Norris-LaGuardia Act and section 301(a) of the Labor-Management Relations Act. <em>Avco </em>\u201chas produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of <em>Sinclair. </em>[370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962)] The principal practical effect of <em>Avco </em>and Sinclair taken together is nothing less than to oust state courts of jurisdiction in \u00a7 301(a) suits where injunctive relief is sought for breach of a no-strike obligation.\u201d 398 U.S. at 244-245, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1589. Such result, Justice Brennan found, was inconsistent both with the Court\u2019s conclusion in Dowd Box, 368 U.S. 502, 82 S.Ct. 519, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962) \u2014 that the purpose of section 301(a) was to supplement rather than to encroach upon the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts \u2014 and with the doctrine of the \u201cfederal policy of labor law uniformity\u201d 398 U.S. at 245-246, 90 S.Ct. 1583, expressed by the Court in Lucas Flour, 369 U.S. 95, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962). In contrast, our previous decision in <em>Natta </em>has been reaffirmed, rather than undercut, by our intervening decisions. <em>Compare </em>Mac-Pherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Second, the Supreme Court concluded that the earlier decision in <em>Sinclair </em>contravened one of the fundamental policies of federal labor law: \u201cThus, because <em>Sinclair, </em>in the aftermath of <em>Avco, </em>casts serious doubt upon the effective enforcement of a vital element of stable labor-management relations \u2014 arbitration agreements with their attendant no-strike obligations \u2014 we conclude that <em>Sinclair </em>does not make a viable contribution to federal labor policy.\" 398 U.S. at 249, 90 S.Ct. at 1591. Our decision in <em>Natta, </em>on the other hand, does not conflict with any such overriding policy of federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 23 (1954).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">.

In Montecatini Edison v. E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., <em>434 </em>F.2d 70, 72 (3d Cir. 1970), this Court ruled that on review of discovery orders under section 24, the district court\u2019s actions should be tested against the standard of abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. Three factors provide a basis for the district court\u2019s decision permitting discovery limited to the issue of fraud in the filing of the application. First, there is serious question whether the materials in question may be obtained through discovery in the Patent Office, because of the strictures imposed on such discovery by Rule 287. Second, the requested discovery, if available in the Patent Office at any time, could not have been obtained under Rule 287 at the time Judge Coolahan permitted such discovery in the district court, since the discovery period in the Patent Office had not commenced. Third, it was possible that such earlier discovery would have led to a measureable advance of the litigation and, conceivably, to its prompt termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Two other considerations indicate that in some circumstances the refusal of discovery by the district court might well be warranted first, the inconvenience occasioned by the possibility of discovery conducted simultaneously before two tribunals, and second, the potentially disruptive impact of such proceedings on the methods adopted by the Patent Office for disposition of controversies before it. However, the district court\u2019s conclusion that, in this case, the factors favoring a grant of discovery outweigh those suggesting the contrary result is not, in my judgment, so clearly improper as to constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
