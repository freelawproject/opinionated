(collectively, Greyhound) appeal from a conviction of criminal contempt, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(B),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for willfully violating certain provisions of an order entered by a three-judge district court. The principal issue on appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that the violations of the order were willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">The background of this case dates back to 1947. Greyhound, a common carrier operating throughout most of the United States, sought and obtained, between 1947 and 1956, approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for the acquisition of eight bus companies and their routes in the western United States. Mt. Hood Stages, Inc. (Mt. Hood), doing business as Pacific Trailways, is a common carrier authorized to operate in Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. At the acquisition hearings before the ICC, Mt. Hood opposed a number of the acquisitions, pointing out that its north-south route through central Oregon was being completely encircled by Greyhound. To overcome this opposition, Greyhound officers made certain representations to the ICC concerning Greyhound\u2019s policies and implementing practices with regard to Mt. Hood. Following the making of these representations Mt. Hood withdrew at least some of its objections to acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">In 1964 Mt. Hood petitioned the ICC to reopen the acquisition proceedings and sought a supplemental ICC order, under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(9), specifically enforcing the representations and assurances made to the ICC by Greyhound during the previous acquisition proceedings. The ICC hearing examiner found that Greyhound was violating a number of representations made during the earlier hearings; this finding was adopted by Division Three of the ICC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, the ICC found that Greyhound had made specific representations in the prior acquisition proceedings which amounted to assur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>anees of public benefit and interest and no harm to existing carriers or service. The failure of Greyhound to abide by its commitments, without sound reasons, Division Three observed, \u201cconstitute[d] destructive competition in contravention of the national transportation policy.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 463. The ICC, however, did not enter a specific order but, rather, gave Greyhound time voluntarily to conform its practices to its representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Greyhound did not voluntarily conform and in 1968 the full ICC entered an order directing Greyhound, <em>inter </em>alia, to cease and desist from \u201call practices of the character found in the prior reports of Division 3 [of the ICC] and the hearing examiner to be unreasonable and inconsistent with [Greyhound\u2019s] representations in the above-entitled proceedings ..\u201d The ICC denied Greyhound\u2019s subsequent petition for reconsideration, and Greyhound petitioned for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A three-judge district court denied Greyhound\u2019s motion to set aside the ICC order and granted the Government\u2019s counterclaim for enforcement of its order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court issued a ten-paragraph order, the portions of which are material to this appeal are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">In June 1971, the Government filed petitions charging Greyhound with criminal and civil contempt for failing to comply with the order of the three-judge district court. After a bench trial, Chief Judge Robson, in a careful and detailed opinion, found Greyhound in criminal contempt of five paragraphs of the order and in civil contempt of three paragraphs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court fined Greyhound Corporation $100,000 and Greyhound Lines, Inc. $500,000 for their criminal contempt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Greyhound has appealed from the criminal contempt convictions and the fines imposed under these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Greyhound concedes, there being no appeal of the civil contempt judgment, that it violated the 1970 order of the three-judge district court but argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the violations were willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Willfulness is, of course, an element of criminal contempt and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Brown, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 454 F.2d 999, 1006 (1971); United States ex rel. Porter v. Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co., 163 F.2d 168, 173-174 (7th Cir. 1947). In United States v. Seale, 461 F.2d 345, 368 (7th Cir. 1972), a criminal contempt case involving alleged disruption and obstruction within a trial, this court noted that \u201c[t]he minimum requisite intent [for criminal contempt] is better defined as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>volitional act done by one who knows or should reasonably be aware that his conduct is wrongful.\u201d A finding of criminal contempt cannot stand, moreover, if the court\u2019s order is vague or uncertain. International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass\u2019n, 389 U.S. 64, 76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967). Greyhound relies substantially on the claimed obnubilation of the three-judge court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Willfulness for criminal contempt may, as in other areas of criminal law, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in proof. <em>Kroger Grocery, supra. </em>In eases involving in-court obstruction or disruption, such as <em>Seale, </em>these facts and circumstances will typically involve simply the conduct and statements occurring during the trial. In a criminal contempt case involving a court order, such as the one before us, on the other hand, the court should consider the entire background behind the order \u2014 including the conduct that the order was meant to enjoin or secure, the interests that it was trying to protect, the manner in which it was trying to protect them, and any past violations and warnings \u2014 in determining whether the order is sufficiently specific and in determining whether the defendant knew or should have known that his conduct was wrongful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Terminal R.R. Ass\u2019n v. United States, 266 U.S. 17, 29, 45 S.Ct. 5, 69 L.Ed. 150 (1924); United States v. Christie Indus., Inc., 465 F.2d 1002, 1007 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Willfulness, for the purpose of criminal contempt, does not exist where there is a \u201c[g]ood faith pursuit of a plausible though mistaken alternative.\u201d In re Brown, <em>supra, </em>454 F.2d at 1007. To provide a defense to criminal contempt, the mistaken construction must be one which was adopted in good faith and which, given the background and purpose of the order, is plausible. The defendant may not avoid criminal contempt by \u201ctwisted interpretations\u201d or \u201ctortured constructions\u201d of the provisions of the order. United States v. Gamewell, 95 F.Supp. 9, 13 (D.Mass.1951). See also United States v. Christie Indus., Inc., <em>supra, </em>465 F.2d at 1007. As Chief Judge Robson noted, a defendant, if he has doubts as to his obligations under an order, may petition the court for a clarification or construction of that order. 363 F.Supp. at 534. See McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 192, 69 S.Ct. 497, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949). While a defendant is, of course, not required to seek such a clarification, a failure to do so when combined with actions based upon a twisted or implausible interpretation of the order will be strong evidence of a willful violation of the decree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v. Gladstone, 450 F.2d 913, 915 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Tijerina, 412 F.2d 661, 667 (10th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 990, 90 S.Ct. 478, 24 L.Ed.2d 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Similarly, while actions showing a good faith effort to comply with the order will tend to negate willfulness, <em>Kroger Grocery, supra, </em>delaying tactics, indifference to the order, or mere \u201cpaper compliance\u201d will support a finding of willfulness. In re Holland Furnace Co., 341 F.2d 548, 551 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 924, 85 S.Ct. 1559, 14 L.Ed.2d 683. The very issuance of the order puts the party on notice that his past acts have been wrongful. \u201cNo concept of basic fairness is violated by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>quiring a person in this position to be more than normally careful in his future conduct.\u201d United States v. Custer Channel Wing Corp., 247 F.Supp. 481, 496 (D.Md.1965), aff\u2019d, 376 F.2d 675 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 850, 88 S.Ct. 38, 19 L.Ed.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We turn now to the specific paragraphs of the order as to which Greyhound was found to be in criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">Paragraph 1 of the order requires: \u201cthat Greyhound show Mt. Hood schedules in Greyhound folders on an equal basis with other non-Greyhound lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The district court in finding that Greyhound had violated this provision interpreted the phrase \u201con an equal basis\u201d to mean that Mt. Hood should be treated at least as well as other non-Greyhound carriers. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to support Chief Judge Robson\u2019s finding that Greyhound\u2019s violation of this provision was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">We note first that Greyhound unreasonably delayed in complying with this paragraph of the order. Rather than taking special care to include Mt. Hood schedules in its folders, Greyhound, as was pointed out below, did not make many of the required changes until after the contempt petitions were filed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which was eighteen months after the court order was entered. We agree with Chief Judge Robson that \u201cGreyhound\u2019s failure to effect corrections for this length of time hardly evinces an attitude of good faith or cooperation.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Moreover, Greyhound\u2019s explanation of its failure to comply with this provision consists of strained and twisted interpretations of the order. Greyhound contends, first, that since the order did not specify the exact charts and folders in which Mt. Hood schedules were to be included, Greyhound could not know that it was not in compliance with the order. In addition, Greyhound argues that \u201con an equal basis\u201d should be interpreted as permitting Greyhound to make certain distinctions between non-Greyhound lines. Each omission of a Mt. Hood schedule can be justified, according to Greyhound, on the ground that Greyhound does make such distinctions between non-Greyhound lines and, in each instance referred to by Chief Judge Robson, Mt. Hood just happened to fall into the group of non-Greyhound lines which was not included in the particular folder or chart. No other single non-Greyhound carrier, according to Greyhound, had been given all of the \u201cbenefits\u201d to which Chief Judge Robson found Mt. Hood to be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">These interpretations of the order are patently unreasonable. The purpose of the order was to insure that Greyhound would not continue its predatory conduct and \u201cdestructive competition\u201d toward Mt. Hood (104 M.C.C. at 463) but would, rather, comply with the representations made by its officers at the acquisition hearings. These representations included broad statements that Greyhound \u201chas always carried [Mt. Hood\u2019s] schedules in its schedule folders.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 476. There were no conditions or qualifications placed on these representations or on the subsequent order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet Greyhound\u2019s reading of the order would, for all practical purposes, render this provision a nullity. For whenever an omission was pointed out, Greyhound could either note that the order did not refer to the particular chart or table in question or Greyhound could find some basis to distinguish Mt. Hood from the non-Greyhound lines which were includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ed in the chart or table. The combination of such twisted interpretations of the order and Greyhound\u2019s failure to seek a clarification or modification of the order is significant evidence that Greyhound knew or reasonably should have known that its conduct was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Finally, Chief Judge Robson\u2019s finding of willfulness is further supported by the fact that Greyhound had received numerous complaints from Mt. Hood about the schedules. We reject Greyhound\u2019s contention that the warnings from Mt. Hood can be dismissed as merely the complaints of an adversary. Mt. Hood initiated the ICC proceedings which led to the 1968 ICC order. It was, moreover, the direct beneficiary of both the ICC order and the three-judge district court order. The failure to show Mt. Hood schedules was specifically discussed at a meeting attended by officials of Greyhound, Mt. Hood, and the ICC in May 1970. Under these circumstances, Greyhound should have been particularly careful to investigate and remedy, where appropriate, the complaints of Mt. Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Greyhound attempts to avoid the finding of willfulness by arguing that it was lulled into a false sense of security by the ICC. Greyhound points out that at the May 1970 meeting of the ICC, Greyhound, and Mt. Hood, Bernard Gould, Director of the ICC\u2019s Bureau of Enforcement, told Greyhound, after Mt. Hood\u2019s various complaints had been discussed, that the ICC field staff would investigate Greyhound to determine whether any enforcement action was necessary. Greyhound contends that when it did not hear from the ICC, it assumed that it was in compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We note, however, that Gould testified that at the May 1970 meeting he indicated several respects in which he thought Greyhound was not in compliance. In particular, Gould testified: \u201cI think the entire tenor of the conference left no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that Greyhound had not fully complied. . I believe certain of the schedules failed to list properly the Mount Hood Stages connections, and I indicated that I thought that was a failure to comply.\u201d Moreover, although Gould did indicate that the ICC would investigate Greyhound, he clearly was, as Greyhound concedes, under no duty to inform Greyhound of the outcome of this investigation. The order itself was simple and straightforward; it concerned only one non-Greyhound carrier; Greyhound continually received complaints from Mt. Hood and on at least one occasion Gould indicated that he believed that Greyhound was not in compliance. Greyhound\u2019s position on this point would seem to border upon an argument that some sort of a duty rested upon the governmental agency which was conducting an investigation of claimed illegal activities to provide a running account to the charged party of violations developed during the course of the investigation. We reject such a contention. Given these factors and the strained interpretations which Greyhound now offers to excuse its noncompliance, the contention that it was somehow lulled into believing that it was in compliance wholly fails to persuade us.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Paragraph 8, containing two elements, requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">\u201cthat Greyhound revise its interline schedules in connection with Mt. Hood so as to eliminate the presently existing delay of approximately three hours for passengers seeking to travel between California and Spokane via Mt. Hood\u2019s route and to negotiate in good faith with Mt. Hood on the establishment of bus schedules most advantageous to the traveling public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We shall consider each part of this paragraph separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">1. <em>Three-Hour Delay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Mt. Hood holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity for a bus route between Klamath Falls and Biggs (The Dalles), Oregon, a north-south route passing through central Oregon. Greyhound\u2019s acquisitions between 1947 and 1956, combined with its existing routes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>enabled Greyhound to completely encircle Mt. Hood and to by-pass Mt. Hood\u2019s north-south route by using its own coastal route through Portland. Mt. Hood\u2019s only link to points north of Biggs and south of Klamath Falls, however, is Greyhound.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">From 1949 to 1964, Mt. Hood and Greyhound operated a joint through bus between San Francisco, California, and Spokane, Washington, using the Mt. Hood route through central Oregon. In such a service, the passengers remain on the same bus (in this case a Greyhound bus leased and operated by Mt. Hood) throughout the trip and the bus travels over the routes of both bus companies. Greyhound and Mt. Hood also operated interline service over this route continuously from prior to 1964 to the present. Interline service, unlike a through bus, involves an exchange of passengers from the bus of one company to that of the other company at the point where the route of one company ends and the route of the other company begins. See Gil-bertville Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 115, 121 n. 2, 83 S.Ct. 217, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In 1964 Greyhound canceled the through-bus agreement with Mt. Hood and permanently rerouted its San Francisco-Spokane bus along the wholly Greyhound route through Portland, lengthening the trip by 110 miles. Mt. Hood\u2019s central Oregon route was then completely dependent on Greyhound connecting buses at Klamath Falls and Biggs, Oregon. In its 1964 petition to the ICC, Mt. Hood complained that after Greyhound terminated the joint through bus with Mt. Hood, Greyhound \u201cchanged its schedules between San Francisco and Klamath Falls and between Biggs and Spokane so as to break connections with [Mt. Hood] and force a delay of nearly 3 hours for any passenger seeking to use the shorter route via [Mt. Hood].\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Chief Judge Robson held that Greyhound had violated Paragraph 3 by failing to eliminate a three-hour delay at Biggs (The Dalles) and that this violation was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Since Mt. Hood\u2019s Klamath Falls-Biggs route is met at both ends by Greyhound, Mt. Hood had no way of eliminating these delays itself. Rather, as Chief Judge Robson noted, \u201cthe condition that Paragraph 3 was designed to remedy, i. e., the elimination of the three-hour delay, was exclusively within Greyhound\u2019s control.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 540. The requirement, moreover, does not appear onerous: it involved correcting the delays in the connections with a single non-Greyhound line on a single route. In any case, Greyhound never petitioned for a modification of the provision. Yet here again Greyhound delayed for an unreasonable length of time \u2014 eighteen months after the entry of the injunction \u2014 before making the changes ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Furthermore, Greyhound once more offers wholly implausible interpretations of the order to excuse its noncompliance. Greyhound argues, as it did in the district court, that it reasonably believed it had complied with Paragraph 3 when it restored the joint through bus with Mt. Hood in April 1970. Paragraph 3, however, expressly refers to interline schedules, not the through bus.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A Greyhound official, although contending that he believed Greyhound to be in compliance with the order by restoring the through bus, admitted that there is a distinction between interline service and a through bus.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, as Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Judge Robson noted, Greyhound\u2019s reading of this part of Paragraph 3 would render it purposeless since Paragraph 2 already required the restoration of the joint through bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Focusing narrowly on the words \u201cpresently existing delay,\u201d Greyhound also asserts that the only delay existing when the court order was issued, in February 1970, was at Klamath Falls. Greyhound apparently argues that it could reasonably assume it was in compliance since Greyhound eliminated the Klamath Falls delay by shifting it to Biggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We agree with the Government that it is difficult to conceive of a more tortured reading of the injunction or of an interpretation further at odds with the purpose and history of the order. At the acquisition hearings, Greyhound represented that the acquisitions would \u201chave no material adverse affect (sic) upon other carriers,\u201d and that \u201ca short direct route will be made available for all passengers of applicant and all other bus companies . . . greatly reducing the possibilities of long, and oftimes over-night layovers.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 476. In 1964 Division Three of the ICC, finding delays of nearly three hours in Greyhound\u2019s connections at Klamath Falls and Biggs stated, \u201c[t]he only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the record is that the cancellation of the through bus and revision of time schedules were inspired by a desire to stifle competition.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 461.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In 1970 the three-judge district court similarly noted that the evidence had indicated and the ICC had found that Greyhound had \u201carranged its north and south connecting schedules so as to destroy the advantages of Mt. Hood\u2019s route (i. e., by creating long layovers at points on the Klamath Falls route . . .).\u201d 308 F.Supp.. at 1036. The very purpose of the injunction, as stated, was to eliminate Greyhound\u2019s discrimination and destructive practices toward Mt. Hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">When the order is viewed against its background and purpose, it is clear that Greyhound\u2019s interpretation of the order is implausible and that Greyhound should reasonably have known that it was not complying with Paragraph 3 by shifting the three-hour delay from Klamath Falls to Biggs.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">2. <em>Good Faith Negotiations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">The second requirement of Paragraph 3 was that Greyhound \u201cnegotiate in good faithi with Mt. Hood on the establishment of bus schedules most advantageous to the traveling public.\u201d The court below correctly observed that the duty to negotiate in good faith, while not including the duty to agree, does require an active participation in the deliberations, a sincere effort to overcome the obstacles or differences between the parties, and a duty to respond to a good faith proposal put forth by the other party. 363 F.Supp. at 541 \u2014 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">Chief Judge Robson, in finding that Greyhound had willfully failed to negotiate in good faith, noted that Mt. Hood officials met and corresponded several times with Greyhound officials; that at these meetings, Mt. Hood made specific proposals toward improving connections at Eugene, Oregon; that Greyhound took no action on these proposals, neither putting forth counterproposals nor implementing those suggested by Mt. Hood; that Greyhound did not take any actions with regard to the Eugene or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Burley connections for eighteen months, until after the contempt petitions were filed; that when Greyhound finally did make a change in the Eugene schedule, that change was basically that which Mt. Hood had suggested eighteen months earlier; that a Greyhound official admitted that it would have been no more difficult to implement this change in the Eugene schedule when it was first suggested by Mt. Hood in March 1970 than it was in November 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">There may be borderline cases where, although a court ultimately determines that a party has not negotiated in good faith, the party could reasonably have believed, prior to the court decision, that, because of the extent of its participation in the deliberations, it was negotiating in good faith. The situation before us, however, is far from being such a case. Greyhound did very little with respect to the negotiations other than attend the meetings: it did not respond to proposals, put forth counterproposals, or implement Mt. Hood\u2019s suggestions. We disagree with Greyhound\u2019s contention that, absent a \u201cvery positive effort\u201d on Mt. Hood\u2019s part to secure an agreement, Greyhound could reasonably believe it was negotiating in good faith. Mt. Hood did put forth a specific proposal with regard to the Eugene connection and, as Chief Judge Robson pointed out, since Greyhound completely ignored this proposal, \u201cit would appear to have been a useless act for Mt. Hood to have drawn up a detailed proposal with regard to the Burley connection.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 541. Negotiation is, by definition, a two-way street. Greyhound should reasonably have known that, while it had no obligation to agree, doing nothing other than attending meetings was far from being within the scope of good faith negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">C</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Paragraph 4 of the order requires: \u201cthat Greyhound voluntarily and accurately quote joint through routes in connection with Mt. Hood, without geographical limitations in a manner fully responsive to inquiries from the traveling public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Paragraph 5 requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201cthat Greyhound cease and desist from quoting Mt. Hood\u2019s service unfavorably or inaccurately in response to inquiries from the traveling public and from not quoting Mt. Hood service at all in response to specific requests from the traveling public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Greyhound contends initially that the criminal contempt convictions relating to these paragraphs cannot stand since, in determining whether a violation existed, Chief Judge Robson utilized a standard not specified in the order. Under the district court\u2019s standard, an agent\u2019s failure to quote Mt. Hood service was considered not in compliance if the routes in connection with Mt. Hood \u201cwould have been shorter, faster, cheaper, and/or more convenient than the best all-Greyhound routing.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">As Chief Judge Robson noted, a court order, although it will not be expanded beyond the meaning of its terms in determining whether a party is in contempt, is subject to reasonable interpretation in light of the background of the order and the purpose for which it was entered. 363 F.Supp. at 544. The mere fact that such an interpretation is necessary does not render the injunction so vague and ambiguous that a party cannot know what is expected of him. Here, Greyhound officials had asserted, at the acquisition hearings, that it was not Greyhound\u2019s policy \u201cto route passengers over a circuitous route over its line.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 490. Moreover, in 1968, the ICC found that it was an unreasonable practice for Greyhound to fail \u201cto require its agents to inform inquiring persons fully, accurately, and impartially of <em>shorter or faster or cheaper or equally desirable </em>joint through routes or fares . . ..\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 544. The standard adopted by Chief Judge Robson is not only a reasonable interpretation of the order, it is consistent with the history and purpose of the order. Furthermore, we note that the alternative standard suggested by Greyhound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>would \u201crender the order practically unenforceable.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Using this standard, Chief Judge Robson found literally hundreds of instances of unsatisfactory quotations. In particular, he noted that even after the filing of the contempt petitions in June 1971, ICC surveys showed a 51% rate of quoting errors. Greyhound argues that it is unfair to base a finding of willfulness on this, since no particular percentage of compliance was specified in the order. The 51% figure is significant, however, not only because of its size in absolute terms, but also because, as Chief Judge Robson pointed out, this was approximately the level of quoting violations found immediately after the court order was entered. Yet between these initial surveys and those in 1971, the ICC informed Greyhound that its agents were being monitored and that a high rate of error was being reported. Compliance, here again, was wholly within Greyhound\u2019s control. Under these circumstances, the fact that the error level remained about the same is strong evidence of willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">It appears to us that Greyhound is in effect arguing that a court order should contain a percentage proviso before the party ordered could be found in violation. Or putting the contention into application, the order should have stated \u201cif Greyhound fails to comply with this order half the time it will be deemed to have done so willfully.\u201d Noncompliance with court orders may be excused under some circumstances but we have not been shown that excusing circumstances existed here. Otherwise there should be compliance in full and certainly a failure to comply in approximately half of the instances checked is substantial evidence of a knowledgeable and willful failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Further evidence of willfulness is found in the wholly inadequate steps Greyhound took to achieve compliance on the part of its ticket agents. The inadequacy of Greyhound\u2019s compliance program is set out in detail in the district court opinion (363 F.Supp. at 554 \u2014 560) and will not be repeated here. As Chief Judge Robson pointed out, Greyhound, although not required by the order to take any specific steps to achieve compliance, was required to take all steps reasonably necessary to insure compliance with Paragraphs 4 and 5. We agree with Chief Judge Robson that the evidence indicates that Greyhound officials flagrantly disregarded the order and, at best, constructed a \u201cpaper compliance,\u201d which they should reasonably have known would be ineffective. The present case is, thus, in sharp contrast to <em>Kroger Grocery, supra, </em>where the prosecutor and district court failed \u201cto point out what more the defendant could have done to impress upon its employees its honest and good faith effort to comply with [the court order].\u201d 163 F.2d at 175. Rather, the lack of meaningful compliance efforts here is strikingly similar to the defendants\u2019 conduct in In re Holland Furnace Co., <em>supra, </em>where both a company and certain of its officers were held to be in criminal contempt for failing to obey a court order. Chief Judge Robson properly noted that \u201cthe record in this case shows that not only did the errors occur, but, when one considers the inadequate measures Greyhound took to achieve compliance, it was almost inevitable that errors would occur.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Greyhound argues, however, that it reasonably interpreted Paragraph 4 as requiring only quotations of the Greyhound-Mt. Hood joint through bus and not the interline service. To support this contention, Greyhound notes that the district court, in discussing Paragraph 3, stated that there was a difference between a joint through bus and interline service. The critical factor is, however, that Paragraph 4 refers to \u201cjoint through <em>routes </em>in connection with Mt. Hood,\u201d and not to the joint through <em>bus. </em>Both joint through buses and interline service can be \u201cjoint through routes.\u201d \u201c[T]he test of the existence of a \u2018through route\u2019 is whether the participating carriers hold themselves out as offering through transportation service.\u201d Thompson v. United States, 343 U.S. 549, 557, 72 S.Ct. 978, 983, 96 L.Ed. 1134 (1952). We agree with Chief Judge Rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>son that, given the arrangements between Greyhound and Mt. Hood, Greyhound\u2019s contention that only the joint through bus is a joint through route is patently wrong. Moreover, Greyhound should reasonably have known that its interpretation was erroneous. The hearing examiner, in discussing Greyhound\u2019s failure to quote joint through routes, gave, as examples of this failure, instances in which Greyhound agents did not quote Greyhound-Mt. Hood interline service. Finally, we note that the plural form \u201croutes\u201d is used in Paragraph 4 and Greyhound concedes that there was only one joint through bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Finally, Greyhound argues that the district court erred in basing its finding of criminal contempt of Paragraph 5 on the finding that Greyhound had willfully violated Paragraph 4. This contention is frivolous. As Chief Judge Robson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cThe court has already found that Greyhound did not conform with Paragraph 4 in that Greyhound did not voluntarily and <em>accurately </em>quote Mt. Hood\u2019s joint through routes. Having made that finding it necessarily follows that Greyhound was quoting Mt. Hood\u2019s routes unfavorably and <em>in accurately. </em>For Paragraph 5 is, in part, a corollary of Paragraph 4. If there was a willful failure to comply with Paragraph 4, there necessarily was a willful failure to comply with Paragraph 5.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 553-554. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Paragraph 6 of the order requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Y\">\u201cthat Greyhound show Mt. Hood\u2019s connecting routes on its maps on an equal basis with other non-Greyhound carriers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The district court found that Greyhound violated this paragraph by failing to show Mt. Hood services on an equal basis with other non-Greyhound lines. As in Paragraph 1, the district court interpreted \u201cequal basis\u201d to mean that Mt. Hood should be treated \u201cat least as well as any other non-Greyhound carrier.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The evidence is more than sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding of willfulness. Here again the record indicates that Greyhound delayed in making the required changes: three maps that failed to depict Mt. Hood service on an equal basis were not corrected until November 1971, twenty months after the injunction was entered. During this period, moreover, Mt. Hood complained to Greyhound about the maps. Yet, as Chief Judge Robson noted, \u201c[n]ot once during that period of delay did Greyhound ever complain to the ICC or the court that compliance would be a hardship, nor did it ever ask the court for a clarification or modification of the order, as it had a right to do, to determine whether the showing of Mt. Hood\u2019s routes on its wall maps was within the requirements of the order.\u201d 363 F.Supp. at 564. Under the circumstances, Greyhound knew or reasonably should have known that its conduct- was wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">In an attempt to excuse this noncompliance, Greyhound offers the same excuse that it did in connection with Paragraph 1, that is, that Greyhound reasonably believed that it could make distinctions among non-Greyhound lines and Mt. Hood just happened to fall into the group of non-Greyhound lines not shown on the map in each instance cited by the district court. This contention has no more merit with respect to Paragraph 6 than it did with respect to Paragraph 1. Greyhound represented at the acquisition hearings that it cooperated in every way to acquaint the public with Mt. Hood\u2019s services and, thereby, promoted additional traffic and business for that line. 104 M.C.C. at 452, 454. In its 1964 petition to the ICC, however, Mt. Hood complained that Greyhound had \u201cdiscontinued showing [Mt. Hood\u2019s] connecting routes upon its maps, while continuing to display those of numerous other non-Greyhound carriers.\u201d 104 M.C.C. at 468. The hearing examiner found that Mt. Hood\u2019s charge was supported by the evidence and the examiner\u2019s finding was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>adopted by Division Three and subsequently affirmed by the full ICC and the three-judge district court. Neither Greyhound\u2019s representations nor the court order was qualified in any way. Here, as in Paragraph 1, Greyhound\u2019s strained interpretation of the order would permit Greyhound, for all practical purposes, to avoid compliance. And, as with Paragraph 1, Greyhound sought no clarification or modification of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Generally, as applicable to most if not all of the paragraphs found to have been violated, we also note the following matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In the early years of this long drawn-out controversy there were internal Greyhound documents suggesting the routing of passengers over Greyhound\u2019s own longer route rather than over Mt. Hood\u2019s route. This intention to route passengers over the longer Greyhound route was not to be put into bulletins to the field men but was to be discussed confidentially with field men. It is not surprising that subsequent to the orders of the ICC and the three-judge court that even this type of internal document was not proved to exist. Very seldom does one who is willfully violating a court order, any more than does one in violating a criminal statute, proclaim by words what is being done. But the willful violation may be proved by action or inaction as graphically as though it had been proclaimed in descriptive words. As in criminal cases, criminal contempt proceedings permit the application of the \u201cwell established rule that intent, knowledge or willfulness, where an essential element of an offense, may be inferred from the facts and circumstances in proof and form a proper basis for a finding . . . \u201d <em>Kroger Grocery, supra, </em>163 F.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Greyhound lays particular emphasis on the preliminary paragraph of the three-judge court order and, in so doing, focuses on the word \u201cpractices,\u201d asserting that there was no proof that it was practicing in July 30, 1952, procedures which are now being held to be mandatory for it. This approach, however, ignores the qualifying words \u201cin existence or in contemplation\u201d as of the 1952 date which in turn brings into play the broad-sweeping representations made by Greyhound to achieve its acquisition purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Greyhound also makes much of the fact that in some respects it had complied with the three-judge court order. The district court took cognizance of \u201cGreyhound\u2019s eleventh hour remedial action.\u201d We have not attempted to evaluate in terms of comparative onerousness those parts of the order with which Greyhound chose to comply. It is sufficient to state that what we are concerned with here is the portions of the order as to which there was willful noncompliance. Nor are we much impressed by gunpoint compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">While Greyhound in March 1970 announced a program for compliance with the order of the three-judge district court, it is significant that it did not provide for sending copies of the injunction to its agents, or even for advising them of the existence of the court\u2019s order. See <em>Kroger Grocery, supra, </em>163 F.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Greyhound argues that the order is too vague for it to know exactly what to do by way of compliance. The language of the order, particularly when read in the contextual background, refutes this contention. No appeal was taken from the order and as we have noted no effort was ever made to secure a clarification. It is not even now contended that there is an impossibility of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Greyhound also cites the increase of Mt. Hood traffic subsequent to the entry of the court\u2019s order. This, of course, does not mean that the potential of traffic which would have followed full compliance was reached. It does, however, tend to reflect that the traveling public does have a pocketbook interest in the least expensive routing between two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">In sum, the record of this case shows a flagrant disregard of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>order. The purpose of the order was to insure that Greyhound would comply with representations it made at the acquisition hearings and cease its predatory practices toward Mt. Hood. The language of the order was straightforward; the order pertained to a single non-Greyhound line which operated in only a few states in the country. The court injunction, moreover, ordered Greyhound to do essentially the same things which the ICC had ordered the company to do. in 1968. Yet Greyhound repeatedly delayed in complying with the provisions of the order until after the contempt petitions were filed, despite continuing complaints from Mt. Hood. What compliance did occur was often mere \u201cpaper compliance.\u201d In the district court and in this court, Greyhound has sought to excuse its non-compliance with what can only be termed twisted and strained interpretations of the order. There is no doubt that Greyhound knew or should have known that its conduct violated the letter and spirit of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Finally, Greyhound argues that the district judge erred in imposing fines aggregating $600,000 on Greyhound as a sanction for criminal contempt. In United States v. United Mine Workers, 380 U.S. 258, 303, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947), the Supreme Court set forth the factors to be considered by trial courts in imposing fines for criminal contempt and noted that \u201c[b]ecause of the nature of these standards, great reliance must be placed upon the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d See also Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 188, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958); Jewel Tea Co. v. Kraus, 204 F.2d 549, 551 (7th Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In the present case, Chief Judge Robson carefully followed the standards delineated in <em>United Mine Workers. </em>We find no abuse of discretion in the amount of the fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We have considered the other contentions raised by Greyhound in this appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-13\">\u201cA court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a2e-dedup-0\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-18\">(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-19\">.
