As the result of a medical finding that she was psychologically \u201cnot fit at present for teaching duty,\u201d appellant was placed on involuntary leave of absence without pay by the Board of Education from September 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1970, to June 30, 1971. On September 25, 1971, she was directed to resubmit to a mental examination and was again placed on involuntary medical leave without pay until June 30, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules, she filed a petition for review of these determinations in the New York Supreme Court, seeking: (a) to annul the original determination of unfitness; (b) to direct that her leave of absence not be counted against her accumulated sick leave; and (c) to require the Board to furnish her copies of all medical reports relied upon in its determinations. The state court denied her this relief, but concluded that the second determination of unfitness for school years 1971 \u2014 72 was not based on the requisite medical findings and remanded the case to the Board for the formulation of an adequate record. The court ordered the Board to conduct another examination of appellant and to reconsider its determination in light of this re-examination and any medical reports of independent physicians submitted by appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Following denial of leave to appeal by the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals, Ms. Newman brought this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that the Board had violated her right to procedural due process by not providing her an adversary proceeding. On February 15, 1974, the District Court granted the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the earlier state court decision was res <em>judicata </em>of the matter. At that time, the District Court did not have the benefit of the decision of this Circuit in Lombard v. Board of Education, 502 F.2d 631 (2d Cir. 1974), which was announced on July 22, 1974. We believe that <em>Lombard </em>controls both the <em>res judicata </em>and due process questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">It is clear from the record that appellant never raised her federal constitutional claims in the state court. There is no mention of any claim of procedural due process in the New York Supreme Court\u2019s opinion; indeed, it specifically went off on other considerations. The United States District Court, however, concluded that appellant \u201cdid raise the issue of due process violations\u201d in her state court petition, citing paragraph 34 of the complaint. That paragraph follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">34. Petitioner\u2019s forced medical leave of absence has been accomplished in violation of petitioner\u2019s due process and equal protection rights, and in disregard of her tenure rights which entitled her to a due process hearing on charges as a prerequisite to suspension. Education Law, [McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 16,] Section 2573(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">No allegation, elaborations, or citations' of authority accompany this, the sole mention of the phrase \u201cdue process\u201d in appellant\u2019s entire twelve-page petition. We conclude therefore that her due process claim was neither raised nor adjudi-, cated in the New York Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Under the authority of <em>Lombard, </em>we are obliged to reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\">. Appellant has since refused to undergo any further mental examinations by the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
