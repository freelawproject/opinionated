The invitation for bids issued by the Sanitary District fully incorporated the provisions of the Chicago Plan, a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor which requires, as a prerequisite to eligibility for a contract award in certain federally involved construction projects in the Chicago, Illinois SMSA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> completion and submission prior to bid opening of an \u201cAppendix A\u201d or its equivalent, indicating goals for minority manpower utilization in designated trades on all the bidder\u2019s work during the term of performance of the contract, within ranges prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\">Bids were opened on June 7, 1974 and the apparent low bidder was appellee Rossetti Construction Company, with a bid of $1,988,908.00. The Sanitary District granted Rossetti tentative award of the contract pending approval of the bid\u2019s compliance with federal contract regulations, including those imposed by the Chicago Plan, and submitted the bid to the EPA Contract Compliance Office for consideration. On June 28, 1974, the director of the Office for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs of EPA notified the Sanitary District that, due to failure to comply with the Chicago Plan\u2019s requirements, Rossetti\u2019s bid was considered to be unresponsive. Specifically, he found that by placing brackets around all of the trades designated on Appendix A, Rossetti had failed to indicate which specific trades it intended to utilize on the project; and, by placing the figure of 10% opposite the bracketed trades, it had failed to designate acceptable manpower goals within the prescribed ranges required by the Plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-11\">Rossetti protested the rejection and sought an opportunity to appear before that agency and present evidence concerning its bid. On July 2, 1974, a meeting between Rossetti and EPA compliance officials was held during which Rossetti tendered an amended Appendix A, correcting the defects in its prior submission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of this amendment, a written statement was provided setting forth the circumstances explaining the original Appendix A<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>documentation tending to establish a past history of active participation in minority employment programs and actual compliance with the appropriate minority hiring goals for operating engineers set forth in Appendix A for the year 1974.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">The matter was taken under consideration by the EPA and, on July 10, 1974, after consultation with Department of Labor officials, possessing primary authority for interpretation of the Plan, Rossetti was informed that the Chicago Plan provided no authority or discretion to permit amendment of a nonresponsive Appendix A subsequent to bid opening. Accordingly, Rossetti\u2019s bid was found to be unresponsive and the Sanitary District prepared to award the contract to the project\u2019s second low bidder, intervening defendant appellant Loitz Brothers Construction Company.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">On July 11, 1974, Rossetti filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The parties agreed to maintain the <em>status quo </em>pending judicial resolution. After a full hearing, the district court concluded as a matter of law that the error in Rossetti\u2019s Appendix A was a good faith inadvertent misstatement which, since Rossetti was in fact in current compliance with the Chicago Plan\u2019s utilization goals and since the error did not affect price, quality or quantity of goods or services provided, was minor and could be corrected or waived without violence to the Chicago Plan\u2019s purpose or intent. The court rejected the Department of Labor\u2019s position that no federal agency had the power to permit such post-bid-opening amendment of Appendix A as being without basis in law and deemed the position clearly contradicted by repeated exercise of discretion in the past. Accordingly, the court issued a decree compelling the Department of Labor to accept Rossetti\u2019s amendment and to find its bid responsive, and enjoining the Sanitary District from granting the contract award to any party other than Rossetti. All defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">Rossetti seeks judicial review of the Department of Labor\u2019s determination that the Chicago Plan precludes post-bid-opening amendment of its unresponsive Appendix A. While the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.' \u00a7 702, provides a basis for such consideration, Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shafer, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 424 F.2d 859, 872 (1970), the applicable standards of review are narrowly circumscribed. It is well established that great deference is due to the interpretation given an administrative regulation by the federal agency entrusted with its promulgation and interpretation. Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); Contractors Ass\u2019n of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159, 175 (3rd Cir. 1971), cert denied, 404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L.Ed.2d 95. Moreover, when the administrative determination at issue concerns procurement of bid disputes, \u201c[i]f the court finds a reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s [decision], the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original proposition, have reached a different conclusion as to the proper administration and ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>plication of the procurement regulations.\u201d Steinthal v. Seamans, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 455 F.2d 1289, 1301 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-4\">For purposes of decision, we assume the correctness of the district court\u2019s findings of fact concerning the circumstances underlying the preparation of the defective Appendix A,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the good faith of Rossetti\u2019s officers in the matter,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and its actual compliance with the Chicago Plan\u2019s minority employment utilization goals at the date of the submission of its bid. Our review of the applicable authority and of the record persuades us, however, that even assuming the facts found, the judgment appealed from is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">The district court concluded that the Plan must be interpreted so as to permit the Department of Labor to exercise discretion sufficient to approve the filing, after the opening of a bid, of an amended Appendix A, committing the bidder to minority employment goals within the prescribed range for the trade actually involved, where (1) the inadequate commitment originally submitted was an inadvertent error made in good faith and (2) the bidder\u2019s current hiring of minority employees is in fact within the prescribed range. The court considered that in the light of the purpose of the Plan, to promote minority hiring in skilled construction trades, no useful purpose would be served by disqualifying a contractor for inadvertent error, when it has proved that its minority hiring practices comply with the goals of the Plan. The court relied on the proposition that a regulation should be interpreted in such a manner as to promote its purpose. The court deemed the error minor under the circumstances, and relied on both state and federal doctrines <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> permitting the waiver of minor irregularities and correction of bid defects which do not go to the price, quantity or quality of the goods or services to be performed. The court also relied on several instances in which the Department had previously permitted submissions of an appropriate Appendix A after opening of bids. Evidently, the proofs with respect to Rossetti\u2019s good faith and hiring practices satisfied the court that it was an abuse of discretion to refuse permission to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">There is, of course, some appeal to the thought that an employer who has demonstrated achievement of the 1974 goal of hiring members of minorities is already serving the purpose of the Plan and that there may be as much or more probability that he will reach the 1975 goal as an employer who merely makes the commitments. The Plan, however, is focussed on the making of the commitment, with its extent increasing year by year, and there is nothing unreasonable in insisting on the- commitment as the condition of eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-12\">The Chicago Plan was promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement Executive Order 11246, requiring furnishing of equal employment opportunity by fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>eral contractors. It was imposed on December 19, 1973 after two prior attempts to develop \u201cvoluntary home town plans\u201d had been deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60 \u2014 11.3. To remedy the perceived ineffectiveness of the voluntary plans, the Secretary implemented an imposed plan which sought to obtain an enforceable commitment from contractors in federally sponsored or assisted projects in the Chicago area to utilize in all their work an acceptable percentage of minority workmen in selected skilled and semi-skilled construction trades during the period of their employment on the project. The lynchpin of this scheme is the ability of the government to <em>enforce </em>good faith compliance with the Plan\u2019s objectives. To achieve this enforceability, a contractual obligation, is obtained from the contractor by requiring, as a condition precedent to the awarding of the contract, the submission, prior to bid opening, of a properly completed Appendix A.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">The Plan (Appendix A) not only prohibits award of the contract \u201cunless the bidder completes and submits, prior to bid opening,\u201d Appendix A, but also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">\u201cA bidder who fails or refuses to complete or submit such goals shall not be deemed a responsive bidder and may not be awarded the contract or subcontract. ... In no case shall there be any negotiations over the provisions of specific goals submitted by the bidder after the opening of bids and prior to the award of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">We think the specific provision above quoted is ample to exclude the defect in Rossetti\u2019s original Appendix A from the category of minor errors and defects which may be waived or corrected even though the defect does not go to the price, quantity or quality of the services. Similar provisions concerning affirmative action commitments are contained in local plans enacted in Philadelphia, Washington, D. C. and other municipal areas.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These plans have been consistently interpreted by the Comptroller General, -the Department of Labor, and the courts as precluding post-bid-opening amendment of incomplete or unresponsive affirmative action commitments under the conditions of this case. See, e. <em>g., </em>Northeast Construction Co. v. Romney, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 381, 485 F.2d 752, 756-57 (1973);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 52 Comp.Gen. 874 (1973); Comp.Gen. Decision B-176171 (Aug. 29, 1972); Comp.Gen. Decision B-178839 (Oct. 10, 1973); Comp.Gen. Decision B-180324 (Jan. 16, 1974).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-14\">Accordingly, we find ample support for the Secretary of Labor\u2019s decision challenged here. As was stated by Judge Leventhal, in dealing with a substantially similar problem under an analogous Washington, D. C. Plan: \u201cWhat the Washington Plan, and Appendix A, called for was a statement of specific goals for a future period, not as of the time of the bid, and a commitment for a minority utilization. The specific com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>mand of the Appendix A regulation clearly states and reiterates a bid lacking the pertinent information concerning projected employers [sic] and specific goals will be deemed nonresponsive. Whether or not other bidders would be prejudiced by subsequential insertion, the Government\u2019s broad policy objective may be prejudiced by the omission.\u201d Northeast Construction Co. v. Romney, <em>supra, </em>485 F.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">Moreover, we take note that a contrary position, such as that adopted by the district court, tends to impair the operation of the sealed competitive bidding system. Where a bidder is permitted to correct a deficiency in Appendix A after bid opening, \u201c[t]he effect . would be to permit a bidder who repented his bid- \u2014 perhaps on seeing that his bid was too far below the next bidder to be economically sound \u2014 to step away from the matter by simply failing to supply the omission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>485 F.2d at p. 757.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the district court\u2019s position would impose a requirement of a factual hearing, with the attendant possibilities of judicial and appellate review, prior to the awarding of a contract and the commencement of work, in order to assess the good faith or inadvertence of the error and to determine whether the contractor in question was in fact in actual compliance with the utilization goals. The delay and protracted litigation engendered in this case stands as persuasive evidence of the injury which can result, both to the contractors who may well be bound to their original estimates during the pendency of the dispute, and to the general public.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">Considering the above-stated propositions dispositive, we need not devote extensive analysis to the question of whether general federal procurement regulations or the applicable Illinois law, which both permit waiver or amendment of minor or inconsequential errors after the opening of bids, require the Department of Labor to permit Rossetti to amend its Appendix A. We have concluded that, while admittedly Appendix A does not go to matters of price or quality of work, it has been made a matter of bid responsiveness.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Clearly, under either federal or state law, unresponsive bids may not be corrected, after opening, in order to make them responsive. See 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 l-2.406-3(a); City of Chicago v. Mohr, 216 Ill. 320, 328-29, 74 N.E. 1056 (1905).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">Accordingly it appears that the Plan makes the submission of an appropriate Appendix A a matter of responsiveness; nothing in the Plan provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>for administrative discretion to permit post-bid-opening amendment; and the position taken by the Department of Labor in this case is within the permissible scope of interpretation of the Plan. The record discloses, however, several instances where the Department has assumed its power to permit a bidder to furnish an appropriate Appendix A after the opening of bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">The question arises whether these instances establish administrative interpretation of the Plan, supporting the existence of discretion in the Department to permit post-bid-opening amendment of an Appendix A so as to bring the bid into compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">It has been suggested in argument that the agencies\u2019 exercise of discretion on these prior occasions was not authorized by law and, therefore, provides no authority for the district court\u2019s conclusions. We do not reach the question of validity of those actions, since the facts and circumstances of the prior cases fall well outside the ambit of those presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">The record discloses that, in each of; the five instances in which the federal appellants have permitted a post-bid-opening submission or correction of Appendix A, the bidding \u2022 documents presented to the prospective bidder by the contracting entity did not contain the Chicago Plan or Appendix A. These instances occurred soon enough after the present Plan was promulgated so that the documents appear not to have been available to the agencies inviting bids. The Department of Labor and the EPA considered that, under these particular circumstances, prospective bidders had no opportunity to submit an Appendix A in conjunction with their bids and concluded that it would be unfair to evaluate a submitted bid on the basis of factors which, through no fault of the contractor, were not included in the bid invitation. Accordingly, if all other elements of the bids in question were found to be responsive, the agencies permitted submission of a correctly completed Appendix A after the opening of bids.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">The facts presented in this case are certainly of a different color. It is undisputed that the bidding documents advertised by Hinsdale Sanitary District incorporated fully both the text of the Chicago Plan and Appendix A and, in several instances, informed the prospective bidder of the importance of properly complying with the Plan. Rossetti representatives attended a pre-bid conference where prospective bidders were again reminded of the mandatory nature of Appendix A submissions. Under these facts, we conclude that, regardless of the propriety of the five prior exercises of discretion, there was no showing made of any practice or intention, by either the Department of Labor or the EPA, of permitting amendment of Appendix A after the opening of the bid when the Chicago Plan requirements were properly included within the bid package. At best for Rossetti the five instances introduced into the Plan a flexibility during an initial period where circumstances rendered insistence on full compliance more palpably unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-10\">Accordingly, the federal defendants\u2019 present interpretation of the Plan and their application of it to the instant case are neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause remanded with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>structions to dismiss the action. Because of the exigencies of time, indicated by the parties, our judgment to that effect was entered December 30, 1974, noting that the opinion would be later filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1134-23\">. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-11.1 et seq. issued pursuant to Exec.

Rossetti, in its initial Appendix A submitted prior to the opening of bids, indicated a minority utilization goal for all fifteen designated trades for the contract performance period of 1974 and 1975 of 10%. While 10% would fall within the mandatory range for minority manpower utilization prescribed in Appendix A by the Secretary of Labor for most of the trades, it was insufficient for 1974 as to Plasterers, 18.8-20.2%; and Operating Engineers, 10.2- 13.9%, and for 1975 as to Plasterers, 20.2- 21.6%; Roofers, 12.0-14.0%; Operating Engineers, 13.9-17.6%; and Bricklayers, 10.6-12.5%. See 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-11.23(a) (Appendix A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1135-15\">. Rossetti\u2019s amended Appendix A indicated that, of the fifteen designated trades, it only intended to utilize operating engineers and stated a minority manpower utilization goal of 12% for 1974; 15% for 1975; 18% for 1976; 22% for 1977; and 25% for 1978 \u2014 all substantially within the acceptable minimum ranges set forth by the Secretary of Labor in Appendix A. See 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 60-11.23(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1135-16\">. Rossetti asserted that its error in completing Appendix A was clerical in nature and was made in good faith. The Hinsdale waste treatment project at issue here was originally bid as a comprehensive project. Rossetti, as a member of a joint venture, submitted a bid on this project. The venture\u2019s bid forms were completed by its major participant, Ad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>vanee Construction, and its Appendix A stated a minority manpower utilization goal for 1974 and 1975 of 10%. While the bid was low, it was rejected as being over budget and, thus, the propriety of the 10% figures was never called into question. When the project was rebid in separate phases, Rossetti, allegedly unaware of the noncompliance of the figures utilized in the joint venture bid, erroneously carried over the earlier error of Advance. The district court accepted this explanation in its findings of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">. In its findings of fact the district court concluded that \u201c[i]n actuality, of the total man-hours worked by operating engineers from January 1 to June 30, 1974 by Rossetti employees, 10.55% were worked by minority operating engineers. Thus Rossetti was in actual compliance with the goals for 1974. Also, proof has shown that Rossetti\u2019s minority utilization has increased from that time to the date of trial and that at this time Rossetti is approaching the standard set for 1975.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">.

The testimony indicates that the Rossetti employee who prepared the original Appendix A was aware of the disparity which existed between the Plan\u2019s requirements and the actual figures submitted.

As was indicated in <em>Northeast Construction, </em>a legal question is presented under such circumstances as to the degree of enforceability of any commitment which is tendered in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of the document.

Of course, it may be argued that this problem could be obviated by requiring the federal government to waive any errors contained in a flawed Appendix A when the contractor could be shown to be in present compliance with utilization goals. Waiver of such a crucial and important concern as obtaining an enforceable commitment to observe federal standards of minority hiring during the term of participation on a federally involved contract, however, is clearly not envisioned under the language of the Plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">. The Chicago Plan has recognized this competing concern of delay, and has resolved the difficulty by seeking only the <em>commitment </em>of utilization prior to contract award. During performance, compliance investigation proceeds with sanctions available for failure to honor the commitment. Thus, compliance is not ignored under the Plan, as Rossetti argues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">. It is well established that the procurement process, once exclusively concerned with price and quality of goods and services, has been increasingly utilized to achieve social and economic objectives only indirectly related to conventional procurement considerations. The attenuated relationship to price, quantity or quality, however, does not necessarily limit the power of Congress or the President to condition award of a contract on full and proper compliance. See, e. <em>g., </em>Northeast Construction Co. v. Romney, <em>supra, </em>485 F.2d at 760-61; Contractors Ass\u2019n of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, <em>supra, </em>442 F.2d at 170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1139-12\">. We thus need not decide the question presented by Loitz Brothers as to whether the general procurement regulations relied on by Rossetti and the district court, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>are applicable in projects where federal participation is limited to the role of partial funding. See, Shaw-Henderson, Inc. v. Schneider, 335 F.Supp. 1203, 1215 (W.D.Mich.1971), aff\u2019d, 453 F.2d 748 (6th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">. In the instance of the Joliet contract awarded to Advance Construction Company, permission was granted to <em>amend </em>a faulty Appendix A after bid opening. While testimony at trial appears to indicate that the decision was reached on the assumption that the bidding materials contained the Chicago Plan and Appendix A, it is clear from the record that, as with the other four projects, the bidding materials did not contain any reference to the Plan and the initial faulty submission was provided on the initiative of Advance. Accordingly, all of the instances of prior conduct are factually distinguishable from the instant controversy and we have no occasion to reach their validity or authority. Even if the decision of an employee of the department in the Joliet-Advance instance were not explained on the basis that the Appendix A was not made available to the bidder, such single decision of an employee would not establish an administrative construction, binding on the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
