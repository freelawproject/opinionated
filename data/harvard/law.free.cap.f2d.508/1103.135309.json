Plaintiff longshoreman, Herbert Miller, sued defendant, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company (Royal Netherlands), owner of the motorship ADONIS for injuries to Miller allegedly caused by Royal Netherlands\u2019 negligence and/or unseaworthiness of the ADONIS. Plaintiff also sued Royal Netherlands\u2019 insurer, West of England Ship Owners Mutual Protection &amp; Indemnity Association, pursuant to the Louisiana Direct Action Statute. Royal Netherlands in turn filed a third-party complaint against stevedore Strachan Shipping Company (Stra-chan), Miller\u2019s employer and against Strachan\u2019s insurer, American Mutual Liability Insurance Company, thus completing the now classic longshoreman-shipowner-stevedore triangle. <em>See, </em>Seas Shipping Co., Inc. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946); and Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">Miller sued Royal Netherlands for injuries he sustained aboard the ADONIS on January 10, 1972 while she was docked starboard side to the Washington Avenue Wharf in New Orleans. ' Miller\u2019s gang was loading and stowing pipes in the port and starboard wings of the vessel\u2019s No. 2 \u2019tween deck. The 1,850-pound pipes were stowed in tiers and these tiers were stacked to a height of approx-, imately 6 to 8 feet. Following the completion of loading of the pipe, Miller was waiting in the center of the hatch to help off-load a forklift machine which had been used to stow the pipe when 39 pieces of pipe with a combined weight of 72,000 pounds suddenly came out of the offshore wing stow and fell into the square of the hatch, crushing off one of Miller\u2019s arms and inflicting other serious injuries upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">The pivotal issue in the trial of this litigation became whether an inshore list of the ship caused the pipe to fall, or whether the falling pipe caused the ship to list. Miller claimed that the ship was negligently made unstable and unsea-worthy by improper loading and distribution of potable water in the No. 4 tank and by improper distribution of cargo, an activity conducted by the ship\u2019s crew without the participation or assistance of the stevedore. Miller also claimed that the manner in which the pipe was stowed rendered the ADONIS unseaworthy and negligently unstable because the stow was not properly tiered, chocked, dunnaged and lashed. Royal Netherlands answered first that it was neither negligent nor was the ship unseaworthy, and alternatively, in the event that the jury might determine that the ship was unseaworthy, that such unseaworthiness was caused or brought into play by stevedore Strachan in breach of its implied warranty of workmanlike performance and, therefore, that it was entitled to indemnification from Strachan if it was required to pay damages based upon the ship\u2019s unseaworthiness. Strachan countered by asserting that all cargo operations were conducted in a safe and workmanlike manner in compliance with all safety regulations and that the ship\u2019s inshore list caused the pipe previously stowed to either break or jump over its chocking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">In answers to special interrogatories, the jury found that Royal Netherlands was negligent and that the ADONIS was unseaworthy, but that Royal Netherlands\u2019 negligence alone proximately caused Miller\u2019s injuries; that the stevedore, Strachan, did not breach its warranty of workmanlike performance to Royal Netherlands, and that Miller\u2019s damages were 200,000 dollars. The trial court entered judgment holding Royal Netherlands solely liable in the amount of 200,000 dollars. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">Royal Netherlands mounts its attack upon the judgment below on the grounds that (1) there is insufficient evidence upon which to warrant a verdict against the shipowner, (2) the jury\u2019s answers to the special interrogatories are fatally inconsistent and (3) the charge that Royal Netherlands could recover indemnity from Strachan only if the jury found that unseaworthiness of the ADONIS proximately caused Miller\u2019s injury was reversibly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">A review of the record convinces us that Royal Netherlands\u2019 sufficiency of the evidence complaint is without merit. In a lengthy trial all three parties devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>oped extensive proof to construct and reinforce their contradictory conceptions of the events culminating in Miller\u2019s injuries. The contradictory proof developed classic jury issues as to cause and effect. Sufficient evidence was adduced to have sustained a verdict based on any party\u2019s major premise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Royal Netherlands\u2019 more substantial allegation relates to inconsistency in the jury\u2019s answers to the special verdict questions submitted pursuant to Rule 49(a) F.R.Civ.P. These questions and the jury\u2019s responses are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">A finding by this court that a critical verdict was inconsistent with another would require a remand for a new trial <em>[e.g., </em>Royal Netherlands S.S. Co. v. Strachan Shipping Co., 362 F.2d 691 (5th Cir. 1966); Missouri Pacific R.R. Co. v. Salazar, 254 F.2d 847 (5th Cir. 1958)] since we could not speculate which inconsistent finding the jury intended to be controlling. However, the determination that an inconsistency exists must be made only after a concerted effort to reconcile every apparent inconsistency. As we stated in Griffin v. Matherne, 471 F.2d 911 (5th Cir. 1973): \u201cThe Seventh Amendment requires that if there is a view of the case which makes the jury\u2019s answers consistent, the court must adopt that view and enter judgment accordingly. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. Eller-man Lines, 369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 786, 7 L.Ed.2d 798, 806-807 (1962). This court has stated that the test to be applied in reconciling apparent conflicts between the jury\u2019s answers is whether the answers may fairly be said to rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>resent a logical and probable decision on the relevant issues as submitted, . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 915. \u201cWe therefore must attempt to reconcile the jury\u2019s findings, by exegesis, if necessary, . before we are free to disregard the jury\u2019s verdict and remand the case for a new trial.\u201d Gallick v. B &amp; O R.R. Co., 372 U.S. 108, 119, 83 S.Ct. 659, 666, 9 L.Ed.2d 618 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">The jury found that the defendant Royal Netherlands was negligent [No. 1]; that Royal Netherlands\u2019 negligence was a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries [No. 2]; that the ADONIS was unsea-worthy [No. 3], but that the unseaworthiness of the vessel was not a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries [No. 4]; and that Strachan Shipping Company did not breach its warranty of workmanlike performance to Royal Netherlands [No. 8]. Royal Netherlands contends that if the jury found that its negligence caused the ship to become unstable, they were legally bound to find that such instability constituted unseaworthiness. Therefore, Royal Netherlands continues, the jury\u2019s proximate cause answers to Nos. 2 and 4 were inconsistent since they would have determined thereby that the same condition both was and was not a proximate cause of Miller\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">While ordinarily liability based upon unseaworthiness is wholly distinct from liability based upon negligence, e.g., Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 94, 66 S.Ct. 872, 877, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), a negligent act or omission in the course of loading which causes a vessel to become unstable also creates an unseaworthy condition. <em>See, e.g., </em>Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 400 U.S. 494, 499, 91 S.Ct. 514, 518, 27 L.Ed.2d 562 (1971); Gutierrez v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963); Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. Ellerman Lines, 369 U.S. 355, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). However, the sum of these legal theories does not lead to the conclusion that the jury\u2019s answers to interrogatories Nos. 2 and 4 must be inconsistent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">It is possible to reconcile the answers by making the plausible assumption that the jury considered only the acts and omissions it thought caused the listing of the ship in answering the negligence question, and separately and distinctly applied its decision on unseaworthiness to the manner of the stowage of the pipe, <em>i.e., </em>they found that the ship\u2019s officers\u2019 negligence in failing to attend to the vessel\u2019s lateral stability and subsequent loading of water in the No. 4 starboard tank caused the ADONIS to list and that the manner of stowing the pipe created an unseaworthy condition. A review of the proof adduced, the conduct of the trial, the trial court\u2019s instructions and arguments of counsel demonstrate that this is a logical and probable way to reconciliation of the inconsistency of the answers in point of legal theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">This pervasive, totality-of-circumstances overview was suggested by this court in McVey v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 288 F.2d 53 (5th Cir. 1961), and confirmed in Griffin v. Matherne, 471 F.2d 911 (5th Cir. 1973). In such a light, the jury could consistently have found that Royal Netherlands\u2019 own personnel were negligent in creating and failing to correct the starboard list and that the ship was unseaworthy because the pipe was improperly stowed, but that the list and not the improper stowage of the pipe proximately caused the pipe to fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">The district court\u2019s lengthy instructions contained an explanation of the difference between negligence and unseaworthiness and cautioned the jury that if they found both negligence and unseaworthiness, the plaintiff could still recover only for one. Reason confirms that the jury could have found negligence on the part of the shipowner in creating and failing to correct the list (since it was a finding which the evidence clearly would permit) but, mindful of the court\u2019s instruction, simply did not pause to further consider whether the list also constituted an unseaworthy condition. In view of the mass of evidence and copious judicial instructions which this jury faced, such a failure to appreciate the need to apply this legal concept is not only plausible but understandable. Indeed, considering that the jury\u2019s func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>tion under Rule 49(a) is solely one of fact finding, a jury which had made a finding that the listing of the ship constituted negligence on the part of the shipowner, would not be bound to apply the legal consequences of such a finding, <em>i.e., </em>that negligence causing instability necessarily constituted an unseaworthy condition in the ship. This could be done by the court. Since this logical and probable rationalization of the jury\u2019s answers exists the verdict must be accepted. Even though equally persuasive possibilities' that would produce reversal might be shown to exist, our inquiry ends here. Stacey v. Illinois Central R.R., 491 F.2d 542 (5th Cir. 1974); Griffin v. Matherne, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Royal Netherlands further asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a shipowner may recover indemnity from an injured longshoreman\u2019s stevedore-employer only if the jury found that unseaworthiness of the vessel proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Royal Netherlands contends that this charge suffers from the erroneous implication that Royal Netherlands could not recover indemnity if it was found liable for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Under our assumption (required to harmonize the jury\u2019s special verdict answers) that the jury determined that Royal Netherlands\u2019 negligence in creating and failing to correct the list was the sole proximate cause of Miller\u2019s injury, any further finding as to the stevedore\u2019s work, which must have been determined to have been unrelated to creation or correction of the list, would have been superfluous and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Royal Netherlands relies upon Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co. v. Nacirema, etc., Co., 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491 (1958) and Grace Lines, Inc. v. Port Everglades Terminal Co., 324 F.2d 699 (5th Cir. 1963) for its contention that the judge\u2019s charge was erroneous. In <em>Weyerhaeuser, </em>the Supreme Court held, and in <em>Grace Lines, </em>this court held that the trial judge was in error in directing a verdict for the stevedore after a determination that the shipowner was liable only for negligence, and not for unseaworthiness. Royal Netherlands asserts that the effect of the court\u2019s charge in this case is the same, <em>i.e., </em>that Royal Netherlands could not recover indemnity if it was found liable for negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prejudicial defect, Royal Netherlands continues, is made evident by the special verdicts that Royal Netherlands was guilty of negligence which proximately caused the accident and that no breach of warranty of workmanlike performance was committed by Strachan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">Neither <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>nor <em>Grace Lines </em>is apropos to the case presently before this court. In the case at bar the judge instructed the jury that Royal Netherlands\u2019 claim against Strachan must be predicated upon a finding that unseaworthiness of the <em>vessel </em>proximately caused plaintiff Miller\u2019s injuries, and not, as Royal Netherlands contends, that Royal Netherlands was precluded from recovering indemnity from Strachan if its liability was based on a finding of negligence. The concept of unseaworthiness did occupy a crucial place in Royal Netherlands\u2019 case against Strachan because a finding that Strachan breached its warranty of workmanlike performance, a prerequisite to recovery by Royal Netherlands, would necessarily render the vessel unseaworthy in a case such as this where Strachan\u2019s acts involved only the manner of loading and method of stowage of the pipes. <em>E.g., </em>Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 400 U.S. 494, 499, 91 S.Ct. 514, 518, 27 L.Ed.2d 562 (1971); Gutierrez v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963); Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. Ellerman Lines, 369 U.S. 355, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). Thus the judge\u2019s charge that the jury must find that the unseaworthiness of the vessel was the proximate cause of Miller\u2019s injury was not erroneous when read in context with all other instructions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>This situation is different from that in both <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>and <em>Grace Lines. </em>In those cases the trial judge dismissed the shipowner\u2019s third-party complaint without giving the jury an opportunity to determine if the stevedore\u2019s actions, alleged by the shipowner to have constituted a breach of warranty, would have sustained a recovery over by the shipowner in spite of its own negligence. In <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>and <em>Grace Lines, </em>a jury trial of the stevedore\u2019s culpability was required because the acts and omissions of both the shipowner and the stevedore surrounding the accidents were so physically intertwined that an initial finding of negligence against the shipowner would not preclude an additional finding that the stevedore\u2019s breach of its warranty of workmanlike performance also contributed to the injury. In the case before us today, however, consistency with our resolution of the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories compels a finding that the jury determined <em>only </em>the shipowner was responsible for the injury proximately resulting from its neglect in causing the vessel\u2019s starboard list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">. <em>See </em>Brown, Federal Special Verdicts: The Doubt Eliminator, 44 F.R.D. 245 at 338 (1967); Ford Motor Co. v.
