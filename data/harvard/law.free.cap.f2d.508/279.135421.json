Appeal No. 74-1301 is from an order entered in district court civil action No. 71-1002 denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to convene a three-judge district court, and granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint. Appeal No. 74-1302 is from an order entered in district court civil action No. 71 \u2014 2301 also denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to convene a three-judge. district court and granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint. Appeal No. 7&lt;U1303 is from the entry of order No. 1447 in proceedings for the reorganization of Penn Central Transportation Co., which, as relevant to this appeal, dismissed applications to have the trustees in reorganization of Penn Central operate trains Nos. 600 through 617 (the 600 series), between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and trains Nos. 200 through 298 (the 200 series) between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New York, New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants are the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the United Transportation Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellees are the trustees in reorganization of Penn Central, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The complex procedural history of this litigation can, for present purposes, begin with order No. 232 entered on April 16, 1971. By that order the reorganization court enjoined all persons, including the appellants, from instituting or maintaining any litigation affecting the continuance or discontinuance of passenger trains covered by the National Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (the Amtrak statute), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 et seq., in any court other than the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the entry of this order the appellants filed district court civil action No. 71-1002 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking to enjoin termination of any service between Harrisburg and Philadelphia or between Philadelphia and New York. The complaint also specifically requested that the question of whether the 600 series trains and the 200 series trains were in intercity or commuter service within the meaning of \u00a7 102(5) of the Amtrak statute be referred, pursuant to 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1336(b), to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The district court by order No. 238 approved the contract between the debtor and Amtrak and by order No. 244 dated April 30, 1971 acceded to appellants\u2019 request that the intercity or commuter status of the 200 and 600 series trains be referred to the Commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By order No. 245 the reorganization court directed that intercity rail service be discontinued, but that pending the I.C.C. determination the trustees resume the operation of the 200 and 600 series trains if they should be discontinued by Amtrak.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Commission undertook to investigate and report on both series. On June 24, 1971, in Finance Docket No. 26632, 338 I.C.C. 621 it found that the 600 series trains were not \u201cintercity rail passenger service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 102(5) of the Amtrak statute, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(5), but were commuter trains. On July 26, 1971, in Finance Docket No. 26634, 338 I.C.C. 690 it found that the 200 series trains were not \u201cintercity rail passenger service\u201d, but commuter trains. On July 14, 1971 the Commission was made a party to the reorganization proceedings with respect to hearings on exceptions to its reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Meanwhile, effective May 1, 1971, both series of trains were designated by the National Rail Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) as \u201cAmtrak\u201d trains. They have since that date been operated by Penn Central pursuant to a contract with Amtrak.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On August 11, 1972 the appellants petitioned in the reorganization proceeding for an order directing the trustees to resume operation of the 600 series trains. When it became clear that Amtrak was not about to terminate this service a hearing scheduled on that petition was cancelled without prejudice. Although the record is not entirely clear, it appears that other informal applications for relief with respect to the 600 and 200 series trains were also presented in the reorganization proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">On September 22, 1971 the appellants filed district court civil action No. 71\u2014 2301 praying that the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336(c), enforce the two I.C.C. decisions and declare pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202 that Penn Central may not be relieved of the responsibility for the disputed service.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The defendants moved in both Nos. 71-1002 and 71-2301 to dismiss the complaints. And the plaintiffs, relying on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325, moved for the convening of a three-judge court in both actions. Thus the district court had before it the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss both civil actions, the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to convene a three-judge court, and certain applications in the reorganization proceedings all directed at obtaining or opposing an adjudication that the 600 series and 200 series trains were commuter trains falling outside the scope of the Amtrak statute. The court considered all these matters in a single opinion. In re Penn Central Transportation Co., 370 F.Supp. 22 (E.D.Pa.1974). It held, <em>inter alia </em>that:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">(1) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325 was inapplicable because the ICC reports on the 600 and 200 series trains were not \u201corders\u201d within the meaning of that statute; (2) it had jurisdiction both by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1336(b) 1398(b), and under the Bankruptcy Act, and (3) by \u00a7 202 of the Amtrak statute, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 522 Congress had precluded judicial review of the decision by Amtrak to operate the 600 and 200 series trains as intercity trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">1. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325 provides that an interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of an order of the I.C.C. shall not be granted unless the application therefor is heard by a three-judge district court. No order was entered in Finance Dockets Nos. 26632 or 26634. Thus \u00a7 2325 is inapplicable. United States v. Atlanta, Birmingham &amp; Coast R.R., 282 U.S. 522, 51 S.Ct. 237, 75 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>513 (1931). Moreover, the appellants, plaintiffs in civil actions Nos. 71-1002 and 71-2301, sought to enforce rather than to enjoin enforcement of the ICC\u2019s conclusion that the disputed trains were commuter rather than intercity. Thus the district court properly declined to request the convening of a three-judge district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">2. The basis for the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction need not detain us. We have twice held that all litigation concerning the Penn Central\u2019s relationship with Amtrak should be heard in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In re Penn Central Transportation Co., 457 F.2d 381, 387 (3d Cir. 1972) (Appeal of State of New York); In re Penn Central Transportation Co., 446 F.2d 1109, cert. denied 405 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 943, 30 L.Ed.2d 787 (Appeal of Congress of Ry. Unions).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">3. The district court properly concluded that Amtrak\u2019s decision to operate, and Penn Central\u2019s decision to discontinue the 600 and 200 series trains were beyond judicial review. The congressional purpose in enacting the Amtrak statute was the creation of a modern, efficient intercity railroad passenger service system. Section 101 of the Amtrak statute, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 501. The first step in creation of that system was to be a preliminary report by the Secretary of Transportation to the ICC and to Congress recommending a \u201cbasic system.\u201d Section 201 of the Amtrak statute, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 521. The recommendation was to specify \u201cpoints between which intercity passenger trains shall be operated routes . . . and the trains presently operated over such routes, together with basic service characteristics of operations to be provided within the basic system, taking into account schedules, [and] number of trains . . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>Interested parties were afforded an opportunity to comment and make recommendations on the preliminary report. Section 202 of the Amtrak statute, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 522. The statute then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cThe Secretary shall . .. . submit his final report designating the basic system to Congress. . . . The basic system as designated by the Secretary shall become effective for the purposes of this chapter upon the dates that the final report of the Sec-' retary is submitted .to Congress <em>and shall not be reviewable in any court.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">The Secretary\u2019s final report was submitted on January 28, 1971. In that report he designated points between which intercity passenger trains would be operated, including \u201cNew York-Chicago.\u201d He designated routes over which service might be provided, including the \u201cNew York-Pittsburgh Segment via Philadelphia, Harrisburg.\u201d He designated trains presently operated over such routes in the New York-Pittsburgh segment via Philadelphia-Harrisburg, including in that designation the 600 series trains. He also designated New York and Washington as two points between which intercity passenger service trains \u201cshall be operated\u201d and designated routes over which that service \u201cmay be operated\u201d as \u201cNew York-Washington Segment via-Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore.\u201d He listed the trains presently operating over the New York-Washington segment including in that list the 200 series trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">There can be no doubt that Congress, having afforded interested parties an opportunity to comment and make recommendations on the Secretary\u2019s preliminary report, intended that the final report designating the basic system, a document culminating a process essentially legislative in nature, be subject to review only in the legislative branch. The statute could be no more explicit. <em>See </em>Quincy College and Seminary Corp. v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 328 F.Supp. 808, 811 (N.D.Ill.1971) aff\u2019d, 405 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 939, 30 L.Ed.2d 777 (1972). The complaints in civil actions Nos. 71\u2014 1002 and 71-2301 were properly dismissed, and order No. 1447 in the reorga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>nization proceeding was properly entered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The orders appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">. A separate order growing out of the same opinion is before us in Parker v. Penn Central Transportation Co., No. 74-1325, (3d Cir. filed Jan. 13, 1975), 510 F.2d 970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-11\">. On December 19, 1974 the State of New Jersey, originally an appellant filed a stipulation of dismissal. The State of New York also appeals from order No. 1447 with respect to the Chatham, New York \u2014 New York, New York run. The gravamen of that claim is more fully considered in Parker v. Penn Central Transportation Co., No. 74-1325 (3d Cir., filed Jan. 13, 1975.), 510 F.2d 970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-17\">. <em>See </em>In re Penn Central Transportation Co., 446 F.2d 1109 (3d Cir.), aff\u2019g, 329 F.Supp. 387 (E.D.Pa.1971) (Appeal of Congress of Ry.
