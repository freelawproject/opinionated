Stats, ch. 26, \u00a7 2-314 (1973)). Midland sought $2,000,000 in damages from plaintiff for the following reasons set forth in its complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-19\">\u201c6. Defendant failed to make timely shipment and delivery of the said tennis rackets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-20\">\u201c7. Defendant failed to furnish to plaintiff all its requirements of said tennis rackets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-21\">\u201c8. The tennis rackets which were manufactured by defendant and sold and delivered to plaintiff were not of good and merchantable quality. The said tennis rackets were not porosity and oxide free, were not of optimum metal density and were not free of shrinkage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-22\">\u201c9. The number of rejects in the lots of tennis rackets manufactured by defendant and sold and delivered to plaintiff exceeded 1%.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-23\">Paragraph 10 of the complaint describes the damages that Midland claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-24\">\u201c10. As a result of the matters set forth in the foregoing paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9, plaintiff\u2019s supply of tennis rackets was not sufficient for it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>satisfy the demand for such rackets, plaintiff was required to refund the purchase price of defective tennis rackets which were returned to it, and the reputation of plaintiff and its tennis racket in the market was damaged. By reason of the foregoing, plaintiff has suffered damages to the extent of $2,000,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">As a result of the alleged defects Midland withdrew its tennis rackets from the market. As of the time of the oral argument before us, Midland\u2019s suit had not yet been tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Plaintiff tendered the defense of the Midland action to defendant under its comprehensive general liability insurance policy, but defendant refused the tender on various grounds. In its answer to the instant complaint, defendant asserted that (1) there was no \u201coccurrence,\u201d as required by the insurance policy; (2) there was no \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policy; and (3) the so-called \u201csisterhood\u201d exclusion (Exclusion N of the policy) was applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. Since we uphold the validity of these three defenses, we do not reach other defenses asserted in defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">After both parties filed motions for summary judgment, then District Judge Tone issued an unreported memorandum opinion denying plaintiff\u2019s motion and granting defendant\u2019s, holding that \u201cMidland\u2019s claim is essentially one for loss of investment, loss of anticipated profits, and loss of goodwill\u201d and that damages from injury to such intangible property rights were excluded from the policy\u2019s coverage. In a supplemental opinion, he also held that the \u201csisterhood\u201d exclusion (N) precluded coverage. He did not determine whether there was an \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">In pertinent part, the policy covers plaintiff\u2019s liability for \u201cproperty damage\u201d which is \u201ccaused by an occurrence.\u201d In our judgment, the district court correctly held that any sums plaintiff may be obligated to pay as a result of the Midland action will not be a result of \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined in the policy. The definition is: \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property.\u201d As Judge Tone rightly observed, Midland is claiming damages for injury to intangible property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so that coverage does not exist under the policy. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Northern Grain Co., 365 F.2d 361, 367 (8th Cir. 1966); Hartford Accident <em>&amp; </em>Indemnity Co. v. Case Foundation Co., 10 Ill.App.3d 115, 294 N.E.2d 7 (1st Dist. 1973). Since this is a diversity case, Illinois rules on choice of law are applicable because that is the state where the district court is located. Illinois choice of law rules dictate the choice of Ohio law, as the state wherein the insurance contract was apparently executed. However, plaintiff has cited no applicable authority from Ohio that is contrary to the <em>Hartford </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Using an inventive, if farfetched, approach, plaintiff contends in this Court, that there was \u201cproperty damage\u201d to the finished product, the racket, by reason of the incorporation of the allegedly defective part, the frame. We do not think that the mere inclusion of a defective component, where no physical harm to the other parts results therefrom, constitutes \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the meaning of the policy. For example, if an automobile crash results from the failure of its defective tire, the defective component can be said to have caused \u201cproperty damage\u201d to the finished product. If, however, some of the tires purchased by the automobile manufacturer are found to be defective and the manufacturer therefore with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>draws its cars from the market, there has not been \u201cinjury to or destruction of tangible property,\u201d which is (as noted) the definition of \u201cproperty damage\u201d in the policy. We also reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that because Midland\u2019s complaint implicitly seeks compensation for the loss of use of its machinery for finishing the rackets idled by the alleged lack of quality frames, the suit is one for \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Idled machinery is not injured or destroyed tangible property and, therefore, there is no \u201cproperty damage\u201d within the coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Secondly, Exclusion N of the policy applies, as held in the district court\u2019s second memorandum opinion. That clause specifically excludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\"><em>\u201cdamages claimed for the withdrawal, </em>inspection, repair, replacement or loss of use <em>of the Named Insured\u2019s products </em>or work completed by or for the Named Insured <em>or of any property of which such products or work form a part, if such products, work or property are withdrawn from the market or from use because of any known or suspected defect or deficiency therein\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Here Midland withdrew the tennis rackets from the market because the frames \u201cwere not porosity and oxide free, were not of optimum metal density and were not free of shrinkage.\u201d As the district judge observed, Exclusion N was \u201cdesigned to exclude from coverage costs incurred by the withdrawal of goods from the market, the situation presented here.\u201d (See emphasized language of Exclusion N above.) Under the language of Exclusion N, it is immaterial that the withdrawal was not by the insured.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Finally, although it was not a basis for the district court\u2019s decision, we think it is appropriate to note that the damages claimed by Midland were not the result of \u201can occurrence\u201d as required by the terms of the policy. An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.\u201d Because Midland\u2019s complaint controls the question whether defendant must accept the tender of defense, it is of course immaterial that plaintiff\u2019s declaratory judgment complaint characterizes Midland\u2019s suit as \u201cfor property damage arising from an occurrence of alleged negligent manufacture\u201d of aluminum tennis racket frames by plaintiff. If one of the completed rackets had broken during normal use due to the defective frames and a person or an item of property had been harmed, it seems clear that there would have been an \u201coccurrence\u201d and that defendant would have had responsibility for plaintiff\u2019s defense. Such a situation would clearly be \u201can accident.\u201d The policy does not, however, cover \u201can occurrence of alleged negligent manufacture\u201d; it covers negligent manufacture that results in \u201can occurrence.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s strained interpretations aside, the Midland complaint would not support a reasonable belief that Midland\u2019s damages were the result of \u201can occurrence\u201d within the definition of the policy in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Plaintiff relies upon Maurice Pincoffs Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 447 F.2d 204 (5th Cir. 1971), to support its argument that there was an \u201coccurrence\u201d under defendant\u2019s policy. However, in that case, the parties did not disagree on whether an occurrence had in fact transpired. The question before the court was whether there was one occurrence of liability or eight separate occurrences under the policy. The <em>Pin-coffs </em>case is inapplicable because it did not focus upon the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Because it was not raised below, we do not consider plaintiff\u2019s argument that since Midland\u2019s suit against plaintiff had not yet been tried, summary judgment in this case was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-17\">. Although Midland\u2019s complaint refers to \u201ctennis rackets,\u201d it is clear that plaintiff was commissioned to make only the frames. Apparently Midland would then undertake to complete the rackets by adding string, handles, etc. This fact is crucial to plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. The \u201csisterhood\u201d exclusion is discussed in R. Elliott, New Comprehensive General Liability Policy, Practicing Law Institute XII-QQ-9 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. See Paragraph 10 of Midland\u2019s complaint quoted <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">. The non-Ohio cases relied upon by plaintiff to show that there was property damage are inapposite because they involve policy provisions differing from the one before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">. To the extent that Parker Products, Inc. v. Gulf Insurance Co., 486 S.W.2d 610 (Tex.Civ.App.1972), is to the contrary, we agree with the dissenting opinion. This point, was not discussed when the <em>Parker Products </em>case reached the Supreme Court of Texas. See 498 S.W.2d 676 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
