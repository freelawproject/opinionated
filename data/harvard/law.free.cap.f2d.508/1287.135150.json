Rule 59; 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice If 110.08 [3], at 120; (c) since premature, the appeal sought to be taken on August 13 is a nullity. Turner v. HMH Publishing Co., 328 F.2d 136 (CA 5, 1964); Stevens v. Turner, 222 F.2d 352, 354 (CA 7, 1955); Studer v. Moore, 153 F.2d 902 (CA 2, 1946); (d) no notice of appeal was filed within 30 days of September 17. Thus this court lacks jurisdiction of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-32\">The per curiam opinion in Turner v. HMH supports appellee\u2019s motion. But we think the correct rule is that of the later and carefully considered opinion by Judge Thornberry in Markham v. Holt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>369 F.2d 940 (CA 5, 1966).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that case the court entered an order granting motions for summary judgment on July 16. Appellant filed notice of appeal on August 6, noticing appeal from the July 16 \u201cfinal order and/or judgment.\u201d On August 10 the court by separate document filed the actual judgment. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-4\">This Court has consistently adhered to the policy of exercising all proper means to prevent the loss of valuable rights when the validity of an appeal is challenged not because something was done too late, but rather because it was done too soon. Avery v. Fischer, 5th Cir. 1966, 360 F.2d 719, 723; Carter v. Campbell, 5th Cir. 1960, 285 F.2d 68; Bates v. Batte, 5th Cir. 1951, 187 F.2d 142, 143, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 815, 72 S.Ct. 29, 96 L.Ed. 616. The basic policy considerations underlying the limitation that a final judgment is a prerequisite to appealability are the excessive inconvenience and costs occasioned by piecemeal review on the one hand, and the danger of denying justice by needless delay on the other. Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 1964, 379 U.S. 148, 152-153, 85 S.Ct. 308, 311, 13 L.Ed.2d 199, 203; In re Forstner Chain Corp., 1st Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 572, 575. The purpose of requiring the filing of a timely notice of appeal is to advise the opposing party that an appeal is being taken from a specific judgment, and such notice should therefore contain sufficient information so as not to prejudice or mislead the appellee. Wilson v. Southern Ry., 5th Cir. 1945, 147 F.2d 165. The assumption of jurisdiction in the instant case, we are convinced, does not violate the spirit of the final-judgment rule nor the notice-of-appeal requirements. This Circuit has long been committed to the rule that where, as in the instant case, it is obvious that the overriding intent was effectively to appeal, and no prejudice will result to the appellee, we are justified in treating the appeal as from a final judgment. See United States v. Stromberg, 5th Cir. 1955, 227 F.2d 903, 904; Atlantic Coast Line Ry. v. Mims, 5th Cir. 1952, 199 F.2d 582, 583, accord, Donovan v. Esso Shipping Co., 3d Cir. 1958, 259 F.2d 65, cert. denied, 1959, 359 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 583, 3 L.Ed.2d 572.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">369 F.2d at 942. In similar contexts the Ninth Circuit has reached the same result in a series of cases. Firchau v. Diamond National Corp., 345 F.2d 269 (CA 9, 1965); Ruby v. Secretary of United States Navy, 365 F.2d 385 (CA 9, 1966); Curtis Gallery &amp; Library, Inc. v. United States, 388 F.2d 358 (CA 9, 1967); Eason v. Dickson, 390 F.2d 585 (CA 9, 1968). As Judge Thornberry wrote in <em>Markham, </em>the provision that the Rules be construed \u201cto secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action\u201d, Rule 1, F.R.Civ.P., requires that a defect such as this be treated as too insubstantial to deprive us of jurisdiction. \u201c[I]t is too late in the day and entirely contrary to the spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of such mere technicalities.\u201d Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222, 225 (1962). The per curiam in Turner v. HMH neither referred to nor gave effect to these policies. As between it and <em>Markham, </em>we think that we are required to follow the latter. See also 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice If 204.14 at 983:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">These cases <em>[Markham </em>and the Ninth Circuit cases] make it clear that an appeal should not be dismissed because it was technically premature if in fact an appealable judgment or order was rendered below, the appellant clearly manifested his intent to appeal from it and the prevailing party below can show no prejudice resulting from the prematurity of the notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-7\">There is no prejudice shown in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">. <em>Markham </em>does not refer to <em>Turner.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
