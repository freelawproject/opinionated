On a second count of the indictment, she was convicted of having possessed the same marijuana with intent to distribute it, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Of the appellant\u2019s three contentions on this appeal, only one has a semblance of merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This pertains to the District Court\u2019s refusal, absent a request of the jury, to allow the jury to have a certain exhibit in its possession during the jury\u2019s deliberations. The appellant claimed that the exhibit impeached the arresting officers, inasmuch as it did not record some of the incriminating testimony given by one of the officers. The district judge based his refusal upon the ground that the report contained certain \u201cextraneous matters.\u201d We think the better practice would have been to excise the extraneous material and send the relevant portions of the exhibit, along with the other exhibits, to the jury room. Through the examination of counsel, however, the jury had been made aware of the alleged discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the official report. This, considered in the light of the whole record, leads us to conclude that if the court\u2019s action constituted error, such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-10\">. The appellant complains of one of the court\u2019s instructions, but considering the instructions in their entirety, we hold that the jury was fairly informed.</p>\n<p id=\"AHq\">It is also contended that the prosecuting attorney made a prejudicially erroneous comment during summation. The record does not reveal that the challenged comment was made nor, if made, that any objection to the alleged comment was made by the appellant\u2019s attorney at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
