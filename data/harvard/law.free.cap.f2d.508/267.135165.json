The statute divides the county into five districts and provides for a county commission composed of one representative from each district. The commissioners are elected by the voters of the county at large, but each commissioner must reside in the district he represents. In Reese v. Dallas County, Alabama, 5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 879, this Court held that a similar county commission plan for Dallas County, Alabama, was constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">The district court found that the registered voters in Madison County, as of August 1, 1971, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">District 1 - 3,358</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYN\">District 2 - 2,907</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A96\">District 3 - 3,739</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aal\">District 4 - 4,519</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aid\">District 5 - 58,836</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM2\">Total for County - 73,359</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The City of Huntsville is in District 5. The population of Huntsville on December 31, 1970, was 137,802; the population of the county was 186,540.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">This Court said in <em>Reese: </em>\u201cDilution [of voting strength] is established if a dis-tricting scheme works an invidious effect on an identifiable group.\u201d 505 F.2d at 883. In that case \u201cSelma, the urban community, [was] outvoted three to one by rural areas, even though its population [was] virtually equal to their population\u201d. In this case Huntsville, the urban community, could be outvoted four to one by rural areas, even though the city\u2019s population was almost 74 percent of the total population of Madison County. In each case, instead of excluding a group of voters outright, the ability of the urban voters to participate in the county\u2019s activities was diluted by the restrictions on their opportunity to elect candidates from their own area.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-28\">We hold that the statutory plan for the election of the County Commission of Madison County, Alabama, violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-19\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion and the Court\u2019s opinion in Reese v. Dallas County, Alabama.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
