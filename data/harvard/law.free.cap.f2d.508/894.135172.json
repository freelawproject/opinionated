Under the provisions of the will, the income of the trust was to go to his widow, Mrs. Mary Hayward Weir, for life and then \u201cto such person or persons, including her estate, as she may, by her last will and testament, nominate and appoint.\u201d Just prior to the death of Mrs. Weir in 1968, the trust realized capital gains of some $541,738.82 and subsequently paid taxes which are the subject of this lawsuit. In her will, Mrs. Weir exercised her general testamentary power of appointment over the trust by directing that the principal be distributed to appellant-Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Below, appellant sought a refund of the taxes paid on the 1968 capital gains, claiming that the trust should be retroactively accorded a charitable deduction under \u00a7 642(c) of the Int.Rev. Code of 1954.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ' We agree with the conclusion of the district court that these monies were not paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose \u201cpursuant to the terms of the governing instrument\u201d as required by \u00a7 642(c), since the will of Ernest Weir expressed no such intent. Correspondingly, we affirm on the basis of Judge Carter\u2019s opinion published at 362 F.Supp. 928.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-10\">. Although the 1969 Tax Reform Act modified some of the terms of this statute, these changes, codified at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 642(c)(1) (1970), have no relevance to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-11\">. Appellant additionally claims error in the denial of its pretrial discovery request for \u201call notes, reports, notes of conferences and mem-oranda\u201d prepared by the auditing IRS Agent and by the Appellate Division of the Regional Commissioner\u2019s office. Relying on recommendations contained in a report of Magistrate Martin D. Jacobs, Judge Gagliardi granted Appellant\u2019s motion for production of documents only to the limited extent of requiring the Government to turn over factual material (as distinguished from opinions, legal analy-ses, and recommendations). The pure deliberative processes of government have traditionally been protected against disclosure, and, accordingly, we affirm on the basis of Magistrate Jacobs\u2019 report, unofficially reported at 72-1 USTC (CCH) (I 9435.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
