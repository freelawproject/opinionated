His principal contention is that his conviction for possession of marijuana was based in part upon evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-26\">The search warrant authorized a search of the \u201cpremises and residence, if any, located at 37 West Lowell Street,\u201d for marijuana plants. According to Rutherford, the warrant was invalidly drawn because it failed to describe with particularity the place to be searched. Although the description in the warrant may seem imprecise, a warrant is valid as long as the officer executing it can with reasonable effort ascertain and identify the place to be searched. Steele v. United States, 267 U.S. 498, 503, 45 S.Ct. 414, 69 L.Ed. 757 (1925); United States v. Melancon, 462 F.2d 82, 93-94 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 409 U.S. 1038, 93 S.Ct. 516, 34 L.Ed.2d 487 (1972). In this case, where the yard searched and the house located at 37 West Lowell St. were within a single fenced enclosure, the warrant\u2019s reference to \u201cpremises\u201d was sufficient to draw the officer\u2019s attention to the yard. <em>Cf. </em>United States ex rel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Saiken v. Bensinger, 489 F.2d 865, 867-868 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 910, 94 S.Ct. 2607, 41 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Appellant also contends the warrant was invalidly issued. According to Rutherford, the warrant\u2019s supporting affidavit, which was based in part on an informant\u2019s statement, failed to provide sufficient information to enable the judge issuing the warrant to make an independent determination of probable cause. Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), sets out a two-pronged test. First, the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances as to how the informant obtained his information. Here the judge knew the informant, a neighbor of appellant, had seen marijuana plants growing in appellant\u2019s yard, had obtained a sample and had taken it to the police. Thus, the judge could reasonably conclude that the informant\u2019s statement to the affiant-officer was based on personal observation. Secondly, under <em>Aguilar, </em>the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded the informant was credible. Here, the circumstances establish reliability. <em>See </em>Ignacio v. People of Territory of Guam, 413 F.2d 513, 519 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 943, 90 S.Ct. 959, 25 L.Ed.2d 124 (1970). The judge knew the informant was willing to let his name be used, that he was a citizen/neighbor with no apparent ulterior motive, that he had of his own accord brought a sample to the police, and that the sample had proved to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are without merit. Taking into consideration evidence of the water hose leading from appellant\u2019s house to the plants and the testimony of three witnesses that appellant cared for the marijuana plants, we cannot say the jury acted unreasonably in finding him guilty. <em>See </em>Freeman v. Stone, 444 F.2d 113, 114 (9th Cir. 1971). And we find that the judge\u2019s instruction on possession was a proper statement of the law. <em>See </em>Juvera v. United States, 378 F.2d 433, 436-437 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 389 U.S. 1008, 88 S.Ct. 568, 19 L.Ed.2d 604 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
