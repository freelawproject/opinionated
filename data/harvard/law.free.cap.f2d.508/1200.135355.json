Wolk, Capra, and Fish-man \u2014 who admittedly conducted an illegal \u201cbookmaking\u201d operation in Minneapolis. Based on these telephonic communications and on the physical evidence of gambling paraphernalia found in appellants\u2019 possession, the Government painted a picture of the appellants as bookmakers who played an integral part in the conduct of the Wolk book by \u201claying off\u201d bets and by exchanging \u201cline\u201d information with the Wolk book on sporting events.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">On appeal, appellants raise the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">(1) The contents of the intercepted oral communications should have been suppressed because the wiretap application was signed by a Deputy Assistant Attorney General and not the Attorney General or his specially-designated Assistant Attorney General as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516;</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">(2) An evidentiary hearing should have been held to examine the truth of the Attorney General\u2019s affidavit in which he asserted that he personally approved a request for authority to apply for a wiretap order by initialing a memorandum to that effect;</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">(3) The evidence is insufficient to establish that defendants participated in the Wolk gambling business to the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>tent required to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955;</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">(4) The trial court erred in instructing the jury that a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 is established if the Government shows that a defendant who is a bookmaker \u201cexchanges line or other information, or places or accepts layoff bets with another bookmaker;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">(5) The trial court erred in instructing the jury that the $2,000 per day gross revenue requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(b)(l)(iii) is met by counting the total amount of wagers placed in any single day; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">(6) The statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, as construed by the trial court: (a) is an illegal Bill of Attainder, (b) is unconstitutionally vague, (c) contravenes the first, fifth, and sixth amendments, (d) is an improper delegation of legislative power under Article I, and (e) is an illegal usurpation of power specifically reserved to the states by the tenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-8\">We find it unnecessary to fully discuss appellant\u2019s contentions numbered above as (1), (2), (5), and (6). We agree with the late Judge Neville\u2019s excellent discussion and proper determination of these issues in his district court opinion. United States v. Schullo, 363 F.Supp. 246 (D.Minn.1973). As to the validity of the wiretap (issue 1), we note that United States v. Cox, 462 F.2d 1293 (8th Cir. 1972), on which Judge Neville relied, is in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 500, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 336 (1974), which affirmatively answered the question of whether Justice Department procedures, such as those in the instant case, comply with the wiretap authorization requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516. We have discussed this issue extensively in United States v. Brick, 502 F.2d 219 (8th Cir. 1974). Since the initials of Attorney General Mitchell appear on the authorization for the wiretap and his affidavit filed in this case recites that he \u201capproved a request for authority to apply for an interception order in this matter,\u201d the appellants\u2019 challenge to the wiretap must be rejected as similar challenges were rejected in <em>Chavez </em>and <em>Brick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-10\">We now turn to a consideration of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction of each of the appealing defendants. The statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, defines \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d to mean, among other things, an operation which \u201cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business * * *.\u201d As noted, the government\u2019s case rested on transcribed logs of wiretapped conversations \u25a0 between each appellant and the Wolk gambling establishment and on proof that all three defendants were bookmakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">The appellants strongly argue that the evidence is insufficient to bring them within the purview of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They claim that, even assuming they were laying off bets and giving line information to the Wolk organization, they were not \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201cconduct\u201d of the Wolk business. They assert that lay off bets, if actually made, constitute a form of insurance in which one bookmaker passes the risk of loss to another and that the interests of appellants, in fact, directly conflicted with the interests of the Wolk book.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-13\">As to Anthony Petrangelo, the taped telephone conversations disclose that he furnished the Wolk book with his \u201cline\u201d (point spreads on various sporting events) and received Wolk\u2019s lay off betting on a regular and consistent basis. In addition, the two parties discussed opportunities for Petrangelo to further lay off a particular bet to an unnamed third party bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">The evidence against Frank Schullo indicates that he frequently called the Wolk operation inquiring of Wolk\u2019s line and that he placed bets on selected ath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>letic contests with Wolk on a fairly regular basis. The taped conversations indicate that some bets were lay offs although others may have been either lay offs or personal bets. In addition, the telephonic record indicates that Wolk made frequent lay off bets with Schullo based on Schullo\u2019s line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">The evidence shows that Steve Thomas functioned as an intermediary in placing Wolk\u2019s bets with an unnamed third party bookmaker. The transcribed conversations establish that Thomas complied with the requests of the Wolk book to obtain the line from the third party bookmaker on frequent occasions. If the odds were deemed favorable, Thomas placed Wolk\u2019s bets with this bookmaker. In addition, Thomas placed some of his own personal bets with this same bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">In examining the insufficiency of the evidence claims we must determine whether the activities of the appellants fall within the statutory term \u201cillegal gambling business.\u201d Neither Congress nor the courts have precisely delineated the reach of the term \u201cbusiness\u201d within the phrase \u201cillegal gambling business.\u201d Common usage does not offer a precise standard for the word \u201cbusiness\u201d since it may encompass anything from a single profit-seeking transaction to the overall activity of an entire industry. The statutory requirement that the \u201cbusiness\u201d must involve \u201cfive or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own\u201d some portion of the business limits the definition somewhat but still leaves the term nebulous and elastic in scope. Thus, it is necessary to examine the legislative history in order to further narrow the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">Section 1955 of Title 18 was enacted as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Title VIII of the Act was aimed at syndicated gambling which Congress found to have a pervasive effect upon interstate commerce. 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4028. Although Congress, with this special finding, could arguably have proscribed all illegal gambling,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it evidently intended by use of the term \u201cbusiness\u201d to signify an organized operation or enterprise involving at least five or more persons similar to a single firm engaged in any other field of commerce. The House Judiciary Committee Report on this portion of the Crime Control Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-10\">The intent of section 1511 and section 1955, below, is not to bring all illegal gambling activity within the control of the Federal Government, but to deal only with illegal gambling activities of major proportions. It is anticipated that cases in which their standards can be met will ordinarily involve business-type gambling operations of considerably greater magnitude than simply meet the minimum definitions. The provisions of this title do not apply to gambling that is sporadic or of insignificant monetary proportions. It is intended to reach only those persons who prey systematically upon our citizens and whose syndicated operations are so continuous and so substantial as to be of national concern, * * * [H.R.Rep.No.1549, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4029 (hereinafter \u201cHouse Report\u201d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aem-dedup-0\">Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report emphasizes that the standards of \u00a7 1955(b)(1) were designed to bring the federal power to bear only against \u201cillegal gambling activities of major proportions.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">It is anticipated that cases in which this standard can be met will ordinari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ly involve business-type gambling operations of considerably greater magnitude than this definition would indicate, however, because it is usually possible to prove only a relatively small proportion of the total operations of a gambling enterprise. [S.Rep.No.91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 73 (1969).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcVMF\">Thus, given the congressional emphasis on fairly large organized gambling operations and the exclusion of small-scale operations through the five-person minimum, it appears that Congress intended some gambling businesses to remain beyond the scope of the statute. Initially, proposed \u00a7 1955(b)(l)(ii) defined \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d to mean in part an operation which \u201cinvolves five or more persons who <em>participate </em>in the gambling activity.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was subsequently amended and the bill reported by the House Judiciary Committee contains the final language of \u00a7 1955(b)(l)(ii) (\u201cconduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part\u201d). House Report at 12-13, 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4029. The amendment was apparently the result of objections by the Committee on Federal Legislation of the New York City Bar Association. The word \u201cparticipate,\u201d it was argued, could include even the customers of a gambling business, thereby bringing the federal power to bear against such small scale operations as \u201cMom and Pop\u201d bookmaking businesses having two owners and three customers. House Hearings at 325-326. The final language was intended to exclude customers from the count of \u201cfive or more.\u201d House Report at 53, 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 4029. <em>See </em>United States v. Riehl, 460 F.2d 454, 459 (3d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-6\">Although it is clear that Congress was concerned with large organized gambling operations, it is often difficult to determine whether a particular operation or individual is a part of a large gambling organization. In discussing this problem, Attorney General Mitchell observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-9\">In areas in which the criminal syndicates operate, franchises are allocated on a territorial basis to nominally independent bookmakers and numbers operators. * * * The. Cosa. Nostra, on its part, provides services essential to the conduct of large-scale illegal gambling \u2014 such as providing the capital needed for <em>\u201claying off\u2019 </em>or reinsuring bets, and arranging for protection from law enforcement agencies \u2014 and collects its share of the profits. In an area which organized crime has invaded, there are few independent gamblers. [House Hearings at 152-53 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-11\">A system of lay off betting constitutes the cement which can weld widely scattered operations into an effective gambling organization. The President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_K\">Organization is also necessary to prevent severe losses. More money may be bet on one horse or one number with a small operator than he could pay off if that horse or number should win. The operator will have to hedge by betting some money himself on that horse or that number. This so-called \u201clayoff\u201d betting is accomplished through a network of local, regional, and national layoff men, who take bets from gambling operations. [The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 189 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\">In evaluating the appellants\u2019 claims of insufficiency of the evidence, we are cognizant of the congressional intent to bring federal power to bear against gambling operations organized into a business network and not against small, independent operators. A close examination of the record, including the transcribed conversations, convinces us that the activities of each appellant were of such a nature that a jury could have found that each appellant was involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>in a network of gambling operations intertwined with the Wolk business to an extent sufficient to bring them within the purview of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. The activities of both Petrangelo and Thomas played a substantial part in the conduct of the Wolk book. Petrangelo aided the Wolk operation by providing a regular and consistent market for Wolk\u2019s lay off betting. Thomas served as an agent for or collaborator with the Wolk book in arranging bets under circumstances assumed to be favorable under the line offered by an unnamed third party bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">The case against Schullo discloses a somewhat loose arrangement between the Wolk organization and Schullo. Schullo made at least some lay off bets with the Wolk book on a fairly regular basis and apparently also received some lay off bets from Wolk. Although the nature of the relationship between Schullo and the Wolk book is not as clearly established by the transcribed conversations as in the case of Petran-gelo and Thomas, these conversations do indicate that Schullo and the Wolk book frequently exchanged lay off bets. From this evidence, a jury could conclude that in providing a regular market for Wolk\u2019s lay off bets, Schullo assisted the Wolk operation in the balancing of its books on various athletic contests. As such, a jury could conclude that Schullo conducted or financed a part of the Wolk operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">Since the evidence establishes that more than five persons (including the appellants) were involved in the conduct and financing of the Wolk operation, the activities of each appellant in the Wolk gambling business fall within the reach of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. <em>See </em>United States v. Brick, 502 F.2d 219 (8th Cir. 1974); United States v. Ceraso, 467 F.2d 647 (3d Cir. 1972); United States v. Harris, 460 F.2d 1041 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 877, 93 S.Ct. 128, 34 L.Ed.2d 130 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">Finally, we turn to appellants\u2019 claim of error in the instructions. Judge Neville instructed the jury in terms of the statute, adding in explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-7\">Now, the words, \u201cConduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct or own all or part of\u201d are to be given their normal, customary meaning. <em>If it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant here on trial is a bookmaker himself, and exchanges line or other information, or places or accepts layoff bets with another bookmaker, </em>you may consider that defendant as conducting, financing, managing, directing or owning all or part of a gambling business of the other bookmaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">On the other hand, if a person is merely a customer placing a bet with a bookmaker, he does not fit within the definition of these words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-9\">So, if a person is merely a customer placing a bet or bets with a bookmaker, without being a bookmaker himself or being an employee, agent, or runner of a bookmaker, then the defendant is not a person who conducted, financed, managed, supervised, directed, or owned all or part of an illegal gambling business. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">The appellants focus on that part of the instruction that we have emphasized above. This portion of the instruction, standing by itself, appears to be somewhat broader in reach than the statute since isolated and casual lay off bets and an occasional exchange of line information may not be sufficient to establish that one bookmaker is conducting or financing the business of a second bookmaker. However, the court clearly stated that \u201c \u2018conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct or own all or a part of\u2019 are to be given their normal, customary meaning.\u201d Moreover, the court, in explaining the contentions of the parties to the jury, emphasized appellants\u2019 contention that their exchange of line information or lay off betting with the Wolk book did not constitute the \u201cconducting, financing, managing, supervising, or directing\u201d of all or part of an \u201cillegal gambling business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">The evidence discloses a consistent rather than an isolated pattern of conduct between the Wolk-Capra-Fishman book and each appellant. Under such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>circumstances and viewing the instructions as a whole, we conclude that Judge Neville did not commit any prejudicial error in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-6\">(a) Whoever conducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-7\">(b) As used in this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-8\">(1) \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d means a gambling business which\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-9\">(1) is a violation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-10\">(ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-11\">(iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-12\">(2) \u201cgambling\u201d includes but is not limited to pool-selling, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or selling chances therein.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">. For the uninitiated, a brief lexicon of gambler\u2019s terms may be useful to understanding this case. A \u201cbookmaker,\u201d of course, is one who accepts wagers, most commonly on sporting events.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-14\">A bettor, in addition to the total bet, pays the bookmaker ten percent, which is the bookmaker\u2019s commission, the \u201cvigorish\u201d or \u201cvig\u201d or, sometimes, \u201cjuice,\u201d in the vernacular. Ideally, a bookmaker has an equal amount wagered on both sides of each event with the result that he has a ten percent profit, less expenses, and, ideally, loses nothing. In truth, betting is rarely equal on both sides and bookmakers may lose money, even to the point of their businesses being destroyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aoo-dedup-0\">To protect against losses, a bookmaker normally engages in \u201clay off\u201d betting whereby he passes on to another bookmaker the amount of bets by which his own \u201cbook\" is unbalanced; thus to the extent he loses to his own customers, he wins back from the other bookmaker, or vice versa. The \u201clay off\u2019 bet is therefore, in effect, bookmaker\u2019s insurance or reinsurance. Bookmakers, however, can and commonly do place personal wagers with one another which are not \u201clay off\u2019 bets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-21\">The \u201cline\u201d constitutes the \u201codds\u201d or \u201chandicaps\u201d or \u201cpoint spreads\u201d on the wagered contests. This is a list of the teams and events with a certain number of points attributed to the nonfavored team. To win a bet on the favored team, therefore, that team must win by a score exceeding the point spread given to the nonfavored team. The \u201cline\u201d is subject to change as a given event approaches and a bookmaker may alter the \u201cline\u201d on a particular event in order to try and even out the money wagered on each side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-22\">Bookmakers may cooperate with one another by keeping their \u201clines\u201d consistent in order to avoid \u201cmiddling,\u201d whereby a bettor, because there are two different point spreads on a single event, may bet and win on both competing teams. Yet bookmakers also compete, and one may use a \u201cbeard,\u201d or bettor not identifying himself with his principal, to bet heavily with the other in an effort to make a \u201ckilling,\u201d particularly where \u201cmiddling\u201d is possible because of a discrepancy in the point spread.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1297-15\">.
