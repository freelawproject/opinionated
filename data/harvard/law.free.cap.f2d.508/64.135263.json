The principal question presented by this appeal is whether the bar to patentability found in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g) was avoided by an abandonment of Law\u2019s application before the Prosser patent issued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The district court rejected defendant\u2019s \u00a7 102(g) argument, but held the patent invalid as obvious. Finding a lack of candor in the processing of the application, the court awarded attorney fees to the defendant. We do not reach the obviousness issue because we find the patent invalid under \u00a7 102(g); we disagree with the conclusion that this is an exceptional case in which fees should be awarded to the infringer.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In order to set forth the essential facts we need only refer to three patent applications. The earliest of the three, the Allen application, did not specifically teach the use of polyethylene film or other plastic strips. The language in the Allen claim referred to \u201ca readily frangible colored body\u201d as a warning device; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in practice, Allen was using such materials as colored oxide, sand, or powder. However, the generic language in Allen\u2019s application was construed by the Patent Office also to encompass the use of plastic film which was expressly taught in the Law application.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">As already noted, Law\u2019s application anticipated the invention claimed by Prosser. Law, however, did not receive a patent because an interference was declared between his specific application and the earlier generic application filed by Allen. After the decision in the interference proceeding in December of 1973, which awarded priority to Allen, Law made no effort to develop his idea commercially. However, Allen, who had admittedly learned of the idea of using polyethylene film from the Law application, did promptly commercialize it: he sold the product himself and licensed others to use it under his generic claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">Prosser conceived the same invention independently. Nevertheless, it is clear that the invention had previously been conceived by Law and was already the subject of a pending patent application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff makes no claim that Law abandoned his invention before Prosser discovered it or before Prosser filed his application. The abandonment argument rests entirely on Law\u2019s acquiescence in the adverse ruling in the interference proceeding with Allen which preceded the issuance of the Prosser patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">For two reasons we hold the patent invalid under \u00a7 102(g). The critical language of that section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201cA person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201c(g) before the applicant\u2019s invention thereof the invention was made in this country by another who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">As we read this language, the abandonment is irrelevant unless it occurred \u201cbefore the applicant\u2019s invention.\u201d The use of the pluperfect tense \u2014 \u201chad not abandoned\u201d \u2014 plainly refers to an abandonment which occurred \u201cbefore the applicant\u2019s invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Moreover, the concept of abandonment contemplates a voluntary decision by the original inventor to terminate any effort to practice his conception. In some circumstances abandonment of a patent application by acquiescing in an adverse ruling by the Patent Office might amount to an abandonment of the invention, but certainly not in the circumstances disclosed by this record. For the invention itself had no more been abandoned than if Law had assigned his interest in it to Allen. The practical effect of the interference ruling was to give Allen, rather than Law, the opportunity to profit from Law\u2019s idea. Since there was no abandonment of the invention, and since Law\u2019s failure to participate in its exploitation was not voluntary, we do not believe he \u201cabandoned\u201d his invention within the meaning of \u00a7 102(g). Certainly he did not do so \u201cbefore the applicant\u2019s invention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">The district court found that Dow and Allen were guilty of a lack of candor in connection with the processing of the patent application and therefore awarded attorney fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are persuaded that this finding is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">The district court found that relevant prior art had not been cited by Dow and that the Allen patent was not cited as prior art by the Examiner. We agree with Dow that the Allen patent was clearly the most relevant prior art and the record does establish that it was brought to the attention of the Examiner. We attach no particular significance to the fact that several months passed after Dow became aware of the Allen patent and before it was cited, since the Examiner plainly had ample time in which to consider its relevance. The Examiner\u2019s decision not to cite the Allen patent as a reference is not attributable to Dow.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">We have also carefully considered the suggestion that the patent is tainted by Allen\u2019s conduct. Allen purchased plastic tape from Dow, accepted an exclusive license under the Prosser patent from Dow, and granted sublicenses to licensees under the Allen patent. Assuming, without deciding, that the net effect of the relationship would have been to extend the practical useful life of Allen\u2019s patent by three years (since the Prosser patent issued three years after Allen\u2019s), our holding of invalidity adequately vindicates the public interest. We are also persuaded that there was no failure by Allen to make any disclosure either to Dow or to the Patent Office which affected the integrity of the Patent Office proceedings. This is not an \u201cexceptional case\u201d within \u00a7 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">Accordingly, the portions of the Judgment Order entered on December 26, 1972, holding the patent invalid and unenforceable, and awarding normal costs to the defendant (paragraphs 1 through 4), are affirmed; the portion of said judgment awarding attorney fees to the defendant (paragraph 5) is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-14\">.
