Government proof tended to show a transfer April 1, 1973 of 32.09 grams MDA and .61 gram of cocaine. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of five years, with confinement for six months and probation for the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">Appellant Smith claimed at trial that he was \u201cpressured into this sale\u201d by agents and an informer, and the district court submitted the issue of entrapment to the jury to the apparent satisfaction of Smith. Since the jury found against him, though adequately instructed, Smith urges on appeal that entrapment must be deemed to have been established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">Smith\u2019s theory appears to be that evidence of repeated requests by government agents for assistance in obtaining narcotics, all preceding the sale by appellant, and the absence of evidence, beyond the sale itself, tending to show Smith\u2019s predisposition to sell the controlled substances, required acquittal as a matter of law. He relies principally on Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958), where the Supreme Court reversed a conviction, concluding that entrapment had been shown as a matter of law by the undisputed testimony of prosecution witnesses, the defense having called no witness of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">In the present case, however, there was a conflict in testimony as to the number of contacts between the government agents and Smith before the sale. Accordingly it will be necessary to analyze the evidence to determine whether the view of the evidence most favorable to supporting the jury verdict compels the conclusion that there was entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-16\">As stated in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 441-442, 53 S.Ct. 210, 212, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932), \u201cthe fact that officers or employees of the Government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not defeat the prosecution. Artifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises. A different question is presented when the criminal design originates with the officials of the Government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\u201d It was said in <em>Sherman, </em>356 U.S. at 372, 78 S.Ct. at 821, \u201ca line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-18\">\u201c[T]he entrapment defense prohibits law enforcement officers from instigating a criminal act by persons \u2018otherwise innocent in order to lure them to its commission and to punish them.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 428, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1641, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973), quoting <em>Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at p. 448, 53 S.Ct. 210. The test is whether \u201cthe criminal conduct was \u2018the product of the <em>creative </em>activity\u2019 of law-enforcement officials.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Sherman, </em>356 U.S. at p. 372, 78 S.Ct. at p. 821, quoting <em>Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at p. 451, 53 S.Ct. 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">\u201cEntrapment as a matter of law is established only where undisputed testimony makes it patently clear that an otherwise innocent person was induced to commit the act complained of by the trickery, persuasion, or fraud of the government agent.\u201d United States v. Millpax, Inc., 313 F.2d 152, 156 (7th Cir. 1963), citing <em>Sorrells; </em>United States v. Haden, 397 F.2d 460, 466 (7th Cir. 1968) cert. den. 396 U.S. 1027, 90 S.Ct. 574, 24 L.Ed.2d 523, citing <em>Sherman </em>and <em>Sor-rells.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">The testimony of several special agents, called by the government, tended to establish the following version: On Sunday, April 1, 1973 at 3 p. m., Special Agent Casteel and Joseph Hale, a paid informer, went to the trailer where Smith lived. This was at Carbondale, Illinois, and Smith was a student at Southern Illinois University. Hale introduced Casteel to Smith and asked if Cronson, Smith\u2019s roommate, had made arrangements for the purchase of either cocaine or MDA. Smith said Cronson wasn\u2019t there, but Smith had contacted a source of supply and Smith would handle the transaction. Smith said the purchase would probably take place later that day, and asked Casteel where he Vould be. Casteel gave him his room number at a motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">At 5 p. m. that day, Smith came to the room. Casteel and Hale were there, with Special Agent Bushendorf secreted in the bathroom. Smith told Casteel he could buy an ounce of cocaine for $1,050 or an ounce of MDA for $375. Casteel agreed to buy the MDA and asked for a small sample of the cocaine to see whether he wanted to buy a quantity later. Smith then telephoned someone he called Roger, informed him of the order, and said he would be over in a few minutes. Smith left, returned about an hour later and delivered the MDA, for which payment was made. He asked to see Casteel\u2019s and Hale\u2019s wallets to see if they were police. After that he turned over a small sample of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">Cross-examination of Special Agent Casteel developed testimony that Special Agent Jovonovich had made contacts with Smith\u2019s roommate before April 1. Casteel had not met Smith before April 1. He had contact with him three or four times after April 1, and attempted to make additional purchases. On those occasions, Smith told Casteel his source had sold all he had. Smith was not arrested until May 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">Cross-examination of Special Agent Bushendorf brought out that he was in charge of the investigation in Carbon-dale which began during the latter part of March, 1973 and continued to May 17. There were several agents in the unit. Hale had been a useful informer in Indiana and was referred by another agent to Bushendorf. Hale came to Carbon-dale and was instructed to make himself acquainted with the scene there and see what he could find out about the peddling of drugs. Bushendorf testified that, including the visit April 1, agents or Hale had visited the Smith trailer three times at the most.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">Hale and Jovonovich did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">Smith testified that he met two men named Joe (who turned out to be Hale and Jovonovich) on Sunday, two weeks before the sale. They had met Cronson before and had been asking how they could buy large quantities of drugs. He described meeting with Hale and either Jovonovich or Casteel on five occasions before the day on which he made the sale. They repeatedly spoke \u201cvery strongly about how they wanted to make a fast possession\u201d of huge amounts of drugs so they could make money. \u201cThey were asking Bill, Chris, and myself if we could get them for them, and if we couldn\u2019t, who could?\u201d He described the attitude of the students to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>ward the agents as \u201crather cold,\u201d and was surprised the agents kept coming back. Except for deception as to identity, there was no testimony of any misrepresentation by the agents or the informer. Smith testified to statements that were, on their face, threats to \u201cbreak into our trailer and take our belongings,\u201d but conceded these things were said in a joking manner. The only pressure claimed, in substance, was that the requests were repeated a number of times before the sale. There was no play upon sympathy as in <em>Sherman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Supporting the claim of repetitions of requests, Smith testified that five meetings took place in two weeks before the sale. He said the first meeting definitely took place after March 25 and could have been March 31. He placed the sale in mid-April. His testimony concerning the meetings was corroborated by several defense witnesses, who also said the sale occurred in mid-April. There is documentary proof, however, that the MDA and cocaine delivered to Casteel were received from him by mail at the laboratory in Chicago April 3. This strongly corroborates the agents\u2019 testimony that the sale was April 1. The jury could well have believed that the defense witnesses were confused as to the sequence of events; that Hale and Jovonovich met Cronson on one occasion and Smith on another late in March; that there were' no other meetings before April 1; and that many of the conversations took place after the April 1 sale. Under this version the numerous repetitions of the request, accomplishing a change from refusal to acquiescence by the defendant, as present in <em>Sherman, </em>were lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">Accordingly we conclude that the entrapment issue was, at best for Smith, a jury question, and the defense was not established as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1254-7\">SWYGERT, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ahd-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">The evidence relating to the conduct of federal narcotics agents in entrapping a naive young man and inducing him to sell illegal drugs is so overwhelming that his conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">According to my readings of the record the Government prosecutor at trial inadvertently or otherwise constructed a red herring having to do with calendar dates relative to the operative facts so as to obfuscate the real issue of entrapment. Then on appeal, in his brief and at oral argument, he invited us to validate his approach. Unfortunately, the majority upholds the conviction on the ground there was sufficient conflict in the evidence so as to preclude us from considering the entrapment issue. But the only major conflict concerned the dates when the crucial events took place; there seems to be little dispute about their occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-11\">The evidence must be narrated in detail to demonstrate that the defendant was not predisposed to sell drugs and only through the deliberate efforts of the agents was he induced to commit the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">Stephen R. Smith, now twenty-two years old, lives in Long Grove, Illinois with his parents and eight brothers and sisters. In March and April 1973, Stephen was in his fourth year of studies at Southern Illinois University at Carbon-dale, Illinois. For three years he was a pre-med student, but then switched to civil engineering. During each of the summer recesses he worked at various jobs as a mechanic, a carpenter, and a painter, using his earnings to help finance his schooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">Christopher Cronson and William Clayton graduated with Stephen Smith at Adlai Stevenson High School in Prairie-view, Illinois. The three matriculated at Southern Illinois University. Early in 1973, the boys rented a trailer about a mile and a half from the campus, where they lived while attending the university-</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-14\">The first quarter of the 1973 school year ended about March 12, 1973. Some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>time thereafter, on a Saturday morning, most likely March 17,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> undercover agent Joseph Jovonovich and \u201cinformant\u201d Joseph Hale<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> picked up Christopher Cron-son in their car on a highway leading from Carbondale to Edgewood Mobile Estates where the trailer occupied by Cronson, Clayton, and Smith was located. Cronson had stayed overnight at the University in Carbondale. After introducing themselves as Joe Hale and Indiana Joe, the two asked Cronson if he could locate some drugs, mescaline or cocaine, for them. Cronson said he did not have any drugs, but did agree to give them a marijuana cigarette in return for a ride home. At the trailer Cronson was reminded by \u201cIndiana Joe\u201d of his promise; thereupon Cronson produced a marijuana cigarette. The two smoked the \u201creefer\u201d with William Clayton who had been awakened at their arrival with Cronson. Hale and Jovonovich said they were \u201cnew in town\u201d and inquired generally about the Southern Illinois University. Clayton testified, \u201cThey asked repeatedly if me or Chris [Cronson] could obtain drugs for them.\u201d After approximately a half-hour Hale and Jovonovich left the trailer and drove Cronson back to the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Late in the afternoon of the following day (Sunday) Hale and Jovonovich returned uninvited to the trailer. (Cron-son testified, \u201cWe are talking roughly about the Sunday two weeks before the sale.\u201d) It was during the supper hour and all three of the boys, Cronson, Clayton, and Smith were there. Hale and Jovonovich began talking to Clayton and Cronson about how to deal in marijuana and then asked the boys again, \u201cCan you get any drugs for us?\u201d Clayton testified, \u201cMostly they were asking for pounds of LSD and cocaine and amphetamines.\u201d Hale and Jovonovich asked what the possibilities were of the boys getting them the drugs. Smith testified that when Hale asked whether the three young men could get some cocaine for him, \u201c[w]e more or less ignored the conversation because we did not ever think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>in terms like that.\u201d Hale and Jovono-vich stayed at the trailer for about thirty to forty-five minutes and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">The following Wednesday Hale and Jovonovich were waiting outside the trailer about 5:30 in the afternoon when Cronson and Smith returned from Car-bondale where Smith had taken his turntable to be repaired. (Cronson testified, \u201cThis Wednesday that we are talking about was approximately a week and a half before the sale.\u201d) Hale and Jovono-vich talked to Smith and Cronson as to whether the boys could get some drugs. Hale told the boys, according to Smith\u2019s testimony, that he wanted to buy \u201ca lot of hard chemicals to take back to Indiana to sell them so he could make more money to buy a large amount of hashish and he said that he came to Carbondale to get it.\u201d Cronson testified: \u201cThey asked us if we could get them some drugs and, in general, just tried to make some friendship with us to make a sale with them. The agents were not invited over to our trailer that Wednesday. We never invited them back.\u201d After eating supper with the boys, Hale and Jovono-vich left the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">The following Saturday around dinnertime undercover agent Steven W. Cas-teel accompanied Hale and Jovonovich to the trailer where they met Cronson, Clayton, and Smith. Casteel after being introduced told the boys that his wife had died and that he was back in school, having attended Southern Illinois University before. He said he was starting all over again, wanted to make some friends, and would like to purchase some drugs. Cocaine and LSD were mentioned. Smith testified that the agents \u201ccame on very strongly about how they wanted to make a fast possession and get it because large drugs really could be moved during a strong limit of time.\u201d Smith also testified that he told them that if they wanted to get any drugs the only place that he could think of would be \u201csome low-rent park or on the street or at the dormitories.\u201d That Saturday evening young Smith and his girlfriend, Sandra Schenck, were in Merlin\u2019s bar located at the edge of Carbondale. Hale and Casteel were also there. Smith testified, \u201cWe were basically ignoring them, pretending they were not there, because we did not want to have anything to do with them. I pointed out to Sandy who they were.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cronson was also in the bar on the same evening. He testified: \u201cThey [the agents] asked me if I could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>get them any cocaine. I was just leaving when they were going in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">The next contact Smith had with the agents took place on Wednesday following the encounter at Merlin\u2019s bar. During the early evening, while all three boys were at the trailer and in the process of preparing their suppers, Hale and Jovonovich arrived uninvited. Clayton testified that this meeting was prior to the date of the sale. Clayton further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-6\">We were watching television, myself and my roommate Chris Cronson and one of my neighbors, Gary Wagner. They came in and sat down. The same type of questions were asked, and most of the time I\u2019d have to ignore them or walk away, because they\u2019d just keep, you know, consistently asking questions and I\u2019d ignore them most of the time. And they stayed for about half an hour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlE\">Cronson testified about the Wednesday meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-7\">The next time that I met with them was on a Wednesday, and at that time a neighbor was over, Gary Wagner, and he had come down to our trailer to borrow a kitchen utensil, and he was there, and there was a show \u2014 we were watching this show and during that time Joe Hale and that man came in, knocked on the door and came in and sat down, and we smoked a marijuana cigarette, and they asked us if we could locate any drugs for them. [T]he main thing that I remember is that they were interested in cocaine and LSD .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-24\">Smith\u2019s version of that Wednesday meeting is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-25\">[I]t was suppertime, sir, we were cooking . . . . Bill Clayton, Chris Cronson, Gary Wagner, and myself were present in the trailer at that time . . . . Well, sir, I\u2019m sure Joe Hale was there \u2014 I\u2019m positive Joe Hale was there, and I don\u2019t perfectly recollect that Joe Jovonovich was there, but if Gary says that Joe and Joe were introduced to him, whenever the two came we always made a joke about Joe and Joe because it\u2019s a common name, and Gary had the names first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1257-28\">Gary Wagner, a neighbor of the boys and a fellow student had come over to the trailer that Wednesday evening to borrow a kitchen utensil. Gary Wagner was called as a defense witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Significantly, the Government did not directly contradict the foregoing testimony of Clayton, Cronson, Smith or Wagner. The prosecutor could have called Hale and Jovonovich in rebuttal if he thought their testimony would contradict the defense witnesses as both were present during the trial but neither of them testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">The Saturday following the Wednesday meeting Casteel and Hale again visited the trailer. Smith testified about this meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-5\">Q All right, when did you next see any of these agents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-6\">A It must have been the next Saturday, the Saturday following that Wednesday, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-7\">Q And where was that at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-8\">A That was in my trailer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-9\">Q And what agents came to your trailer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-10\">A Steven Casteel and Joe Hale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-25\">Q And who was home with you at the trailer that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-26\">A I was there at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-27\">Q Incidentally, let me just ask you this; did you at any time ever invite these persons to the trailer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-28\">A No sir, or anybody else. We were kind of surprised when they came over as much as they did, because we weren\u2019t exactly warm when they did come over; we were rather cold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-29\">Q Well, when they came, did they barge right in, or did they just walk right in or how were they-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-30\">A Wel{ when they first started coming over, I think they knocked, and we would say, \u201cwell, come on in\u201d, because we wouldn\u2019t say no to them. People that visited, we would say, \u201ccome on in.\u201d But, I think, toward the latter meeting with them, they just simply knocked and then walked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>in. Because there was always somebody at home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-5\">Q They didn\u2019t necessarily wait for somebody to tell them, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-6\">A Not necessarily, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-7\">Q What were you doing in the trailer on this day that they came in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-8\">A I was recopying my chemistry notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-9\">Q And tell us what happened in the trailer that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-10\">A Well, they came in and they began approaching me, \u201cCould you get me some drugs\u201d and I told them that I\u2019d rather not; you know, if you want to get drugs, I\u2019d prefer if you went to somebody else, and I don\u2019t want to be bothered with it, and they egged me on a little more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-11\">Q What do you mean, \u201cegged you on\u201d? Proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-12\">A Well they egged me on a little bit more and they said, \u201cbecause we got to make a deal right away, right now\u201d, and they were really pressing for time, it seemed. So, I just told them, I didn\u2019t absolutely agree that I would do it, I\u2019d leave the trailer to make a phone call, because we didn\u2019t have a phone in our trailer, and I took the keys to his auto and went down there and used the phone and I ran back and I said, \u201cI can\u2019t get hold of Chris.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-13\">Q You went to somebody else\u2019s trailer in order to use the telephone to try and get Chris?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-15\">Q Did you know whether or not Chris had a deal going with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-16\">A No, because Chris would not deal with them. Because he told me he didn\u2019t want to deal with them, and he wished they\u2019d leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-17\">The next day, Sunday, about 3:00 P.M. Casteel and Hale again visited the trailer. Smith was there alone preparing to study. There had been no prior arrangement for their visit. Smith testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-18\">Mr. Hale and Mr. Casteel walked in, and we exchanged greetings, and they said, \u201cWell, you know, can you get us any drugs?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d They said, \u201cWe\u2019re not particular; we\u2019ll take any quantity of any kind of drugs you can get.\u201d So, in the meantime, they sort of sat and, you know, so, I said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll see what I can do . . . . Mr. Casteel told me, you know, that stuff will only take you half an hour. You know, you can do it in half an hour.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do it in half an hour.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t want to hear it. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-20\">I said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll see what I can do for you,\u201d and the following conversation we had if I would see any of Chris\u2019s friends. I said, \u201cYes, I do; we have the same friends approximately.\u201d And they said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just go over to his house and see what you can get for us?\u201d And, so I said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d And they left, and I changed my clothes, and I left about, oh, I\u2019d say about, oh, I\u2019d say about fifteen minutes after they left. And, I went to this guy\u2019s [Roger] house. . . . When I got to Roger\u2019s house, I said, see, we had told Roger about these people coming over to our trailer, and we\u2019d been basically ignoring them, and he knew all about it, and I said, \u201cWell, I decided I\u2019d go get some,\u201d and after talking with him and he knew who I\u2019d give it to, he said, \u201cWell, I can make a couple of phone calls.\u201d So I sat down and Roger made, I don\u2019t know, he could have made two or three phone calls, and after he got through with the phone calls, and he had talked to a buddy, and that he has one ounce of cocaine and one ounce of MDA. And I said, \u201cWell, tell him we\u2019ll need both. That\u2019s good for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-22\">About an hour later Smith drove to the hotel where Hale and Casteel told Smith he should meet them. Casteel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJf\">Approximately five o\u2019clock in the afternoon that same day. My supervisor, special agent Stephen Bushendorf, Mr. Hale and myself were seated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Room 154, waiting for his [Smith] knock at the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-4\">Q What happened after the knock on the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-5\">A The knock took us somewhat by surprise; Agent Bushendorf then proceeded to the bathroom section of the motel room where he hid for the next few minutes. And at that time I opened the door and Mr. Smith entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-6\">Q So at this time present in the room were Mr. Smith, agent Bushen-dorf, did you say, yourself, and your confidential informer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-7\">A Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-8\">Q What happened, did you admit the defendant to the room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-9\">A He came in the room, and at that time stated that he had been able to make the arrangements, that I could purchase an ounce of cocaine for $1,050 or an ounce of MDA for $375, and he asked me what I wished to do. At that time I told him I would purchase the ounce of MDA and would like a small sample of the cocaine in order to decide if it was a sufficient quantity of strength for me to make an additional purchase from him at a later date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-10\">Q And, did you have any further conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-11\">A Yes, sir; at that time Mr. Smith asked if he could use my phone and he placed a local call to a subject that he called Roger, and he told Roger, first of all, that I had taken the ounce of MDA and a sample of coke, and asked if everything would be all right. Apparently the subject on the other end said yes, and he said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll be over and get it in a few minutes,\u201d then he discontinued the conversation. He then turned to me and said he would be back in approximately an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-12\">Q Did you hear him use the word over the phone, MDA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-13\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-14\">Q And cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-15\">A Excuse me sir, he may have said coke, instead of cocaine. It\u2019s used as a brief term for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-16\">Q After the telephone conversation, what did the defendant do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-17\">A He then exited the room, out of my sight. We didn\u2019t have any other conversation with him until later on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq7G\">Smith\u2019s version of the events on Sunday continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1260-18\">I told them [the agents] my connection [actually Roger\u2019s connection, one Scott] did have access to one ounce of MDA, and cocaine . they said, \u201cO.K., we\u2019ve got enough money for the cocaine . \u201d I told them, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll be back in about an hour.\u201d And they said, \u201cO.K.\u201d Mr. Casteel told me that he just wanted a sample of the cocaine Then I left, and I ran out back around back to my car, and I drove back over to Roger\u2019s house. All right, after seeing as though Roger had \u2014 in his conversation with Scott, had dipped around to where Scott would be at that time, so he got to the restaurant to a party, picked up Scott, and then we drove to Scott\u2019s house and picked up a sample of cocaine, which he wrapped in some waxed paper and gave it to me, and I held it cupped in my hand. And then from Scott\u2019s house we drove approximately four miles or three miles north on old Route 13 to a farmhouse where he picked up one ounce of MDA. Then we went \u2014 he wanted to make his trip worthwhile, so we stopped at Save-Mart and picked up a gallon of paint for what purposes I have no, idea, and then drove back, dropped Scott out at the party and Scott said, you know, told Roger that he could give him the money for the MDA later, that it wasn\u2019t important that he have it then. Scott told that to Roger, and while we were driving Scott and Roger, you know, were asking me questions about the two people I was about to deal with, how well did I know them, I said, \u201cWell I just met them a couple of weeks ago through Chris.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>And they were asking me, like, \u201cDid they seem to you like they were real clean people, you know?\u201d and they asked me whether, and we sort of agreed that I should check their wallets to make sure there were no agents in there before I gave them the drugs. So I agreed. I said, \u201cO.K., I\u2019ll do that\u201d, just, you know, for personal safeness, so then we drove back to the Ramada Inn and parked on the east side of the Ramada Restaurant. I ran from the car and I had the MDA in my pocket here and I had the cocaine in my fingers, just like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">After Casteel handed the defendant $375 for the purchase, Smith testified he told the agents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-6\">All right, you got the sample of cocaine, if you want any more cocaine go to somebody else. Now you know where to get it, if you want it you have to go to Chris or Bill, and their sellers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Smith returned to Roger Laut\u2019s home where Smith gave Laut the $375. He kept none for himself. He intended to make no profit for himself. He was arrested May 17, 1973. Except for the instant sale, he has never bought, sold, or used MDA, cocaine or any other illicit drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">In the presentation of its case, prior to the testimony of Smith, Cronson, Clayton, Wagner and Schenck the Government had called Steven Casteel as one of its witnesses. He testified he had been a county deputy sheriff prior to his employment in April 1972 by the Bureau of Narcotics. He was assigned to the investigation at Carbondale in February 1973 along with four or five other agents. His testimony continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-9\">Q Prior to your meeting Stephen Smith on April 1st, after you had made contact with Stephen Smith, others of the unit and yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-10\">A Other members of the unit had made contacts with his roommate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-11\">Q Who, that is, what members of the unit had made contact with Mr. Smith prior to that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-12\">A Special Agent Jovonovich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-13\">Q What is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-14\">A Jovonovich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-15\">Q Jovonovich \u2014 Joseph Jovonovich?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-16\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-17\">Q And who else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-18\">A I believe that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-19\">Q Had you met Chris Cronson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-20\">A I may have possible met Mr. Cronson the day before April 1st. In a bar I met several individuals; I possibly did meet Mr. Cronson then, and so I would have had contact with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-21\">Q Did you have previous contact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-22\">A No, I don\u2019t recall ever meeting Mr. Smith earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-23\">Q You described Joseph Jovonovich as a Special Agent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-24\">A Yes, sir, he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-25\">Q Do you know whether or not any other agents had met Mr. Smith prior to the day that you met him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-26\">A Not to my knowledge, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-27\">Q Well, do you know how it was that Mr. Smith was ever first introduced to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-28\">A I can only relate certain information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-29\">Q Well, insofar as the leading question, that was your first contact with Mr. Smith, in the trailer, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-30\">A Yes, sir, that was my initial'contact with him, as far as I can recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-31\">Q Following that day, did you have contact with Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-32\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-33\">Q Approximately how many occasions prior to the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-34\">A I would say approximately three or four. At the time I was introduced to him at the trailer following \u2014 during the investigation, I believe I also met Mr. Smith one time downtown; he drove by in his car, and we engaged in conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-35\">Q When you met with Mr. Smith, following the date in question, what was the purpose of your meeting? Why did you go to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>A I was attempting to make an additional drug purchase; for example, cocaine, which he stated he would sell to me the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-4\">Q And did Mr. Smith engage in any further sales?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-5\">A No, sir. He stated that his only source of supply had sold all that he had at that time, and it would be a while yet before he would be able to offer any more illicit drugs for sale to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-6\">Q Did Mr. Smith at any time tell you that he did not want to deal in drugs, or become involved in the sale of drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-7\">MR. HESS: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to this question; it calls for hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-8\">THE COURT: Sustained. Proceed. MR. LAVELLE: Your Honor, the question involved is a direct response to the conversation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-9\">THE COURT: Go on to the next question. You are just stalling around. You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-10\">Q In any conversations with you, during the times that you met Mr. Smith, following the date in question, did Mr. Smith tell you that he did not want to deal with drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-17\">A I don\u2019t recall hearing him say. Q Do you recall meeting Mr. Smith on Mother\u2019s Day, in town, on Sunday? While he was on the telephone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-18\">MR. HESS: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to further object to the line of questioning, as I am unable to, having followed it for some time, to determine what materiality any visit on Mother\u2019s Day would have to the offense charged on April 1st.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-19\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-20\">MR. LAVELLE: I might suggest a basis for my line of inquiry, Your Honor. The defendant was \u2014 for a period of time following the sale, there were further attempts made to my client to induce him to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-21\">THE COURT: Now, I\u2019m going to sustain the objection. Proceed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-22\">Stephen Bushendorf an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration conducted a surveillance by Agent Casteel and informant Hale at the trailer in Edgewood Mobile Estates in the afternoon of Sunday, April 1. Later he followed them to the Ramada Inn where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>Casteel, Hale, another agent and he \u201cdiscussed the case.\u201d Bushendorf testified that he had given Hale, who held a full-time job in an Indiana steel mill, the sum of $300 for six or seven days part-time work in Carbondale. He further testified that he used \u201cthe measure of [Hale\u2019s] success\u201d for giving him this money, although Hale would have received per diem allowance in any event.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bushendorf indicated that during the period of Hale\u2019s activities in Carbondale, March 15 to May 17, he was never assigned to any specific case, that written records were not kept oh all of Hale\u2019s activities, but that he believed that there was a written record of the Smith case. He stated that members of his unit did visit the Smith trailer, but the total number of visits was no more than three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Although all of the young men involved in this case insisted that the events leading up to the sale by Smith happened at least in part after April 1, a careful, intense reading of the record makes a number of things clear. There was only one sale. The sale occurred on April 1. The events leading up to the sale are not in dispute. Obviously the boys were wrong as to the actual calendar dates of the events, but this does not destroy their credibility as witnesses with regard to the events which happened before the sale took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-6\">The Government\u2019s brief on appeal states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-7\">Hale and Jovonovich first visited the trailer of the defendant on Saturday, March 31,1973, and . . . they did not meet Stephen Smith on that day. There is substantial evidence to show that the defendant sold the drug to Agent Casteel on April 1, 1973, the following day, and that April 1, 1973, was the first time the defendant met any agents or informants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">That statement is belied by the record. The statement makes no sense; it flies in the face of logic when the totality of the evidence is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">Although I am strongly inclined to believe the facts point to a finding of entrapment as a matter of law, I refrain from so arguing because of the obvious confusion by Cronson, Clayton, and Smith over the calendar dates of the events surrounding the sale. I believe, rather, that the conviction should be set aside and the case remanded for a new trial. I shall deal with this ultimate conclusion on my part at the end of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">In my view the facts here are even stronger than those in Sherman v. United States, 365 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1957), a case holding that there had been entrapment as a matter of law. The defendant in his brief on appeal has compared the facts of the two cases with each other, setting forth his analysis. I adopt that comparison as my own.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-15\">1. In Sherman v. U. S. there was a series of sales. In this case there was a single transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-16\">2. In Sherman v. U. S. there was no evidence that the defendant was in the narcotics trade. Likewise, here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-17\">3. In Sherman v. U. S. there was no significant evidence that the defendant made a profit on any of the sales. In this case there is absolutely no evidence that the defendant made a profit on the singular transaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-18\">4. With respect to a possible \u201cready complaisance\u201d or predisposition to accede to the informer\u2019s requests for the illicit narcotics, in Sherman v. U. S. the defendant had a record of past convictions for both possession and selling narcotics, while in the present case there is no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>dence of past charges or convictions of any kind. Indeed, the defendant\u2019s history in the present case appears to be exemplary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-4\">5. In Sherman v. U. S. the informer testified but the defendant did not testify. In the present case the defendant did testify, but the government did not call as witnesses the informer, Joe Hale, or the government agent, Joe Jovono-vich, who were the principals in the pre-sale meetings with the defendant wherein the entrapment was engendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-5\">6. In Sherman v. U. S. the informer was not paid for ensnaring the defendant. In the present case the informer, Joe Hale, was paid a bounty on a contingent fee basis for entrapping the defendant which is a practice that is subject to criticism and in itself the basis for reversal of a conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">Aside from the obvious confusion of the three boys about the calendar dates, the unequivocal facts in the present case establish entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\">The law does not permit those entrusted with its enforcement to create situations leading to criminal conduct so as to ensnare a person who, though weak, does not possess a predisposition to crime. Judges must ever be alert to see that the law is not perverted. If they blink at such happenings our confidence in justice would be sorely undermined.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I am reminded of Holmes\u2019 characterization of the concept of the law in the form of a woman at the side of the road.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By what has happened here her face is distorted by shame; her eyes blinded by tears. Here we have a young, twenty-two year old youth, his college career brought to naught, his life ruined because of the machinations of overeager government agents and informers who wanted to \u201cmake\u201d criminal cases rather than discover pre-existing illegal activity-</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">After much agony, I have concluded, however, that the case does not call for an outright reversal. Because of the conflict over dates, I think the wiser course is to reverse and remand for a new trial. For that approach I find support in United States v. Bueno, 447 F.2d 903 (5th Cir. 1970). There the Fifth Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-13\">There are two controlling questions on the appeal of this narcotics conviction. The first is whether there is entrapment as a matter of law when a government informer furnishes the narcotics to the defendant for sale to a government agent. The second is whether the government has the duty of coming forward with contrary evidence when the defendant testifies to uncontradicted facts that would constitute entrapment as a matter of law, and there is no evidence to show that his testimony is untrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-14\">Holding that the uncontradicted facts testified to by defendant constitute a good defense on the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>entrapment, and that the government failed to carry the burden of going forward with contradictory evidence, we have no alternative but to reverse this conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-5\">The case has three principal participants \u2014 the Defendant, the Informer, and the Government Agent. As between the Government Agent and the Defendant, ' the Agent\u2019s testimony clearly supports the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-7\">The question then comes as to whether the government can rest on the challenge to the credibility of the Defendant, or whether it must come forward with some contradictory evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-8\">The government\u2019s case cannot rest on the mere fact that he entered into the Informer\u2019s plan willingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-9\">Neither party produced the Informer. If the Informer\u2019s testimony would tend to disprove the Defendant\u2019s story, it was up to the government to produce him. The Defendant having testified to facts which establish a defense as a matter of law, the government has the duty to come forward with contrary proof, if it is to carry its ultimate burden of proving guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. United States v. Groessel, 440 F.2d 602 (5th Cir. 1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-10\">Thus, we hold that the conviction on this record must be <em>reversed and the case remanded for retrial. </em>If the government cannot come forward with evidence that contradicts Defendant\u2019s testimony, then he is entitled to discharge, as a matter of law. If the government produces evidence sufficient to raise a jury question, then the case should be submitted with proper instructions in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">The defense testimony having established a prima facie case of entrapment, the Government had the duty to produce contrary proof if its obligation to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was to be discharged. The Government called neither Hale nor Jovonovich, despite their presence, to contradict the defense witnesses relating to the pre-sale activities and to help establish the true time sequences. Nor did it produce any records or reports of those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">It relied solely on the witnesses who were acquainted with the events on the day of the sale. That was not enough under the circumstances. The Government had the duty to bring out all the facts. We hardly need to be reminded again of the statement in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-14\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">To prevent a strong possibility of manifest injustice to the defendant I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">. The conflict in the testimony centers on when the operative events occurred. Although the defendant and another witness for him said that the sale of the drugs to the federal agents happened after April 1, 1973, they were obviously wrong. The record shows, nearly conclusively, that the sale occurred Sunday, April 1. The Government witnesses were positive about the date. Their testimony was corroborated by the fact that purchased substances were received by a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs forensic chemist, Marc D.

The \u201cmeasure of his success\u201d, as testified by a Government witness was the basis of this overall payment. Between six and eight people were arrested as the result of his activity. Hale worked in an Indiana steel mill plant and was known to Cronson, Clayton and Smith as \u201cIndiana Joe.\u201d Prior to his Carbondale activity, he had been an informer for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Indiana, where he had \u201cmade a great many cases,\u201d according to the Government\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">.

LAVELLE: You\u2019re right, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1257-41\">Q Can you tell us, to the best of your ability the time that you met the agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>with respect to the sale, was it before or after the sale?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-12\">A It was before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-13\">Q And how many weeks before the sale?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-14\">A I don\u2019t know exactly. I\u2019d say close to a week or so. As I recall now it was a week before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-15\">Q Do you recall the day of the week this was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-16\">A It was early spring quarter, which would have made it April, early, which would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-17\">Q The day of the week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-18\">A The day of the week? No, I can\u2019t. Q Was it a week day, or a weekend? A It was a week day, because I had come to borrow a tape measure for dinner and we were all watching a show that was only on one day a week, on Wednesday, and since we were making a big meal, it. had to be in the middle of the week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-19\">Q Well, how many agents did you meet that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-20\">A I met two agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-21\">Q Were you first introduced to those agents that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-22\">A That was the first time I had ever seen them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-23\">Q Do you know what names you were introduced\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-24\">A I was introduced to them as them being Joe and Joe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">Q Do you now know the names of those agents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-32\">A Uh\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-33\">Q Do you see any of those agents present here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-34\">A No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-35\">Q Have you seen any of those agents since you\u2019ve been waiting around outside the courtroom here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-36\">A Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-37\">Q Would you tell us what occurred in the trailer at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-38\">A Well, I was sitting in the trailer when these two agents knocked on the door. And they walked in, and there was an exchange of hellos between Chris and Steve and then 1 was introduced to them as being Joe and Joe, and then the conversation led on where they were asking, you know, if there was any drugs for sale, and then Joe, the red-headed Joe, asked me if I knew where there was any drugs, and he asked me once again, he says, yes, like a pound of acid and stuff like that, and my remark was to him, you know, that he was crazy, and after that the talk about drugs was more or less, you know, dropped off, and we began watching television and marijuana was smoked by all including Steve, including myself.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1262-11\">. It can be argued that Casteel\u2019s testimony that he could not recall meeting Smith prior to April 1 and the defendant\u2019s evidence that there were three previous occasions, Saturday [April 24], Wednesday [April 27], and Saturday [April 31], when Casteel had visited the trailer created a sufficient conflict in the evidence so as to preclude us from critically looking at the entrapment issue as a matter of law. I do not think this argument is valid when the entire record is considered or even when Casteel\u2019s testimony alone is looked at carefully. For example, a close reading of the following questions and answers would indicate that Casteel and Smith met only once after the April 1 sale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-12\">Q <em>Following that day, </em>did you have contact with Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-13\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-14\">Q Approximately how many occasions <em>prior to the arrest?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-15\"><em>A I would say approximately three or four. </em>At the time I was introduced to him at the trailer following \u2014 during the investigation, <em>I believe I also met </em>Mr. Smith one time downtown; he drove by in his car, and we engaged in conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-v\">Q When you met with Mr. Smith, following <em>the date in question, </em>what was the purpose of your meeting? Why did you go to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-24\">A <em>I was attempting to make an additional drug purchase; </em>for example, cocaine, which he stated he would sell to me the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-25\">Q And did Mr. Smith engage in any further sales?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1262-26\">A No, sir. He stated that his only source of supply had sold all that he had at that time, and it would be a while yet before he would be able to offer <em>any more illicit </em>drugs for sale to me. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1262-27\">At the very least Casteel\u2019s testimony as to the number and dates of the occasions when he had contact with the defendant is ambiguous and subject to different inferences. At this point I cannot help but observe that the record indicates to me that the case was loosely tried, by counsel for both the Government and the defense. Some of the judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings are also difficult to understand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">. It is interesting to note the language actually used by Bushendorf to describe the activities for which Hale was paid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1263-11\">Q And what was that phase of his work upon which his payment would be based?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">A Well, as I testified before, it would be based upon the people to whom he introduced us and the places where he was present with the <em>entrapment </em>of other people . . . .

United States, 311 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1962), a conviction was reversed because of a contingent fee arrangement aimed at particular individuals. The court stressed that no evidence was introduced to show either that the Government had reason to suspect these individuals of wrongdoing or that the informant had carefully been instructed on the rules against entrapment. I suggest this approach as an independent ground for reversal and a remand for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1264-9\">.
