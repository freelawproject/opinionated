Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 32 Tax Ct.Memo. 825 (1973).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-14\">. There is one factual error reflected in the Tax Court opinion which Visador argues led to the erroneous conclusions of that court. The Tax Court indicated that at the time of the transaction, 1961, Dwight and Willis Coff-man, the two principals here, were employees of Coffman Stair Company, which was controlled by their father and uncle. In fact, the father had died in 1958. This error was not material to the Tax Court\u2019s decision and we are unable to agree that it has any significance in the disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
