Lambert owned and operated the Camelot Inn, a cafe in Fall River, Massachusetts. On October 6, 1972, at the Inn he shot and killed one Thomas F. McCabe. As a result of this incident, described more fully in the newspaper accounts in notes 1-4 <em>infra, </em>Lambert was charged as an accessory after the fact to murder, and later with murder itself. The charge was reduced to manslaughter, however, at a bindover hearing. Lambert was tried in the Massachusetts Superior Court for Bristol County and was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-27\">During the period before trial the defendant, the Providence Journal Company, published four articles concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Lambert dated October 8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, October 13,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and December 28, 1972<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and February 18, 1973,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which it distributed in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Alleging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>articles were defamatory,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lambert sued the Journal in the District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The Journal filed a motion for summary judgment together with supporting affidavits, Lambert\u2019s deposition, and a memorandum of law. Lambert filed an objection to the motion, together with supporting affidavits, depositions, and a memorandum of law. The court granted the motion on the alternative grounds that the allegedly libellous material was not defamatory since the innuendo pleaded by Lambert was unwarranted, and that even if the material were actionable Lambert failed to demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of fact as to the Journal\u2019s actual malice under the standard established in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 685 (1964). Lambert appeals. We find it unnecessary to reach the court\u2019s second ground of decision, as we agree that none of the articles was reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Lambert cannot object to the articles insofar as they report, admittedly truthfully, that he was <em>charged </em>with murder. \u201cThe publication of the fact that one has been arrested, and upon what accusation, is not actionable, if true. . . But if to this fact there is added, by way of comment, words which amount to an accusation that the charge is true, or comment which assumes the guilt of the person arrested, by headlines or otherwise, the mere fact that the person was arrested upon the charge stated is no justification for words imputing guilt.\u201d Commercial Pub. Co. v. Smith, 149 F. 704, 706 (6th Cir. 1907); Thompson v. Globe Newspaper Co., 279 Mass. 176, 188, 181 N.E. 249 (1932). Lambert claims that the articles\u2019 characterization of McCabe as a murder victim and the incident itself as a murder with that term\u2019s denotation of illegality, instead of the neutral \u201cshooting death,\u201d \u201chomicide,\u201d or \u201ckilling,\u201d constituted such editorial comment imputing guilt. In support of his construction Lambert submitted the depositions of three community residents who testified that such had been their \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cplain,\u201d and \u201cordinary\u201d understanding of the articles in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">It is for the court to decide whether a statement can be defamatory in character. Andoscia v. Coady, 99 R.I. 731, 735, 210 A.2d 581, 584 (1965); Sharratt v. Housing Innovations, Inc., 1974 Mass.Adv.Sh. 575, 577-578, 310 N.E.2d 343, 345.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Reading the articles in their entirety, Bray v. Providence Journal Co., 101 R.I. 111, 116, 220 A.2d 531, 534, W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 111 at 747-48 (4th ed. 1971), and construing their language naturally, Reid v. Providence Journal Co., 20 R.I. 120, 122, 37 A. 637 (1897); Lyman v. New England Pub. Co., 286 Mass. 258, 261, 190 N.E. 542, 543 (1934), we are constrained to agree with the district court that none was reasonably capable of conveying the defamatory meaning Lambert alleges. Bray v. Providence Journal Co., <em>supra; </em>Sharratt v. Housing Innovations, Inc., <em>supra </em>at 578, 310 N.E.2d at 345. Even if the use of the term \u201cmurder\u201d implied that the killing was unlawful, each article unequivocally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>states that Lambert has \u201cdenied\u201d the murder charge or \u201cpleaded innocent,\u201d or reports the progress of the case in such a way as to make clear that no determination of his involvement has been made. Nothing in them suggests that the Journal has concluded that Lambert is the guilty party even if it has decided that there was a murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the term \u201cmurder\u201d is used interchangeably throughout with the terms \u201cfatal shooting,\u201d \u201cshooting death,\u201d and \u201chomicide,\u201d often in the same or adjacent sentences. In this context the term clearly is chosen solely for variety\u2019s sake and merely echoes the report of the charges levelled against Lambert without implying their truthfulness. It is obviously to be understood as \u201calleged murder.\u201d In these routine news articles we think it would require more forceful language than this to justify Lambert\u2019s reading.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The innuendo cannot be used to enlarge the natural meaning of the words actually used. Ogrodnick v. Providence Journal Co., 93 R.I. 316, 317, 175 A.2d 289, 291 (1961); Colby Haberdashers, Inc. v. Broadstreet Co., 267 Mass. 166, 170, 166 N.E. 550, 551 (1929). None of these articles can be construed to impute guilt without such an enlargement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Finding the meaning of the articles clear, we see no basis on which the depositions of witnesses could be held competent as to their defamatory capacities. Snell v. Snow, 54 Mass. (13 Metc.) 278 (1847); Duncan v. Pearson, 135 F.2d 146 (4th Cir. 1943). To the ordinary reasons advanced for excluding such testimony may be added the difficulty, evidenced by the depositions here, of distinguishing between \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201ckilling\u201d \u2014 a distinction vital to Lambert\u2019s case. Such considerations explain the courts\u2019 reluctance to entertain libel suits dependent upon a precise construction of a newspaper\u2019s use of technical legal terminology. Bray v. Providence Journal Co., <em>supra </em>(\u201ctestimony\u201d). Joyce v. Globe Newspaper Co., 355 Mass. 492, 245 N.E.2d 822 (1969) (\u201ccommitment\u201d); Piracci v. Hearst Corp., 263 F.Supp. 511 (D.Md.1966). Despite the Journal\u2019s loose use of the word \u201cmurder,\u201d we think only \u201csupersensitive persons, with morbid imaginations,\u201d Reid v. Providence Journal Co., <em>supra </em>at 122, 37 A. at 637, could discover in any of these articles the assertion that Lambert was guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-5\">. \u201cPair Deny Murder, Accessory Charges \u2014 2 Men held in Fatal Fall River Shooting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cTwo Fall River men were arrested by police early yesterday morning and charged in connection with the murder shortly before midnight Friday of a 28-year-old Fall River man in the Camelot Inn on South Main Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cEdward Smialek, 55, who lives above the Inn at 427 South Main St., pleaded innocent to a charge of murder before Judge Hugh Morton in District Court yesterday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cThe manager of the Camelot Inn, George J.

The innuendo actually pleaded, that each article was understood to mean that \u201ca \u2018murder\u2019 had been committed and that Plaintiff was charged with the criminal conduct aforesaid,\u201d seems deficient as a matter of law. The latter imputation would be defamatory but was admittedly true; the former is false but not defamatory as to Lambert because it does not imply his involvement. Riverhouse Pub. Co. v. Porter, 287 F.Supp. 1, 3-5 (D.R.I.1968); Hanson v. Globe Newspaper Co., 159 Mass. 293, 294-295, 34 N.E. 462, 462-463 (1893). The essence of Lambert\u2019s claim is that the articles were understood to mean that he had committed murder, and we treat it as such throughout our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AF9y\">. The district court applied Rhode Island\u2019s law of libel in this case. Erie R. R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). Since Massachusetts law does not differ in any significant respect as our twin citations throughout will show, we need not consider whether that state has a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 150 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-5\">. This differentiates the instant case from Commercial Pub. Co. v. Smith, <em>supra. </em>In that case the court held it was a jury question whether the following article was defamatory:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak8f\">\u201cMurderer Arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Augusta, Ark., Feb. 10th. \u2014 Sheriff Marshal Patterson arrested Fred Smith, camped in a tent ten miles north of Augusta, on White river. Smith is wanted at Kennett, Mo., for killing old man F. E. Porch, the incentive being robbery. The state of Missouri offered $300, the county $200, and the citizens of Malden $600, for Smith\u2019s arrest. Smith does not deny being the man wanted, but claims he did not do the killing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Describing the plaintiff as a murderer implicated him in the killing in a way the Journal\u2019s articles did not implicate Lambert here. \u201cOther cases, though persuasive, are rarely controlling [in libel actions] because of variations in the words used.\u201d Lane v. The Washington Daily News, 66 App.D.C. 245, 85 F.2d 822, 824 (1936). Moreover, <em>Smith </em>was decided nearly seventy years ago under federal common law. The trend has shifted towards restricting liability for defamation, W. Pros-ser, <em>supra </em>at 738-39, and we doubt the <em>Smith </em>result would be reached under present-day Massachusetts and Rhode Island libel law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. The context shows that the single use of the phrase \u201cactual murder\u201d in the last article served to distinguish the murder charge from the earlier accessory charge and could not be read to assert the conclusion that the killing was unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
