The bomb, contained in a package addressed to the Worcester Music Co., exploded in the South Boston Postal Annex. Investigation by postal authorities revealed that the explosion had been caused by a home-made bomb charged with black powder, and triggered by a device wired to attached batteries by means of soldered circuits. Officials of the Worcester Music Co. told postal inspectors that appellant had been employed by Worcester as a service manager; that he had knowledge of electrical circuitry and soldering; that appellant and another former employee of Worcester were the proprietors of Bell Music and Amusement Co., against which Worcester had obtained an $80,000 judgment for breach of a covenant not to compete; and that Bell Music would be apt to have a workshop equipped to do electrical soldering.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">Subsequently, the postal inspectors received a report from the Postal Service Crime Laboratory that appellant\u2019s thumb print had been identified on the inner wrappings of the parcel which had contained the bomb. The postal inspectors secured from a magistrate a warrant to search the premises of Bell Music and Amusement Co. In the affidavit submitted in support of their application for the warrant, the inspectors recounted the above described results of their investigation and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-20\">\u201c12. On several occasions between July 26 and August 8, 1973, we went to the premises of Bell Music and Amusement Company, Inc., at 1 Pine-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>land Avenue, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, looked through the glass window. [sic] The premises consisted of a front office with one desk and file cabinets. To the rear of this office through a door partially open, we observed a wooden bench and table.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN4\">The present appeal arises out of the refusal of the district court to suppress the fruits of the search of Bell Music, strands of wire similar to that used in the construction of the bomb. Appellant contends that the inspectors\u2019 representation that they had observed a wooden bench and table in the Bell Music establishment was false, that evidence presented at, the suppression hearing made it apparent that they could not have seen what they said they saw, and that they admitted as much in their testimony at the hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">A little over a decade ago the Supreme Court noted that it had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201c. . . never passed directly on the extent to which a court may permit [examination of the validity of a search warrant] when the search warrant is valid on its face and when the allegations of the underlying affidavit establish \u2018probable cause\u2019.\u201d Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 531\u2014 532, 84 S.Ct. 825, 827-828, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">This observation came amid a slow thaw in the rigidity of the rule which had long predominated among the circuit courts that judicial scrutiny of the propriety of the issuance of a warrant could not probe beneath the surface of the supporting affidavits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In several circuits the process of reassessment has culminated in the adoption of general standards which permit examination of the accuracy of affidavits underlying a warrant in a variety of circumstances. In United States v. Carmichael, 489 F.2d 983 (7th Cir. 1973), the Seventh Circuit ruled that a defendant is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">\u201c. . . entitled to a hearing which delves below the surface of a facially sufficient affidavit if he has made an initial showing of either of the following: (1) any misrepresentation by the governmnment agent of a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>fact, or (2) an intentional misrepresentation by the government agent, whether or not material.\u201d 489 F.2d at 988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Evidence should be suppressed, the court ruled, only if after the hearing the trial court finds the government agent to have been \u201crecklessly or intentionally untruthful\u201d. <em>Ibid. </em>Upon such a finding, evidence resulting from a search pursuant to a warrant based on the untruthful affidavit must be suppressed, the court held, regardless of whether, absent the misrepresentative portions, the affidavit still establishes probable cause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The Fifth Circuit, in United States v. Thomas, 489 F.2d 664 (5th Cir. 1973), discussed the rule established by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Carmichael, </em>and adopted a rule which is similar, but marked by two important variations. Evidence should be suppressed, the court ruled, if the warrant was issued on the basis of an affidavit containing a misstatement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201c. . . (1) was committed with an intent to deceive the magistrate, whether or not the error is material to the showing of probable cause; or (2) made non-intentionally, but the erroneous statement is material to the establishment of probable cause for the search.\u201d 489 F.2d at 669.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s formulation of the rule, unlike the Seventh Circuit\u2019s would hold a warrant invalid if the underlying affidavit contained a negligent but unintentional misrepresentation that was material.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A second distinction between the rules set forth in the two decisions is that the Fifth Circuit explicitly requires that a non-material misrepresentation must have been made with an intent to deceive the magistrate if it is to vitiate the resulting warrant. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s rule seems to contemplate no determination of whether the affiant intended to deceive the magistrate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">In essence the two rules reflect differing pragmatic judgments of what sort of misconduct \u2014 negligent or intentional, flagrant or trivial \u2014 can and ought to be deterred by the suppression of evidence at trial. At what point does the increase in deterrence effected by an expansion of the Fourth Amendment rights of defendants become so marginal that it does not warrant the hindrance to successful prosecution of the guilty which results?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtN\">\u201cThe rule is calculated to prevent, not to repair. Its purpose is clear \u2014 to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way \u2014 by removing the incentive to disregard it.\u201d Elkins v. . United States, 364 U.S. 206, 217, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 1444, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">We find perplexing the question of the prophylactic value of the exclusion of evidence secured with a warrant issued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>reliance on negligent and material, but not intentional misstatements. At this stage of development of legal doctrine, we would hesitate to adopt a position for this circuit on a hypothetical basis. Suffice it to say that, as we view the record, the question is not before us, and we imply no views as to the answer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We find the misstatements at issue in the present appeal non-material. The testimony and photographic evidence adduced at the suppression hearing establish conclusively that the statement in the affidavit that \u201c[t]o the rear of this office through a door partially open, we observed a wooden bench and table\u201d was incorrect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Excising that paragraph of the affidavit, however, we still find at least the minimal requirements for probable cause satisfied. The affidavit truthfully recounted the statements of the Worcester Music Company officials that they had won a substantial judgment against appellant and Bell Music, that appellant had electrical wiring skills, and that Bell Music would probably have a workshop facility. Combined with the information supplied by the Postal Service Crime Laboratory with respect to the manner of construction of the bomb and the identification of appellant\u2019s thumb print on the wrappings of the bomb, these facts viewed in a commonsense manner were sufficient to establish probable cause for a search of Bell Music. United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1964); Rosencranz v. United States, 356 F.2d 310 (1st Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">That we regard the misstatement in the affidavit as immaterial in the sense of not being a \u201cbut for essential\u201d of probable cause, however, does not dispose of the case. The fact that the investigating agents had actually seen a workbench within the Bell Music premises may have carried great weight with the magistrate, for it both provided an independent fact supporting a finding of probable cause, and verified by observation the educated guess given by the Worcester Music officials, thus strengthening the credibility of all they said. It changed a marginally adequate affidavit into a solidly persuasive one. A knowing misstatement of so significant a fact would exhibit exactly that quality of unscrupled zeal which impelled the adoption of the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We are sensitive to the fact that allowances must be made for errors in judgment, observation, or memory on the part of fallible human beings endeavoring faithfully to carry out the duties of office, sometimes under conditions of great pressure. But we see no policy reason for overlooking intentional, relevant, and non-trivial misstatements in an affidavit which could subject any maker of such, be he an official or a private citizen, to a fine or imprisonment for perjury under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>deed, policy suggests particular sensitivity to such misstatements in an affidavit for a search warrant which is necessarily granted ex parte, and in complete reliance upon the truthfulness of the statements in the affidavit. The major reliance for implementation of the Fourth Amendment is a warrant, a judgment of probable cause, i. e., a conclusion that there exist \u201creasonable grounds to believe \u2014 that criminally related objects are in the place which the warrant authorizes to be searched, at the time when the search is authorized to be conducted\u201d,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by \u201ca neutral and detached magistrate . . . [not of an] officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Were the judicial response to be merely the elimination of the false statements and the assessment of the affidavit\u2019s adequacy in the light of the remaining averments, enforcement officers would be placed in the untoward position of having everything to gain and nothing to lose in strengthening an otherwise marginal affidavit by letting their intense dedication to duty blur the distinction between fact and fantasy. We therefore see no supportable alternative to suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant based on an affidavit containing an intentional, relevant, and nontrivial misstatement. We see no basis for confining this sanction to false statements made with the specific intent to deceive the magistrate as opposed to false statements merely intended to \u201cround out the picture\u201d. We see no danger of frequent frustration of warrant-based searches and seizures occasioned by challenges based on intentional misstatements. Such challenges, to be entertained, would have to be preceded by a showing of falsity of allegation \u2014 a showing presumably not easily to be made in most cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Since neither the magistrate, nor the district judge dealt with the question whether the postal inspectors knowingly misrepresented the facts, we must remand this case for a hearing on that issue. The hearing should be conducted by the district judge and, if he determines that the misstatements in the affidavit were knowingly made, the evidence discovered in the search of Bell Music and Amusement Company must be suppressed and a new trial granted to appellant. In the future when a defendant makes a preliminary showing of knowing misstatements in an affidavit underlying a warrant, a hearing should be conducted by a judge to determine whether the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In Wingo v. Wedding, 418 U.S. 461, 94 S.Ct. 2842, 41 L.Ed.2d 879 (June 26, 1974), the Supreme Court held that the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-639, did not affect the longstanding requirement that evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus cases be conducted by a judge. The Court found \u201cnothing in the text or legislative history of the Magistrates Act\u201d to suggest that Congress intended to change the requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">\u201cRather, both text and legislative history plainly reveal a congressional determination to retain the requirement. For, although the Act gives district judges broad authority to assign a wide range of duties to Magistrates, Congress carefully circumscribed the permissible scope of assignment to only \u2018such additional duties as are <em>not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u2019 </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) (emphasis added).\u201d 94 S.Ct. at 2848.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">In Campbell v. United States District Court, 501 F.2d 196 (9th Cir. Aug. 15, 1974), the Ninth Circuit faced the question whether the Magistrates Act permitted reference of a motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>to a magistrate for findings and recommendations. Paralleling the Supreme Court\u2019s analytical approach in <em>Wingo </em>the circuit court sought to determine whether before the passage of the Magistrates Act the laws or Constitution required that a motion to suppress be heard, in the first instance, by a judge. The court found that unlike habeas corpus proceedings motions to suppress were subject to no preexisting requirement that they be heard initially by a judge. <em>See also </em>Weber v. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, 503 F.2d 1049 (9th Cir. Sept. 13, 1974). That it is permissible to refer a motion to suppress to a magistrate does not imply, the court added, that the district judge is relieved of the responsibility of finally deciding the issues raised at the hearing. Scrupulous care must be taken, the court stated, that the final adjudication is made by the district court, without special deference to the findings of the magistrate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The rule we establish here is not addressed to the general question whether motions to suppress may be referred for preliminary action to a magistrate. We limit ourselves to one specific situation, where the veracity of an affidavit underlying a warrant is challenged. In such circumstances the credibility of witnesses is so likely to be determinative, and the evidence so delicately balanced that we see little probability that judicial time would be saved by preliminary reference to a magistrate. Furthermore, in this circuit we have relatively few full time magistrates; these deal with a limited number of federal agents. We see risks to both the defendant and the government in requiring the same magistrate who believed the challenged statements of government agents or who has believed them in the past, to hold a hearing to determine if the agents perjured themselves in obtaining a warrant. <em>Cf. </em>Halliday v. United States, 380 F.2d 270 (1st Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Judgment vacated; remanded to the district, court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">. The posture of the district court, relative to the issues raised by appellant, is as follows. The district judge referred the motion to suppress to the magistrate who wrote a memorandum recommending that the motion be denied. Although the magistrate permitted counsel for appellant to cross-examine the two postal inspectors about their observations of the Bell Music offices, he made no findings regarding the veracity of the statements made in the affidavit, indicating instead that he was constrained to look only within the \u201cfour corners of the affidavit\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The district judge heard brief argument from counsel for appellant, but, stating that he was concerned only \u201cwith what is in the affidavit\u201d, denied the motion to suppress without findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The government argues that appellant made no request for findings, that Fed.R. Crim.P. 41(e) does not require findings, and that absent such findings we must affirm the action of the district court if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it. <em>See </em>United States v. Horton, 488 F.2d 374 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 993, 94 S.Ct. 2405, 40 L.Ed.2d 772 (1974). Here, although the government in its memorandum in opposition to the motion to suppress cited United States v. Carmichael, 489 F.2d 983 (7th Cir. 1973), a leading case permitting examination of the veracity of statements contained in a probable cause affidavit, neither the magistrate, nor the district court believed it permissible to delve beneath the surface of the affidavit. Since we hold that the district court must, in certain circumstances, delve beneath the surface of a facially sufficient affidavit, it would be improper for us to treat the case as though the district court had decided that no intentional misstatement had been made in the affidavit. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Horton, </em>where the district court did not appear to have misconceived the controlling law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-15\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v.

We accept the Seven Circuit\u2019s phrasing as the proper characterization of \u201cmaterial\u201d in this context \u2014 information which is essential to a showing of probable cause \u2014 and so use the term throughout this opinion. We reject appellant\u2019s effort to have us accept a definition which would equate \u201cmaterial\u201d to relevant to an element of probable cause.

The position of the court on the question of the significance of material misstatements negligently made is rendered somewhat nebulous by a footnote several pages subsequent to the quoted passage which states that the court does not reach the question of what degrees of negligence will invalidate a warrant. 489 F.2d at 671 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">Both the <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Carmichael </em>courts discuss the arguments in Kipperman, Inaccurate Search Warrant Affidavits As a Ground for Suppressing Evidence, 84 Harv.L.Rev. 825 (1971), which advocates the exclusion of evidence secured with a warrant which depends for probable cause on negligently misstated facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\">. The importance of this distinction becomes apparent in the context of the <em>Thomas </em>opinion. The court found that the affidavit there challenged contained knowing misrepresentations indicating that the agent\u2019s sources had named a man called Finley in connection with criminal activities described in the affidavit. In fact the sources had named a man called \u201cTee\u201d and the agent had concluded, on the basis of further investigation, that \u201cTee\u201d was Finley. Closely analyzing the facts, the court held the resulting warrant valid since the agent\u2019s false statements were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d, 489 F.2d at 671-672, i. e\u201e with no intent to deceive the magistrate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b156-5\">. <em>Compare </em>United States v.
