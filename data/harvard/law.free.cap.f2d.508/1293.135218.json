They sought to be released from serving sentences<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for violation of the Tribe\u2019s disorderly conduct statute, \u00a7 19, Crow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>Creek Sioux Tribe Penal Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Tribe\u2019s contributing to the delinquency of a minor statute, \u00a7 9, Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Penal Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They contended that they were unjustly confined because, <em>inter alia, </em>both statutes violate (1) the due process guarantee of the Indian Bill of Rights, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302(8),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> insofar as they are so vague that persons of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning, and (2) the free speech guarantee of the Indian Bill of Rights, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> insofar as they may punish protected speech. The district court rejected these contentions and denied the petitions by a memorandum decision filed April 1, 1974. Petitioners appeal from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">The evidence heard by the district court in this case focused upon the proceedings that took place in Tribal Court before Tribal Judge Walter Peck. The petitioners and Judge Peck, a respondent below,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gave oral testimony before the district court on procedures which had been followed in the Tribal Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the respondents presented no evidence of how the questioned statutes had been applied in the Tribal Court to persons other than the petitioners, the district judge, in rejecting the constitutional attack on the statutes, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-7\">The case of Wainwright v. Stone, [414 U.S. 21,] 94 S.Ct. 190 [38 L.Ed.2d 179] (1973), is controlling wherein it was held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-8\">The judgment of federal courts as to the vagueness or not of a state statute must be made in the light of prior state constructions of the statute. For the purpose of determining whether a state statute is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation \u201cwe must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-9\">There was no evidence that these statutes were applied in any vague or inconsistent manner. No bad faith or harassment has been shown. In fact, the record is clear that both statutes have been interpreted consistently and it cannot be said that men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning or differ as to its application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">The Tribe, in urging us to affirm the district court, makes the following statement in its brief on the challenge to the disorderly conduct statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-5\">Victoria Aikens acted as Chief Judge for 15 years prior to 1972, and during that time without exception, prosecution under the disorderly conduct statute was limited to cases involving fighting and intoxication. There has never been a prosecution under this statute or a conviction for \u201cdisturbing or annoying any public or religious assembly,\u201d and the application of the statute in that regard has been consistent. In the instant case, the facts revealed that the defendants were not charged with disturbing or annoying any public or religious assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-6\">Appellants also urge that the term \u201cdisorderly condition\u201d is overbroad. The question may be answered quite simply. In the entire history of the Tribal Court system, no one has ever been charged with being in a \u201cdisorderly condition.\u201d The interpretation has been consistent throughout, that if a person under the influence of intoxicants appeared in a place in a drunken state, and if his appearance while in the drunken state prevented others from enjoying their individual activities free' from disturbance, then such a person, where proven, was considered in an intoxicated an [sic] disorderly condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">Appellants Regina and Willard Big Eagle offer this response to the Tribe\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-8\">This allegation is patently false. Even Victoria Aikens was astounded to hear of Appellees\u2019 allegation, and she signed an affidavit, appendixed to this Reply, admitting that the disorderly conduct statute \u201cwas so broad and vague . ... [that it] could have been extended to other disorderly situations involving speaking.'\u201d [Appendix A] Indeed, during Judge Ai-kens tenure, countless arrests and convictions were obtained under the disorderly conduct statute where fighting and intoxication were not involved. [Brackets in original, footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-11\">No evidence supporting either of these conflicting contentions appears anywhere in the record as made in the district court. We agree with the argument of Regina and Willard that, if tested by standards applied to communities outside an Indian reservation, the Tribe\u2019s disorderly conduct statute appears facially vague and overbroad. <em>See </em>Wiegand v. Seaver, 504 F.2d 303 (5th Cir. 1974); Original Fayette County Civic and Welfare League v. Ellington, 309 F.Supp. 89, 92 (W.D.Tenn.1970) (three-judge court). <em>See also </em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 133-134, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974) (overbreadth); Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162-171, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972) (vagueness); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972) (overbreadth); Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (vagueness); Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453-458, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939) (vagueness). But we are not prepared to say that a limiting construction of the statute, well-known to the Indian reservation society, would not, if made by the Tribal Court, cure its facial vagueness and overbreadth. <em>Compare </em>Wainwright v. Stone, 414 U.S. 21, 22-23, 94 S.Ct. 190, 38 L.Ed.2d 179 (1973), Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 109-111, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972), and Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572-574, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), <em>with </em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, <em>supra, </em>415 U.S. at 133-134, 94 S.Ct. 970, and Gooding v. Wilson, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 520-528, 31 L.Ed.2d 408. Since this is a case of first impression arising under the Indian Bill of Rights, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301-1303, we believe that we must approach cautiously the issues that it presents. We ought not rule on the question presented here where the record fails to establish whether the Tribe\u2019s disorderly conduct statute has been properly restricted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>meaning by consistent and authoritative construction by the Tribal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Lest we be misunderstood, we do not say that this statute can necessarily be saved by a restricted interpretation. Rather, we decline to rule on its validity without evidence of its enforcement and construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">We view the contributing to the delinquency of a minor statute differently from the disorderly conduct statute. In their analysis of this statute, Regina and Willard direct their attention exclusively at its possible vagueness. They argue that the language of the statute, such as \u201cencourage\u201d or \u201ccontribute\u201d to delinquency, could subject to prosecution an adult who, for example, smokes in front of a child, refrains from sending a child to church, \u201cwanders the streets at night,\u201d is \u201cunemployed,\u201d \u201cassociates with unsavory characters,\u201d or \u201cuses profane language in public.\u201d Thus, they conclude, the statutory language is vague and therefore fails to give notice of what conduct is criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">The potential vagueness of a statute, as applied in hypothetical cases, is no ground for holding the statute unconstitutional. A defendant cannot claim that a statute is unconstitutional in some of its reaches if it is constitutional as applied to him. <em>E. g., </em>Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 755-57, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2561-2562, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974); Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley R.R. v. Jackson Vinegar Co., 226 U.S. 217, 219-220, 33 S.Ct. 40, 57 L.Ed. 193 (1912). Justice White articulated this rule in dissent in Coates v. City of Cincinnati, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-9\">It is possible that a whole range of other acts defined with unconstitutional imprecision, is forbidden by the ordinance. But as a general rule, when a criminal charge is based on conduct constitutionally subject to proscription and clearly forbidden by a statute, it is no defense that the law would be unconstitutionally vague if applied to other behavior. Such a statute is not vague on its face. It may be vague as applied in some circumstances, but ruling on such a challenge obviously requires knowledge of the conduct with which a defendant is charged. [402 U.S. at 618, 91 S.Ct. at 1690.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\"><em>See </em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 608, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491-492, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965); United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 32-33, 83 S.Ct. 594, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963); Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 100-101, 71 S.Ct. 576, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">Appellants pled guilty to \u201cprovid[ing] intoxicating beverages for Wilbert Big Eagle and Donovan McGhee,\u201d minors for whom such beverages were otherwise unobtainable. The record discloses that these minors were drunk when apprehended by police. We can infer from the guilty pleas of the appellants that their conduct in supplying them with intoxicants caused Wilbert\u2019s and Donovan\u2019s drunkenness. There can be no real doubt that by such conduct appellants were \u201ccontributing\u201d to the delinquency of minors. Thus, entirely without regard to the statute\u2019s possible vagueness as applied to other defendants, because the statute is not vague as applied to Regina and Willard Big Eagle, their attack on its constitutionality must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">We hold that appellants\u2019 attack on the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe\u2019s contributing to delinquency statute is without merit, for the appellants\u2019 conduct falls squarely within the proscription of the law. However, we remand this case for an evidentiary hearing on the Tribal Court\u2019s construction of the disorderly conduct statute and for a re-evaluation of the appellants\u2019 entitlement to habeas corpus relief in the light of the evidence presented at such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-15\">We remand for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-9\">. Both petitioners pled guilty after proceeding pro <em>se </em>before the Tribal Court. Both received a sentence of 30 days\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $50 for disorderly conduct and a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 120 days and a fine of $200 for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Regina served her sentences from December 28, 1973, to January 28, 1974, when she was released on probation for one year. Willard served his sentences, including one, not at issue here, for malicious mischief, from December 28, 1973, to February 22, 1974, when he was released on his own recognizance pending the outcome of this habeas corpus petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">.
