The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously affirmed these convictions, Commonwealth v. Ross, 1972 Mass.Adv.Sh. 873, 282 N.E.2d 70, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973). Ross v. Massachusetts, 410 U.S. 901, 93 S.Ct. 968, 35 L.Ed.2d 265 (1973). On remand the Supreme Judicial Court held that <em>Ham </em>did not affect the result reached in its earlier deliberation, Commonwealth v. Ross, 1973 Mass.Adv.Sh. 839, 296 N.E.2d 810.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ross sought a writ of habeas corpus from the district court, which the court granted, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">\u201cThe questions propounded to the jurors in the present case were directed to the general issue of bias and prejudice, and were far more extensive and carefully worded than those given in Aldridge [v. United States, 283 U.S. 308, 51 S.Ct. 470, 75 L.Ed. 1054 (1931),] and <em>Ham. </em>They were exemplary in every respect, except the failure to specifically direct the attention of the jurors to the issue of racial prejudice. In substance, they were no different than the ones given in <em>Ham. </em>The fact that one juror responded that he suffered from racial prejudice and was excused does not cover the situation, because his perception cannot be imputed to the twelve who were chosen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-9\">\u201cIn the instant case, there was a white victim. The offense in <em>Ham </em>was victimless, i. e., possession of marijuana. The likelihood of infection of the verdict was at least as great as it was in <em>Ham. . . </em>The petitioner had a constitutional right to have the issue of racial prejudice specifically called to the attention of the prospective jurors on the <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">In Ham v. South Carolina, <em>supra, </em>the defendant was a black civil rights leader charged with possession of marijuana. His defense was that the police were out to get him and were framing him on the drug charge. His counsel requested the judge to ask on <em>voir dire </em>two questions designed to ferret out any possible racial prejudice against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge did put three general questions to the prospective jurors on the issue of bias, but he refused to ask any question directed specifically to racial prejudice. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion, held \u201cthat the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Amendment required the judge in this case to interrogate the jurors upon the subject of racial prejudice.\u201d 409 U.S. at 527, 93 S.Ct. at 850. The contours of the <em>Ham </em>decision were not sharply defined by the Court. Justice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion did not explicitly state that whenever a black defendant requests the trial judge to inquire specifically on the issue of racial prejudice on <em>voir dire </em>the trial judge must do so. Nor did the opinion explicitly state that the defense request for specific questions directed to racial prejudice need only be honored where the defendant was a civil rights leader .or other \u201cspecial target of racial prejudice,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was the construction the Supreme Judicial Court gave <em>Ham.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Commonwealth v. Ross, 1973 Mass.Adv.Sh. 839, 296 N.E.2d 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Under the view we take of the facts in this case, however, we are not required to resolve this ambiguity. In <em>Ham </em>the defendant was a civil rights leader, while in this case the black defendant is for the purpose of this inquiry an ordinary black citizen. But in this case, the charges against the defendant involved violence against a white, not a victimless crime like possession of marijuana. Moreover, the white victim, a security officer at Boston University, had a status close to that of a police officer. In addition, the eyewitness testimony of a white gas station attendant was a major part of the state\u2019s case against Ross. On these facts the district court was not in error in concluding that \u201c[t]he likelihood of infection of the verdict [by racial prejudice] was at least as great as it was in <em>Ham.\u2019\u2019 </em>In effect, the court held that a black defendant charged with violent crimes against a white security officer would be likely to be a special target of racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Our dissenting brother suggests that the rule of <em>Ham </em>should only apply to cases brought to trial after the date <em>Ham </em>was decided. However, we do not feel the writ should be denied on the ground that <em>Ham </em>should not be given retroactive application. The Supreme Court implicitly decided that <em>Ham </em>applied to this case when it summarily vacated the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and remanded the case to that court for reconsideration in light of <em>Ham. See </em>Ross v. Massachusetts, 410 U.S. 901, 93 S.Ct. 968, 35 L.Ed.2d 265 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>It is not a significant distinction between this case and <em>Ham </em>that Ham took the stand and put his credibility in issue, while Ross did not take the stand. If a juror is prejudiced against blacks, he would not be able to appraise the defense offered by the black defendant impartially, whether or not that defense included the defendant\u2019s taking the stand. Nor is it particularly relevant that the trial court here doubted that questions directed to discovering racial prejudice would result in any admissions of bias. This objection would apply equally well to other questions the court is required to put to proposed jurors. <em>See </em>Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. c. 234, \u00a7 28 (Supp.1974). For example, a proposed juror biased by pretrial publicity might aver he is not biased or a juror who believes anyone indicted is guilty as charged might answer that he believes the defendant is innocent until proven guilty, yet we do not allow the possibility of a false answer to serve as an excuse for not asking these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">By deciding in this case that the trial judge should have questioned the proposed jurors specifically on the question of racial prejudice, we do not hold that he had to ask the specific questions sought by Ross\u2019s counsel. \u201c[T]he trial judge was not required to put the question in any particular form, or to ask any particular number of questions on the subject, simply because requested to do so by petitioner.\u201d Ham v. South Carolina, <em>supra, </em>409 U.S. at 527, 93 S.Ct. at 850. <em>See </em>Featherston v. United States, 491 F.2d 96 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 971, 94 S.Ct. 3176, 41 L.Ed.2d 1142 (1974). The trial judge has broad discretion as to the questions to be asked regarding racial prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The writ of habeas corpus shall issue unless within 90 days from the date of this opinion the Commonwealth has either instituted proceedings to retry the petitioner or applied for a writ of certio-rari. If certiorari is sought and granted, the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus shall be stayed pending further order of the Supreme Court. If certiorari is sought and denied, the writ of habeas corpus shall issue unless the Commonwealth has instituted proceedings to retry the petitioner within 30 days after the date certiorari is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-17\">. The defendant\u2019s motion for examination of proposed jurors asked that various questions be put to the <em>voir dire </em>panel. The question which this litigation involves was \u201cAre there any of you who believe that a white person is more likely to be telling the truth than a black person?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-6\">. After the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on remand, Ross again filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. The Court denied the petition, Ross v. Massachusetts, 414 U.S. 1080, 94 S.Ct. 599, 38 L.Ed.2d 486 (1973), but Justice Marshall filed an opinion, in which Justices Douglas and Brennan joined, dissenting from the denial. This part of the procedural history of this case has no legal effect in this court. The denial of a petition for certiorari from a state court judgment affirming a conviction has no legal significance when an application for a writ of habeas corpus thereafter comes before a district court. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 488-497, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (opinion of Justice Frankfurter, for a majority of the Court). That only three Justices voted to grant Ross\u2019s second petition for certiorari does not mean that five or more Justices were voting, or even would have voted, to affirm on the merits the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on remand. That the three dissenting Justices filed a lengthy opinion with the denial of certiorari does not reverse the effect to be accorded the denial; the opinion only indicates how strongly those Justices feel about the case. Denial of certiorari may be motivated, among other reasons, by a desire \u201cto have different aspects of an issue further illumined by the lower courts,\u201d Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912, 918, 70 S.Ct. 252, 255, 94 L.Ed. 562 (1950) (opinion of Justice Frankfurter respecting denial of certiorari), or by a preference for administrative reasons to have the prisoner seek habeas corpus in the district court. <em>See generally </em>R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice \u00a75 5.4-5.7 (4th ed. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">. The two questions sought to be asked were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ara-dedup-1\">\u201c1. Would you fairly try this case on the basis of the evidence and disregarding the defendant\u2019s race?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-14\">\u201c2. You have no prejudice against ne-groes? Against black people? You would not be influenced by the use of the term \u2018black\u2019?\u201d 409 U.S. at 525 n. 2, 93 S.Ct. at 849.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b850-5\">. If a juror were prone to racial bias, we question whether it is reasonable to conclude that he would confine that bias, and its destructive effects on his impartiality, to cases where the defendant was a civil rights leader. That the juror might be particularly prone to vent his bias in such a case in no way supports the conclusion that he would be an impartial juror in the absence of such a special factor, as the due process clause requires, <em>see </em>Peters v. Kiff, 407 U.S. 493, 501, 92 S.Ct. 2163, 33 L.Ed.2d 83 (1972) (opinion of Justice Marshall).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">. Other state cases suggest any black criminal defendant, target or not, who requests a specific inquiry about racial prejudice is entitled to it. Cochran v.

We observe with respect to our brother\u2019s dissenting opinion that whenever trial judges are vested with broad discretion it is possible to evoke Pandora, but only if one assumes that discretion will be thrown to the winds. As for this and the other points made, we come to rest with the conviction that they would apply equally to the case presented in <em>Ham.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b851-10\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuB\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AGmk\">The sole issue on this appeal relates to the <em>voir dire </em>examination of prospective trial jurors during which the trial judge denied a specific request on behalf of the petitioner, Ross, to ask a particular question, accurately stated by the majority as follows: \u201cAre there any of you who believe that a white person is more likely to be telling the truth than a black person?\u201d No question was sought by Ross\u2019 counsel addressed to prejudice against Ross as a black. Other questions addressed to prejudice against blacks were requested by co-defendants not involved on this appeal. In my opinion the request of Ross\u2019 counsel cannot be given the broad interpretation that the majority has given in saying that it was \u201ca defense request to interrogate prospective jurors specifically on the issue of racial prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">The majority hold, as did the District Court, that the failure of the trial judge to question \u201cthe proposed jurors specifically on the question of racial prejudice\u201d amounted to a denial of constitutional due process. In so holding, they rely primarily on the recent Supreme Court decision in Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 93 S.Ct. 848, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973), although they concede that the <em>Ham </em>opinion \u201cdid not explicitly state that whenever a black defendant requests the trial judge to inquire specifically on the issue of racial prejudice on <em>voir dire </em>the trial judge must do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number><em>If </em>the District Court be correct in saying that \u201cThe petitioner had a constitutional right to have the issue of racial prejudice specially called to the attention of the prospective jurors on the <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d and <em>if </em>it was a \u201cdenial of due process\u201d of constitutional dimension to deny a defense request to interrogate prospective jurors specifically on the issue of racial prejudice and <em>if </em>the District Court had no choice but to enter the order granting the writ of habeas corpus because \u201cThe mandate of <em>Ham </em>is so clear . . . then, in my opinion, Pandora\u2019s box of potential evil has indeed been opened wide and I look with Cassandra-like foreboding upon the fu- * ture of the <em>voir dire </em>jury examination in cases involving black defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Starting with the question, which the majority quite accurately states this litigation involves, \u201cAre there any of you who believe that a white person is more likely to be telling the truth than a black person?\u201d, I find no relation between such a question and the ultimate desideratum, namely, to uncover racial prejudice against a black defendant. Such a question could not be properly answered unless prosecution and defense read to the prospective juror the name and color of all witnesses they intended to call. Even then it would be impossible to obtain a juror\u2019s pre-trial commitment as to a witness\u2019 credibility until the particular witness had been seen and heard. Will it be constitutionally impermissive to deny interrogation as to a prospective juror\u2019s feelings as to the credibility of a witness of the \u201cX\u201d race, nationality or religion? Illustrative of the problem are questions proposed by petitioners\u2019 co-defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATCR\">\u201c18. Do you have any feelings either for or against persons of the Black race who wear the Afro style haircut and long sideburns?\u201d (App. p. 56) or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7_\">\u201c7. Do you feel that this increase (in crime) is due primarily to blacks in the city?\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201c12. Do you object to the number of blacks and Puerto Ricans on the welfare rolls in the city?\u201d (App. p. 58.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The other forty questions sought to be asked by these co-defendants were undoubtedly intended in good faith by counsel to ferret out the more intimate prejudices of the panel which was to pass judgment on their clients but query, did not the state trial judge probe sufficiently deeply, as a practical matter, in inquiring \u201cCan you under oath return a fair and impartial verdict based upon the evidence that you hear in the courtroom and not upon any extraneous factors; no bias or prejudice or personal interest in the case, and no prejudice of any kind.\u201d (App. p. 494.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Petitioner argues that the state judge\u2019s failure to focus the attention of the prospective jurors as to any racial prejudice they might entertain is \u201cas a matter of constitutional law\u201d reversible error. \u2022 If this is to be the rule by judicial legislation, in fairness to trial judges, state and federal, the rule should only be so promulgated for future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The District Court concedes that the questions propounded on the general issue of bias and prejudice were exemplary in every respect \u201cexcept the failure to specifically direct the attention of the jurors to the issue of racial prejudice.\u201d However, if there are to be rules they should be clear and capable of objective application. In other words, it is easy to understand and apply a rule which requires a trial judge in every case in which there is a black defendant to inquire of each individual juror whether he would be adversely prejudiced against such a person because of his race. But is the trial judge duty bound to ask such a question in the absence of a request? If he asks the question <em>sua sponte, </em>the appeal in all probability will be on the ground that he injected the racial issue into the case \u2014 hence reversible error. If he fails to ask the question, the same result will obtain and, if counsel fails to make the request, incompetence of counsel will be the charge on the habeas corpus application.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The importance of appellate pronouncements in the field of trial procedure is because of the guidance they should give to trial judges. What are we telling the trial judge as to how he should conduct the <em>voir dire </em>on the next trial so as to avoid constitutional error?</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">A \u201cnext\u201d trial can be assumed. Only a few years have elapsed since the first trial. The witnesses and their whereabouts in all probability are known. The facts supporting guilt as found on the first trial may be read in the two opinions of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But juries, not courts, are to determine guilt or innocence and the method of selection of the jury will be the most important element initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Neither Aldridge,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ham, supra, </em>the District Court opinion nor this court\u2019s opinion will be of real value as guidelines. <em>Aldridge </em>and <em>Ham </em>indicate that questions regarding racial prejudice must be asked. And, although <em>Ham </em>and the majority state that the questions need not be \u201cin any particular number\u201d or form, <em>Ham, </em>409 U.S. at 527, 93 S.Ct. 848, only an appellate court will be able to decide whether the future trial judge will have properly exercised that \u201cbroad discretion\u201d with which appellate courts so liberally endow him.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">If the courts are satisfied to accept \u201cNo\u201d to the single question \u201cAre you prejudiced against blacks?\u201d and this colloquy is considered to be constitutionally sufficient, such a question should be permitted if counsel should choose to request it. But the courts are not so easily satisfied \u2014 and probably properly so. Few jurors will reveal the innermost workings of their minds \u2014 particularly in public. The mere \u201cobtaining jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The courts have said that a prospective juror\u2019s eligibility \u201cshould not be adjudged on that juror\u2019s own assessment of self-righteousness <em>without something more.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_l\">It is all very well to speak of a standard to be used in the exercise of discretion in passing upon requested inquiries as meeting \u201cthe essential demands of fairness.\u201d <em>Aldridge, supra, </em>283 U.S. at 310, 51 S.Ct. 470, but, what these demands may be, will only be known to the trial judges years later in the opinion of some appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">Take for example a single instance derived from this case because it falls into the category of the \u201csomething more\u201d field of inquiry. A proposed question submitted to the trial judge here followed the questions: \u201cDo you have children? Do they go to public schools?\u201d and was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-17\">\u201c16. If in private schools, is this a result of your feelings towards the number of blacks and Puerto Ricans in the school system?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">In view of certain situations recently reported in the public press existing in Eastern Massachusetts with respect to the public schools such a question might well be included in a probing group, including \u201cAre you at all nervous about walking the streets of your town or city after dark?\u201d Almost unlimited questions along this line can be conjured up for obtaining a true picture of the potential juror\u2019s mind. To obtain such a picture the <em>voir dire </em>might well more properly be relegated to the psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">However, our present concern must be this case. We are given some 120 pages of transcript devoted entirely to the trial judge\u2019s efforts to obtain an impartial jury. Successive panels were interrogated. The defendants who are black stood before the prospective jurors. The trial judge was most specific as to \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d generally. The jurors knew when asked about prejudice that the defendants were black. Each juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>was given an opportunity to approach the Bench and express whatever his own personal reasons for not wishing to serve. Any possible reluctance to express racial bias or prejudice in public was thus avoided. In fact two jurors' were excused because of prejudice; one in particular, because of racial prejudice. The ultimate jury consisted of 10 whites and 2 blacks. No incident has been pointed out to us which might indicate that this was not a normal and average American jury which heard the evidence and reached their verdict thereon. If there is to be a new <em>voir dire </em>rule, mandating upon request the injection of a racial prejudice issue into the case, I am not prepared to fault the trial judge for not knowing it before it was promulgated.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Finally, I am not unmindful of the fact that a distinguished court (the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court) has twice passed upon the issue of fair trial for this defendant. After the first af-firmance certiorari was granted and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Ham. </em>That reconsideration was given and again there was affirmance. Certiorari was denied, three Justices vigorously dissenting, as appears in the opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall. 414 U.S. 1080, 94 S.Ct. 599, 38 L.Ed.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The Supreme Court has stated that denial of certiorari has no legal significance \u2014 at least as to the merits of the controversy. Nor would I question the sound philosophy behind such an interpretation. Two cases in particular in which the opinions were written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter clearly demonstrate that \u201csuch a denial (of certiorari) carries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court\u2019s views on the merits of a case which it has declined to review.\u201d Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U.S. 912, 919, 70 S.Ct. 252, 255, 94 L.Ed. 562 (1950). Again in 1953 the Supreme Court devoted itself in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953), to the effect, if any, which might be attributed to denial of certiorari. In a separate opinion (pp. 488 \u2014 497, 73 S.Ct. 397) Mr. Justice Frankfurter set forth most specifically the reasons why no effect should be given to denial. The many instances cited of petitions \u201crarely drawn by lawyers,\u201d \u201calmost unintelligible,\u201d inadequate records, no clear statements of the issues, the lack of importance of the issues, the mere numerical quantity of the petitions, all justify the conclusion that \u201cThe denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case, . \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Quite rightly did the Justice say: \u201cThe reasons why our denial of certiorari in the ordinary run of cases can be any number of things other than a decision on the merits are only multiplied by the circumstances of this class of petitions.\u201d <em>Brown, supra, </em>at 497, 73 S.Ct. at 441. However, this very expression is pregnant with the possibility as Mr. Justice Jackson pointed out in his separate opinion that \u201cThere may be circumstances so extraordinary that I do not now think of them which would justify a departure from this rule, but the ordinary run-of-the-mill case certainly does not.\u201d <em>Brown, supra, </em>at 545, 73 S.Ct. at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">This small opening in an otherwise seemingly impregnable fortress entitles one to peer into the interior \u2014 a hypothetical conference chamber in which consideration of certiorari in this case is being discussed. <em>Ham </em>for all practical purposes had just been decided. The constitutional issue of the \u201cblack\u201d question presented by <em>Ross </em>was so clear that a remand was directed in light of <em>Ham. </em>When <em>Ross </em>next arrived it was in the same garb \u2014 no other questions, no procedural issues, no diminution in importance of the only issue \u2014 just the same single \u201cblack\u201d question. If there were any doubt on the subject Mr. Justice Marshall must have made all conscious of the singleness of the issue in his dissent, Justices Douglas and Brennan joining. Under these circumstances I would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>reluctant to characterize this case as an \u201cordinary run-of-the-mill case.\u201d The intervening remand had not created a new issue. If the absence of the \u201cblack\u201d question called for remand on the first petition, its continued absence must have been noted on the second. Very possibly the denial of the <em>Ross </em>second certiorari petition has no legal significance but in my opinion the scope and intent of <em>voir dire </em>in the specific field of bias and prejudice as presented here has great legal significance. If counsel are permitted to endeavor to obtain via the <em>voir dire </em>a juror\u2019s commitment as to his views of prospective witnesses\u2019 credibility I foresee countless future appeals arising therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">For these reasons \u2014 but primarily because I believe that the petitioner received a fair trial in Massachusetts \u2014 I dissent and would reverse the granting of the writ.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\">.
