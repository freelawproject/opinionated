We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-28\">The examiner refused registration under the Lanham Act, section 2(e)(3) (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(e)(3)) on the ground that DUCHARME is primarily merely a surname. The board affirmed the refusal to register while adding, \u201c[mjoreover, \u2018DUCHARME\u2019 is admittedly a surname <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>and while it may well be, as applicant in substance contends, a rare surname, Section 2(e)(3) of the Statute makes no distinction between rare or commonplace surnames.\u201d Further, the board quoted from the examiner\u2019s answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">The name Ducharme is listed in var-' ious telephone directories as a surname just as applicant has disclosed in its amendment on June 16, 1971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The sole issue here is whether the mark sought to be registered, DU-CHARME, was properly refused registration under section 2(e)(3) of the Lanham Act as being primarily merely a surname. Section 2 in pertinent part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature <em>unless </em>it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-9\">(e) Consists of a mark which .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">(3) is primarily merely a surname. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">It is clear that the burden is on the Patent Office to prove that the trademark is primarily merely a surname. In re Standard Elektrik Lorenz Aktiengesellschaft, 371 F.2d 870, 873, 54 CCPA 1043, 1047 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">This court has recognized that section 2(e)(3) is difficult to apply in determining whether a mark is primarily merely a surname.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we are of the opinion that a correct resolution of the issue can be made only after the primary significance of the mark to the purchasing public is determined, as suggested by Ex parte Rivera Watch Corp., 106 USPQ 145, 149 (Com\u2019r Pat.1955). We thus adopt the reasoning expounded in <em>Rivera </em>in which it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-16\">A trademark is a trademark only if it is used in trade. When it is used in trade it must have some impact upon the purchasing public, and it is that impact or impression which should be evaluated in determining whether or not the primary significance of a word when applied to a product is a surname significance. If it is, <em>and it is only that, </em>then it is primarily merely a surname.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">The board held that in view of the lack of any established secondary meaning of appellant\u2019s mark, the mark would only have the significance of a surname to purchasers. Thus, the board, in essence, shifted the burden of proof to appellant without first establishing that DUCHARME is primarily merely a surname. As stated previously, the Patent Office has the burden to show that DUCHARME is primarily merely a surname and unless it meets its burden, appellant need not demonstrate non-surname significance of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">The examiner stated that DUC-HARME is listed in various telephone directories as a surname. In fact, in answer to the examiner\u2019s refusal to register, appellant referred to the Manhattan telephone directory in New York City noting that it lists six names similar to applicant\u2019s mark.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the board did not specifically state that it adopted such an approach as establishing that DUCHARME is primarily merely a surname, the telephone directory is the only evidence produced by the examiner as a basis for his refusal to register DU-CHARME on the Principal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Although the use of a telephone directory may be considered a fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tor in determining whether a mark is primarily merely a surname, we do not find this, <em>standing alone, </em>to be determinative of the issue. This is particularly true here where the Patent Office only relied upon six listings in the Manhattan telephone directory supplied by appellant. Such a showing does not establish that the primary significance of DU-CHARME to the purchasing public is that of a surname. See Ex parte Wayne Pump Co., 88 USPQ 437, 439-40 (P.O. Ex\u2019r Ch.1951); Ex parte Gemex Co., 111 USPQ 443 (Com\u2019r Pat.1956); Drexel Enterprises, Inc. v. Colby, 138 USPQ 1 (S.D.Cal.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Therefore, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-16\">.
