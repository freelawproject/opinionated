(1974)). After the EEOC authorized appellants to file suit, they initiated the present proceeding as a Fed.R.Civ.P. class action on their own behalf and the behalf of all others simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>larly situated. After an extensive trial, the district court made findings of fact and entered judgment in Goodyear\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Plaintiffs renew their arguments \u2022 on appeal. Of course, findings of fact in Title VII cases are reviewed in the same manner as any other trial court findings: this court will not set the findings aside unless it is able to conclude that such findings are clearly erroneous.' <em>See, </em>Smith v. Delta Airlines, 486 F.2d 512, 514 (5th Cir. 1973); Terrell v. Feldstein Co., 468 F.2d 910, 911 (5th Cir. 1972); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We have examined the record thoroughly and we find sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s decision that Goodyear did not discriminate in the employment of black females. Therefore, since the lower court\u2019s decision is not clearly erroneous, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
