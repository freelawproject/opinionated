He specifically alleged that the defendants \u201cknew or should have known that the charges [on which his arrest was based] were not true and were not based upon fact\u201d and \u201c[t]hat the arrest and detention of the Plaintiff was completely and totally without legal justification.\u201d The defendants made no motion to dismiss the complaint but filed an answer on the merits. At a pre-trial hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel conceded, under questioning from the Court, that the plaintiff, following arrest, had actually been detained for merely a short time and had, during such restraint, suffered no physical injury. At this point, the Court proceeded to dismiss the action on its own motion on the ground that a cause of action for violation of constitutional rights under Section 1983, 42 U.S.C. exists only if the constitutional violation giving rise to the action is \u201caggravated\u201d or flagrant. In so dismissing the action, the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-22\">The defendants assume \u2014 as they must under the controlling authorities \u2014 that an unjustified arrest and detainer represent an unconstitutional deprivation, violative of an individual\u2019s rights under both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, redressable, at least in certain circumstances even under their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>argument, by reason of Section 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But they urge, and the District Court so ruled, that such a deprivation confers no right of action under Section 1983 unless that deprivation is aggravated by the \u201cuse of excessive force, such as beating, or some aggravation by means of detention, [over an] extremely long period of time without making available bond or without allowing the party to make a call to arrange for bond.\u201d They would thus read into Section 1983 what the District Court described as a <em>de minimis </em>rule. The difficulty with the argument, as well as the ruling of the District Court adopting it, is that, as the Court in Joseph v. Rowlen, <em>supra </em>(402 F.2d at 369) remarked in dismissing a similar argument, \u201cthere is nothing in the language of sec. 1983, or the fourth and fourteenth amendments as presently construed\u201d to support such a limitation on a right of action under Section 1983, contrary as it is to the broad tone of that section, which, as Justice Harlan described it in his concurring opinion in Monroe v. Pape (1961) 365 U.S. 167, 196, 81 S.Ct. 473, 489, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, is \u201cone of overflowing protection of constitutional rights.\u201d That argument would disregard the fact that it is the constitutional deprivation under color of state law, not the force used in effecting the deprivation or the extent of the injury suffered, that provides the basis for an action under Section 1983. That an infringement of personal liberty such as follows from an unconstitutional arrest has resulted in but a short period of restraint or has involved no physical injury may go in mitigation of damages but it manifestly cannot immunize the constitutional deprivation or abort an aggrieved plaintiff\u2019s right of action under Section 1983. The enabling statute was not so considered at the time of its enactment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor has it since been authoritatively construed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no justification for the incorporation of a <em>de minimis </em>rule by way of a limitation on the right of action by an individual for an admitted violation of constitutional rights. There is no warrant for any separation of constitutional rights into redressable rights and non-re-dressable rights, of major and minor unconstitutional deprivations, and Section 1983 makes no such distinction and authorizes no such separation. By its very terms it applies indiscriminately to a \u201cdeprivation of <em>any </em>rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\u201d (Italics added)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The defendants would draw upon an analogy with prisoners\u2019 Section 1983 claims as authority for their proposition that not every constitutional deprivation \u2014 only those \u201cof constitutional dimensions\u201d \u2014 measures up to the type of deprivation cognizable generally under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Section 1983.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In advancing this contention, the defendants lost sight of the obvious distinction that exists between the ordinary citizen .and the prison inmate. By the very nature of his confinement a prisoner is deprived of certain liberties that are the normal rights of the individual citizen. Deprivation is, to some extent, a necessary part of his confinement. So long as the deprivations of a prison inmate are no more than the \u201c \u2018necessary or reasonable concomitants of [his] imprisonment\u2019 \u201d they do not rise to a constitutional level or, to use the defendants\u2019 phrase, are not \u201cof constitutional dimensions.\u201d It is only when the deprivation imposed on the inmate goes beyond the reasonable limits of prison administration that it becomes an unconstitutional deprivation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But an individual, not under the disability of prison confinement, on the contrary, has an \u201cincontrovertible\u201d right \u2014 a right always \u201cof constitutional dimensions\u201d to be free from unreasonable interference by police officers and to enjoy \u201csecurity from \u2018arbitrary intrusion by the police.\u2019 \u201d Jenkins v. Averett, <em>supra </em>(424 F.2d at 1231). That was the right the plaintiff, by his complaint, was asserting. It was a right of unquestioned \u201cconstitutional dimensions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">It is true, as we have on several occasions stated, that a police officer, sued in an action for unconstitutional arrest under Section 1983, may defend on the ground that he acted in good faith in a reasonable belief on his part in the validity of the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But good faith and reasonable belief are matters of defense, the burden of establishing which rests on the defendant-officer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants in this case, by their answer, have raised this defense. That defense has not been ruled on and is open for resolution at trial or by a motion under Rule 56. The only circumstance when it would be appropriate to dismiss an action under Rule 12 without a trial on the merits or in the absence of a motion for summary judgment, would be when the good faith and reasonable belief of the arresting officers appeared incontestably on the face of the plaintiff\u2019s pleading. That is not our case. The dismissal of the action is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-5\">. Street v.
