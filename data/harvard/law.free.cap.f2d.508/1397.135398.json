Ga.Laws 1971, p. 3546. The statute changed the county commissioner elections from a district basis to an at-large basis. On July 5, 1972 Twiggs County officials submitted the 1971 Act to the United States Attorney General for approval in accordance with \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Attorney General filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>written objections to the Twiggs County election plan on August 7, 1972, but Twiggs County\u2019s August 8, 1972 primary election was conducted under the revised procedures. On November 6, 1972 five black residents and registered voters of Twiggs County, Georgia filed this action seeking a declaration that the 1971 statute was invalid, and an injunction to prevent Twiggs County from conducting the general election under its procedures. The district court orally denied the temporary restraining order. On January 24, 1973 the United States also challenged the Twiggs County election procedures. Chief Judge Brown ordered the United States\u2019 suit consolidated with Bond\u2019s, and a three-judge district court held a hearing on the two cases on January 30, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-4\">After the hearing, the three-judge district court entered a partial consent order on January 31, 1973. That order found the 1971 Georgia statute invalid, enjoined implementation of the at-large election system without compliance with Section 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ordered new county commissioner elections in 1974, and reserved the question of the proper procedures for the 1974 elections. On October 29, 1973 the three-judge district court determined that the only issue remaining was the proper procedure to be used for conducting the 1974 and subsequent county commissioner elections. The three-judge court determined that a single judge district court could properly resolve that question and remanded the entire case to the initiating judge for further handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-7\">On January 7, 1974 the single-judge district court entered a final order requiring Twiggs County election officials to hold the 1974 general election on a district rather than a county wide basis. The district court then went on to consider Bond\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. The district judge denied the request for attorneys\u2019 fees finding that \u201cthis is not a statutory scheme that depends solely on enforcement by private citizens and that, therefore, contemplates the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to successful litigants to reimburse them for carrying their con-gressionally imposed enforcement burden.\u201d (A. 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-8\">Bond\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s refusal to award attorneys\u2019 fees presents two questions: whether the single-judge district court had jurisdiction to rule on the attorneys\u2019 fees question; and whether the court properly decided that question. We hold that the district court had jurisdiction and that attorneys\u2019 fees should have been awarded in this case. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the district court to determine the reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-9\">JURISDICTION OF THE SINGLE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b1493-10\">The three-judge court was convened under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, rather than under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>the Three-Judge Court Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 et seq. Thus we focus primarily on the congressional intent in enacting Section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-4\">The three-judge district court\u2019s October 29, 1973 order effectively determined the Section 5 controversy. The January 31, 1973 and the October 29, 1973 orders taken together hold that White et al. had violated Section 5 when they implemented the new procedures. Once the three-judge .district court made that determination, it fulfilled the congressional intent behind Section 5\u2019s three-judge court provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-5\">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 contained sweeping and innovative provisions designed to \u201cbanish the blight of racial discrimination in voting . . .\u201d South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 308, 86 S.Ct. 803, 808, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966). The statute reflects congressional recognition of the problems of federalism that the legislation posed. \u201cIn drafting \u00a7 5, Congress apparently concluded that if the governing authorities of a State differ with the Attorney General of the United States concerning the purpose or effect of a change in voting procedures, it is inappropriate to have that difference resolved by a single district judge. The clash between federal and state power and the potential disruption to state government are apparent. There is no less a clash and potential for disruption when a disagreement concerns whether a state enactment is subject to \u00a7 5. The result of both suits can be an injunction prohibiting the State from enforcing its election laws.\u201d Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 562-63, 89 S.Ct. 817, 830, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969). Congress did not explicitly provide for a private cause of action under Section 5. But in <em>Allen </em>the Court implied a private right of action, noting that \u201c[t]he guarantee of \u00a7 5 that no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with an unapproved new enactment subject to \u00a7 5, might well prove an empty promise unless the private citizen were allowed to seek judicial enforcement of the prohibition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 89 S.Ct. at 827. The Court found that the potential disruption of state election procedure warranted applying the three-judge court requirement to private suits under Section 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 560-63, 89 S.Ct. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-10\">But once the three-judge district court has determined that a violation of \u00a7 5 has occurred, and has issued the injunction, the congressional solution to the potentially disruptive effects of the federal-state conflict has been implemented. Under those circumstances, we think it proper for a three-judge district court constituted under \u00a7 5 to then remand the case to a single-judge district court to determine matters ancillary to the main proceeding. This procedural alternative minimizes the burden that the three-judge court requirement imposes on the federal judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1494-11\">We note that the Supreme Court has approved a similar practice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. In Public Service Comm. v. Brashear Freight Lines, 312 U.S. 621, 61 S.Ct. 784, 85 L.Ed. 1083 (1941), seventy-six interstate common carriers challenged the constitutionality of the Missouri Bus and Truck Law. A three-judge district court heard the constitutional claim, and upheld the statute. The state officials counterclaimed for damages. The Supreme Court held that the damages action should have been heard by a single district judge, rather than the three-judge court. 312 U.S. at 624-25, 61 S.Ct. 784. The Court noted that once the constitutional claim has been determined, then the congressional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>purpose in requiring a three-judge court had been satisfied. The <em>Brashear </em>case spawned an exception to \u00a7 2281 three-judge court jurisdiction, allowing a single-judge court to enforce the judgment of a three-judge court. <em>See </em>Hamilton v. Nakai, 453 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 945, 92 S.Ct. 2044, 32 L.Ed.2d 332; W. Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, (Wright, Ed.) \u00a7 52. The three-judge district court in this case performed its function under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act when it determined that there had been a violation of \u00a7 5. It then properly exercised its discretion when it remanded the case to the district court for enforcement of its decree, and for determination of the attorneys\u2019 fees question. This disposition effectuates congressional policy under \u00a7 5 yet minimizes the burden on the federal judiciary. <em>See </em>Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, 419 U.S. 90, 95 S.Ct. 289, 42 L.Ed.2d 249 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-5\">DENIAL OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-6\">An award of attorneys\u2019 fees is the exception rather than the rule in the federal judicial system. Under the so-called \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d attorneys\u2019 fees are not ordinarily recoverable in the absence of a statute or enforceable contract providing for them. F. D. Rich Co. v. United States Industrial Lumber Co., 417 U.S. 116, 124, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 2163, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974); Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714, 87 S.Ct. 1404, 18 L.Ed.2d 475 (1967). Three exceptions to the American Rule currently exist: (1) the \u201cobdurate, obstinate\u201d exception, Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973); Fairley v. Patterson, 493 F.2d 598 (5th Cir. 1974); (2) the common fund exception, Hall v. Cole, <em>supra; </em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970); and (3) the private attorneys general theory, Fairley v. Patterson, <em>supra; </em>Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-7\">The district court considered the applicability of the private attorneys general exception in rejecting Bond\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-9\">Plaintiffs also pray for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees citing cases including Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143 (5th Cir. 1971). As the presence of the United States as a party plaintiff demonstrates this is not a statutory scheme that depends solely on enforcement by private citizens and that therefore contemplates the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to successful litigants to reimburse them for carrying their congressionally imposed enforcement burden. The <em>Lee </em>case, as well as other similar cited cases, does not therefore demand or permit attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1495-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969) mandates a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1495-11\">In <em>Allen </em>the Supreme Court specifically addressed the question of private enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In implying a private right of action under \u00a7 5, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-12\">The achievement of the Act\u2019s laudable goal could be severely hampered, however, if each citizen were required to depend solely on litigation instituted at the discretion of the Attorney General. For example, the provisions of the Act extend to States and the <em>subdivisions thereof. </em>The Attorney General has a limited staff and often might be unable to uncover quickly new regulations and enactments passed at the varying levels of state government. It is consistent with the broad purpose of the Act to allow the individual citizen standing to insure that his city or county government complies with the \u00a7 5 approval requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1495-13\">393 U.S. at 556-57, 89 S.Ct. at 827. The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1495-14\">The guarantee of \u00a7 5 that no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with an unapproved new enactment subject to \u00a7 5, might well prove an empty promise unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>the private citizen were allowed to seek judicial enforcement of the prohibition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1496-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 557, 89 S.Ct. at 827. The district court\u2019s reasoning implies that in the absence of a specific provision for attorneys\u2019'Tees, a statutory scheme must depend <em>solely </em>on private enforcement for the private attorneys general exception to apply. The statutory schemes where courts have applied the private attorneys general concept have provisions for governmental enforcement, but courts have concluded that private enforcement is necessary to effectuate the congressional purpose. <em>See </em>J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964) (Securities Exchange Act of 1934); Burke v. Compania Mexicana de Aviacion, 433 F.2d 1031 (9th Cir. 1970) (Railway Labor Act); Note, Implying Civil Remedies from Federal Regulatory Statutes, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 285 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-6\">The considerations that the Supreme Court relied upon to imply a private right of action in <em>Allen </em>are also relevant in determining the propriety of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the private attorneys general exception. There is a need for private enforcement of Section 5, and awarding attorneys\u2019 fees encourages private enforcement actions. This is particularly vital here since damages are not available. <em>See </em>Lee v. Southern Home Sites Corp., 444 F.2d 143, 147-48 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-7\">Nor do we reach a different conclusion' because the Attorney General exercised his discretion and intervened in this particular suit. The Act\u2019s enforcement provisions state that the Attorney General \u201cmay institute ... an action\u201d or \u201cmay . . . file ... an application for an order\u201d. 42 U.S.C.1 \u00a7\u00a7 1973j(d) &amp; (e). The plaintiffs below challenged the Twiggs County procedures over two months before the Attorney General decided to institute suit. They sought to enjoin an election that was clearly invalid since the Attorney General had objected to the Twiggs County procedure. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. Depriving them of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case merely because the Attorney General decided to file suit just before the hearing on Bond\u2019s claim would certainly discourage private enforcement actions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-11\">The appellees contend that attorneys\u2019 fees should be denied in this case because they did not seriously contest the merits of Bond\u2019s claim. We cannot agree. Any cooperation on the part of the appellees tends to reduce the amount of work required to prove a \u00a7 5 violation, thereby reducing the amount of the proper award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-12\">Sierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974) is not inconsistent with the result we reach here. In that case, the Sierra Club sued the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the developers of the San Antonio Ranch project, charging violations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 et seq. The district court there awarded attorneys\u2019 fees, even though on the merits it exonerated the developer from any malfeasance. The court of appeals reversed, holding that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was improper where the developer had not breached any legal duty. 502 F.2d at 64 \u2014 66. In this case, Bond demonstrated that White and the other defendants below had not complied with their legal duties under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That breach of duty coupled with the need for private enforcement of Section 5 justifies awarding attorneys\u2019 fees here. Therefore we reverse and remand this case to the district court' to determine the proper award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1496-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1492-12\">. \u00a7 1973c.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1492-13\">\u201cWhenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under the first sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964, or whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under the second sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1968, such State or subdivision may institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>tion, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure: <em>Provided, </em>That such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, except that neither the Attorney General\u2019s failure to object nor a declaratory judgment entered under this section shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure.

Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966). But in <em>Allen, </em>the Court held that the \u00a7 14(b) restrictions do not apply to private suits under \u00a7 5.
