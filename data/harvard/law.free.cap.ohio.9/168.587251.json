From Butler. Upon trial before the jury, the plaintiff, amongst other evidenoe, offered a certified copy of a deed from * John Oleve Symmes to James Henry, dated the 10th of July, 1797, and attested by three witnesses. The deed was proven by one of the subscribing witnesses on the 8th of August, 1800, before Reynold Keen, who certifies that he is one of the associate judges of the court of Common Pleas of the city and county of Philadelphia. It was recorded in Hamilton county the 28th of August, 1800, while Butler constituted a part of that county. This deed was \u25a0 overruled by the court and a verdict taken for the defendant. The plaintiff now moves for a new trial because the deed was improperly rejected.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-8\">Milliken, Bebb, and G. J.

The deed was proven in Pennsylvania according to the laws of that state then in force; and the judge\u2019s certificate of his official character, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of it. Read\u2019s Dig. 89 ; 1 Ch. St. 168; 2 Ohio, 56 ; This deed having been recorded under the act of 20th of Jan. 1802, was, by that act, made valid. 1 Ch. St. 342, 3 ; 1 Kent.

And the act of the 20th of Jan. 1802, gives effect to all deeds which had been acknowledged or proved according to the laws of the state where the acknowledgment or proof was taken. This deed was acknowledged according to the laws of Pennsylvania; and, indeed, the law of June, 1795, under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>deed was executed, was itself adopted from the Pennsylvania code. The grgund of rejecting the deed, was simply that it did not appear from the certificate of the judge that he was an officer authorized to take the acknowledgment or proof. In Lessee of Johnston <em>v. </em>Haines, 2 Ohio, 55, it was decided, that where the person taking the acknowledgment of a deed, gives himself no official character in his certificate or subscription, the certificate is insufficient, and the registry of the deed irregular. In that ease it was not expressed in the acknowledgment, that the person taking it was an officer of any kind, and the name subscribed was without any official character. But in the present instance it does appear from the certificate, that the person taking proof of execution, was one of the associate judges of the county and city of Philadelphia. It was not necessary that the judge should say, in so many words, that he was authorized to take proof, when he stated a fact from which that inference is, irresistibly made. He states his official character, and the laws of Pennsylvania gave a person invested with that official character authority to take the acknowledgment or proof. No objection was taken to the deed in consequence of its being a copy from the recorder\u2019s office, nor could such objection be sustained, as the statute of 1831, makes such copies evidence. The deed, therefore, was improperly rejected, and a new trial must be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">N\u00e9w trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
