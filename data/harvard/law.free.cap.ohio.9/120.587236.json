If the intention be clear that the parties designed the deed as a present grant, it should be held a .conveyance, otherwise it is to be held a mere contract. 2 Wend. 433; 5 Wend. 26; 12 Wend. 156; 3 Johns, 419, 47, 389, 424; 5 Johns, 74; 10 Johns, 336; 4 Cruise Dig. 69. Where there is a present demise and a covenant for a future one, the paper is held a lease; but if there are no apt words of present demise, but provision for executing a lease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>then it is held a mere contract for a lease. 10 Johns. 337; 1 T.

A deed to convey the estate of a married woman, must be executed according to law, and show her ^intention to convey absolutely. 7 Ohio, pt. 1, 195; 9 Mass. 218; 13 Mass. 223; 3 Mason, 347. Judging of this paper, independent of legal decisions, we \u25a0should not hesitate to pronounce it a simple agreement to convey. No language can be better adapted to express such intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">2. The deed is not executed according to the laws of Ohio, to pass \u2022a legal title, except against Wetherbe and Dixon, for their curtesyThe law in force at the time of its execution, viz., the act of 20th \u25a0January,. 1802, 1 Ch. St. 342, requires deeds thereafter executed, to be <em>acknowledged </em>or <em>proven </em>according to the laws of Ohio, or of the place where executed. This deed has never been <em>acknowledged </em>or proven by Mrs. Dixon or Mrs. Wetherbe, and has but one subscribing witness. \u00abContracts by married women are void unless made in conformity with the statute. 6 Ohio, 335 ; 6 Wend, 9 ; Griff.

Whether the paper of the 20th November, 1804, is to be-regarded a deed, or a mere contract for one, depends upon the intention of the parties, apparent on the instrument. 12 Wend. 156 ; 2 Wend. 439; 3 Johns. 47; 5 Johns. 76 ; 1 Mass. 227. Judging by this rule, no one can suppose the parties expected any other deed. They acknowledge the money paid, and bind themselves, their heirs, etc., to resign, give up, and forever quit claim to Woodward, <em>all </em>their right and claim, etc., to the lots and the appurtenances. The parties evidently intended, to give up and quit claim forever, all their right, &amp;e., in the lots, and the \u25a0instrument seems sufficient to carry the design into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">2. As to the intention of Mrs. Wetherbe and Mrs. Dixon. Suppose \u25a0the paper a contract, and not as such binding upon married women, still in law, after thirty-five years, the contractee in quiet possession, -it is a clear unequivocal case, for the <em>presumption of a deed. </em>6 Bin. 419.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-8\">3. This deed executed according to the law of Massachusetts, where -it was made, binds all the parties to it. 9 Mass. 172, 220; 5 Mass. 463 ; 7 Mass. 20 ; 6 Pick. 87; 8 Pick. 32, 536. The abilities and \u25a0disabilities of married women are regulated by the law of their domdeil, which protects their persons. The form of legal t ties of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>estate is regulated by the <em>lex loci rei sitae, </em>but *the capacity of the married woman, and the forms which shall protect her incapacity from abuse, are fixed by the law of her domicil. Hence it is not important that our own statute shall have been complied with in executing this paper, as the form of execution to pass the wife\u2019s interest in. the land conforms to the law of Massachusetts. Story Conft. of L. 127; 8 Pick. 32, 536.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">4. But this deed is clearly within our statute. The act of 1802, intends to make valid, deeds executed in other states according to their law. This appears both from the object and language. A deed executed and acknowledged as this, in Massachusetts by a married woman, passes her interest in land, and as our law adopts the foreign <em>execution </em>and foreign <em>acknowledgement </em>both, the deed is good here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-6\">5. The shares claimed if not generally barred, are so as to lot 92, by partition in pais, evidenced by the conveyances and long continued occupancy by Dennison; and as to Mrs. Woodward\u2019s share she united in the deed, and with her husband has ever since continued to occupy other parts of the land, and she must be held to this partition unless relieved from it in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-7\">D. Van Matee, for the county.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AYP\">Lane, 0. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOh\">There is no doubt that Woodward expected to acquire the interest of Martha, Baehael, and Hannah, in the lots, by the deed of 1804. It is sometimes a nice matter to discriminate between an agreement to convey, and a present conveyance : but whore the parties intend to pass the title, without any further act, the law will endeavor so to interpret their proceedings as to work this effect. In this transaction the contract of sale is made, the consideration paid, and a deed is given, sealed, acknowledged and recorded, and possession of the land held under it, for more than thirty years ; by which, the parties evidently meant to pass the title. Now a deed may be held to operate in any form of conveyance that will carry into execution the lawful objects of the makers. Whether the form be feoffment, grant, bargain and sale, or release, the deed may enure as either. 6 Mass. 32 ; 4 Kent C. 2d ed. 403. An instrument in the forms requisite for a deed, if it show a consideration paid, and an immediate contract to convey, takes effect in Massachusetts, as a deed of bargain and sale, because it raises a <em>use, </em>which is <em>executed </em>by the statute of uses. 3 Mass. 573 ; 6 Mass. 24; 7 Mass. 189. This deed, ti' erefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>though in form a ^release, is a substantive bargain and sale, and operates as an immediate conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">It is however claimed, that the deed is inoperative to pass the wives\u2019 estate, because it was acknowledged by the husbands only. The acknowledgement of a deed is not a part of the deed itself; it is required by law, either as evidence of execution, or as authority for registration. In deeds executed by the wife in our state, the law makes the acknowledgement the necessary evidence of the fact of sealing, and of freedom from constraint. This ceremony is adopted as a protection to married women ; but the legislature has not thought fit-to require the same solemnities in deeds executed abroad, but merely exacts a compliance with the forms required by the law of the place of execution. 1 Ch. St. 485, \u00a7 3. By the laws of Massachusetts, where these parties resided, and where this conveyance was made, we-find a deed signed by husband and wife, but acknowledged by the husband only, is an effectual transfer of the wife\u2019s property. 6 Mass. 541; 5 Mass. 438. It seems plain, therefore, that the grantors have complied with the Massachusetts forms, sufficiently to give effect to their deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The rights, therefore, of Hannah, Rachael and Martha, having-passed to Woodward by the deed of the 20th Nov. 1804, before their conveyance to the lessor of the plaintiff, it only remains to examine if he acquired any title from Abigail Woodward and Ilepsibeth Foster. They were married women, parties with their husbands in the petition-, for partition. In the case heretofore decided,.8 Ohio, 87, we held their interests were not extinguished by these proceedings, but were-restored to them or their heirs, after their husbands\u2019 deaths. They are now held by the lessor of the plaintiff, unless that portion in lot 92, was conveyed to M\u2019Clelland. His deed was made in 1808, by Woodward and Samuel Foster, conveying lot 92. No mention of the wives is made in the granting part or in the <em>covenants; </em>but in the: testatum clause, the grantors, together with their wives (each of whom, relinquishes her right of dower) set their names and seals, etc., and the instrument is duly executed by all. At the time of this conveyance, each husband held half of the lot, three-eighths in his own right,, and one-eighth in right of his wife ; and the rights of the wives were-likewise two-fold, viz. a vested remainder in an eighth, and a contingent dower interest in three-eighths. The words of the deed apply to-the dower only, and it is not for us to extend them beyond their plain; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>.\u2022meaning. The recovery of the plaintiff is, therefore, limited to the \u25a0two-eighths of Mrs. Woodward and Mrs. Foster.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
