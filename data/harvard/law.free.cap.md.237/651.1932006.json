A police officer testified that at about 6:00 A.M., the defendant was in an automobile with three others, all involved in the breaking and larceny according to the accomplice\u2019s testimony, and that the stolen goods were in the trunk of this car. This identity of the accused with the perpetrators is sufficient corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice to sustain the guilty verdicts. <em>McDowell v.
