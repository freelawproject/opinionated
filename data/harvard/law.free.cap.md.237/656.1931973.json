See <em>Raven v. State, </em>233 Md. 241, cert. den. 377 U.S. 947; <em>Titus v. Warden, </em>233 Md. 618; and cf. <em>Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 13 L.ed 2d 408, 85 S.Ct. 564. Furthermore, the contention merely poses a theoretical question without indicating what relevancy it has to the applicant and therefore presents no justiciable issue. Cf. <em>Sansbury v. Director, </em>237 Md. 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
