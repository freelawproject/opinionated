However, during a full evidentiary hearing on the legality, <em>vel non, </em>of the arrest, the officers testified that at the time of the arrest, they had in their possession an arrest warrant for appellant, it was read to him, and one officer remembered \u201ccepiing\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">This evidence is not contradicted, and no attack is made upon the validity of the arrest warrant. No citation of authority is necessary to sustain the proposition that an arrest made by police officers in executing a valid arrest warrant is lawful, both under state and federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">\n<em>Judgment and sentence affirmed, costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
