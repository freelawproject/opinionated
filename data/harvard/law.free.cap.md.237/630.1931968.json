They entered the apartment with the consent of the three occupants, including the appellant and, also with the consent of the occupants, searched the apartment. The search resulted in the discovery of a burnt bottom teaspoon and a bottle cap containing heroin. A hypodermic needle, two eye droppers and two needle holders were also found. Officer Robinson testified that the spoon and bottle cap were significant because used as \u201ccookers in the preparation of heroin\u201d. After receiving permission from the appellant, Officer Robinson examined the arms of the appellant for needle marks and counted four fresh needle marks in the bend of her left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The appellant denied that she was using dope herself but indicated that one of the other women had used it in her presence. She testified that she had used narcotics several days before for the first time and that all four needle marks on her arm were four days old. She admitted that she knew where the narcotics paraphernalia were kept in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The trial judge, in weighing the testimony accepted the testimony of Officer Robinson that the needle marks were \u201cfresh\u201d marks and the inferences legitimately drawn from this testimony. He did not accept the testimony of the appellant to the contrary. As the trier of fact he was entitled to do this. The credibility of the witnesses was for his determination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
