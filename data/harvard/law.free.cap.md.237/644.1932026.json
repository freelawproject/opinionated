Supp.), Art. 27, sec. 645-1, Maryland Rule BK 46 a, Code (1957), Art. 94, sec. 2, and because the application does not contain a statement of reasons why the lower court\u2019s order should be reversed, in compliance with Rule BK 46 b, we have considered the contentions of the applicant which were before the court below because of the seriousness of the crime involved (murder). However, we find no merit in any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Judge Cullen adequately answered the applicant\u2019s contentions except that in regard to one relating to alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Criminal Court of Baltimore to convict, he seemed to imply that such a question is not properly raised in a post conviction proceeding. The statute provides that the issue of jurisdiction may he raised in a post conviction proceeding, Code (1964 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, sec. 645A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
