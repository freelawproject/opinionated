The record before us discloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that at the trial below the appellant made no motion for directed verdict at any time, nor were there any objections made to any of the court\u2019s instructions or refusals to instruct. Likewise, the appellant does not complain in this appeal of any rulings made by the court on any objections made by her during the trial. Under these circumstances this Court on review will not consider the questions presented by the appellant. Maryland Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\">What the appellant really sought here was a review of the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial. There is nothing in the record to justify departure from the usual rule that this Court will not pass upon the trial court\u2019s action in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
