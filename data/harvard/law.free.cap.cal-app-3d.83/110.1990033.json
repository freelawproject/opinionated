A.), P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">These three actions consist of a personal injury action and two wrongful death actions, all arising out of the same accident. The three matters were consolidated for the purpose of trial. The principal issues on this appeal arise by reason of comparative fault and partial indemnity guidelines enunciated in the seminal cases of <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393] and <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899]. The cases were tried in the <em>post-Li pre-American Motorcycle </em>milieu and were pending on appeal to this court when <em>American Motorcycle </em>came down.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">These cases stem from an off-highway motorcycle accident which occurred on private property of Modesto Irrigation District. Ernest Harding, deceased, aged 15 years, was operating a motorcycle upon which Wade Wroten, deceased, aged 16 years, and Richard Lemos, aged 18 years, were passengers. Involved in the occurrence were three other motorcycles operated by defendants Matt Kellstrom, John Eichel and Allen Lionudakis.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Plaintiffs George W. Harding and Doris J. Harding, parents of deceased Ernest Harding, and Frank D. Wroten and Denzel Ray Wroten, parents of deceased Wade Wroten, filed wrongful death suits against Kellstrom, Eichel and Lionudakis and their parents, Modesto Irrigation District, and John Applegate, owner of the motorcycle Harding was operating.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Plaintiff Richard Lemos filed an action for personal injuries against the same defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">No cross-complaints were filed against the plaintiffs Lemos, Wroten or Harding, nor have any of the defendants sought indemnity by way of cross-complaint against the party defendants or nonparties.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Before trial plaintiffs Lemos and Wroten settled their respective claims against the defendants Modesto Irrigation District and John Applegate for the total sum of $19,000. By agreement the sum was allocated $14,250 to Wroten and $4,750 to Lemos. These settlements were made pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 877.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No one contends that the settlements were not consummated in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A special verdict returned by the jury found that \u201c[w]ithout taking into consideration the question of reduction of damages due to the negligence of the plaintiff or of the deceaseds\u201d the total amounts of damages suffered by each of the plaintiffs as a proximate result of the accident were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">Plaintiff Lemos .............................................................. $16,556.45</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">Plaintiffs Harding ............................................................ 31,367.06</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">Plaintiffs Wroten ............................................................ 47,715.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The jury also found that negligence of plaintiff Lemos or the decedents or other persons \u201ccontributed as a proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The jury was asked: \u201cThe combined negligence of the plaintiff, the deceaseds, the defendants and of other persons whose negligence proximately contributed to the injury being 100%, what proportion of such combined negligence is attributable to the plaintiff, what proportion of such combined negligence is attributable to each of the deceased, what proportion is attributable to each of the defendants, and what proportion is attributable to each of the other persons?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The answer was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">Plaintiff Richard Lemos .............................................. 10 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A02\">Decedent Wade Wroten .............................................. 10 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APe1\">Decedent Ernest Harding ............................................ 33 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO9\">Defendant Matt Kellstrom .......................................... 10 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADB\">Defendant John Eichel ................................................ 30 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIN\">Defendant Allen Lionudakis ........................................ 2 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-v\">Defendant John Applegate ............................................ 5 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3BL\">Defendant Modesto Irrigation District ...................... 0 percent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvJ\">Total 100 percent</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">Based on the special verdict, the trial court entered judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">\n<em>In Favor of:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEt\">\n<em>Against: Lemos Wroten Harding</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\">Eichel $3,541.94 $10,039.50 $9,410.12</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkE\">Kellstrom $1,180.65 $ 3,346.50 $3,136.71</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZF\">Lionudakis $ 236.12 $ 699.30 $ 627.34</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">The plaintiffs appealed, urging that the liability of each defendant is joint and several for the entire sum awarded to each plaintiff less each plaintiff\u2019s settlement (where applicable) and less each plaintiff\u2019s comparative fault. Defendants\u2019 cross-appeals urge that the costs should be apportioned according to fault. Since the decision in <em>American Motorcycle </em>was filed defendants have filed a supplemental brief urging that the fault of each plaintiff should be charged to the others and that the causes should be reversed for retrial to permit the defendants to protect themselves by way of cross-complaints for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">It is apparent in each instance that in arriving at the above dollar amounts the trial court assessed damages against each defendant in proportion to that defendant\u2019s fault as found by the jury and in the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of Lemos and Wroten the court deducted the pretrial settlement before applying the defendants\u2019 fault percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In sum <em>American Motorcycle </em>holds that the \u201cjoint and several liability\u201d doctrine (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 875) is not abolished or contracted by <em>Li\u2019s </em>adoption of the comparative negligence system; each tortfeasor whose negligence is a proximate cause of an indivisible injury remains individually liable for all compensable damages attributable to that injury.  The common law equitable indemnity doctrine is modified to permit a tortfeasor to obtain partial indemnity from other tortfeasors; a defendant who is liable to a plaintiff may file a cross-complaint against other tortfeasors, whether or not already parties in the action, to obtain partial indemnity from them on a comparative fault basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">It is apparent that <em>American Motorcycle </em>requires that the judgments be reversed for the purpose of entering joint and several judgments against Kellstrom, Eichel and Lionudakis.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In this regard appellants argue that the injuries to the plaintiffs are indivisible and incapable of being apportioned \u201cwhere there is concerted action among multiple plaintiffs which is causative in nature and incapable of logical division.\u201d The basic flaw in this position is that none of the plaintiffs sued the other plaintiffs, and the issue as to the amount of fault, if any, of one plaintiff which may have contributed to the injury to any other plaintiff was not before the court, was not an issue in the case, and was not adjudicated. The court in <em>American Motorcycle </em>recognized the distinction between fault contributing to one\u2019s own injuries and fault causing injuries to another. In this regard the court stated: \u201cMoreover, even when a plaintiff is partially at fault for his own injury, a plaintiff\u2019s culpability is not equivalent to that of a defendant. In this setting, a plaintiff\u2019s negligence relates only to a failure to use due care for his own protection, while a defendant\u2019s negligence relates to a lack of due care for the safety of others. Although we recognized in <em>Li </em>that a plaintiff\u2019s self-directed negligence would justify reducing his recovery in proportion to his degree of fault for the accident, the fact remains that insofar as the plaintiff\u2019s conduct creates only a risk of self-injury, such conduct, unlike that of a negligent defendant, is not tortious. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at pp. 589-590; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Moreover, <em>American Motorcycle </em>cites with approval BAJI No. 14.90 (see fn. 2, p. 590) and it is obvious from the wording of that instruction and the other BAJI instructions devised for use in comparative fault cases that the individual plaintiff\u2019s fault is to be compared to that of all others who have been found to have contributed to that plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The individual plaintiff\u2019s award should not be reduced by the fault of a coplaintiff in the absence of the pleading and proof of a legal relationship between them which requires such fault to be imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">It follows that the percentage of contributory fault to be deducted from each plaintiff\u2019s award is the percentage of fault attributable to that plaintiff as found by the juiy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The next issue is whether the pretrial settlement received by Lemos and Wroten should be deducted from the total damages suffered by each of those plaintiffs before or after the reduction of the total damages by the percentage of fault attributable to that plaintiff. In each instance if the amount of the settlement is deducted first the amount by which the plaintiff\u2019s total damage will be reduced is less than if the percentage of fault is applied to the total damage figure first. Thus in the case of Lemos, for example, the net judgment under the former method is $10,625.80 ($16,556.45 minus $4,750 less 10 percent) as compared to $10,150.80 ($16,556.45 less 10 percent minus $4,750) under the latter method.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">There apparently are no decided cases on this point. The language of Code of Civil Procedure section 877 (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>is of no help. Applying the percentage reduction to the total damage before deducting the settlement more closely complies with the <em>Li </em>test by reducing the plaintiff\u2019s damages \u201cin proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person recovering.\u201d <em>(Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 829.) Thus, deducting the settlement first in effect reduces the fault percentage below that found by the jury. In the Lemos case, <em>ante, </em>for example, deducting the settlement first would cause Lemos\u2019 total damage to be reduced by only 7 percent rather than 10 percent as found by the jury. Accordingly, we conclude that the correct procedure is to apply each plaintiff\u2019s contributory fault percentage reduction to the total damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and reduce the resulting figure by the amount of that plaintiff\u2019s pretrial settlement. (See Peyrat, <em>Comparative Fault\u2014Three Years After Li, </em>CJER J. (spring 1978) p. C.129, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28, 29, pp. C.142-C.143.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Defendants argue further that the costs recoverable under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 should be apportioned in accordance with fault. This contention has been answered adversely to the defendants\u2019 contention in <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Sierra Boat Co. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 325, 347 [145 Cal.Rptr. 47], The reasoning and conclusions of that case that costs should not be apportioned according to fault are sound and we concur with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Lastly, defendants urge that this cause be reversed for the purpose of \u201cfurther proceedings in accord with the newly enunciated principles of partial indemnification.\u201d Apparently defendants are asking that this court reverse the plaintiffs\u2019 judgments in order to permit them (the defendants) to protect themselves by filing appropriate cross-complaints for indemnification. The defendants, however, did not preserve the issue of indemnification at any stage of the proceedings and there are not presently before us any pleadings or motions in this regard that were presented to or passed upon by the trial court. In discussing the retrospective application of <em>American Motorcycle </em>the court in <em>Safeway Stores </em>v. <em>Nest-Kart, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 322, seems to make the retrospective application of the indemnity principle enunciated in <em>American Motorcycle </em>to cases pending on appeal dependent upon whether \u201c. . . the issue of comparative contribution or indemnity has been properly preserved below, . . .\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 333), stating \u201c[w]e have no reason to suspect that the application of <em>American Motorcycle </em>to those cases in which the comparative contribution or comparative indemnity question has been properly preserved, at trial and on appeal\" will result in such a serious disruption of the administration of justice so as to warrant denying the benefits of the <em>American Motorcycle </em>doctrine to those defendants who have diligently pursued the issue.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 334; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Accordingly, we decline to reverse for any purpose other than to enter appropriate joint and several judgments against the defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded with directions to the trial court to enter a joint and several judgment in favor of the plaintiff or plaintiffs in each case against the defendants Kellstrom, Eichel and Lionudakis for the amount of the plaintiff or plaintiffs\u2019 total damages as found by the jury, reduced only by the percent of comparative fault attributable to the plaintiff or plaintiffs whose damages are being calculated, and reduced further by the amount of any pretrial settlement applicable, all in accordance with this opinion.
