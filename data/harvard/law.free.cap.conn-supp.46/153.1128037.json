(Hamilton), and Mark Bond, filed their original motion to strike on December 7, 1998; an objection by the plaintiff, David A. Bogdahn, administrator of the estate of Paul E. Pelletier, was filed on February 9, 1999. The defendants filed a reply brief on April 23,1999. On May 3,1999, this court allowed the plaintiff two weeks to respond to the defendants\u2019 reply brief and allowed the defendants one week thereafter to reply to the plaintiffs brief. On May 14, 1999, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On June 29, 1999, at a hearing before this court, the court granted permission to file the aforementioned amended complaint, there having been no objection thereto. On May 14, 1999, the plaintiff filed his reply memorandum in further support of his objection to the motion to strike, and, after an extension of time was granted Hamilton and Bond filed a supplemental memorandum dated June 1, 1999, in further support of their motion to strike. Oral argument was heard before this court on June 29,1999. The memorandum filed by Hamilton and Bond dated June 1,1999, urges the court to strike the first and fourth counts of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The first count, as to Hamilton only, alleges that Pelletier was an employee of Hamilton. On June 1, 1994, Pelletier filed a complaint of sexual harassment and discrimination based upon sexual orientation with the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission). Following the suicide of Pelletier on June 16, 1994, this action was brought by the plaintiff, who is the administrator of Pelletier\u2019s estate. The decedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Pelletier, was a homosexual. He had complained to Hamilton of sexual harassment and sexual discrimination based upon his sexual orientation. Pelletier was continuously harassed by Bond and the defendant Bruce McGarry from the fall of 1993 through June 1, 1994. Bond and McGarry were employees of Hamilton at all times relevant hereto. It is alleged that Bond and McGarry ridiculed and harassed Pelletier Because of his sexual orientation. He was called derogatory names such as \u201cfaggot\u201d by McGarry and Bond, and, on repeated occasions in the spring of 1994, the mens\u2019 room at Hamilton was defaced with derogatory slurs related to Pelletier\u2019s sexual orientation. Not only did Pelletier file a complaint with the commission on June 1, 1994, but he had also complained to Hamilton about these actions by Bond and McGarry. The claim against Hamilton is that it discriminated against Pelletier in terms, conditions or privileges of employment by failing to protect him properly against sexual orientation discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-81c (1), and failed to protect him properly against the infliction of sexual orientation discrimination in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-60 (5). The plaintiff claims that Pelletier committed suicide on June 16, 1994, as a direct result of the sexual harassment and discrimination previously described.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The fourth count as to Bond only alleges that he was an employee of Hamilton and that between September, 1993 and June, 1994, he conspired with McGarry to harass, ridicule, discriminate, batter and cause injury to Pelletier based upon his sexual orientation. It is further alleged that the actions taken by Bond were done as an agent of Hamilton. These actions, it is claimed, violate \u00a7\u00a7 46a~60 (5) and (8) and 46a-81c (1). Hamilton and Bond have jointly moved to strike count one against Hamilton and count four against Bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion to strike is to contest . . . the legal sufficiency of the allegations of any complaint ... to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Novametrix Medical Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>BOC Group, Inc., </em>224 Conn. 210, 214-15, 618 A.2d 25 (1992). \u201cIn ruling on a motion to strike, the court is limited to the facts alleged in the complaint. The court must construe the facts in the complaint most favorably to the plaintiff.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The first basis for the defendants\u2019 motion to strike is that the plaintiffs claims pursuant to \u00a7 46a-60 were not alleged in the administrative complaint that Pelletier brought to the commission. The defendants claim that the administrative complaint fails because \u00a7 46a-60 was not mentioned in it. This argument, however, flies in the face of \u00a7 46a-54-52 (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides: \u201cA timely filed complaint under oath is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making the complaint a written statement sufficiently precise to identify the parties and to describe <em>generally </em>the action or practices complained of which have occurred, are occurring or are about to occur and when\u201d; (emphasis added); as well as General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82 (a), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged discriminatory practice, except for an alleged violation of \u00a7 46a-68, may, by himself or his attorney, make, sign and file with the commission a complaint in writing under oath, which shall state the name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>address of the person alleged to have committed the discriminatory practice, and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by the commission . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Nowhere in the statute or regulation is there a requirement that the specific statute be named.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Further, it is clear that these requirements must be liberally interpreted. The court has reviewed the administrative complaint and finds that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements with sufficient specificity. It describes the sexual discrimination as being based on sexual orientation and even cites \u00a7 46a-81c (1). Section 46a-81c (1) provides: \u201cIt shall be a discriminatory practice in violation of this section . . . For an employer, by himself or his agent, except in the case of a bona fide occupational qualification or need, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment any individual or to <em>discriminate against him </em>in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment <em>because of the individual\u2019s sexual orientation . . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defendants\u2019 claim that the administrative complaint could not have been asserted under \u00a7 46a-60 is without merit. Section 46a-60 (a) (5) provides that it is a prohibited discriminatory employment practice: \u201cFor any person, whether an employer or an employee or not, to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared to be a discriminatory employment practice or to attempt to do so ... .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (7) defines discriminatory employment practice as \u201cany discriminatory practice specified in section 46a-60 or 46a-81c.\u201d As noted previously, \u00a7 46a-81c (1) provides that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a discriminatory employment practice. It is true that \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5) does mention that it is discriminatory \u201cto aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the doing of any act declared to be a discriminatory employment practice or to attempt to do so . . . .\u201d Paragraph 6b. of Pelletier\u2019s administrative complaint, however, states in pertinent part: \u201cRespondent Mark Bond, individually . . . and [Hamilton], by and through their employee, servant or agent, Mark Bond . . . have ratified, endorsed and <em>perpetrated </em>respondent, Bruce McGany\u2019s, actions.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court finds these words in the administrative complaint, again interpreted on a liberal basis, are made with sufficient specificity to qualify as aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">This court also finds that the complaint in this action cites \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5) and \u00a7 46a-81c (1). As stated previously, there is a specific reference in the administrative complaint to \u00a7 46a-81c (1), and because of the relationship of the statutes mentioned, \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5) is also included in the administrative complaint. Finally, there is the Second Circuit Court of Appeals case of <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Avco Corp., </em>964 F.2d 1330, 1334 (2d Cir. 1992), in which the court found that it did have jurisdiction over those claims that are reasonably related to the allegations in the plaintiffs administrative complaint, and further found that a claim is reasonably related to the plaintiffs administrative complaint if it is within the \u201cscope of the [administrative] investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This court finds that the allegations of the complaint are reasonably related to the allegations in Pelletier\u2019s administrative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Next, the defendants argue that the plaintiff did not have a private cause of action because the release granted by the commission was issued pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82b. According to the complaint, Pelletier filed a complaint with the commission on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>1, 1994. The plaintiff requested a release to sue from the commission by a letter dated November 27, 1996. The commission granted a release to sue to the plaintiff on January 2, 1997, pursuant to \u00a7 46a-82b.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">By Public Acts 1998, No. 98-245, \u00a7 6 (P.A. 98-245), the Connecticut General Assembly revised General Statutes \u00a7 46a-100 to provide in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who has timely filed a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities in accordance with section 46a-82 and who has obtained a release from the commission in accordance with section 46a-83a, as amended by this act, or 46a-101, as amended by this act, may also bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district in which the discriminatory practice is alleged to have occurred or in which the respondent transacts business . . . .\u201d With the current revision, a party is not limited to the forms of discrimination listed in \u00a7 46a-60 in order to bring an action before the Superior Court for a discriminatory practice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A claim under \u00a7 46a-81c may also be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The defendants claim that the plaintiff did not have a valid cause of action when he originally filed suit in both federal and state court. The defendants argue that the legislature did not intend to permit a cause of action that was improperly before the court to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u201cIt is an axiom of statutory construction that legislative intent is to be determined by an analysis of the language actually used in the legislation.\u201d <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>618 A.2d 1340 (1993). In ascertaining the legislature\u2019s intent, the court must be \u201cmindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d Id. Applying these principles to the present case, it is apparent that the legislature intended to allow a cause of action to proceed which was brought before the effective date of the statute. Public Act 98-245, \u00a7 14, provides that the changes included in \u00a7 46a-100 are applicable to \u201call cases pending with the commission or in the courts . . . .\u201d Therefore, the plaintiffs action alleging a violation of \u00a7 46a-81c prior to P.A. 98-245 may be brought before the Superior Court because it was a case pending \u201cin the courts\u201d on the effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Additionally, the defendants argue that the legislature specifically excluded plaintiffs who received a release to sue under \u00a7 46a-82b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by specifically mentioning releases under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83a and 46a-101. The plaintiff contends that a release to sue under \u00a7 46a-82b is adequate because of the passage of P.A. 98-245. Our courts have consistently held that failure to comply with the conditions established by the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> forecloses a plaintiffs access to judicial relief, because it deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to hear his complaint. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>196 Conn. 208, 217-18,491 A.2d 1096 (1985). In the present case, the plaintiff received a release to sue pursuant to \u00a7 46a-82b, not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>release under \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83a or 46a-101. Section 46a-83a provides for a release to appeal after the commission has dismissed an administrative complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 46a-101 provides for the commission to issue a release to sue upon the expiration of 210 days without a ruling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While courts must ordinarily give a strict construction to a statutory cause of action, the plaintiff should not be deprived of his cause of action because the legislature was imprecise in its statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">A release under \u00a7 46a-82b would be meaningless if the court adopted the defendants\u2019 reasoning. According to the terms of \u00a7 46a-82b (b), a \u201ccomplainant may bring a civil action in accordance with the provisions of [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 46a-100, 46a-101, 46a-103 and 46a-104 . ...\u201d At all relevant times, \u00a7 46a-100 limited the bringing of a civil action to actions that had a release to sue under certain statutory sections, and never cited \u00a7 46a-82b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since \u00a7 46a-82b would have applicability to actions filed with the commission prior to January 1, 1996, it is an understandable oversight that the legislature failed to include such releases within \u00a7 46a-100. If the court adopted the defendants\u2019 reasoning, any action pursuant to a release to sue under \u00a7 46a-82b, whether filed prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>to or subsequent to the adoption of P.A. 98-245, could not be brought because \u00a7 46a-100 did not provide for a release to sue under \u00a7 46a-82b.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">It is apparent that there are inconsistencies regarding releases to sue within the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act. For example, \u00a7 46a-101 (a) stated at all relevant times: \u201cNo action may be brought in accordance with section 46a-100 unless the complainant has received a release from the commission in accordance with the provisions <em>of this section.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) This language could even foreclose an action brought under \u00a7 46a-83a, a statutory section specifically included within \u00a7 46a-100. In light of this oversight by the legislature and the foregoing analysis, it seems apparent that the legislature did not intend to bar an action brought with a release to sue under \u00a7 46a-82b. Instead, the legislature provided for a civil action in the case of an appeal of a commission ruling or the expiration of a statutory time limitation without including every section that provides for a release to sue in \u00a7 46a-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Alternatively, under \u00a7 46a-82b, the commission was mandated to release the complaint allowing the plaintiff to sue in Superior Court if it had not acted by January 1, 1997. Accordingly, the commission did issue such a release on January 2, 1997, and tolled the statute of limitations. A private cause of action was authorized, therefore, even though P.A. 98-245 cited a release only in accordance with \u00a7 46a-83a and \u00a7 46a-101 because P.A. 98-245 had not taken effect at the time of the granting of the release on January 2, 1997. The release under \u00a7 46a-82b stands on its own and is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Assuming, arguendo, that a release specifying \u00a7 46a-83a or \u00a7 46a-101 was required, based upon the legislative intent and scheme described previously, the plaintiff could, under P.A. 98-245, obtain a valid release under \u00a7 46a-82b.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Also, if there was a mistake by the commission in issuing the wrong release, it would be fundamentally unfair and contrary to the legislative intent to bar the plaintiff from proceeding with a private cause of action because of such mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Finally, \u00a7 46a-81c was adopted in 1991 and that cause of action by itself or through \u00a7 46a-60 (5) was a cause of action at all times relevant hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">For the foregoing reasons, this court concludes that the plaintiff did have and does have a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The third claim is that Bond is not a proper defendant under \u00a7\u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8) and 46a-81c. The plaintiff concedes that Bond is not a proper defendant under those sections. Under \u00a7 46a-60 (5), however, Bond may be held liable as an employee if he aided or abetted \u201cthe doing of any act declared to be a discriminatory employment practice or to attempt to do so.\u201d This court has already stated that the administrative complaint has, for all practical purposes, accused Bond of aiding and abetting the discriminatory act. The allegations of the complaint in this case include the claim that Bond \u201cconspired with the Defendant McGarry to harass, ridicule, discriminate, batter and cause injury to [Pelletier] based upon [Pelletier\u2019s] sexual orientation.\u201d As stated previously, a discriminatory employment practice includes discrimination because of sexual orientation, and although Bond may not be held liable solely under \u00a7 46a-81c, based upon the definition of discriminatory practice which includes, as described previously, discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>nation because of sexual orientation, Bond is liable under \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5). Although the violations of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8) and 46a-81c are not in and of themselves actionable, there is a valid cause of action against Bond as a result of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (5) and the definitions in the statutes that include sexual orientation under \u00a7 46a-81c under the terms of \u00a7 46a-60a (5). The allegations of the violation of \u00a7 46a-81c may, therefore, stand. Although the court does not find any basis for a violation of \u00a7 46a-60 (a) (8), it will not strike that portion of the complaint because the court should either strike or not strike the entire count.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">For all of the aforementioned reasons, the defendants\u2019 motion to strike the first and fourth counts of the amended complaint is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"> Prior to P.A. 98-245, General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46a-100 provided in relevant part: \u201cAny person who has timely filed a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities in accordance with section 46a-82, alleging a violation of section 46a-60 and who has obtained a release from the commission in accordance with section 46a-101, may also bring an action in the superior court for the judicial district in which the discriminatory practice is alleged to have occurred or in which the respondent transacts business . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82b (b) provides: \u201cIf the commission fails to issue a determination of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause on any such complaint not later than January 1, 1997, the executive director of the commission shall issue forthwith a release of the complaint from the commission, allowing the complainant to bring a civil action.
