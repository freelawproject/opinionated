The court finds that pursuant to \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B), an employee who steals property valued at $25 or less may not be disqualified for larceny but may be disqualified for wilful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>The administrator is specifically authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 31-249b to appeal from the board\u2019s final decision. The board is authorized pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-249c to appear as a party in any proceeding before a reviewing court. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 22-9, \u201c[s]uch appeals are heard by the court upon the certified copy of the record filed by the board.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The record in each case establishes that each of the claimants was discharged from their employment due to the theft of property with a value of $25 or less. Christina J. Bliven, a cashier at Staples, Inc., stole a lock worth $24.99. Christopher Jessup stole a pound of pastrami valued at $9.98 from his employer, Crown Super Market. Karen A. Solek, a clerk at Waldbaum Food Mart, stole $9.82 worth of groceries. Michael S. Kinlock, a dietary assistant at Fairfield Manor, stole food items from his employer\u2019s kitchen worth less than $25. Ronnie L. Leaks, a line cook at Chili\u2019s Grill and Bar, stole steaks worth $18. William F. Moffett stole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>less than $25 worth of beer from his employer, Hartford Distributors, Inc. Linda D. Wilson, a sales clerk at Follett College Stores Corporation, Inc., stole $5 worth of merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Such single incidents of petty larceny would not have constituted grounds for disqualification prior to the passage of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-323, which amended the disqualification statute, \u00a7 31-236. Prior to the 1995 amendment, disqualification would occur for \u201cfelonious conduct,\u201d larceny of currency or property whose value exceeds $25 or repeated wilful misconduct. Thus, under the latter scenario, single incidents of theft would not disqualify a fired employee from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Public Act 95-323, however, deleted the reference to \u201crepeated\u201d wilful misconduct and redefined \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d as \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, or a <em>single knowing </em>violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, when reasonably applied. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The position of the board is that petty larceny of property valued at $25 or less cannot constitute disqualification because of the plain language of our Unemployment Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 et seq., compels us to maintain the validity of the larceny provision and to find that a claimant cannot be disqualified under the wilful misconduct provision for stealing $25 or less of property or services.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The court rejects such construction of \u00a7 31-236 and finds it inconsistent with the clear language and structure of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Section 31-236 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cDisqualifications,\u201d sets forth in great detail disqualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>circumstances for unemployment compensation. Subsection (a) (1) of that statute deals with the applicant\u2019s unavailability for work. Subsection (a) (2) addresses the disqualifying termination scenarios. Under subsection (a) (2) (B), the disqualifying grounds are discharge for felonious conduct, for larceny of property or services valued at more than $25, larceny of any amount of currency, wilful misconduct in the course of employment, just cause or participation in an illegal strike.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The issue here is whether a theft of $25 or less of property or services, clearly not a disqualifying larceny, can constitute a disqualifying act of wilful misconduct. The answer must be yes. Prior to Public Act 95-323, repeated petty thefts could amount to repeated wilful misconduct. See <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Duncaster, Inc., </em>board case No. 1195-86-BP (November 6, 1986). Under the current provision, similarly repeated thefts would most clearly constitute wilful misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The obvious intent of the larceny provision is to lessen the penalty for a fired employee who has stolen something of small value. This, however, does not elevate such thefts to protected activity for which an employee would never be disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A somewhat analogous statutory structure and result is addressed in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 572, 418 A.2d 933 (1979). In that case, a tenured teacher who took a leave of absence faced termination of her employment. General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (b), now (d), set forth the grounds for terminating a teachers contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of employment. The six grounds listed in that statute included two relevant to the proceedings against the plaintiff in <em>Tucker, </em>\u201cinsubordination against reasonable rules of the board of education,\u201d and for \u201cother due and sufficient cause.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (b) (2) and (6), now (d) (2) and (6); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that the defendant board of education\u2019s denial of the leave request was a decision, not a \u201crule\u201d of the board. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 575. Thus, the contract could not be terminated for \u201c \u2018insubordination against reasonable rules of the board of education.\u2019 \u201d Id., 576. The defendant, however, successfully argued on appeal that the insubordination against its decision would constitute valid grounds under \u201cother due and sufficient cause.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (b) (6), now (d) (6). \u201cThe board contend[ed] that insubordination in and of itself constitutes \u2018other due and sufficient cause\u2019 for the termination of the plaintiffs contract and is a valid statutory basis for dismissal under the provisions of \u00a7 10-151 (b) (6) [now (d) (6)]. We agree with the board\u2019s contention.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 577; see also <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>190 Conn. 748, 750, 462 A.2d 385 (1983) (after remand, statutory analysis in <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 572, reviewed, approved).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Similar to the Teacher Tenure Act, \u00a7 10-151, the Unemployment Compensation Act, \u00a7 31-236, contains nothing to exclude from a general ground behavior of the character, if not the severity, of a separate, more specific ground. Insubordination, though not amounting to insubordination against reasonable rules \u201cdid constitute other due and sufficient cause.\u201d In these cases, larcenies though not meeting the ground of disqualification for larceny of over $25 value, could constitute \u201cwilful misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>This construction of \u00a7 31-236 is buttressed by consideration of the revised \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d definition from Public Act 95-323. The instances of petty larceny would have to be considered \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, or a single knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, when reasonably applied. General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The facts certified in <em>Gilliard v. Hartford Club, </em>board case No. 729-BR-96 (May 13. 1996), would meet the statutory wilful misconduct definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, the employee was observed concealing food items on her person, then placing them in her locker. The items were then found in the locker, and no explanation was offered by the employee. The employer\u2019s policy was to immediately dismiss any employee for stealing, regardless of the value of the items. The employee was provided a copy of the rule in writing. Other employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>had been discharged for violating the employer\u2019s rule against stealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The wilful misconduct inquiry references criteria different from the larceny provision. A demonstrated larceny of property valued at over $25 disqualifies a claimant. Wilful misconduct requires not only proof of the larceny, but the existence of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy. If minor pilferage had been tolerated in the past, then an employee for petty theft might not be disqualified. Such a defense would not seem to lie for the larceny disqualification. See <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 6, 675 A.2d 845 (1996) (statute must be read as whole and interpreted so as to give effect to all its provisions); <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990) (same); see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 116, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991) (statute is construed as whole and subsections read concurrently so that reasonable overall interpretation reached).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Contrary to the board\u2019s claim, the administrator\u2019s position does not read out or by implication repeal the larceny disqualification of \u00a7 31-236. It remains a valid ground for automatic disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are guided by well established principles, paramount among which is the principle that [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative histoiy and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 391, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The intent of Public Act 95-323 was to broaden the scope of disqualification, especially with respect to the nature of the termination. Petty larcenies that were not severe enough to invoke the larceny disqualification may be enough to invoke the wilful misconduct disqualification. The elimination of the \u201crepeated\u201d criteria from the \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d disqualification would logically affect the consequence of a single petty larceny. This is further evidenced by the revised definition of wilful misconduct. The requirement of reasonable and uniform application would seem to be the focus of the petty larceny cases. The larceny disqualification thus retains its vitality. An employer seeking to contest the qualification for compensation of an employee terminated for theft of $26 worth of property need only document the theft. If the property was worth $25 or less, the issue would be wilful misconduct. The burden of proof would include not only the theft, but a reasonable publicized and uniformly enforced policy, reasonably applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In its decision, the board ignores this construction of the statute and insists that the larceny provision must be amended to accomplish a disqualification for a larceny of $25 or less. The history of the larceny disqualification also is informative as to legislative intent. The original larceny disqualification, Public Acts 1981, No. 81-318, \u00a7 1, referenced larceny in the third degree. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124, larceny in the third degree, was a class B misdemeanor until such act was amended in 1982 by Public Act 1982, No. 82-271, \u00a7 3. In 1985, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-26 substituted $50 larceny for larceny in the third degree. In 1993, Public Acts 1993, No. 93-243, \u00a7 5, decreased the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>larceny disqualification from $50 to $25. In the court\u2019s view, Public Act 95-323 is a continuation of a legislative intent to further restrict unemployment compensation for cause related terminations. Now, a single incident of petty larceny may meet the standard of a wilful misconduct disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The board seeks in this review judicial deference to its statutory construction. These cases represent the board\u2019s initial application of the Public Act 95-323 revision. The interpretation and construction of a statute is uniquely the function of courts, not administrative agencies. <em>Bezzini </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>49 Conn. App. 432, 436, 715 A.2d 791 (1998); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 57-58, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991); <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Prof it Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the court finds the issues for the administrator. The appeal is sustained and the case is remanded to the board to vacate its decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\"> On January 5, 1998, the court, <em>Berger, J., </em>consolidated these seven appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-5\"> Practice Book \u00a7 22-9 provides: \u201c(a) Such appeals are heard by the court upon the certified copy of the record filed by the board. The court does not retry the facts or hear evidence. It considers no evidence other than that certified to it by the board, and then for the limited purpose of determining whether the finding should be corrected, or whether there was any evidence to support in law the conclusions reached. It cannot review the conclusions of the board when these depend upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. In addition to rendering judgment on the appeal, the court may order the board to remand the case to a referee for any further proceedings deemed necessary by the court. The court may remand the case to the board for proceedings de novo, or for further proceedings on the record, or for such limited purposes as the court may prescribe. The court may retain jurisdiction by ordering a return to the court of the proceedings conducted in accordance with the order of the court, or may order final disposition. A party aggrieved by a final disposition made in compliance with an order of the superior court may, by the filing of an appropriate motion, request the court to review the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\u201c(b) Corrections by the court of the board\u2019s finding will only be made upon the refusal to find a material fact which was an admitted or undisputed fact, upon the finding of a fact in language of doubtful meaning so that its real significance may not clearly appear, or upon the finding of a material fact without evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn individual shall be ineligible for benefits . . . (B) if, in the opinion of the administrator, he has been discharged or suspended for felonious conduct, conduct constituting larceny of property or service, the value of which exceeds twenty-live dollars, or larceny of currency, regardless of the value of such currency, wilful misconduct in the course of his employment, just cause, or participation in an illegal strike as determined by state or federal laws or regulations . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-5\"> The facts certified in <em>Gilliard </em>are as follows: \u201cThe claimant was employed as a part-time assistant server for the Hartford Club (hereinafter referred to as the employer) from September 22,1993, until her discharge on November 4,1995. Upon the filing of her original claim for benefits, the Administrator found the claimant eligible for benefits by a decision issued on December 20, 1995. The employer filed a timely appeal to the Appeals Referee. The Referee conducted a de novo hearing, at which only the employer appeared. The relevant findings of fact of this case are as follows: On November 4, 1995, the claimant\u2019s coworker reported to the kitchen storage area, concealed [items] on [her] person, and placed them in her locker. Based on the coworker\u2019s allegations, the employer\u2019s manager and one of its senior staff immediately began an investigation, which included an inspection of the claimant\u2019s locker. They discovered in the claimant\u2019s locker an unopened one-half gallon of milk and a small container of orange juice. The value of the food items was less than five dollars. When confronted, the claimant did not offer the employer any explanation for concealing the milk and orange juice in her locker. She was immediately discharged pursuant to the employer\u2019s policy, which provides that stealing from the employer is grounds for immediate dismissal regardless of the value of the item(s) stolen. The claimant was aware of the rule because it was contained in a package of written material that was given to the claimant upon hire. The employer had previously discharged other employees for violating its rule against stealing. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
