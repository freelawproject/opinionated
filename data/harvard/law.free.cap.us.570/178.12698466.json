But petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioner's shotgun. Petitioner was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer's question\n  suggested that he was guilty. Petitioner claims that this argument violated the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees that \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\"\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  Petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in response to the officer's question. It has long been settled that the privilege \"generally is not self-executing\" and that a witness who desires its protection \" 'must claim it.' \"\n  <em>\n   Minnesota v.

There were no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a dark-colored car. Police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene. The investigation led police to petitioner, who\n  had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed. Police visited petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway. He agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioner's interview with the police lasted approximately one hour. All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. See\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). For most of the interview, petitioner answered the officer's questions. But when asked whether his shotgun \"would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder,\" App. 17, petitioner declined to answer. Instead, petitioner \"[l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 18. After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants. Prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders, and he was released. A few days later, police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings. On the strength of that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge petitioner, but by this time he had absconded. In 2007, police discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an assumed name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner did not testify at trial. Over his objection, prosecutors used his reaction to the officer's question during the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt. The jury found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence. On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors' use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the Fifth Amendment. The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioner's prearrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   silence was not \"compelled\" within\n   the meaning of the\n   Fifth Amendment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315640\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/368/550/#p557\">\n    368 S.W.3d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557-559 (2011).

At the station, police took Salinas into what he describes as \"an interview room.\" Brief for Petitioner 3. Because he was \"free to leave at that time,\" App. 14, they did not give him\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. The police then asked Salinas questions. And Salinas answered until the police asked him whether the shotgun from his home \"would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 17. At that point Salinas fell silent.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Salinas was later tried for, and convicted of, murder. At closing argument, drawing on testimony he had elicited earlier, the prosecutor pointed out to the jury that Salinas, during his earlier questioning at the police station, had remained silent when asked about the shotgun. The prosecutor told the jury, among other things, that \" '[a]n innocent person' \" would have said, \" 'What are you talking about? I didn't do\n   that.

Thus, a prosecutor may not comment on a defendant's failure to testify at trial-even if neither the defendant nor anyone else ever mentions\n   a Fifth Amendment right not to do so.

Much depends on the circumstances of the particular case, the most important circumstances being: (1) whether one can fairly infer that the individual being questioned is invoking the Amendment's protection; (2) if that is unclear, whether it is particularly important for the questioner to know whether the individual is doing so; and (3) even if it is, whether, in any event, there is a good reason for excusing the individual from referring to the Fifth Amendment, such as inherent penalization simply by answering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Applying these principles to the present case, I would hold that Salinas need not have expressly invoked the Fifth Amendment. The context was that of a criminal investigation. Police told Salinas that and made clear that he was a suspect. His interrogation took place at the police station. Salinas was not represented by counsel. The relevant question-about whether the shotgun from Salinas' home would incriminate him-amounted to a switch in subject matter. And it was obvious that the new question sought to ferret out whether Salinas was guilty of murder. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315640\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/368/550/#p557\">\n    368 S.W.3d, at 552-553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   These circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference that Salinas' silence derived from an exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights. This Court has recognized repeatedly that many, indeed most, Americans are aware that they have a constitutional right not to incriminate themselves by answering questions posed by the police during an interrogation conducted in order to figure out the perpetrator of a crime.

The nature of the surroundings, the switch of topic, the particular question-all suggested that the right we have and generally\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   we have was at issue at the critical moment here. Salinas, not being represented by counsel, would not likely\n   have used the precise words \"Fifth Amendment\" to invoke his rights because he would not likely have been aware of technical legal requirements, such as a need to identify the Fifth Amendment by name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At the same time, the need to categorize Salinas' silence as based on the Fifth Amendment is supported here by the presence, in full force, of the predicament I discussed earlier, namely that of not forcing Salinas to choose between incrimination through speech and incrimination through silence. That need is also supported by the absence of any special reason that the police had to know, with certainty, whether Salinas was, in fact, relying on the Fifth Amendment-such as whether to doubt that there really was a risk of self-incrimination, see\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

That being so, for reasons similar to those given in\n   <em>\n    Griffin,\n   </em>\n   the Fifth Amendment bars the evidence of silence admitted against Salinas and mentioned by the prosecutor.

The critical question-whether those circumstances give rise to a fair inference that the silence rests on the Fifth Amendment-will not always prove easy to administer. But that consideration does not support the plurality's rule-based approach here, for the administrative problems accompanying the plurality's approach are even worse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The plurality says that a suspect must \"expressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2178.

How is simple silence in the present context any different?\n   The basic problem for the plurality is that an effort to have a simple, clear \"explicit statement\" rule poses a serious obstacle to those who, like Salinas, seek to assert their basic Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, for they are likely unaware of any such linguistic detail. At the same time, acknowledging that our case law does not require use of specific words, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2178, leaves the plurality without the administrative benefits it might hope to find in requiring that detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Far better, in my view, to pose the relevant question directly: Can one fairly infer from an individual's silence and surrounding circumstances an exercise of the Fifth Amendment's privilege? The need for simplicity, the constitutional importance of applying the Fifth Amendment to those who seek its protection, and this Court's case law all suggest\n   that this is the right question to ask here. And the answer to that question in the circumstances of today's case is clearly: yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For these reasons, I believe that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from commenting on Salinas's silence.

But we have never said that the government must demonstrate such a need on a case-by-case basis for the invocation requirement to apply. Any such rule would require judicial hypothesizing about the probable strategic choices of prosecutors, who often use immunity to compel testimony from witnesses who invoke the Fifth Amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
