Race is not itself assigned a numerical value for each applicant, but the University has committed itself to increasing racial minority enrollment on campus. It refers to this goal as a \"critical mass.\" Petitioner, who is Caucasian,\n   sued the University after her application was rejected. She contends that the University's use of race in the admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   The parties asked the Court to review whether the judgment below was consistent with \"this Court's decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including\n   <em>\n    Grutter v.

Because the Court of Appeals did not apply the correct standard of strict scrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the University was incorrect. That decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Located in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus of the Texas state university system, the University is one of the leading institutions of higher education in the Nation. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when petitioner sought admission to the University's entering class, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group 12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled. Petitioner was denied admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In recent years the University has used three different programs to evaluate candidates for admission. The first is the program it used for some years before 1997, when the University considered two factors: a numerical score reflecting an applicant's test scores and academic performance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the applicant's race. In 1996, this system was held unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. It ruled the University's consideration of race violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did not further any compelling government interest.\n   <em>\n    Hopwood v. Texas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94540\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/932/#p955\">\n    78 F.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955 (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The second program was adopted to comply with the\n   <em>\n    Hopwood\n   </em>\n   decision. The University stopped considering race in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic metric of a candidate's potential contribution to the University, to be used in conjunction with the Academic Index. This \"Personal Achievement Index\" (PAI) measures a student's leadership and work experience, awards, extracurricular activities, community service, and other special circumstances that give insight into a student's\n   background. These included growing up in a single-parent home, speaking a language other than English at home, significant family responsibilities assumed by the applicant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the student's family. Seeking to address the decline in minority enrollment after\n   <em>\n    Hopwood,\n   </em>\n   the University also expanded its outreach programs\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the\n   <em>\n    Hopwood\n   </em>\n   decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top Ten Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.803 (West 2009). Also referred to as H.B. 588, the Top Ten Percent Law grants automatic admission to any public state college, including the University, to all students in the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas that comply with certain standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The University's revised admissions process, coupled with the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in a more racially diverse environment at the University. Before the admissions program at issue in this case, in the last year under the post-\n   <em>\n    Hopwood\n   </em>\n   AI/PAI system that did not consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-American and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with the 1996 pre-\n   <em>\n    Hopwood\n   </em>\n   and Top Ten Percent regime, when race was explicitly considered, and the University's entering freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5% Hispanic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following this Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Grutter v. Bollinger,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897956\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/306/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gratz v. Bollinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/\">\n    539 U.S. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897864\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/244/\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), the University adopted a third admissions program, the 2004 program in which the University reverted to explicit consideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In\n   <em>\n    Grutter,\n   </em>\n   the Court upheld the use of race as one of many \"plus factors\" in an admissions program that considered the overall individual contribution of each candidate. In\n   <em>\n    Gratz,\n   </em>\n   by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michigan's undergraduate admissions program, which automatically awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The University's plan to resume race-conscious admissions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an internal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The Proposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset of undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24 students. It\n   showed that few of these classes had significant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addition the Proposal relied on what it called \"anecdotal\" reports from students regarding their \"interaction in the classroom.\" The Proposal concluded that the University lacked a \"critical mass\" of minority students and that to remedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit consideration to race in the undergraduate admissions program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To implement the Proposal the University included a student's race as a component of the PAI score, beginning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University asks students to classify themselves from among five predefined racial categories on the application. Race is not assigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed that race is a meaningful factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted on a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the Personal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid students are assigned to so-called cells based on their individual scores. All students in the cells falling above a certain line are admitted. All students below the line are not. Each college-such as Liberal Arts or Engineering-admits students separately. So a student is considered\n   initially for her first-choice college, then for her second choice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared major.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner applied for admission to the University's 2008 entering class and was rejected. She sued the University and various University officials in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged that the University's consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the University. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held that\n   <em>\n    Grutter\n   </em>\n   required courts to give substantial deference to the University, both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversity's\n   benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the University's admissions plan.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085519\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/213/#p217\">\n    631 F.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217-218 (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's request for rehearing en banc.

We take those cases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice Powell in\n   <em>\n    Bakke,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Bakke,\n   </em>\n   the Court considered a system used by the medical school of the University of California at Davis. From an entering class of 100 students the school had set aside 16 seats for minority applicants. In holding this program impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause Justice Powell's opinion stated certain basic premises. First, \"decisions based on race or ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state universities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (separate opinion). The principle of equal protection admits no \"artificial line of a 'two-class theory' \" that \"permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that accorded others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is therefore irrelevant that a system of racial preferences in admissions may seem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict scrutiny, for when government decisions \"touch upon an individual's race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a\n   judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest that could justify the consideration of race: the interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a compelling interest, because a university's \"broad mission [of] education\" is incompatible with making the \"judicial, legislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or statutory violations\" necessary to justify remedial racial classification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    at 307-309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769201\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/265/#p305\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast, serves values beyond race alone, including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes.

If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny, it would require Texas either to close the University or to stop discriminating against applicants based on their race. The Court has put other schools to that choice, and there is no reason to treat the University differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   It is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases, we rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those advanced\n   by the University today. The University asserts, for instance, that the diversity obtained through its discriminatory admissions program prepares its students to become leaders in a diverse society. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Brief for Respondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity \"prepares students to become the next generation of leaders in an increasingly diverse society\"). The segregationists likewise defended segregation on the ground that it provided more leadership opportunities for blacks. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Brief for Respondents in\n   <em>\n    Sweatt\n   </em>\n   96 (\"[A] very large group of Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate colleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as well-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the separate college offers him positive advantages; that there is a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate college; that there is a greater opportunity for full participation and for the development of leadership; that the Negro is inwardly more 'secure' at a college of his own people\"); Brief for Appellees in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   25-26 (\"The Negro child gets an opportunity to participate in segregated schools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-segregated schools. He is important, he holds offices, he is accepted by his fellows, he is on athletic teams, he has a full place there\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This argument was unavailing. It is irrelevant under the Fourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed schools produce better leaders. Indeed, no court today would accept the suggestion that segregation is permissible because historically black colleges produced Booker T. Washington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., and other prominent leaders. Likewise, the University's racial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that it will produce better leaders.\n   The University also asserts that student body diversity improves interracial relations. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Brief for Respondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes \"cross-racial understanding\" and breaks down racial and ethnic\n   stereotypes). In this argument, too, the University repeats arguments once marshaled in support of segregation. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Brief for Appellees in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   17 (\"Virginia has established segregation in certain fields as a part of her public policy to prevent violence and reduce resentment.

Instead, the University's discrimination has a pervasive shifting effect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World 145-146 (2004). The University admits minorities who otherwise would have attended less selective colleges where they would have been more evenly matched. But, as a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispanics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are placed in a position where underperformance is all but inevitable because they are less academically prepared than the white and Asian students with whom they must compete. Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-confidence of these overmatched students, there is no evidence that they learn more at the University than they would have learned at other schools for which they were better prepared. Indeed, they may learn less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court of Appeals believed that the University needed to enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained \"clustered in certain programs.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085519\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/213/#p217\">\n    631 F.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (C.A.5 2011) (\"[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate students in [the University's] College of Social Work are Hispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

There is some evidence that students admitted\n   as a result of racial discrimination are more likely to abandon their initial aspirations to become scientists and engineers than are students with similar qualifications who\n   attend less selective schools.
