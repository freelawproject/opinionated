By feigning car trouble, they tricked the manager to stop. Alleyne's accomplice approached the manager with a gun and demanded the store's deposits, which the manager surrendered. Alleyne was later charged with multiple federal offenses, including robbery affecting interstate commerce,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides, in relevant part, that anyone who \"uses or carries a firearm\" in relation to a \"crime of violence\" shall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n   \"(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury convicted Alleyne. The jury indicated on the verdict form that Alleyne had \"[u]sed or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,\" but did not indicate a finding that the firearm was \"[b]randished.\" App. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) count, which reflected the mandatory minimum sentence for cases in which a firearm has been \"brandished,\" \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Alleyne objected to this recommendation. He argued that it was clear from the verdict form that the jury did not find brandishing beyond a reasonable doubt and that he was subject only to the 5-year minimum for \"us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm.\" Alleyne contended that raising his mandatory minimum sentence based on a sentencing judge's finding that he brandished a firearm would violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District Court overruled Alleyne's objection. It explained that, under\n   <em>\n    Harris,\n   </em>\n   brandishing was a sentencing factor that the court could find by a preponderance of evidence without running afoul of the Constitution. It found that the evidence supported a finding of brandishing, and sentenced Alleyne to seven years' imprisonment on the \u00a7 924(c) count. The Court of Appeals affirmed, likewise noting that Alleyne's objection was foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=457%20Fed.%20Appx.%20348\">\n    457 Fed.Appx. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A.4 2011) (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Sixth Amendment provides that those \"accused\" of a \"crime\" have the right to a trial \"by an impartial jury.\" This right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The principal source of disagreement is the constitutional status of a special sort of fact known as a \"sentencing factor.\" This term was first used in\n   <em>\n    McMillan v. Pennsylvania,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    477 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), to refer to facts that are not found by a jury but that can still increase the defendant's punishment. Following\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   's introduction of this term, this Court has made a number of efforts to delimit its boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   initially invoked the distinction between \"elements\" and \"sentencing factors\" to reject a constitutional challenge to Pennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 9712 (1982). That law provided that anyone convicted of certain felonies would be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if the judge found, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person \" 'visibly possessed a firearm' \" in the course of committing specified crimes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    477 U.S., at 81, n. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the Court acknowledged that there were constitutional limits to the State's ability to \"defin[e] crimes and prescrib[e] penalties,\" it found that the Commonwealth had permissibly defined visible possession as a sentencing factor, rather than an element.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203837\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/79/#p86\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Court's view, this allowed the judge, rather than\n   the jury, to find this fact by a preponderance of evidence without violating the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   did not address whether legislatures' freedom to define facts as sentencing factors extended to findings that increased the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   term of imprisonment for an offense. We foreshadowed an answer to this question in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133049\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/227/#p243\">\n    526 U.S. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243, n. 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133049\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/227/#p243\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133049\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/227/#p243\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999), but did not resolve the issue until\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   . There, we identified a concrete limit on the types of facts that legislatures may designate as sentencing factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n   </em>\n   the defendant was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment under a New Jersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment from 10 years to 20 years if the trial judge found that the defendant committed his crime with racial bias.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S., at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In defending its sentencing scheme, the State of New Jersey argued that, under\n   <em>\n    McMillan,\n   </em>\n   the legislature could define racial bias as a sentencing factor to be found by the judge. We declined to extend\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   that far. We explained that there was no \"principled basis for treating\" a fact increasing the maximum term of imprisonment differently than the facts constituting the base offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S., at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The historic link between crime and punishment, instead, led us to conclude that any fact that increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an \" element\" of the offense to be found by the jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    at 483, n. 10, 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We, thus, found that Apprendi's sentence had been unconstitutionally enhanced by the judge's finding of racial bias by a preponderance of evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    at 491-492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   only concerned a judicial finding that increased the statutory maximum, the logic of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   prompted questions about the continuing vitality, if not validity, of\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   's holding that facts found to increase the mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors and not elements of the crime. We responded two years later in\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The mandatory minimum sentence based on the jury's verdict alone was five years, but the District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum sentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm. As in this case,\n   Harris challenged his sentence on the ground that the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n   </em>\n   even though the judge's finding did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was exposed.\n   <em>\n    Harris, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 551,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court declined to apply\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   to facts that increased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n    536 U.S., at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the Court's view, judicial factfinding that increased the mandatory minimum did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. Because the jury's verdict \"authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   the Court was of the view that the factual basis for increasing the minimum sentence was not \" 'essential' \" to the defendant's punishment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n    at 560-561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254843\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/545/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).

The dissent repeats this argument today. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2166 (opinion of ROBERTS, C.J.) (\"The jury's verdict authorized the judge to impose the precise sentence he imposed for the precise factual reason he imposed it\"). While undoubtedly true, this fact is beside the point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted, the essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is an element of the crime. When a finding of fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to aggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a\n   new offense and must be submitted to the jury. It is no answer to say that the defendant could have received the same sentence with or without that fact. It is obvious, for example, that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime are identical. One reason is that each crime has different elements and a defendant can be convicted only if the jury has found each element of the crime of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Similarly, because the fact of brandishing aggravates the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   have received if a different range had been applicable. Indeed, if a judge were to find a fact that increased the statutory maximum sentence, such a finding would violate the Sixth Amendment, even if the defendant ultimately received a sentence falling within the original sentencing range (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the range applicable without that aggravating fact).

No doubt, it would be illegitimate to overrule a precedent simply because the Court's current membership disagrees with it. But that is not a plausible account of the decision today. The Court overrules\n   <em>\n    McMillan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   because the reasoning of those decisions has been thoroughly undermined by intervening decisions and because no significant reliance interests are at stake that might justify adhering to their result.

In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n   </em>\n   for example, the defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried a maximum sentence of ten years. After his plea, however, the trial judge determined that the defendant had committed the crime with a biased purpose. Under a New Jersey law, that finding allowed the judge to impose up to ten additional years in prison. Exercising that authority, the judge sentenced the defendant to 12 years. 530 U.S., at 469-471,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Because the sentence was two years longer than would have been possible without the finding of bias, that finding was \"essential to the punishment\" imposed. 1 Bishop,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 50; see\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S., at 491-492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, under the majority's rule, in the absence of a statutory mandatory minimum, there would have been no constitutional problem had the judge, exercising the discretion given him by the jury's verdict, decided that seven years in prison was the appropriate penalty for the crime\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   his finding that the firearm had been brandished during the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In my view, that is enough to resolve this case.

As I have explained,\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   's constraint on the normal legislative control of criminal procedure draws its legitimacy from two primary principles: (1) common law understandings of\n   the \"elements\" of a crime, and (2) the need to preserve the jury as a \"strong barrier\" between defendants and the State. Neither of those principles supports the rule the majority adopts today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, there is no body of historical evidence supporting today's new rule. The majority does not identify a single case holding that a fact affecting only the sentencing floor qualified as an element or had to be found by a jury, nor does it point to any treatise language to that effect.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2158 - 2160. To be sure, the relatively recent vintage of mandatory minimum sentencing enhancements means that few, if any, 19th-century courts would have encountered such a fact pattern. So I do not mean to suggest that the absence of historical condemnation of the practice conclusively establishes its constitutionality today. But given that\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   's rule rests heavily on affirmative historical evidence about the practices to which we have previously applied it, the lack of such evidence on statutory minimums is a good reason not to extend it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Nor does the majority's extension of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   do anything to preserve the role of the jury as a safeguard between the defendant and the State. That is because even if a jury does not find that the firearm was brandished, a judge can do so and impose a harsher sentence because of his finding, so long as that sentence remains under the statutory maximum. The question here is about the power of judges, not juries. Under the rule in place until today, a legislature could tell judges that certain facts carried certain weight, and require the judge to devise a sentence based on that weight-so long as the sentence remained within the range authorized by the jury. Now, in the name of the jury right that formed a barrier between the defendant and the State, the majority has erected a barrier between judges and legislatures, establishing that discretionary sentencing\n   is the domain of judges. Legislatures must keep their respectful distance.\n   I find this new rule impossible to square with the historical understanding of the jury right as a defense\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   judges, not a defense\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   judges. See\n   <em>\n    Apprendi,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., concurring) (\"Judges, it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State\"). Just as the Sixth Amendment \"limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury,\"\n   <em>\n    Blakely,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S., at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , so too it limits\n   <em>\n    legislative\n   </em>\n   power only to the extent\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   power infringes on the province of the jury. Because the claimed infringement here is on the province of the judge, not the jury, the jury right has no work to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The majority offers several arguments to the contrary. I do not find them persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   First, the majority asserts that \"because the legally prescribed range\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   the penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2160 - 2161 (citation omitted). The syllogism trips out of the gate, for its first premise-that the constitutionally relevant \"penalty\" includes the bottom end of the statutory range-simply assumes the answer to the question presented. Neither of the historical sources to which the majority points gives an answer: The Bishop treatise speaks only to situations in which \"a statute prescribes a particular punishment,\" not a range of possible punishments. 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 598, at 360-361. The Wharton treatise is similarly unhelpful, focusing on statutes that change the maximum or alter the nature of the common law crime. See 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a7 371, p. 291 (rev. 7th ed. 1874). The sources provided in the\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   concurrence offer no support, for as already discussed, we lack historical evidence about the treatment of facts that altered\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the floor of a sentencing range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Second, the majority observes that \"criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2160 - 2161. Again, though, this simply assumes the core premise: That the constitutionally relevant \"penalty\" involves both the statutory minimum and the maximum. Unless one accepts that premise on faith, the fact that statutes have long specified both floor and ceiling is evidence of nothing more than that statutes have long specified both the floor and the ceiling. Nor does it help to say that \"the floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2161. The meaning of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on what wrongdoers care about most.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   More importantly, legal rules frequently focus on the maximum sentence while ignoring the minimum, even though both are \"relevant\" to punishment. Closest to this case, the question whether the jury right applies at all turns on whether the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   sentence exceeds six months-not, say, whether the minimum punishment involves time in prison.\n   <em>\n    Blanton v.

Examples of other distinctions turning only on maximum penalties abound, as in cases of recidivism enhancements that apply only to prior convictions with a maximum sentence of more than a specified number of years. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). That a minimum sentence is \"relevant\" to punishment, and that a statute defines it, does not mean it must be treated the same as the maximum sentence the law allows.\n   Third, the majority offers that \"it is impossible to dispute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor\n   <em>\n    aggravate\n   </em>\n   the punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2161. This argument proves too much, for it would apply with equal force to any fact which leads the judge, in the exercise of his own discretion, to choose a penalty higher than he otherwise would have chosen. The majority nowhere explains what it is about the jury right that bars a determination by Congress that brandishing (or any other fact) makes an offense worth two extra years, but not an identical determination by a judge. Simply calling one \"aggravation\" and the other \"discretion\" does not do the trick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Fourth, the majority argues that \"[i]t is no answer to say that the defendant could have received the same sentence with or without\" a particular factual finding, pointing out \"that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2162. In that hypothetical case, the legislature has chosen to define two crimes with two different sets of elements. Courts must, of course, respect that legislative judgment. But that tells us nothing about when courts can override the legislature's decision\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to create separate crimes, and instead to treat a particular fact as a trigger for a minimum sentence within the already-authorized range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I will not quibble with the majority's application of our\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   precedents.

First, that line of cases is predicated on a purported Sixth Amendment requirement that juries find facts that increase maximum penalties, not mandatory minimums. Accordingly, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent persuasively explains,\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2167 - 2171,\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    and its progeny have no impact on the distinct question resolved by\n    <em>\n     Harris,\n    </em>\n    which does not bear on the jury right. Second, the\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    line is now too intellectually incoherent to undermine any \"contrary\" precedents. If the rationale of\n    <em>\n     Apprendi\n    </em>\n    -which, as broadly construed by the Court in this case, is that \"[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an 'element' that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,\"\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2155 -were taken seriously, discretionary sentencing, as prescribed by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), should also be held to violate the Sixth Amendment.
