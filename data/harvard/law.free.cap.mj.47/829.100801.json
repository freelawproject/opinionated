Contrary to his pleas, he was convicted of one specification of wrongful distribution of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in violation of Article 112a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912a. The members sentenced appellant to a bad conduct discharge, 90 days confinement, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. Before this Court, Appellant has assigned two errors, one of which asserts that the Court lacks jurisdiction due to a judicial appointment in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This claim of error is rejected on the basis of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>Edmond v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 117 S. Ct. 1573, 137 L.Ed.2d 917 (1997), that this Court\u2019s judicial appointments are proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>In Ms other assignment of error, Appellant, whose adjudged sentence does not include forfeitures, contends that he was, nevertheless, wrongfully deprived of pay and allowances through the <em>ex post facto </em>application of Article 58b, UCMJ, 10 U.S.CA. \u00a7 858b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After briefs were filed and oral argument heard on tiiis assignment, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces issued its decision in <em>U.S. v. Gorski, </em>47 M.J. 370 (1997), holding that the automatic forfeiture provisions of Article 58b, UCMJ, violate the U.S. Constitution\u2019s proMbition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, when applied to an accused whose offenses preceded the effective date of the Article. That decision controls the outcome here, smce Appellant\u2019s offense was committed before the effective date of Article 58b. Accordmgly, any forfeiture of Appellant\u2019s pay and allowances pursuant to Article 58b, UCMJ, constitutes an <em>ex post facto </em>application of that Article warranting remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">With regard to the remedy, Appellant submits that \u201cthe only way tMs Court can act to ameliorate the deprivation [of pay] is to set aside the BCD, wMch would automatically set aside the automatic forfeitures,\u201d since application of Article 58b is linked to the imposition of the BCD.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s brief at 12. In response, the Government says that, \u201c[t]he fact that Appellant does not ask the court to set aside the Article 58b forfeitures evidences a concession that these forfeitures are not pumshment, nor part of Ms sentence, and not within the power of tMs court to modify.\u201d Government brief at 2, footnote 2. Consequently, according to the Government, \u201cAppellant\u2019s appeal on this issue is truly a claim for money damages agamst the Urnted States that has been brought in the Mcorreet forum.\u201d Government brief at 2. While these arguments may have some persuasive force, they have been overtaken by contrary action M <em>U.S. v. Gorski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">In <em>Gorski </em>the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces stated that the appropriate remedy does not affect the findings, the imposed sentence, or the action of the convening authority, extending, instead, only to recoupment of forfeitures taken in reliance on the provisions of Article 58b and 57(a)(1), 10 U.S.CA. \u00a7 857(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court declared illegal both the collection of any forfeitures under Article 58b, and the execution under Article 57(a)(1) of a reduction M grade prior to the date of the convemng authority\u2019s action. The Court then ordered restoration of forfeitures and all pay and allowances withheld as a result of the premature reduction. We will follow the lead of our Mgher Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Having determined that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and on the basis of the entire record should be approved, the findings and sentence approved below are affirmed. Collection of any forfeitures, and execution of the reduction in grade prior to the date of the convening authority\u2019s action are hereby declared illegal. Any forfeitures already collected from Appellant and any pay and allowances withheld because of the illegal reduction in grade will be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Judges KANTOR and WESTON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">. Appellant states that he has no documents to establish the' forfeitures, but presumes that they were automatically put into effect under the terms of Article 58b. He concedes that if the Government has proof that it failed to effectuate the automatic forfeiture provisions the assignment of error would be moot. Since nothing in this regard was presented by the Government, we have treated the assignment as presenting a viable issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. Article 58b, UCMJ provides for forfeiture of all pay and allowances during confinement of an accused whose general court-martial sentence includes confinement of six months or less <em>and </em>a punitive discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b864-7\">. Article 57(a)(1) changed the effective date for certain sentences from the date of the convening authority\u2019s action to the earlier of either that date or 14 days after sentence was adjudged. The Court in <em>Gorski </em>held that this provision, as it applied to the accused\u2019s reduction in pay grade, by causing it to be executed before action by the convening authority, was also an <em>ex post facto </em>violation of the law. Although not raised by Appellant, that issue is also present in the instant case, since Appellant\u2019s reduction in rate was presumably executed on 11 July 1996, 14 days after sentence was adjudged, rather than 6 November 1996, when the convening authority acted. Accordingly, we find such an earlier execution of the reduction to be an invalid <em>ex post facto </em>application of Article 57(a)(1), UCMJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b864-12\">. Although not raised in this case, the Government has filed pleadings in other cases before this Court asserting that the <em>Gorski </em>decision is inchoate, and should not be relied upon as precedent, since the period for filing a <em>writ of certiorari </em>with the U.S. Supreme Court has not expired. The Government contends that the <em>Gorski </em>decision is not binding precedent until the final outcome of that case is conclusively determined. We reject this contention, which flies in the face of numerous opinions of this Court which have relied upon a decision of our higher Court while that decision was pending final resolution by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. Carpenter, </em>37 M.J. 291 (CMA 1993), vacated, 515 U.S. 1138, 115 S.Ct. 2572, 132 L.Ed.2d 823 (1995); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>38 M.J. 608 (CGCMR 1993); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>41 M.J. 529, 530 (C.G.Ct.Crim.App.1994); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>U.S. v.
