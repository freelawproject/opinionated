He was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 10 years, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved these results, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion. On appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa-dedup-0\">WHETHER ERRORS IN THE SJA [STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATEOS RECOMMENDATION AND ADDENDUM THERETO (INCLUDING PREPARATION OF THE RECOMMENDATION BY TRIAL COUNSEL\u2019S SPOUSE AND ERRONEOUS ADVICE IN THE ADDENDUM TO THE EFFECT THAT LEGAL ERROR IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE BASIS FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION BY THE CONVENING AUTHORITY) NECESSITATE A NEW CONVENING AUTHORITY ACTION OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG5\">For the reasons discussed below, we hold that a new recommendation and action are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Prior to trial, Major (Maj) C represented the S JA\u2019s office in the negotiations with local civilian officials that resulted in military jurisdiction over the prosecution of this case. She also represented the Government at a hearing concerning pretrial confinement of appellant. Subsequently, she was designated as the Acting SJA for the command.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Following appellant\u2019s trial, Maj C prepared a draft post-trial recommendation to the convening authority. <em>See </em>Art. 60(d), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 860(d) (1983); RCM 1106, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). Prior to transmitting the recommendation, however, she decided to undertake research and consultation on the question whether she should transfer responsibility for preparing the recommendation to another attorney. She primarily was concerned about the fact that her husband had been trial counsel at appellant\u2019s court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Subsequently, she decided to transfer responsibility for the post-trial recommendation to another attorney in order to avoid any appearance of bias. Because she was scheduled to be away from her office during the following week for temporary duty, she asked Maj K \u2014 who would be Acting SJA in her stead \u2014 to take responsibility in her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Maj K prepared a recommendation and served it on appellant. <em>See </em>Art. 60(d); RCM 1106(f)(1). Apparently as a result of administrative inadvertence, Maj C\u2019s draft recommendation also was served on appellant. After examining the two versions, appellant\u2019s defense counsel observed that they nearly were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Subsequently, a new SJA, Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) W, was assigned to the command, and defense counsel submitted a document to him that responded to the recommendation that had been prepared by Maj K. <em>See </em>RCM 1106(f)(4). Defense counsel challenged Maj C\u2019s role in writing the recommendation, arguing, \u201cThere is a definite appearance of impropriety and probable bias in having the wife of the Chief Prosecutor of MSgt Hamilton write the advice and recommendation to the convening authority.\u201d Furthermore, defense counsel pointed out that Maj C had been \u201cintricately involved with the government witnesses and trial preparation\u201d as the \u201cChief of Military Justice\u201d prior to the trial. Defense counsel acknowledged that Maj K also had written a recommendation, but he noted that it was the <em>\u201cvery same </em>recommendation\u201d that had been written by Maj C, simply with someone else\u2019s signature. In addition to this issue, defense counsel alleged that five separate legal errors had occurred at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">LtCol W prepared an addendum to the recommendation, <em>see </em>RCM 1106(f)(7), in which he addressed the six legal issues that had been raised in defense counsel\u2019s response. He \u201cremind[ed]\u201d the convening au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>thority that he was \u201cnot required to review the case for legal errors or factual sufficiency, but ... [could] take corrective action.\u201d With respect to three of the issues, which concerned admissibility of evidence, he advised the convening authority in each instance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">Evidentiary rulings do not fall under the province of the convening authority, but are matters properly brought before the [military judge], as was done in this case on this issue. Unfavorable rulings are issues for appeal rather than reasons for granting of clemency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As to the issue of Maj C\u2019s role in preparing the recommendation, LtCol W provided the following advice to the convening authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">Another SJA\u2019s Recommendation was prepared and signed by Maj [K], Acting Staff Judge Advocate. Before signing the Recommendation, Maj [K] reviewed the recommendation and the ROT [record of trial] and concluded that the sentence should be imposed as adjudged. He was in no way obligated to reach the same conclusion that Maj [C] did, but could have changed the recommendation had he seen fit. to do so. His independent review of the ROT and the SJA\u2019s Recommendation prior to signing it cleanses any possible taint and renders the SJA\u2019s Recommendation proper for your consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\">Appellant contends that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ah-dedup-0\">\u201cSJA recommendation and addendum ... were defective in two ways: (1) the SJA recommendation was prepared by Maj [C], who was a disqualified person under Article 6(e), UCMJ, and RCM 1106(b); and (2) the convening authority was given erroneous and misleading advice in the addendum which clearly suggested that legal errors are not an appropriate basis for corrective action by the convening authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Final Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">A <em>Disqualification of Maj C</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Appellant contends that, because the recommendation submitted by Maj K to the convening authority was the draft written by Maj C, any disqualification of Maj C extends to use of her work-produet by another attorney in the same office. <em>See United States v. Hightower, </em>5 USCMA 385, 389, 18 CMR 9, 13 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">Appellant makes two distinct arguments in support of his predicate claim that Maj C was disqualified from writing the post-trial recommendation. First, he points to the language in Article 6(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 806(c), and in RCM 1106(b) that disqualifies the \u201ctrial counsel\u201d in a case from acting later as the staff judge advocate to the convening authority in the same case. He urges that \u201ctrial counsel\u201d extends beyond the person who prosecutes in the name of the United States in the courtroom and includes all persons who act on behalf of the United States prior to trial. Final Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">Second, appellant argues that Maj C \u201cwas placed in the position of reviewing the actions of her own spouse in a contested case where there were numerous contested evidentiary issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. While Article 6(c) and RCM 1106(b) do not disqualify a trial counsel\u2019s spouse expressly, appellant contends that the reviewing spouse is someone who has \u201cother than an official interest\u201d in the case when she must review the prosecution\u2019s trial performance. <em>Id.; see </em>RCM 1106(b), Discussion; see <em>generally United States v. Rice, </em>33 MJ 451, 452-53 (CMA 1991) (Government sentencing witness disqualified from writing post-trial recommendation).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we need not decide whether Maj C was disqualified, because Maj C\u2019s actions relating to the SJA\u2019s recommendation to the convening authority did not materially prejudice the substantial rights of appellant. <em>See </em>Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a). After Maj C had drafted her recommendation, she realized that she might have a conflict or an appearance of one in fulfilling that responsibility. Consequently, she delegated that duty to the next most senior officer, to be performed while she was absent from the installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">Although Maj C\u2019s draft and Maj K\u2019s recommendation to the convening authority virtually are identical, appellant has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>demonstrate that the text of the recommendation prejudiced his opportunity to receive relief from the convening authority. The entries on the first page of the recommendation repeat routine administrative information. The content of the following one and one half pages of text \u2014 which includes matters such as a list of appellant\u2019s awards and decorations, a short discussion of the purpose of the SJA\u2019s recommendation, a statement that the evidence was legally sufficient, a statement that there were no legal errors, and a brief recital of additional background information on appellant \u2014 is bland and unremarkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We note that the only discussion of any substantive issue in controversy did not occur in the initial recommendation submitted by Maj K but in the subsequent addendum written by LtCol W, the new SJA. Appellant does not claim that Maj C played any role in the preparation of LtCol Ws addendum. In this unusual context, Maj K\u2019s borrowing of Maj C\u2019s recommendation, which was plain-vanilla in substance, did not prejudice appellant, and appellant has not made any specific representation in this Court to the contrary. <em>Cf. United States v. Craig, </em>28 MJ 321, 324-25 (CMA 1989)(remand usually in order when SJA does not comply with RCM 1106 or when record is unclear whether convening authority considered clemency materials).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>B. Advice on Convening Authority\u2019s Review of Legal Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Appellant contends that the addendum to the recommendation, written by LtCol W, \u201cclearly suggested [incorrectly] that legal errors are not an appropriate basis for corrective action by the convening authority.\u201d Final Brief at 2. Although we do not agree that such a suggestion \u201cclearly\u201d was made, we recognize that the SJA\u2019s advice, as a whole, is ambiguous in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The SJA began his discussion of appellant\u2019s contention of legal error by informing the convening authority that he was \u201cnot required to review the case for legal errors\u201d but that he could \u201ctake corrective action.\u201d In his ensuing discussion of the legal issues raised by appellant, however, the SJA seemed to muddy the water. His advice as to three of those issues \u2014 that \u201c[e]videntiary rulings do not fall under the province of the convening authority\u201d and that \u201c[u]nfavorable rulings are issues for appeal rather than reasons for granting clemency\u201d \u2014 arguably is incomplete to the extent that it implies that such matters are of no proper concern to the convening authority. That implication, if made, would be incorrect because a convening authority statutorily may take action in a case \u201conly after consideration of any matters submitted by the accused----\u201d Art. 60(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Notwithstanding the mandate to consider defense submissions, it is clear that the convening authority\u2019s power \u201cto modity the findings and sentence of a court-martial is a matter of command prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening authority.\u201d Art. 60(c)(1). As a matter of command prerogative, \u201c[t]he convening authority is not required to review the case for legal errors or factual sufficiency.\u201d RCM 1107(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">In matters of clemency, the convening authority\u2019s obligation to consider defense submissions is uniquely critical to an accused. This Court often has observed that the convening authority is an accused\u2019s last best hope for clemency. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>46 MJ 37, 39 (1997). Clemency is the heart of the convening authority\u2019s responsibility at that stage of a case. If an SJA gives faulty advice in this regard, the impact is particularly serious because no subsequent authority adequately can fix that mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">In contrast, the convening authority\u2019s statutory role vis-a-vis defense claims of legal error is less pivotal to an accused\u2019s ultimate interests. Although an SJA must respond to a defense claim of legal error, <em>see Craig, </em>28 MJ at 324, \u201c[t]he response may consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with the matter raised by the accused. An analysis or rationale for the staff judge advocate\u2019s statement, if any, concerning legal errors is not required.\u201d RCM 1106(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Thus, while a convening authority has the power to respond remedially to an accused\u2019s claim of legal error and while he is encouraged to act in the interest of fairness to the accused and efficiency of the system, he is not required to do so. Unlike the lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>opportunity occasioned by defective SJA advice on matters of clemency, erroneous advice by an SJA as to a claim of legal error that leads a convening authority not to afford relief to an accused can be corrected by appellate litigation of the claimed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">It is appropriate in this context for an appellate court to look for prejudice that might have flowed from misadvice as to a defense claim of legal error. <em>See United States v. Welker, </em>44 MJ 85 (1996). We find none. While appellant has pursued on appeal some of the claims of legal error that he raised in his response to the SJA recommendation, neither the Court of Criminal Appeals nor this Court has considered any of these issues to be meritorious. Even if the originally ambiguous advice from the SJA might have misled the convening authority with respect to his power to correct legal errors, the absence of any such errors precludes a finding that the SJA\u2019s advice prejudiced appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Chief Judge COX and Judges SULLIVAN, CRAWFORD, and GIERKE concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
