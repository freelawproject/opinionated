The findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. We affirm the findings and sentence. Our reasoning is set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">On 19 July 1995, the Appellant was convicted, in accordance with his plea, of the carnal knowledge of a 14r-year-old girl in violation of Article 120(b), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(b)(1994), <em>amended by </em>Pub.L. No. 104-106, \u00a7 1113,110 Stat. 462 (1996)[hereinafter UCMJ]. The Government presented extensive evidence of the greater offense of rape, but the military judge entered a finding of not guilty to that specification. Record at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The appellant contends that we should find his plea improvident and set aside the findings of guilty because Article 120, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 was amended after his conviction. Appellant\u2019s Brief and Assignment of Errors at 3, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Prior to the 1996 amendment, courts-martial applied the Federal rule that it is \u201cno defense that the accused is ignorant or misinformed as to the true age of the female[J\u201d Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), Part IV, H45c(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the 1996 amendment created an affirmative defense, commonly called \u201creasonable mistake as to the age of the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This affirmative defense is raised if the consort is at least 12-years-old, and there is evidence that the accused reasonably believed he or she was at least 16-years-old.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">The victim was over twelve, and the appellant says that: \u201cHe did not know that the girl was under sixteen.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief and Assignment of Errors at 2. Based on these facts, Appellant asserts that \u201cconvictions on direct review at the time the conduct in question is rendered no longer unlawful by statute, must abate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (quoting <em>Hamm v. Rock Hill, </em>379 U.S. 306, 312, 85 S.Ct. 384, 389-90, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964)). Said in more modem terms, appellant tells us we must set aside the finding and reconsider his case as if the amended statute were in effect during his trial. This is the common law rule, last fully recognized in <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">This common law rule is, however, seldom applicable to Federal statutes. \u201cTo avoid such abatements \u2014 often the product of legislative inadvertence \u2014 Congress enacted 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 [ (1994)(enacted in 1947) ], the general saving clause____\u201d <em>Warden v. Mar-rero, </em>417 U.S. 653, 660, 94 S.Ct. 2532, 2536, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>41 L.Ed.2d 383 (1974).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Our Supreme Court, and other Federal courts, read the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, broadly and apply it rather than the common law in almost every instance of statutory repeal, re-enactment, or amendment. <em>See generally Warden, </em>417 U.S at 660, 94 S.Ct. at 2536-37, and cases and secondary sources cited therein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Our Supreme Court has applied the common law rather than the \u201cgeneral saving clause\u201d in only two instances. Both involved constitutional claims. <em>Hamm v. Rock Hill, </em>379 U.S. at 312, 85 S.Ct. at 389-90 (general saving clause did not preserve Federal or state prosecutions inconsistent with a specific statute designed to enforce the 14th Amendment. Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1971, 1975a-1975d, 2000a-2000h-6 (1994)); <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (prosecutions under statutes invalidated by the constitutional amendment repealing prohibition were not saved). The appellant seeks to apply the common law rule rather than the statute, but his case is not of constitutional import.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Nor does the appellant\u2019s appeal to \u201cfairness\u201d raise his case above those historically subjected to the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. Appellant\u2019s Brief and Assignment of Errors at 2. In cases, like appellant\u2019s, which involve no fundamental right, it is no more or less fair, in the general sense of the word, to punish the accused for acts which are no longer criminal than to prematurely exonerate him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Even our \u201cawesome, plenary, <em>de novo </em>power of review\u201d does not permit us to ignore \u201cRules for the Government and Regulation of the ... naval Forces\u201d made by the Congress. <em>Compare United States v. Cole, </em>31 M.J. 270, 272 (C.M.A.1990), <em>with </em>U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">As to severity of the sentence, Petty Officer Schuler was 26 years of age at the time of the offense. <em>See </em>Prosecution Exhibit 3. We also find, solely for purposes of extenuation and mitigation, that Petty Officer Schuler, despite his sworn testimony to the contrary, knew the victim\u2019s true age. Record at 45, 61; Art. 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">All the matters presented to us, including the changes to the substantive law discussed above, were considered by the convening authority. Commander, Marine Forces Reserve, General Court-Martial Convening Authority and Order Number 4-96,12 Jun 96, at 5. Clemency is not the function of this court, <em>United States v. Heady, </em>26 M.J. 394 (C.M.A.1988), and we cannot say as a matter of fact or law that the sentence, which includes a bad-conduct discharge, is inappropriately severe. <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267 (C.MA1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Assignments of Error III-V constitute a systemic attack on court-martial jurisdiction which has no merit. <em>See United States v. Grindstaff, </em>45 M.J. 634 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence, as approved on review below, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-20\">Senior Judge CLARK and Judge SEFTON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-17\">. I. APPELLANT\u2019S PLEA IS IMPROVIDENT BECAUSE THE PROVIDENCE INQUIRY RAISED A DEFENSE TO THE CHARGE.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-18\">II.

This provision has been carried forward without change since 1951. <em>See </em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1951 ed.), V 199b. Article 120, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 was made gender-neutral by the 1996 amendment. Pub.L. No. 104-106, \u00a7 1113, 110 Stat. 462 (enacted Feb. 10, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-19\">. This defense was not recognized in our Federal courts prior to the Sexual Abuse Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-2248 (1994). <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>942 F.2d 775 (10th Cir.1991). <em>See also Ex Parte Lane, </em>135 U.S. 443, 10 S.Ct. 760, 34 L.Ed. 219 (1890). The amendment to Article 120 was intended \"to conform military law to federal [sic] civilian law (18 U.S.C. 2243)____\" S. Rep. No. 104-112, at 243 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b598-22\">. The relevant portions of the amendment read: \u201d[I]t is an affirmative defense [to alleged carnal knowledge] that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">(A) the person with whom the accused committed the act of sexual intercourse had at the time of the alleged offense attained the age of twelve years; and</p>\n<p id=\"b598-24\">(B) the accused reasonably believed that that person had at the time of the alleged offense attained the age of sixteen years.\u201d Pub.L. No. 104-106, \u00a7 1113, 110 Stat. 462 (enacted Feb. 10, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b599-10\">. \"The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution____\u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b599-13\">. Our preference for the saving clause over common law is older than the present statute. In 1871, shortly after the common law rule was first applied by our Supreme Court, \"Congress enacted its first general saving provision, c. 71, 16 Stat. 432 (1871), to abolish the common-law presumption____\u201d <em>Warden, </em>417 U.S. at 660, 94 S.Ct. at 2536.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b599-24\">. In 1951 the Court of Military Appeals adopted this approach by implication. Citing the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, and a specific saving clause, Act of 5 May 1950, Pub.L. No. 506, \u00a7 4, 64 Stat. 108 (1950), the court endorsed a provision of Executive Order 10214 providing that \"an offense in violation of the ... Articles for the Government of the Navy ... shall be charged as such and not as a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice____\" <em>United States </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>1 C.M.A 56, 60, 1 C.M.R. 56, 60, 1951 WL 1510 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
