Appellant committed these offenses against three female sailors, including Airman Apprentice (AA) S and Airman (AN) M, under the guise of performing medical examinations. The convening authority approved the sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, 2 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals set aside the findings of guilty to dereliction of duty, dismissed that Charge and its specifications, and affirmed the sentence. 44 MJ 603 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">We granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-16\">I. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION, AND VIOLATED APPELLANT\u2019S SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION, WHEN HE EXCLUDED DEFENSE EVIDENCE OF AA S\u2019S PRIOR REPORT OF RAPE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-17\">II. WHETHER AGENTS OF THE NAVAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE SERVICE [NCIS] ENGAGED IN INVESTIGATORY MISCONDUCT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-18\">We hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding defense evidence of AA S\u2019s prior report of rape. Additionally, we hold that the NCIS did not violate appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment or Article 31<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-19\">FACTS \u2014 ISSUE I</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">Prior to trial, the Government moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence regarding AA S\u2019s prior allegation of rape. At an Article 39(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> session, AA S testified that she had been raped by her cousin in December 1991. She did not report the attack until nearly 2 years later while she was in boot camp. At that time, an enlisted staff member of the recruit training command referred her to the Family Service Center for counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">The defense team argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-22\">Your Honor, the defense does \u2014 does not take issue with the Government\u2019s intention [sic] that this was a truthful report of a rape. It\u2019s offered under 608(c) to show bias was established \u2014 it\u2019s been established through the testimony at the Article 32 hearing that there was an abdominal examination of \u2014 of Airman Apprentice S[ ]. Prior rape could very easily have sensitized her to \u2014 to contact of any nature and could have \u2014 could have created a bias in that sense and could have caused her to misinterpret what was otherwise a legitimate abdominal exam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>... The contention is that the rape \u2014 the trauma of any rape \u2014 the fact that she had discussed it two days earlier with another physician on the 16th of March would have made her vulnerable to \u2014 to leading questions and would go to her state of mind at the time she was questioned by Sandy Maclsaac \u2014 at the time that she made the complaint against HM1 Sojfer in response to Special Agent Sandy Maclsaac\u2019s questioning of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The Government\u2019s counter-argument was that the fact that AA S had been raped did not make it more likely that she would have a bias under Mil.R.Evid. 608(c), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). The military judge excluded any evidence of the prior alleged rape but advised defense counsel that if they had an additional proffer later, he would be willing to reconsider the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">DISCUSSION \u2014 ISSUE I</p>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">For evidence to be admissible, it must be both logically and legally relevant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rules of logical and legal relevance also apply to methods of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">There are various methods of impeachment. Some of them are based on the Military Rules of Evidence: Character for untruthfulness,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prior conviction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> instances of misconduct not resulting in a conviction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> pri- or inconsistent statement,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and bias.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Others are based on common-law rules: Prior inconsistent acts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> specific contradiction,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u201cdeficiencies in the elements of competency.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">Issue I centers on bias and deficiencies in the elements of competency,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> also known as capacity to employ one\u2019s senses. There are similarities between bias and capacity to observe, remember, and recollect. Both are grounds for impeachment, and both may be proven by extrinsic evidence. However, before the proponent may introduce evidence under either theory,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he or she must lay a foundation that establishes the legal and logical relevance of the impeaching evidence. Mil.R.Evid. 401 and 402; <em>see gen-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>orally </em>E. Imwinkelried, <em>Evidentiary Foundations </em>(3d ed.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">How a witness \u201cviews\u201d an event, in terms of her five senses, depends on her background, including family life, education, and day-to-day experiences. Witnesses \u201cbehave according to what [they] bring to the occasion, and what each of [them] brings to the occasion is more or less unique.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that sense, each witness has a bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Additionally, a witness\u2019 interpretation of an event depends on whether her perception is impaired. For example, the individual may be hearing-impaired or may not have been wearing corrective lenses at the time of the crime. A past or present mental condition also may impact on a person\u2019s ability to perceive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Neither the common-law rules nor the rules of evidence may trump the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine opposing witnesses. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 U.S. 129, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968). In <em>Davis, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state law designed to protect the confidentiality of juvenile convictions could not be used to preclude defense cross-examination of a crucial prosecution witness. 415 U.S. at 319, 94 S.Ct. at 1112. There, a bar was broken into and a safe weighing several hundred pounds was removed. It was found 26 miles from the site of the breaking and entering, just outside the home of Jess Straight and his family. Straight\u2019s step-son, Richard Green, told investigators that he had seen two unknown men standing alongside a late-model blue Chevrolet hear where the safe was discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 309, 94 S.Ct. at 1107. Because Green had been placed on probation as a result of a juvenile conviction, the defense sought to cross-examine him to establish that he was identifying other individuals to avoid a revocation of his own probation. <em>Id. </em>at 310-11, 94 S.Ct. at 1107-08. The Court held that \u201cthe right of confrontation is paramount to the State\u2019s policy of protecting a juvenile offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 94 S.Ct. at 1112:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The defense argued that the prior rape should be admitted because a rape victim is more likely to be biased or misinterpret a proper medical examination. However, the defense offered no support for its theory that a prior rape showed bias or would have an impact on the victim\u2019s ability to feel or remember. Had there been a proffer that a mental illness or infirmity affected AA S\u2019s capacity to observe and feel, there might be a different result, unless the evidence otherwise was inadmissible under another rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">In this instance, it is improbable that the victim misinterpreted appellant\u2019s placing his hand on her genital area as an indecent assault rather than a proper abdominal examination. Thus, we hold that the judge did not err in excluding the defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">FACTS \u2014 ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">Appellant contends NCIS agents twice misrepresented the facts of the case to him. The first instance relates to Special Agent (SA) Maclsaac\u2019s interview about these allegations after appellant waived his rights. SA Maelsaac interrogated appellant alone for the first hour and was thereafter assisted by SA Rene Vasquez. Appellant denied the allegations. He told his interrogators that he remembered AN M, and he talked with them about his physical examinations of her. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>pellant admitted examining her abdomen on at least one occasion, but he denied touching her vaginal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">At one point, SA Vasquez confronted appellant by saying, \u201cYou touched her pubic hairs.\u201d Appellant immediately responded, \u201cExcuse me. She is shaved.\u201d After a moment of silence, SA Maelsaae said, \u201cWell, I know that and Rene Vasquez knows that; how do you know that?\u201d SA Maelsaae knew that AN M shaved her pubic area because this fact was contained in her written statement. However, SA Vasquez was not aware of this. Appellant explained that he saw and felt part of AN M\u2019s pubic region during his examination of her abdomen while, he said, an observer was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The second misrepresentation was that SA Maelsaae did not disclose to AA S, when he interviewed her, that he was investigating allegations of professional misconduct against appellant. SA Maclssac told AA S that he was conducting a quality assurance review of the sick call records. Appellant first raised the fraud and trickery allegations in his post-trial submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">DISCUSSION \u2014 ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Fifth Amendment provides: \u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law____\u201d Article 31(d), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 831(d), prohibits admission into evidence of any statement from an accused obtained \u201cthrough the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful induce-ment____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">In <em>Hopt v. Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 583-87, 4 S.Ct. 202, 206-09, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884), the Supreme Court applied the common-law rule<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> prohibiting use of unreliable confessions. Additionally, the Supreme Court has sought to protect individuals against offensive police practices. <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961). That Court has applied a totality-of-the-circumstances test in determining the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 512, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1342, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963). Applying this test, \u201c[t]he necessary inquiry is whether the confession is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>United States v. Bubonics, </em>45 MJ 93, 95 (1996). As the Supreme Court indicated in its first case on the subject: \u201cIt is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a rule that will comprehend all cases.\u201d <em>Hopt, </em>110 U.S. at 583,4 S.Ct. at 207. However, over the years, the Supreme Court and this Court have examined numerous circumstances, including rights\u2019 warnings;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the length of the interrogation;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the characteristics of the individual, including age and education;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and the na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ture of the police conduct, including threats,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> physical abuse,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and incommunicado detention.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">There is not the slightest indication that appellant sought to stop the interrogation or request an attorney. Nor is there evidence of a lengthy interrogation or that the police made threats and promises to appellant to obtain his statement. Appellant does not have a low IQ, and he completed 12 years of education. Thus, we hold, based on the totality of the circumstances, that appellant\u2019s statement was voluntary and admissible in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Chief Judge COX and Judges GIERKE and EFFRON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\">.

Bahr, </em>33 MJ 228 (CMA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Granted Issue I can be resolved on the basis that, \u201c[i]n this instance, it is improbable that the victim misinterpreted appellant\u2019s placing his hand on her genital area as an indecent assault rather than a proper abdominal examination.\u201d 47 MJ at 428. This was a question of fact for the military jury, and our concern is whether a prior rape complaint by the alleged victim against another person was a matter which the members should consider in this ease in evaluating her credibility. <em>See generally U.S. v. Gray </em>and <em>U.S. v. Bahr, </em>both <em>swpra. </em>The defense should have been allowed to show the possible bias of any witness to the jury. The jury must know if a witness is biased. Accordingly, I would find error under Issue I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Nevertheless, I join the majority in its conclusion that appellant\u2019s case may be affirmed. Initially, I note that the military judge\u2019s ruling on this impeachment question was not final and defense counsel failed to pursue this matter at a later time when invited to do so by the military judge. <em>See United States v. Johnson, 35 </em>MJ 17, 21 (CMA 1992). Moreover, there were three different victims in this case who testified to three different assaults by appellant dining medical examinations, rendering an error in impeachment of one witness much less prejudicial. <em>Cf. Bahr, supra </em>at 234. Finally, while a large number of complaints of sexual abuse against different men in a short period of time might provide strong support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>appellant\u2019s bias theory, a single complaint long before the alleged rape is far less significant. <em>Cf. Gray, supra </em>at 81. In light of these circumstances, I would affirm on the basis of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Turning to Issue II, I again agree with the result reached by the majority but am unable to join its rationale for affirmance. Two particular questions are before the Court. The first question is whether misrepresentations by a police officer who interrogated appellant rendered his confession involuntary and inadmissible as a matter of law. <em>See generally Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 739, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 1424-25, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969); <em>Ledbetter v. Edwards, </em>35 F.3d 1062, 1068-70 (6th Cir.1994). The second question is whether misrepresentations by a police officer to an alleged victim to secure her report of a crime is \u201coutrageous government conduct\u201d requiring dismissal of the charges against appellant. <em>See Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 109, 106 S.Ct. 445, 449, 88 L.Ed.2d 405 (1985); <em>United States v. Lemaster, </em>40 MJ 178, 181 (CMA 1994) (Sullivan, J., concurring in the result); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>38 MJ 358, 370-74 (CMA 1993) (opinions of Sullivan, C.J., Wiss, J., and Gierke, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The majority does not directly address the impact of the averred lie which the interrogating officer told appellant. However, it does identify that misrepresentation in the context of this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">SA Maclsaac interrogated appellant alone for the first hour and was thereafter assisted by SA Rene Vasquez. Appellant denied the allegations. He told his interrogators that he remembered AN M, and he talked with them about his physical examinations of her. Appellant admitted examining her abdomen on at least one occasion, but he denied touching her vaginal area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">At one point, SA Vasquez confronted appellant by saying, \u201cYou touched her pubic hairs.\u201d Appellant immediately responded, \u201cExcuse me. She is shaved.\u201d After a moment of silence, SA Maclsaac said, <em>\u201cWell, I know that and Rene Vasquez knows that; how do you know that? </em>\u201d SA Maclsaac knew that AN M shaved her pubic area because this fact was contained in her written statement. <em>However, SA Vasquez was not aware of this. </em>Appellant explained that he saw and felt part of AN M\u2019s pubic region during his examination of her abdomen while, he said, an observer was present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">47 MJ at 428-29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Misrepresentations by the police in the interrogation process do not by themselves render a subsequent confession involuntary and inadmissible. The critical question is whether the misrepresentation was of the type which itself would overbear an accused\u2019s will. <em>See Ledbetter, </em>35 F.3d at 1070. I conclude that the police misstatement of the extent of the Government\u2019s case could not have overborne appellant\u2019s will, and I join the majority\u2019s conclusion that his confession was voluntary. <em>See Amaya-Ruiz v. Stewart, </em>121 F.3d 486, 496 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Drake, </em>934 F.Supp. 953, 963 (N.D.I11.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Appellant\u2019s \u201coutrageous government conduct\u201d complaint with respect to the victim\u2019s questioning by the police is simply ignored by the majority opinion. Our case law and case law from the Supreme Court, as noted above, permit due process challenges to police investigations and prosecutions which shock the conscience of the court in terms of fundamental fairness. However, no legal authority has been cited to this Court which would permit an accused to make such a complaint based on the victim\u2019s mistreatment. The fact that police officers told the victim that they were conducting \u201ca quality assurance review of the sick call records\u201d rather than investigating professional misconduct by appellant is hardly outrageous government conduct within the context of the decisions cited above. <em>Cf. United States v. Lemaster, supra</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
