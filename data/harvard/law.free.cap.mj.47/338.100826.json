The court-martial sentenced appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement and forfeiture of $800.00 pay per month for 2 years, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority reduced the forfeitures to $600.00 pay per month for 24 months but otherwise approved the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Our Court granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT BY REFUSING TO GRANT THE CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE AGAINST TWO MEMBERS WHO HAD RECEIVED A BRIEFING FROM THE SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY CONCERNING THE STATE OF DISCIPLINE IN THE UNIT AND THE SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY\u2019S VIEWS OF \u201cAPPROPRIATE\u201d LEVELS OF PUNISHMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">WHETHER APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCE SHOULD BE SET ASIDE DUE TO UNLAWFUL COMMAND INFLUENCE BY THE SPECIAL COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY AND HIS STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE WHEN, 10 DAYS PRIOR TO TRIAL, THEY CONDUCTED A BRIEFING, ATTENDED BY MEMBERS OF THIS COURT-MARTIAL, ON \u201cAPPROPRIATE\u201d LEVELS OF PUNISHMENT AND IMPLIED THAT THERE COULD BE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR VIEWS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">We hold that the military judge erred by refusing to grant the challenges for cause. In light of this holding, we do not decide the second granted issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">The issues arose as a result of remarks made during a staff meeting several days before the trial. The remarks were attributed to Brigadier General (BGen) Marr, Commander of 62d Airlift Wing, and his staff judge advocate (SJA), Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) Rollinger. The staff meeting covered a variety of topics, including a 15-20 minute presentation on standards, command responsibility, and discipline. The three most senior members of the court-martial panel were present during the command briefing. Neither BGen Marr nor LtCol Rol-linger was asked to testify at trial by either party, but during <em>voir dire </em>the three court members who attended the meeting described their perception of those remarks. Because Issue I concerns the members\u2019 impartiality, our focus is on the impact of the remarks on the members rather than the exact language, intentions, or motivations of the speakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">LtCol Snyder was asked during <em>voir dire </em>if he could judge appellant\u2019s case based on the evidence and with an open mind. He responded in the affirmative but then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-13\">Now, the nature of being a commander, you\u2019re always having to make decisions and justify them at a minimum in your own mind, if not to your boss and the boss\u2019s commander, which is General Man*. An influence that \u2014 most recently we had a commanders\u2019 conference with General Marr where Colonel Rollinger, the Staff Judge Advocate, talked about, you know, standards____ So, there are always those pressures that are inherent with the job that you are weighing advice from the first sergeant, influences from things that you hear at the stand-up, from Colonel Kane, my boss, or General Marr, his boss, giving opinions on what they think is important with regard to the good order and discipline of their unit and your specific unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">So, yes, I think I can be fair and impartial in this case, but there are factors that are just inherent with the job that are influences that I know enter into anyone in a command position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Turning to the specific remarks at issue, LtCol Snyder described LtCol Rollinger\u2019s briefing as \u201cof a general nature,\u201d involving \u201cillustrative examples of types of punishments and types of actions that commanders had taken.\u201d He said that LtCol Rollinger mentioned one specific example, involving child abuse, where, \u201cin Colonel Rollinger\u2019s opinion, the commander underreacted\u201d and \u201chad shirked his or her leadership responsibilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">LtCol Snyder said that BGen Marr also addressed the issue, telling the assembled officers \u201cthat we should use the SJA because he speaks for the Wing Commander.\u201d With respect to the specific example cited by LtCol Rollinger, BGen Marr said that he had forwarded a letter to that commander\u2019s new duty location expressing the opinion that \u201cthat officer had peaked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When asked if he felt that he would be subject to command influence if he voted for a sentence of \u201cno punishment,\u201d LtCol Snyder responded in the negative. He then volunteered that on one occasion he approached BGen Marr and explained his actions after taking disciplinary action that he did not think BGen Marr would agree with.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">When asked if he would worry about a letter to a future superior that would cause his career to \u201cpeak,\u201d LtCol Snyder responded that he would do what was right but that the remarks at the staff conference were \u201cat a minimum in my subconscious and, you know, parts of it are very clearly in my conscious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">A second member, Major (Maj) Taylor, remembered LtCol Rollinger describing a case involving sexual abuse of a child where the commander \u201cdid not act as he should have.\u201d According to Maj Taylor, LtCol Rol-linger \u201csaid that he thought the commander probably should have been given an Article 15 for dereliction of duty and removed of his position.\u201d Maj Taylor said that BGen Marr followed up with \u201ca comment to the effect of, you know, that something on the order of he\u2019s contacted or planning to contact the person that this previous commander worked for and that person\u2019s career in the Air Force is probably not going to be a very lengthy one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">When questioned about the impact of the remarks, Maj Taylor responded that she looks to the SJA for guidance and advice but that she is responsible for making the decision. She said, \u201cI feel that my opinion is my opinion. Although it can be somewhat influenced by guidance and information out there, but it\u2019s ultimately mine and I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">On questioning by defense counsel, Maj Taylor explained, \u201cI took away [from the staff meeting] what was the [SJA\u2019s], Colonel Rollinger\u2019s, opinion. I took away from there that the commander still has the ultimate responsibility to make the decision, administer the discipline, and that the Legal Office offered advice and guidance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">A third member, LtCol MacPherson, remembered that LtCol Rollinger gave a presentation on the commander\u2019s responsibility for maintaining good order and discipline. He said that LtCol Rollinger did give examples but that he would \u201chave to think about it to come up with\u201d them. LtCol MacPherson remembered that BGen Marr said that he \u201cexpected the commanders to be responsible for maintaining the order and discipline of their unit and that was their job, and that anybody that didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t \u2014 they were appointed to the position because he expected them to maintain that and that was their charge when he put them in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">LtCol MacPherson said that he did not remember LtCol Rollinger commenting about an officer\u2019s career, but he did remember that BGen Marr mentioned sending a letter to a former commander\u2019s superior. When defense counsel asked LtCol MacPher-son whether he had the impression that the officer in question \u201cwas going to suffer adverse consequences to his career,\u201d he responded, \u201cThe impression definitely was there. The way it was left with me was there was a presentation, the Wing Commander was dissatisfied with the way things had happened and he wrote a letter to the individual\u2019s now present supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">Defense counsel challenged LtCol Mac-Pherson, LtCol Snyder, and Maj Taylor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>cause. The military judge granted the challenge of LtCol Snyder but denied the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Appellant now asserts that the military judge abused his discretion by refusing to grant the challenges for cause against LtCol MacPherson and Maj Taylor. He argues that the challenged members \u201ccould not be expected to ignore\u201d the comments of BGen Marr, \u201cespecially in light of the actions taken against the offending commander.\u201d Final Brief at 8. The Government argues that the military judge did not abuse his discretion and that removal of \u201cthe only member potentially affected eliminated any concerns about command influence.\u201d Answer to Final Brief at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">RCM 912(f)(l)(N), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), provides that a court member \u201cshall be excused for cause whenever it appears that the member ... [sjhould not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.\u201d This rule includes challenges based on actual bias as well as implied bias. <em>United States v. Lavender, </em>46 MJ 485, 487 (1997); <em>United States v. Napoleon, </em>46 MJ 279, 283 (1997); <em>United States v. Minyard, </em>46 MJ 229, 231 (1997), citing <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 MJ 212, 217 (1996), and <em>United States v. Harris, </em>13 MJ 288, 292 (CMA 1982). RCM 912(f)(3) provides that \u201c[t]he burden of establishing that grounds for a challenge exist is upon the party making the challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Military judges must follow the \u201cliberal-grant mandate\u201d in ruling on challenges for cause. <em>United States v. White, </em>36 MJ 284, 287 (CMA 1993). \u201cWe review [a military judge\u2019s] rulings on challenges for cause for abuse of discretion. On questions of actual bias, we give the military judge \u2018great deference because we recognize that he has observed the demeanor of the participants in the <em>voir dire </em>and challenge process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavender, supra </em>at 488, quoting <em>Napoleon, supra </em>at 283, quoting <em>White, supra </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">We are less deferential on questions of implied bias. Implied bias is reviewed through the eyes of the public. <em>Lavender, supra </em>at 488; <em>Napoleon, supra </em>at 283, citing <em>Daulton, supra </em>at 217. The focus \u201cis on the perception or appearance of fairness of the military justice system.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>42 MJ 384, 386 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The issue becomes more difficult when the basis of a challenge is founded on unlawful command influence. On the one hand, we recognize that a \u201cmember\u2019s unequivocal statement of a lack of bias can ... carry weight.\u201d <em>United States v. Mosqueda, </em>43 MJ 491, 493 (1996), quoting <em>United States v. Nigro, </em>28 MJ 415, 418 (CMA 1989). We also recognize that the military judge is in the best position to judge the sincerity and truthfulness of the challenged member\u2019s responses on <em>voir dire. See Daulton, supra </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">We recognize a commander\u2019s responsibility for discipline, the need occasionally for a more senior commander to intervene to prevent a miscarriage of justice, and the reality that an officer\u2019s lax attitude toward discipline may reflect inaptitude for command. On the other hand, we have long recognized the problems arising in the administration of military justice because of the \u201csubtle pressures that can be brought to bear by \u2018command\u2019 in military society____\u201d <em>United States v. Kitts, </em>23 MJ 105, 108 (CMA 1986). We also have recognized that sometimes it is difficult for a \u201csubordinate [to ascertain] ... the actual influence a superior has on that subordinate.\u201d <em>United States v. Gerlich, </em>45 MJ 309, 313 (1996). Finally, we have recognized that an SJA, though not a commander, generally acts with \u201cthe mantle of command authority.\u201d <em>Kitts, supra </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">In reviewing the issue concerning the challenges for cause, we focus on how the members perceived the briefing by LtCol Rollinger and the remarks of BGen Marr. Neither BGen Marr nor LtCol Rollinger was asked to testify, and thus we have only the fragmentary recollections of those who heard the remarks. The perceived message rather than the actual message is what controls, however, because we are concerned with how the message may have affected the impartiality of the court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>There is no question about the candor or sincerity of the members\u2019 responses during <em>voir dire. </em>Their answers disclaimed any bias or partiality, and we do not fault the military judge for finding that the members exhibited no actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">This case, however, involves implied bias. Our concern is with the effect of subtle pressure exerted by the members\u2019 perceptions of what they heard. They heard the Commanding General\u2019s views of the career potential of a commander who had \u201cunderreacted\u201d to a disciplinary situation. Unlike the situation involving intemperate remarks of a ship\u2019s captain in <em>United States v. Newbold, </em>45 MJ 109 (1996), the remarks in this case were spoken by the court members\u2019 commander and his SJA. Unlike the situation in <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>40 MJ 198, 202 (CMA 1994), where the SJA intervened after telling his commander that he had \u201cgone too far,\u201d the members heard the SJA make the remarks and heard BGen Marr reinforce them. The remarks were recent and fresh in the minds of the court members. The threat was not hypothetical but was specific and reinforced by a recent example.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The military judge commendably recognized the impact of the remarks on LtCol Snyder: In our view, however, the military judge did not fully appreciate that the same sword of Damocles was hanging over the heads of LtCol MacPherson and Maj Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We recognize that the remarks at issue were directed at the commander\u2019s role in initiating disciplinary action rather than an officer\u2019s role as a member of a court-martial. Nevertheless, LtCol MacPherson left the staff meeting with the clear impression that a fellow commander\u2019s career was in danger of being abruptly ended because BGen Marr considered his response to a disciplinary situation inadequate. Although Maj Taylor adamantly insisted that \u201cmy opinion is my opinion,\u201d she conceded that her opinion \u201ccan be somewhat influenced by guidance and information out there.\u201d Under the circumstances, we hold that it was \u201casking too much\u201d of LtCol MacPherson and Maj Taylor to expect them to impartially adjudge an appropriate sentence without regard for its potential impact on their careers. <em>See Daulton, </em>45 MJ at 218; <em>Dale, </em>42 MJ at 886. Accordingly, we hold that the military judge abused his discretion by denying the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to findings but reversed as to sentence. The sentence is set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. A rehearing on sentence may be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Chief Judge COX and Judge EFFRON concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-10\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AF-\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Our Court granted review of two issues in this case: Issue I, jury bias; and Issue II, command influence. 47 MJ at 339. The majority reverses on Issue I and does not answer Issue II. I would reverse this case on both issues since both issues are interlocked; it is the improper influence of the commander in February 1995 at the commander\u2019s meeting right before trial (Issue II) that causes the jury bias of Issue I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Both the majority and the dissent take a detour through the complicated jungle of \u201cimplied bias\u201d as a way around the real issue in this case \u2014 the issue of command influence. More to the point, the real question is: Did the February 1995 commander\u2019s meeting immediately before the Youngblood trial improperly influence or taint the three already selected Youngblood jurors present at that meeting?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">Whether the jurors were tainted by the February commander\u2019s meeting is an issue that can be decided by a review of the facts and our ease law. The record in this case shows the following relevant dates and events:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">1. <em>December 16, 1994 </em>\u2014 Criminal charges against Airman 1st Class Youngblood were referred to a court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">2. <em>December 16, 1994 </em>\u2014 Members of Youngblood\u2019s court-martial selected, including Lieutenant Colonels Snyder and Mac-Pherson, and Major Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>3. <em>Either February 10 or 17, 1995 </em>\u2014 Snyder, MacPherson, and Taylor attended a commander\u2019s meeting presided over by their commander, a general officer, with his staff judge advocate in attendance. At this meeting, Brigadier General (BGen) Marr communicated to all present his view that justice matters were being handled too leniently by commanders and that he had taken, at least once, actions to \u201cpeak\u201d an officer\u2019s career because he was too lenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">4. <em>February 21, 1995 </em>\u2014 Youngblood\u2019s court-martial convenes. Snyder is removed for cause due to attendance at the commander\u2019s meeting; however, MacPherson\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s removal for cause is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">BGen Marr\u2019s remarks to his subordinate commanders at the staff meeting were highly inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>42 MJ 327, 332 (1995); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>40 MJ 198, 201 (CMA 1994). He told these officers that a previous officer under his command had been too lenient in taking disciplinary action and that he was, therefore, sending a letter to that officer\u2019s gaining command indicating that he thought that particular officer\u2019s career had \u201cpeaked.\u201d These remarks created the distinct impression upon those officers at the meeting that their careers might also \u201cpeak\u201d if BGen Marr thought they were too lenient in their disciplinary actions. Hence, as the majority puts it, the \u201csword of Damocles was hanging over [these officers\u2019] heads.\u201d <em>See </em>47 MJ at 342. Such actions by a commander went far beyond any permissible \u201ctraining,\u201d <em>see </em>Art. 37(a)(1), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 837(a)(1), and can be reasonably construed as impermissibly suggesting how these commanders should exercise their judicial discretion. <em>See United States v. Martinez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Today, the majority (with my concurrence) has found that the three court-martial members who attended this meeting were disqualified because of implied bias in this case. RCM 912(f)(l)(N), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1984. It is not contact with command itself that caused these members to be disqualified but the type of contact which requires that result. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>22 MJ 388 (CMA 1986). Eradication of unlawful command influence of this type is one of the main purposes for which this Court was created. <em>See Reynolds, </em>40 MJ at 204 (Sullivan, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Plainly speaking, both sides in a court of law are entitled to a panel of fair jurors, jurors who have not had any pressure put on them to be lenient or to be harsh. The only allowable pressure on a juror is the duty to be fair. Whether a juror succumbs to any improper pressure is really not the main point. A jury system must appear fair for it to be recognized as fair. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>43 MJ 296, 304 n. 4 (1995) (Sullivan, C.J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, and joining Wiss\u2019 dissent).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">As Lord Chief Justice Hewart said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">A long line of cases shows that it is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.<footnotemark>[*]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">As a final note, I am puzzled by the dissent\u2019s attempt to paint BGen Marr\u2019s \u201ccommander\u2019s meeting\u201d comments as a \u201cgeneral instructional or informational course[ ] in military justice\u201d allowable under 10 U.S.C. 837(a)(1). In the first place, the statute\u2019s plain wording allows only \u201cgeneral instructional or informational courses in military justice.\u201d A general\u2019s \u201ccommander\u2019s call\u201d or \u201ccommander\u2019s meeting\u201d is certainly not a \u201ccourse on military justice.\u201d In the second place, anyone who has served on active duty and who has attended a \u201ccommander\u2019s meeting\u201d knows that these meetings are used as a management tool for the commanding officer to get his orders, plans, and operational requirements transmitted to his subordinate commanders. Article 37(a)(1) is clearly not applicable here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[*]\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\"><em>*Rex v.

The express reason for the Court\u2019s holding is that there was a denial of a challenge for cause based on implied bias. But the Court is casting an issue of command influence as a challenge for cause. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The court members at issue, Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) MacPherson, LtCol Snyder, and Major (Maj) Taylor, who were questioned individually, testified that at a monthly commanders\u2019 conference, Brigadier General (BGen) Marr and his staff judge advocate (SJA), LtCol Rollinger, addressed a number of topics, including a child abuse case involving a suspect with a history of past child abuse in which little or no action was taken, and a statutory rape case for which punishment was given pursuant to Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 815. BGen Marr thought that the officer who acted on the child abuse case had peaked in his career and sent a letter to that effect to the gaining command. The full details of the conference are unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The point BGen Marr was trying to make was put forth by LtCol MacPherson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">[T]he thrust of [BGen Marr\u2019s] comments were basically that they expected the commanders to be responsible for maintaining the order and discipline of their unit and that was their job, and that anybody that didn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t \u2014 they were appointed to the position because he expected them to maintain that and that was their eharge when he put them in there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The point was also made by LtCol Snyder: The general thrust of the briefing was that as commanders we have the responsibility to maintain certain standards; that the standards of the military may be somewhat different than a civilian world.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">LtCol Snyder, Maj Taylor, and LtCol Mac-Pherson expressed the opinion that they would be comfortable with imposing a sentence of no punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">Command Influence</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">This ease is another example of the clash that sometimes arises between the need for good order and discipline and the need to maintain an impartial system of military justice. As we have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">The primary responsibility for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the services is saddled on commanders, and we know of no good reason why they should not personally participate in improving the administration of military justice. No doubt the personal presentation of that subject by the commander is impressive, but that is as it should be. The question is not his influence but, rather, whether he charted it through forbidden areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-14\"><em>United States v. Danzine, 12 </em>USCMA 350, 352, 30 CMR 350, 352 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">Much more recently, this Court acknowledged that certain aspects of military law, such as questioning of suspects, not only facilitate criminal prosecutions but also provide commanders with essential information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-16\">The primary purpose of military criminal law \u2014 to maintain morale, good order, and discipline \u2014 has no parallel in civilian criminal law. When a squadron commander ... asks an airman about suspected misconduct, the purpose of the inquiry is not simply to develop a criminal case. An important purpose is to provide that [service-member]\u2019s commander with information about the capability of the individual to perform his or her military mission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-17\">Military missions, whether in combat, in peacetime operations, or in training, are characterized by stress, tension, danger, and the need for rapid decisions based upon accurate information. The habits and traits of character developed in peace can make the difference between success or failure in war.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-18\"><em>United States v. Solis, </em>46 MJ 31, 34 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">The Military Justice Act of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-632, \u00a7 2(13), 82 Stat. 1335, amended Article 37, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 837, to allow general instructional or informational military justice lectures, including those given solely to members of a command, on substantive and procedural aspects of the military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>justice system. 10 USC \u00a7 887(a)(1). But Article 87(b) prohibits commanders from considering a court member\u2019s performance in evaluating their efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Under some circumstances, this Court has held that lectures personally given by a commander to the court members did not have an impact on the trial. <em>Compare United States v. Danzine, supra, with United States v. Littrice, </em>3 USCMA 487, 13 CMR 43 (1953). The talk by BGen Marr and his SJA was not directly aimed at the court members, <em>cf. United States v. Johnson, </em>14 USCMA 548, 34 CMR 328 (1964), and it did not direct or suggest a particular result in the present case. <em>Cf. United States v. Stephens, </em>21 MJ 784 (ACMR 1986). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court found that where a pretrial orientation pamphlet directed to court members created \u201c[t]he appearance, or the existence, of command influence,\u201d there was a presumption of prejudice. 14 USCMA at 551, 34 CMR at 331. But the Court recognized that, although not done in <em>Johnson, </em>this presumption could be rebutted by examining the findings and sentence from the record of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 34 CMR at 331-32. Likewise, in <em>United States v. Brice, </em>19 MJ 170 (CMA 1985), the Court found prejudice. In the midst of Brice\u2019s trial for transfer and sale of lysergic acid diethylamide, all officers, including the court members, were directed to attend a speech by the Commandant of the Marine Corps. During this speech, the Commandant stated that drug trafficking was \u201cintolerable\u201d in the military and that drug traffickers should not be retained. <em>Id. </em>at 171. This Court reversed the conviction, concluding that the \u201cconfluence of subject and timing, particularly as they affect the minds \u2014 however subtly or imperceptibly \u2014 of the triers of fact in this particular case,\u201d was fatal. <em>Id. </em>at 172 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In contrast to <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Brice, </em>this Court did not find prejudice in two recent cases. In <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>40 MJ 198 (CMA 1994), the commander was a special court-martial convening authority who gave a morning briefing to members of the command that included four members of the panel. At this meeting, he expressed his dissatisfaction with sentences at prior courts-martial. This Court, after examining, <em>inter alia, </em>the instructions to the members and the fact that Reynolds did not want to pursue the issue at trial, found beyond a reasonable doubt that Reynolds\u2019 sentence was not tainted by these comments. In <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>42 MJ 327 (1995), the court members were \u201caware\u201d of the wing commander\u2019s letter, circulated on the air base 8 days before Martinez\u2019 trial for negligent homicide, to the members of his command to get tough on drunk-driving cases. 42 MJ at 331. The wing commander further admonished them not to misperceive how seriously the wing leadership took such matters. <em>Id. </em>at 334. This Court held the letter did not have an impact on the court members. <em>Id. </em>at 328. Similarly, even if Youngblood\u2019s case is limited to the anecdote about the letter BGen Marr sent regarding the officer\u2019s career peaking, the impact on the court members in this case is far from obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Implied Bias</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Under the Sixth Amendment, an accused has the right to \u201can impartial jury.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">due process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation. Were that the rule, few trials would be constitutionally acceptable. The safeguards of juror impartiality, such as <em>voir dire </em>and protective instructions from the trial judge, are not infallible; it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote. Due process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\"><em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 946, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). The doctrine of implied bias should be used only in \u201cextreme situations\u201d such as when a \u201cjuror is an actual employee of the prosecuting agency, [when] the juror is a close relative of one of the participants in the trial or the criminal transaction, or [when] the juror was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>a witness or somehow involved in the criminal transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 102 S.Ct. at 948 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); <em>see also United, States v. Lavender, </em>46 MJ 485, 489 (1997)(\u201cappellant did not carry his burden at trial of showing that his case is the \u2018rare exception\u2019 justifying use of the implied-bias doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Only a rare circumstance justifies disregarding the members\u2019 <em>voir dire </em>responses and the military judge\u2019s findings. Appellant\u2019s case is not such a circumstance. The majority has once again expanded the implied-bias doctrine unnecessarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Federal courts in addressing the same issue have indicated that the implied-bias rationale should be a \u201crare exception.\u201d <em>Hun-ley v. Godinez, </em>975 F.2d 316, 318 (7th Cir. 1992). Admittedly, there are differences between courts-martial with court members and jury trials with civilian jurors. These differences include the purpose of the military justice system, the type of individuals selected to be court members pursuant to Article 25(d)(2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 825(d)(2), and the protection given to general verdicts. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, </em>46 MJ 67 (1997). Selection of court members \u201cby reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament\u201d differs significantly from random selection of civilian jurors by voter-registration or driver\u2019s-license lists. Art. 25(d)(2). A military panel of court members has often been called a \u201cblue ribbon\u201d panel due to the quality of its members. <em>See </em>Jesse Bimbaum, <em>A New Breed of Brass: From the Ashes of Vietnam, the Pentagon Has Shaped a Sophisticated Military that Speaks Well and Fights Smart, </em>1991 WL 3118757, Time Magazine 58 (March 11,1991); David Gergen, <em>Bringing Home the \u201cStorm\u201d; What the Victorious American Military Could Teach the Rest of Us, </em>1991 WL 2142956, Washington Post (April 28, 1991). Arguably, this difference is such that invocation of the doctrine of implied bias should be even rarer in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Relying upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 MJ 212 (1996), and others, the majority holds there was an implied bias. Under the implied-bias rationale, if a reasonable person in listening to the <em>voir dire </em>would have decided that the proceedings were unfair, then this Court, applying a <em>de novo </em>review standard, would find error. The Court has not addressed whether these reasonable individuals have to be familiar with the military justice system. <em>Id. </em>at 217 (\u201cviewed ... through the eyes of the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The standard of review set forth by the majority undercuts the moral authority and .psychological support of the trial bench. The Court fails to realize that there is a collective judgment when certain findings or a sentence are announced. The deliberative process itself is protected. Mil.R.Evid. 606(b), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The nature of the general verdict was recognized by LtCol Snyder when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">I think the nature of a court-martial and the jury system, and as the judge said, the oath that I swore not to not only talk about it outside the courtroom but with other members at anytime is something that I take seriously and would cause it to be different than any of the other hypotheti-cals that we discussed. And could not be, you know, attributed directly to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Those who would try to penetrate the deliberative process and influence the court members\u2019 actions are prohibited from doing so by Article 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">The court members were instructed that they had the \u201cgrave responsibility\u201d of determining a sentence \u201cbased upon all the evidence presented and the instructions.\u201d They were instructed to consider all the alternative punishments and told they \u201cmay not have a preconceived idea or formula as to either the type or the amount of punishment.\u201d All members indicated that they could reach a decision on the sentence \u201con an individual basis in this particular case____\u201d These instructions ensured that the members would not rely upon the statements made by BGen Marr or LtCol Rollinger.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">In any event, any error was harmless. <em>United States v. Bannwarth, </em>36 MJ 265 (CMA 1993); <em>United States v. Heriot, </em>21 MJ 11 (CMA 1985). The maximum sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>a dishonorable discharge, 29 years\u2019 confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. Appellant was charged with numerous drug related offenses but received punishment far less than the maximum: a bad-conduct discharge, 2 years\u2019 confinement, partial forfeitures, and reduetion to the lowest enlisted grade. For the reasons set out above, I would affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
