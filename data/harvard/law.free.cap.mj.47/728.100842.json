The findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. Our reasoning is set out below.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-28\">In accordance with his pleas the appellant was convicted of misprision of a serious offense, intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1994) [hereinafter UCMJ]. The appellant does not contest these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-29\">Rather, the appellant asserts that the convening authority improperly considered the comments of the Division Sergeant Major regarding clemency in violation of Rule for Courts-Martial 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.) [hereinafter R.C.M.].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>ly, the appellant complains that he was not \u201cnotified and given an opportunity to rebut\u201d the Sergeant Major\u2019s comments prior to the convening authority\u2019s action. <em>Id. </em>As a result, argues the appellant, a new convening authority\u2019s action is required. Assignment of Errors and Brief at 4, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Military appellate courts have struggled with the consideration of \u201cmatters adverse to the accused from outside the record\u201d for more than 40 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii). This histoiy lesson has value only if it gives new intellectual vitality to precedent which shapes our understanding of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-946. <em>See also United States v. Allbery, </em>44 M.J. 226,227-28 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Government takes the untenable position \u201cthat [the convening authority] did not consider the [S]ergeant [M]ajor\u2019s memorandum when taking action on the case.\u201d Answer on Behalf of the Government at 4. When acting on the appellant\u2019s court-martial, the convening authority exercised a \u201ccommand prerogative.\u201d R.C.M. 1107(b)(1). <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 98-53, at 19 (1983). We would find it remarkable if a commander did not seek the counsel of his or her trusted advisors in such a weighty matter. The only thing unusual about this case is the attachment of the Sergeant Major\u2019s comments to the record of trial, and R.C.M. 1103(b)(3)(I) appears to require that such formal comments be attached to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">Our courts have never considered recommendations from the chain of command designed to enlighten the convening authority\u2019s clemency prerogative to be \u201cadverse matter from outside the record which [the accused] had no opportunity to rebut.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>9 C.M.A. at 497, 26 C.M.R. at 277. Observations \u201cthat the accused\u2019s protestations of remorse \u2018were not at all compelling nor convincing\u2019 \u201d and \u201cfair comment on the offenses of which the accused was convicted\u201d are not \u201csignificant statements] of \u2018new5 matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>9 C.M.A. 452, 453, 26 C.M.R. 232, 233, 1958 WL 3349 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">The Sergeant Major\u2019s comments recommend against clemency, but they contain no substantive matters from outside the record. Instead, the Sergeant Major relied only on the information available to the convening authority including the appellant\u2019s clemency request submitted in accordance with R.C.M. 1105 and 1106. <em>Supra </em>note 2. <em>See also Young, </em>9 C.M.A. 452,26 C.M.R. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">Even if the Sergeant Major\u2019s comments are new matter, recent decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces instruct us to \u201crequire appellant to demonstrate prejudice by stating what, if anything, would have been submitted to \u2018deny, counter, or explain\u2019 the new matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Chatman, </em>46 M.J. 321, 323 (1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel eloquently argues that the Sergeant Major\u2019s opinion ought to have been more favorable, but similar arguments were presented, just as elegantly, by appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel. Detailed Defense Counsel Memorandum regarding Post-Trial Matters dated 29 April 1996. There is no prejudice to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Nor do we believe that our decision encourages \u201cinherently prejudicial conduct.\u201d <em>Chatman, </em>46 M.J. at 324 (Sullivan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Commanders charged with weighty decisions \u201ccan solicit and consider the opinions of responsible officers or other persons, military and civilian[.]\u201d <em>United States v. McCoskey, </em>12 C.MA. 621, 623, 31 C.M.R. 207, 209, 1962 WL 4395 (1962). Unless these recommendations contain substantive information from outside the record of trial and the \u201cappellant makes some colorable showing of possible prejudice,\u201d <em>Chatman, </em>46 M.J. at 323-24, we will not require a new convening authority\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The appellant actively concealed a brutal assault. <em>See United States v. Hoff, </em>27 M.J. 70 (C.M.A1988). Clemency is not the function of this court, <em>United States v. Healy, </em>26 M.J. 394 (C.M.A1988), and the sentence, which includes a bad-conduct discharge, is not inappropriately severe. <em>United States v. Snelling, </em>14 M.J. 267 (C.M.A.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Senior Judge CLARK and Judge SEFTON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-17\">. I. THE CONVENING AUTHORITY IMPROPERLY CONSIDERED ADVERSE MATTERS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE RECORD AND APPELLANT WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE MATTERS OR GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THEM, IN VIOLATION OF R.C.M. 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">II. A SENTENCE WHICH INCLUDES AN UNSUSPENDED BAD-CONDUCT DISCHARGE IS INAPPROPRIATELY SEVERE IN THIS CASE WHERE APPELLANT NOT ONLY STOPPED THE ASSAULT ON SA SIMONEAU, BUT HE WAS ALSO NOT AWARE THAT SA SIMONEAU WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED WHEN HE CONCEALED THE CRIME, AND WHERE APPELLANT HAD AN EXEMPLARY RECORD OF SERVICE PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.
