The panel sentenced him to dismissal, confinement, and forfeiture of $2000.00 pay per month for 2 years. The convening authority approved the sentence, and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 43 MJ 693 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We granted review of these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED BY FAILING TO FIND UNLAWFUL COMMAND INFLUENCE IN MAJOR DENIER\u2019S CASE AND TO GRANT A REHEARING FOLLOWING A POST-TRIAL ARTICLE 39(a), UCMJ, SESSION WHERE THE MILITARY JUDGE LEARNED THAT TWO PANEL MEMBERS HAD DISCUSSED MAJOR DENIER\u2019S CASE IN A LATRINE AND THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT BECAUSE OF \u201cCOMMAND INTEREST\u201d THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RENDER CERTAIN RESULTS IN APPELLANT\u2019S COURT-MARTIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">WHETHER BASED UPON THE \u201cCOMMAND INTEREST\u201d CONVERSATION TWO PANEL MEMBERS HAD IN A LATRINE AT LEAST TWO OF THE COURT MEMBERS WERE NOT FREE TO RENDER AN IMPARTIAL VERDICT AND DID NOT ANSWER HONESTLY DURING VOIR DIRE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">We resolve both issues against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The Court of Criminal Appeals set out the background facts succinctly:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Appellant was a married emergency room physician at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. He has prior active duty service as an Army physician. Mrs. G is the young wife of an Air Force enlisted man, Airman First Class G. Appellant saw Mrs. G as a patient, treating her for a variety of medical problems. Appellant used this professional contact as a springboard for a personal relationship, which included drinks at a bar, rides in his sports car, and discussion of a motel room rendezvous. Appellant admitted this unbecoming conduct, which formed the basis for his guilty plea to the Article 133 offense. At the appellant\u2019s request, the military judge informed the court members of his guilty plea before they heard evidence on the contested cocaine distribution charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The remaining facts are in dispute. According to Mrs. G, she admitted past use of cocaine during one of her conversations with the appellant. Subsequently, the appellant told Mrs. G that he could supply her with some. Mrs. G told her husband about her relationship with the appellant, including his cocaine offer. Airman G was irate, and reported the matter to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Seymour Johnson. AFOSI agents contacted Mrs. G and she agreed to help them. AFOSI agents monitored a telephone conversation between the appellant and Mrs. G., and set up a \u201csting\u201d operation in a Seymour Johnson billeting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">AFOSI installed a video camera (picture only, no sound) in the billeting room. Mrs. G knew there was a camera, but the agents did not tell her where it was. By happenstance, the appellant put several bottles in front of the camera, obscuring the view of the appellant and Mrs. G much of the time. As a result, we never see cocaine produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>by either the appellant or Mrs. G. However, while the appellant is out of the room getting ice, we have an unobstructed view of Mrs. G, and she does not take anything from her body or clothing. Upon Mrs. G\u2019s signal that cocaine had been passed, agents entered the room, discovered cocaine spread out on a table, and apprehended the appellant. AFOSI also seized a razor blade and a straw cut in two pieces from the appellant\u2019s briefcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Appellant testified he was the victim of an extortion scheme cooked up by Airman and Mrs. G. According to the appellant, Mrs. G must have secreted the cocaine in her clothes or a body cavity, taken it out while he was out of the billeting room getting ice, and signaled AFOSI agents to enter. <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> Appellant explained he used the razor blade to cut up his own prescription medication into smaller doses, and cut the straw so Mrs. G could play with the pieces. He then described receiving \u201canonymous\" letters \u2014 but written in such a way to obviously imply that the author was Airman G \u2014 demanding money in exchange for dropping the charges. Appellant\u2019s civilian lawyer submitted these letters to a private forensic consultant, who discovered a hidden, indented writing on one letter. This hidden writing purported to be the full signature of Airman G.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">43 MJ at 696-97 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The granted issues derive from a post-trial letter and the post-trial Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), testimony of Captain Deputy Sheriff Michael Farrell of Burke County, Georgia. Farrell was a friend of appellant and a retired Army major. As a service company commander, Farrell had been appellant\u2019s commander for a time when appellant was in the Army. Farrell traveled to Seymour Johnson AFB on appellant\u2019s behalf as a potential defense character witness at the court-martial. Ultimately, Farrell was not called upon to testify, but instead his written statement was submitted during the presentencing phase of the trial. Farrell asserts that, as a potential witness, he \u201cwaited outside\u201d the court room as instructed and did not attend any sessions of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">The granted issues relate to a conversation Farrell reports overhearing in a latrine near the court room on the fourth day of the court-martial. <em>See infra. </em>Farrell deduced that the participants to the conversation were court members, and he regarded the tenor of the conversation as highly improper. Farrell concluded that command influence must have been at play in the court-martial and that, as a result, the members were predisposed to find appellant guilty or to sentence him severely.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Though Farrell had abundant opportunity to alert defense counsel or appellant of this impending injustice during recesses in the court-martial, he did not do so. Instead, he returned to Georgia before findings were announced. According to Farrell\u2019s post-trial testimony, he decided not to destroy the putative court members\u2019 careers. He reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">I know how difficult it is to get promoted in the service. I know by looking at those fellows with the amount of decorations they had that they were comers and they had a career ahead of them. I thought, and I wasn\u2019t privy to anything that went on in the trial inside the courtroom because I never sat inside of it, so I don\u2019t know if Major Denier was innocent or guilty, except that they found him guilty. I figured in my mind, I figured if I opened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>up this, I said \u201cthis is a can of worms,\u201d and I figured that if he was found guilty that he wouldn\u2019t get a harsh sentence, which I considered that sentence harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">He further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">I did not think that Major Denier would be found guilty or at least punished to the extent that he was punished. And I was going to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">When he found out the results of the trial, Farrell was \u201cshocked.\u201d As he later testified:</p>\n<p id=\"AA_\">I balanced men\u2019s careers who I think probably thought that they were doing the right thing against Major Denier\u2019s life. And when I found out what his punishment was going to be, I said well \u201cIn that case I think that what happened is that they were given the word to slamdunk him and they did,\u201d and I said, \u201cat that point in time, you\u2019ve got to do something about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">What Farrell decided to do was to write the Secretary of the Air Force. While he was in the process of writing the letter, he happened to have lunch with one of the judges in his county, and he asked the judge his opinion on the matter. The judge reportedly commented, \u201cOh, if I were the sitting Judge, I\u2019d be interested. I\u2019d want to know.\u201d But Farrell did not notify the military judge, or trial counsel, or defense counsel, or even appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Instead, he sent the following letter, dated September 8,1993, to the Secretary:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">In due course, the information was forwarded to the military judge, who immediately ordered counsel to review the letter and to communicate to him their respective positions. In accordance with the defense response, the military judge then ordered a post-trial Article 39(a) session. As it was ascertained that three of the six court members would not be available at the time of that session, and indeed that one of the members was abroad on an extended assignment, the military judge drafted a proposed questionnaire for the members, which he provided to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">After the military judge reviewed counsel\u2019s comments and made revisions based thereon, a two-page packet was distributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>members. <em>See </em>Appendix I at 262. The first page was an introductory, explanatory letter to the members. The letter required the members to acknowledge, by signature, that they had \u201cReceived and understood\u201d the documents. All members signed the first document.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The second page was the questionnaire, advising the members of the general nature of the allegedly overheard conversation, and asking the members to indicate, by initialing, the appropriate response. All of the members initialed the response:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">I am absolutely certain that I never overheard nor participated in such a conversation, nor am I aware that this or a similar conversation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">All but one of the questionnaires was signed by the respective members and attested by facially <em>bona fide </em>officials. The remaining questionnaire was not signed by the member, but was nevertheless subscribed by an officer described as \u201cCAPT, USAF[,] ASST OPERATIONS OFFICER.\u201d At the post-trial Article 39(a) session, the military judge accepted all documents from the members as appellate exhibits; there were no objections by the parties..</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">After receipt of the documents, the only witness at the post-trial session was Mr. Farrell, who was called at the behest of the court. He testified that he had been present at the court-martial \u201con Monday [August 16, 1993], and ... [he] stayed through till Saturday [August 21].\u201d The court-martial was in session from Tuesday, August 17, through Saturday, August 21, and it was completed on Monday, August 23. Farrell testified that, during the entire week he was at Seymour Johnson AFB, he \u201cwaited outside [the court room] as ... [he] was instructed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Apparently, Farrell had at least a general idea of who the court members were, because when asked by civilian defense counsel about \u201cthe movement of the jury in and out of the courtroom, down the hallway in front of the courtroom from using the latrines during that week,\u201d he testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">They were up and down that hallway a number of times. When you released them from the courtroom, they\u2019d walk up \u2014 I guess their jury room was up that way. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I would think so because they would walk up that way. Sometimes they walked and got coffee out of the little coffee break room.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Farrell remembered that the members \u201calways wore ... [their Air Force dress blues]. [He] remember[ed] it was hot and the air conditioner wasn\u2019t working very well in the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">When asked by the military judge to \u201cdescribe in words as accurate as you remember, the entire conversation, that you over-' heard\u201d in the latrine, Farrell replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Well, I put down in my letter what I remembered, and as time goes on, my memory ... I didn\u2019t take notes when I was in the stall. I refrained from putting in one of the comments in that letter because I didn\u2019t really think it had a lot to do with what I found out, and I thought it was kind of disrespectful, so I didn\u2019t put it in there. But it led me to believe that these two people who were speaking were members of the jury. They were rather crude in their remarks concerning the prosecutor and they said several crude things and then they went on to say basically that \u201cif it weren\u2019t for command interest and problems they were having with the sexuality with the Tailhook scandal,\u201d their words, not mine, \u201cMajor Denier probably wouldn\u2019t get found guilty or just get a slap on the wrist.\u201d One of them said, and I remember that, he said, \u201cShit happens,\u201d and the other fellow said, \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t happen to me,\u201d which is not very complimentary, but that\u2019s basically what they said. The reason I didn\u2019t put the comment about the prosecutor down was because, like I said, it was kind of rough and I didn\u2019t know where that letter was going to go and who was going to read it.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>When the military judge asked whether the conversation was really about the prosecutor, Farrell responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">What I thought was, and I think this is exactly ... This is what I thought. I thought what they said was that they had made up their mind the prosecutor wouldn\u2019t have got a conviction. That\u2019s what I thought, and I thought that\u2019s what they were saying, and I still believe that\u2019s what they are saying, that they had made up their mind and that there was in fact command interest or influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On examination by defense counsel, Farrell expanded:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">It\u2019s very clear to me when they said that about the prosecutor and then they said about command influence and they said about Tail Hook, that they had been leaned on and told what to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">When Farrell \u201chear[d] a zipper go up,\u201d he \u201cstood up to see if ... [he] could catch a good view of the people who were making these statements.\u201d Cracking the stall door, he noticed that both men were lieutenant colonels, both were in blue uniforms, and both were Caucasians. According to Farrell, they all [sic] had what I call \u201cfruit salad,\u201d a bunch of ribbons. It looked like they were aviators, but they had some big wings, but one of them was a parachutist.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Farrell testified that he did not get a good look at their faces and that, even if they were standing in front of him, he could not identify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">A review of the court-members\u2019 official records revealed that all were male lieutenant colonels, all were Caucasian, two of the six were authorized to wear jump wings, and four of the six were authorized to wear aviator wings. Further, the military judge noted for the record that, with the exception of civilian defense counsel, everyone associated with the court-martial wore the Air Force \u201cClass A uniform\u201d throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">In Farrell\u2019s recollection, this conversation occurred on Friday [August 20]. With the concurrence of the defense, the court members had been informed by the military judge on Tuesday, August 17, that appellant had pleaded guilty to conduct unbecoming an officer in connection with his relationship with Mrs. G.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Based on Farrell\u2019s testimony that he did not see the supposed members\u2019 faces, the defense agreed with the military judge that it would be useless to have Farrell attempt to identify the speakers \u201cthrough photographs or otherwise.\u201d Neither the military judge nor the parties desired that any other witnesses be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">Thereafter, the military judge heard the arguments of counsel. In essence, the defense argued that command influence had been sufficiently shown to warrant setting aside the findings and sentence and that a rehearing should be granted or the charges dismissed. The Government disputed the probability of Farrell\u2019s testimony. The military judge then adjourned the post-trial Article 39(a) session on November 2, 1993, pending transcription and authentication of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-15\">On November 16, 1993, the military judge authenticated the record and issued Post-Trial Ruling No. 1. Appendix II at 264. Therein he cited many of the facts set out above. The judge seems to have concluded that Farrell indeed overheard a conversation in the latrine and that there was a \u201creference to Tailhook and the command interest that followed.\u201d However, the judge was not impressed, for a variety of reasons, with the \u201cinterpretation of the conversation\u201d derived by Farrell. Ultimately, the judge concluded, \u201cThere is <em>no evidence </em>that any unlawful command interest, direct or indirect, was brought to bear upon the members in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, the military judge found no basis to impeach the findings and sentence. <em>See </em>ROM 923, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">The Court of Criminal Appeals similarly found various \u201cdubious aspects of Mr. Farrell\u2019s story.\u201d Assuming \u2014 not finding \u2014 Farrell's testimony to be substantially accurate, that court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">Appellant has presented <em>no evidence </em>that anyone \u201cacting with the mantle of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>mand authority\u201d attempted to influence this court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">48 MJ at 699 (emphasis added), citing, <em>inter alia, United States v. Ayala, </em>43 MJ 296, 300 (1995); <em>United States v. Stombaugh, </em>40 MJ 208, 211, 213 (CMA 1994); <em>United States v. Allen, </em>33 MJ 209 (CMA 1991); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>22 MJ 388 (CMA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Before this Court, appellant reiterates his contention that command influence tainted his court-martial, and he argues that, \u201c[a]t the very least, ... a <em>DuBay </em>hearing [should] be held to resolve unanswered questions concerning the nonresponse of one of the court members through his unsigned affidavit.\u201d Final Brief at 12. <em>See United States v. Du-Bay, </em>17 USCMA 147, 37 CMR 411 (1967). Appellant also argues that the alleged conversation demonstrates that he \u201cdid not receive a fair trial,\u201d in that \u201cat least two of ... [the members] were not candid during <em>voir dire </em>about outside influences on their decisions as court members____\u201d Final Brief at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">We noted in <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 393, that \u201c[c]ommand influence is the mortal enemy of military justice.\u201d In pertinent part, Article 37(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 837(a), denounces command influence in these terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">No person subject to this chapter may attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the actions of a court-martial or any other military tribunal or any member thereof, in reaching the findings or sentence in any case, or the action of any convening, approving, or reviewing authority with respect to his judicial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"apo-dedup-0\">We have construed the unlawful-command-influence species of Article 37 as \u201cinvolvflng] some mantle of command authority in the alleged unlawful activity.\u201d <em>Stombaugh, supra </em>at 211.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Appellant\u2019s burden here was to demonstrate that someone \u201cacting with the \u2018mantle of command authority' \u201d attempted to influence the court-martial. <em>Ayala, </em>43 MJ at 300. Being a court without factfinding power, Art. 67(e), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 867(c)(1994), we accept the assumptions of the courts below that Farrell was not fabricating in claiming that he overheard a conversation relating to the Tailhook scandal and its impact on the military community. Mere common knowledge, however, of front-page, newsworthy events does not equate to evidence of improper command influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">The lower court\u2019s conclusions that no evidence of command influence was shown by the proponent are fully justified in this record. In particular, the findings of the military judge make it clear that: (1) all of the members denied making any of the disputed statements; (2) Farrell could not positively identify the statements as having been made by a court member; (3) the circumstances raised significant doubts as to the precision of Farrell\u2019s recollection, and Farrell\u2019s recollection of the substance of the conversation \u201clackfed] credibility\u201d; (4) the defense introduced no evidence of influence by persons acting under the mantle of command authority, and the defense was not denied any opportunity to obtain such evidence from the members or the command.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">We also reject appellant\u2019s call for' a <em>DuBay </em>hearing to investigate further the unsigned affidavit of one of the members. First, when of the matter of the affidavits was expressly before the court-martial in post-trial session, the defense offered no objection to the documents and it affirmatively declined the opportunity to call additional witnesses. The opportunity to obtain a fuller explanation of the member\u2019s affidavit was thereby waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">Furthermore, there is a perfectly plausible explanation for the absence of the signature. The documents were sent as part of a two-page packet. The member was requested to sign the first page, which he did. The place for signature attestation was at the bottom of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the second page. If the document was perceived as an integrated, two-page submission, it would seem quite plausible to construe it as unnecessary to sign more than once. This assumption is buttressed by the fact that the place for the affiant\u2019s signature on the second page is indented beneath the election requesting a private conference with the military judge. This juxtaposition may readily have suggested that the second page should only be signed if the member was requesting such a conference. The defense\u2019s disinterest in seeking more information when the opportunity was afforded moots further speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Appellant\u2019s allegation of partiality of the court members also fails. Even though no evidence of unlawful command influence was presented, a member\u2019s partiality would be open to question, of course, if it were shown that the member believed that a particular result should be obtained to please the command. In such circumstances, there would be no requirement to prove that a person with the mantle of command authority had acted improperly because the issue of impartiality focuses on the belief of the member, not the position of the command. Here, the responses by the members to the questionnaire, in light of the military judge\u2019s and Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 findings that Farrell\u2019s recollection lacked credibility, are sufficient to reject the claim of partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Judges CRAWFORD, GIERKE, and EFFRON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. Appellant acknowledged all the elements to the offense of conduct unbecoming an officer and most of the specific conduct alleged. The sole point of departure concerned one portion of the conduct alleged in the specification pertaining to his \"inviting her to have alcoholic drinks\u201d at public drinking establishments. With respect to that portion of the conduct, appellant pleaded guilty only to \u201ctalking to her about having alcoholic drinks\u201d at public drinking establishments. The prosecution elected to attempt to prove the charged language, but the members found appellant guilty in accordance with his pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">2. In closing argument, trial counsel pointed out the unlikelihood that Mrs. G \u2014 knowing that she was being videotaped \u2014 would produce drugs from some location that had escaped detection during the search before her meeting with appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[3]\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\">3. Apparently, the defense produced these documents the day before trial, having sat on them for weeks. On cross-examination, trial counsel asked appellant, in effect, why they were trying to blind-side the court-martial with these documents? Why, instead, had he not brought these allegedly exculpatory documents to the attention of the authorities sooner, if they were real? The authorities obviously would have pursued that line of inquiry, and if the documents had come from Airman or Mrs. G, their allegations would have been cast in a radically different light. Appellant could not, however, explain why the documents were being sprung on the court-martial, other than to attribute the tactic to civilian defense counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">4. Farrell later asserted that the supposed members called the prosecutor a \"dumb c ...\u201d and added \"that if it wasn't for the fact that there was some command interest, she wouldn\u2019t get a conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-10\">. We have previously recognized that the literal language of Article 37(a), 47 MJ at 261, includes circumstances in which the unlawful coercion comes from a person not acting with the \"mantle of command authority.\" <em>Stombaugh, </em>40 MJ at 213. In this case, however, where the issue expressly framed by appellant relies upon \"unlawful <em>command </em>influence\u201d (emphasis added) as the source of alleged unlawful influence, we confine our inquiry to whether the source of that alleged influence acted with \"some mantle of command authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b297-8\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Au4\">(dissenting in part and concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The legal premise of this opinion disturbs me and should disturb others who worry about the danger of someone unlawfully influencing the action of a court-martial. <em>See generally </em>Art. 37, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 837. Specifically, the majority misreads or misinterprets this codal provision in a way that significantly narrows a servicemember\u2019s protection from an unfair trial. <em>See United States v. Ayala, </em>43 MJ 296, 301 (Sullivan, C.J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, and joining Wiss\u2019 dissent). In Article 37(a), Congress has said that \u201c[n]o person subject to this chapter\u201d can lawfully influence the outcome of a court-martial. The majority in the case at bar ignores the plain words of this statute and adds, without support, its own words, \u201cacting with the \u2018mantle of command authority.\u2019\u201d 47 MJ at 261; <em>see Ayala, </em>43 MJ at 300 (\u201cpressure from peers is not unlawful ... influence, ... \u2018command\u2019 or otherwise\u201d). The majority\u2019s judicial addition to Article 37 cannot be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">An added burden is placed on an accused trying to prove his or her trial was unlawfully influenced. It means he or she not only has to prove that the trial was improperly influenced by a military member subject to the UCMJ (the statute\u2019s only requirement) but also that the military member violating Article 37 was wearing something \u2014 a \u201cmantle of command authority\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. While this claimed error has been shown <em>on the record </em>to be harmless to appellant (see, <em>e.g., United States v. Sullivan, </em>26 MJ 442 (CMA 1988)), I do not agree that his claim should be rejected out of hand as legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Hopefully, the majority would find Article 37 was violated if a court-martial member tried to unlawfully influence the court-martial he was sitting on pursuant to secret written orders from the base commander of an air base. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>19 MJ 159 (CMA 1985). There, the majority would find that Article 37 was violated since there would be someone \u201cacting with the \u2018mantle of command authority\u2019 \u201d interfering with the operation of a court-martial. Is not this too much to prove? In my view, all that needs to be proved in this case is that someone subject to the UCMJ tried to improperly influence the vote of the court members either as to findings or sentence. Article 37 clearly indicates on its face that rank or grade or command does not matter when the fairness of a court-martial is at issue. Moreover, we have long recognized the subtle and sophisticated ways that unlawful influence may effect a court-martial in its solemn task. Accordingly, I cannot join this continued judicial evisceration of this critical provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. <em>United States v. Stombaugh, </em>40 MJ 208, 215 (CMA 1994) (Sullivan, C.J., concurring in the result).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"A_2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"a1c-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>APPENDIX II \u2014 Continued had distributed cocaine. The defense theory was that the accused had been set up by a guilty paramour and her jealous husband. By the time that the conversation described by Mr. Farrell allegedly occurred, the members had heard all the prosecution evidence and most of the defense evidence, including the testimony of the accused and his questioned document examiner witness. In a military environment where antipathy to illegal drugs, particularly cocaine, 'is patently obvious, it strains credulity to believe that mature lieutenant colonels would be agreeing that an Air Force physician of field grade rank, accused of distribution of cocaine to a female patient married to an enlisted member in a' billeting room on base where had appears to have entended to have sexual relations would have \u201cgotten off with a slap on the wrist except for Tailhook and the command interest\", while some comments about Tailhook may have been made in this bathroom talk., they appear to have -had no relationship to the.case. There is no evidence that any unlawful command influence, direct or indirect, was brought to bear upon the members in this case. Under oath, the members indicated in voir dire that they had no knowledge of the facts of the case from any source, including private conversations, nor did they have any knowledge of the reputation of the accused or his emergency medicine clinic. Further, if a bathroom conversation occurred between two of the members, it apparently held such little significance that none of the members now (including the participants) have any recollection at all of such an event. Had members been exposed to command influence of the nature described by Mr. Farrell, this hardly seems likely. RULING. Having carefully considered all the evidence, I find that the findings and sentence of the court are proper on their face and that no basis pursuant to R.C.M 923 exists to impeach them based on extraneous prejudicial information, outside influence or unlawful command influence.
