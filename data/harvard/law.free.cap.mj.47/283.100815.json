BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">A. THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">In <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), the Supreme Court addressed the tension between the prosecution\u2019s historic privilege to exercise peremptory challenges unfettered by \u201cjudicial control\u201d and \u201cthe constitutional prohibition on exclusion of persons from jury service on account of race.\u201d <em>See Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 91, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 1720, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), citing 380 U.S. at 214-24, 85 S.Ct. at 832-38; U.S. Const., amend. XIV (Equal Protection Clause). The Court held in <em>Swain </em>that it was appropriate to presume that a prosecutor had properly exercised the State\u2019s challenges, and it declined to examine the prosecutor\u2019s actions in the case under review. The Court noted, however, that a defendant could rebut the presumption through proof that the prosecutor had used challenges to exclude persons on the basis of race by showing, for example, a repeated pattern \u201cin case after case.\u201d 380 U.S. at 223-24, 85 S.Ct. at 837-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Twenty-one years later, the Court in <em>Bat-son </em>concluded that <em>Swain </em>had \u201cplaced on defendants a crippling burden of proof\u2019 that had rendered prosecutors\u2019 use of peremptory challenges \u201clargely immune from constitutional scrutiny.\u201d 476 U.S. at 92-93,106 S.Ct. at 1721. The Court, in light of evolving standards of proof in other areas of the law involving allegations of discrimination, established new procedures for considering an alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">First, the \u201cdefendant may establish a <em>pri-ma fade </em>case of purposeful discrimination\u201d based \u201csolely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>dant \u201cmust show that he [or she] is a member of a cognizable racial group, ... that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove\u201d members of that group from the jury, and \u201cthat these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor\u201d excluded persons from the jury on account of race, such as \u201ca \u2018pattern\u2019 of strikes\u201d or the prosecutor\u2019s statements and questions during <em>voir dire </em>and while exercising challenges. 476 U.S. at 96-97,106 S.Ct. at 1722-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Second, once the defendant has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201cthe burden shifts to the\u201d Government \u201cto come forward with a neutral explanation\u201d for the challenge, related to the particular case to be tried. The \u201cexplanation need not rise to the level\u201d of justification for a challenge for cause, but the prosecutor may not merely deny \u201cthat he had a discriminatory motive\u201d or affirm that the challenges were exercised in \u201cgood faith.\u201d 476 U.S. at 97-98, 106 S.Ct. at 1723-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Third, the trial court must determine whether \u201cthe defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The Supreme Court declined to formulate specific procedures to implement its holding \u201c[i]n light of the variety of jury selection practices followed in our state and federal trial courts____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99 n. 24,106 S.Ct. at 1725, n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">B. APPLICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK TO TRIALS UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">\u201c [T]he protections in the Bill of Rights, except those which are expressly or by necessary implication inapplicable, are available to members of our armed forces.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacoby, </em>11 USCMA 428, 430-31, 29 CMR 244, 246-47 (1960). In <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 MJ 380 (1988), we considered whether the prohibition against discriminatory use of peremptory challenges in jury selection, as set forth in Batson\u2019s equal-protection analysis, should be</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">applied to use of peremptory challenges in courts-martial. <em>Cf. Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>411 U.S. 677, 680, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1767, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973) (The concept of equal protection of the laws applies to members of the armed forces through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.). We recognized that servicemembers do not have the right in a court-martial to a jury panel drawn from a representative cross-section of the population, 26 MJ at 389, citing Art. 25, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 825, but we noted that <em>Batson </em>was based on the \u201cequal-protection right to be tried by a jury from which no \u2018cognizable racial group\u2019 ha[d] been excluded,\u201d not on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90. We found no reason to exclude members of the armed forces from the protections of <em>Batson, </em>observing that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">even if we were not bound by <em>Batson, </em>the principle it espouses should be followed in the administration of military justice. In our American society, the Armed Services have been a leader in eradicating racial discrimination. With this history in mind, we are sure that Congress never intended to condone the use of a government peremptory challenge for the purpose of excluding a \u201ccognizable racial group.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">26 MJ at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">C. IMPLEMENTATION OF <em>BATSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>26 MJ 692 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc), the Army Court of Military Review<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> noted that implementation of <em>Bat-son </em>in the military justice system would require an understanding of the structural differences between court-martial panels and civilian juries. Specifically, the court noted that (1) \u201ccourts-martial are not subject to the jury trial\u201d requirements of the Constitution; (2) military accused are tried by a panel of their superiors, \u201cnot by a jury of their peers\u201d; (3) military panels are selected by the commander who convened the court-martial on a best-qualified basis and are not \u201cdrawn from a random cross-section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>community\u201d; (4) military counsel are provided with only a single peremptory challenge, in contrast to the numerous peremptory challenges permitted by most civilian jurisdictions; and .(5) in civilian jurisdictions, the numerous peremptory challenges are used to \u201cselect\u201d a jury, but in courts-martial, a peremptory challenge is used to eliminate those already selected by the convening authority. <em>Id. </em>at 699. The court relied upon the importance of avoiding \u201cthe use of stereotypes for any purpose within the court-martial system\u201d rather than on a history of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The Court of Military Review concluded that, \u201c[bjecause of the differences between courts-martial and other criminal trials, both legal and systemic, the specific procedural formulation adopted in <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>... to address purposeful racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges does not apply to courts-martial.\u201d 26 MJ at 700. In view of the differences, the court adopted a modified version of <em>Batson. </em>Instead of Batson\u2019s requirement to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the court held that, when an \u201caccused is a <em>member of </em>a recognized racial group and the government peremptorily challenges a member of the court-martial panel who is also a member of the accused\u2019s racial group, we will require only that the accused state an objection to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The Court of Military Review observed that relieving the defense of the obligation to prove a <em>prima facie </em>case would not place too great a burden on the prosecution in the context of the military community:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Unlike the situation in the civilian context, trial and defense counsel are usually familiar with the court members, have had the opportunity to work with some of them in some capacity, or observed at least some of them in prior trials. Some members will be known to counsel by way of reputation for being particularly lenient or harsh, for having a law enforcement background, etc. <em>This familiarity with the court members will make the burden on military trial counsel to articulate race neutral reasons for the exclusion of a single minority member less difficult than that imposed on their civilian counterparts, who are exposed to each venireman only briefly.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 701 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The Court of Military Review then articulated the following approach for examining trial counsel\u2019s explanation for the challenge: (1) \u201cthe reasons provided by\u201d trial counsel must be \u201cclearly stated for the record\u201d; (2) \u201cthe military judge will rule on the issue and make findings of fact\u201d; and (3) <em>\u201c[iff a reasonable, racially neutral explanation is not presented, the peremptory challenge will be disallowed.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The court emphasized that it would not \u201crubber stamp\u201d explanations from trial counsel, but it noted the importance of limiting the \u201cscrutiny into the reason provided,\u201d protecting the privacy of prospective members, and discouraging evidentiary hearings. Because \u201cthe issue hinges on credibility of the explanations provided,\u201d the court stated that \u201cgreat deference will be given to the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Upon review in this Court, we agreed with the lower court that the differences between military and civilian proceedings made it inappropriate to require the defense to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. 28 MJ 366, 368 (1989). We adopted the <em>per se </em>rule fashioned by the court below, under which any objection by the accused to trial counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge to a member of the same racial group as the accused would impose upon trial counsel a requirement to offer a race-neutral explanation. <em>Id. </em>We added that trial counsel must offer a \u201cclear and reasonably specific explanation of legitimate reasons\u201d for the challenge and that, \u201c[ajlthough the reasons stated need not rise to the level justifying a challenge for cause, trial counsel cannot assume or intuit that race makes the member partial to the accused and cannot merely affirm his good faith or deny bad faith in the use of his challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">D. NATURE OF THE EXPLANATION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">In <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995), the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>preme Court set forth the standard for reviewing whether a prosecutor has provided a permissible race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge after the defense has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination. The Court noted that the prosecutor was not required to offer \u201can explanation that is persuasive or even plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771, citing <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866-67, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion). The Court held that any race-neutral explanation, such as the prospective juror\u2019s long hair, was permissible and that there is no requirement for the prosecutor to offer \u201ca reason that makes sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769, 115 S.Ct. at 1771. According to the Court, it is inappropriate to focus on \u201cthe reasonableness of the asserted nonracial motive\u201d rather than on \u201cthe genuineness of the motive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769, 115 S.Ct. at 1771-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The issue before us in the present case is how to apply <em>Purkett, </em>a rule fashioned for a civilian jury system, in the military context. As the Court of Military Review noted in <em>Moore, </em>a civilian jury is derived from a representative, randomly selected cross-section of the population. Few, if any, of the prospective jurors are likely to be known by. counsel. In civilian trials, numerous peremptory challenges are provided to each party as a means of selecting the final composition of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In military life, the court-martial panel is selected by the convening authority on the basis of a best-qualified standard. All members selected by the convening authority serve on the panel unless removed through a challenge for cause, exercise of the one peremptory challenge generally permitted to each party (see Art. 41(b), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 841(b)), or under the military judge\u2019s limited power to excuse a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In contrast to a prospective civilian juror, who is not required to possess any significant degree of education, experience, or judicial temperament, the military member comes to the court-martial panel cloaked with the designation by a senior commander, the convening authority, that the member is \u201cbest qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament.\u201d Art. 25(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\"><em>Purkett </em>reflects the Supreme Court\u2019s sensitivity to the fact that in civilian life \u2014 where there are virtually no qualifications for jury service \u2014 instinct necessarily plays a significant role in the use of peremptory challenges to ensure that both the Government and the accused are able to present the case to jurors capable of understanding it and rendering a fair verdict. While instinct serves any counsel, civilian or military, who is seeking to shape a jury, there is a less compelling need for counsel in courts-martial to exercise such challenges in order to ensure that panel members are qualified, because the convening authority already has taken that into account in exercising his responsibilities under Article 25 to select members on the basis of a \u201cbest-qualified\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The Court of Military Review in <em>Moore </em>carefully considered the differences between military and civilian tribunals and held that trial counsel must offer \u201ca reasonable, racially neutral explanation.\u201d 26 MJ at 701. To the extent that <em>Purkett </em>suggests that unreasonable or implausible explanations may suffice in civilian society, we adhere to the analysis of the differences in military and civilian tribunals in both the lower court\u2019s opinion and our own opinion in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">In <em>Moore, </em>we declined to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>procedure for determining whether there is a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Today we hold that the same reasons require us to apply a different standard for assessing the validity of trial counsel\u2019s proffered race-neutral explanation. Once the convening authority has designated a servicemember as \u201cbest qualified\u201d to serve on a court-martial panel, trial counsel may not strike that person on the basis of a proffered reason, under <em>Batson </em>and <em>Moore, </em>that is unreasonable, implausible, or that otherwise makes no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">II. APPLICATION OF <em>MOORE </em>TO THE PRESENT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">In the case before us, charges against appellee, an African-American, were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ferred to trial before a panel selected by the convening authority, which included Staff Sergeant (SSGT) E, also an African-American. When trial counsel sought to exercise a peremptory challenge against SSGT E, she explained her basis by noting SSGT E\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, in general. I was observing him during <em>voir dire, </em>and he seemed to be blinking a lot; he seemed uncomfortable.\u201d Defense counsel disputed these observations and objected to the challenge as insufficiently justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The military judge made no findings of fact in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection to trial counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge. Instead, he simply referred to his past observation of trial counsel and provided her with an opportunity to assert that her explanation was made in good faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">Captain [K] [trial counselj\u2019s been very forthright with the Court in the past. I assume, Captain [K], that you\u2019re, likewise, being forthright this time; that you have no other reason for substituting or for excusing this member?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Trial counsel responded: \u201cNo sir, we do not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ArT\">The Court of Criminal Appeals reversed, holding that trial counsel had \u201cutterly failed to defend [the peremptory challenge] as non-pretext.\u201d 44 MJ at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As the court below noted, trial counsel\u2019s vague reference to the challenged member\u2019s demeanor \u201cdid not articulate any connection, race-neutral or otherwise, between what she observed of the member\u2019s demeanor and what that demeanor indicated concerning the rejected member\u2019s ability to faithfully execute his duties on a court-martial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\"><em>Batson </em>precludes counsel from relying on an assertion of good faith as justification for a peremptory challenge. 47 MJ at 284r-285. The military judge\u2019s leading question, which induced a \u201cgood-faith\u201d response from trial counsel, provides no basis for concluding that trial counsel had a race-neutral explanation for the challenge. The military judge\u2019s decision to rule based on his pre-existing professional relationship with trial counsel eliminated the possibility of any Raison-based challenge to trial counsel\u2019s exercise of this peremptory challenge. Once defense counsel raised the <em>Batson-Moore </em>issue, the burden of production \u2014 that is, the burden to assert a race-neutral explanation \u2014 shifted to the Government. The military judge ignored that shift and did not require trial counsel to produce anything, much less the \u201cclear and reasonably specific explanation of legitimate reasons to challenge\u201d that we endorsed in <em>Moore, supra </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">In the ease before us, trial counsel challenged an African-American staff sergeant on the grounds that he \u201cblinkfed]\u201d and \u201cseemed uncomfortable,\u201d a rationale for challenge asserted in anticipation of defense counsel\u2019s objection. Given the select nature of the pool of court-martial members chosen by the convening authority and the presumption that those members are the \u201cbest qualified\u201d to serve on the court-martial, the statement by trial counsel that a member \u201cseemed uncomfortable\u201d does not, without further explanation, provide a sufficiently articulated reason to sustain a challenge under <em>Moore. </em>The issue in this case is not only the factual dispute as to whether the member \u201cblink[ed]\u201d or \u201clooked uncomfortable\u201d \u2014 characteristics likely exhibited by many who sit on courts-martial. Also at issue is whether there was something about this member\u2019s blinking or level of discomfort that would provide a reasonable, race-neutral basis for the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">As we noted in <em>Moore, </em>argument of counsel normally will suffice to provide the record upon which the basis for a peremptory challenge may be assessed, although the military judge has discretion to \u201cfashion more extensive proceedings in order to make a proper record.\u201d 28 MJ at 369. The military judge normally can and should resolve a dispute about the factual basis for a peremptory challenge without an evidentiary hearing. When the dispute involves in-court observations about a member, the military judge may be able to make findings of fact based upon his or her own observations as to whether the member exhibited the behavior referenced by counsel. In any case, the military judge should make findings of fact when the underlying factual predicate for a peremptory challenge is disputed. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>States v. Perez, </em>35 F.3d 632, 636 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>we held that \u201ctrial counsel ... cannot merely affirm his good faith or deny bad faith in the use of his challenge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369. That is what happened in this case. Thus, the military judge erred in handling appellant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge by relying on the good faith of trial counsel rather than by making findings of fact that would establish a reasonable, plausible race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge by the Government of a member chosen as \u201cbest qualified\u201d by a senior military commander. The obligation to make such a finding is not a burdensome requirement within the court-martial system. <em>See Moore, </em>26 MJ at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals ordering a rehearing is affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Chief Judge COX and Judge GIERKE concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\">. <em>See </em>n. 3, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\">.

Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), has been uniformly accepted in the military. E.g., <em>United States v. Witham, </em>47 MJ 297 (1997); <em>United States v. Greene, </em>36 MJ 274, 281 (CMA 1993); <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 MJ 380, 390 (CMA 1988). Under this precedent and in view of the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765,115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995), trial counsel offered a legitimate race-neutral reason for his peremptory challenge (i.e., the juror\u2019s demean- or). The military judge properly evaluated trial counsel\u2019s credibility in terms of her past practice before the judge and her performance as an officer of the court. <em>United States v.

The majority holds that <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995), does not apply in the military context when the prosecutor sets forth a race-neutral explanation for a peremptory strike against an African-American which is not objectively verifiable by the trial judge and is disputed by the parties. In support of its view, the majority cites the differences between civilian juries and military court panels. However, noticeably lacking from the majority\u2019s discussion is any evidence of past patterns of discrimination in the military community such as existed in the civilian community. The reasons set forth by the majority for not applying <em>Elem </em>are really reasons for not applying <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), in the military in the first instance. With all due respect to my colleagues in the majority, when examined in this context, the fallacy of the majority\u2019s reasoning is readily apparent. Because the majority refuses to follow Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>preme Court precedent and continues this Court\u2019s practice of fashioning a different rule for the military without adequate justification,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The majority correctly recognizes that <em>Batson </em>is based upon the Fifth Amendment \u201cequal protection right to be tried by a jury from which no \u2018cognizable racial group\u2019 ha[d] been excluded.\u201d 47 MJ at 285. Surely, there can be no dispute that this important equal-protection right applies to servieemem-bers accused of crimes as well as to their civilian counterparts. The issues, however, are (1) whether there was a deprivation of this right in the military as there was in many civilian systems, and, (2) whether the prophylactic measures of <em>Batson, </em>and especially its more restrictive progeny in this Court, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>28 MJ 366 (CMA 1989), and <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 MJ 380 (CMA 1988), were necessary in the military context to remedy a phantom deprivation. This Court in <em>Moore </em>eliminated the requirement for the opponent to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination. Now the Court eliminates soft data for both sides, such as tone of voice, body language, or blinking as a race-neutral explanation under <em>Batson. </em>One wonders whether the majority even leaves intact the third step in <em>Batson, </em>because here they did not even require the opponent to prove purposeful racial discrimination. 514 U.S. at 767,115 S.Ct. at 1770-71. <em>See Tulloch, infra </em>at 294 (Crawford, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The majority goes to great lengths to describe the differences between the military and the civilian jury systems while discussing the history of the application of <em>Batson </em>to the military. I have no dispute with the accuracy of the majority\u2019s discussion. I do, however, question why the majority does not follow that discussion to its logical conclusion and consider why it is necessary to apply a more stringent standard to the military where there is no evidence of a present or historical equal-protection deprivation in the military\u2019s jury-selection process than, in contrast, to the civilian system which is replete with historical equal-protection violations. This Court does not have the luxury that state courts have to expand rights as a matter of state law under a state constitution <em>(California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 43, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 1630, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988) (acknowledging that \u201c [\u00a1Individual States, may surely construe their constitution as imposing more stringent constraints____\u201d)). Thus, I would conclude that the majority has not demonstrated adequate grounds or justification to fashion a more restrictive rule in the military context.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">Trial counsel\u2019s challenge of the member was based upon this colloquy taken from the record of trial during <em>voir dire </em>of members by defense counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">DC: Staff Sergeant [E], you\u2019re the junior member of this panel, obviously, by the rank that you have. If you believe, at the end of the Government\u2019s case, that they have not met \u2014 that they have failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and that, therefore, Private Tulloch was not guilty, and every other panel member disagreed with you and thought him to be guilty, would you, nevertheless, vote not guilty\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">SSG [E]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-16\">DC: \u2014 or could you be swayed to turn because of everybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">SSG [E]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>DC: So if you believed he was not guilty, no rank could influence you to change your vote?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">SSG [E]: [Negative response.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">Subsequently trial counsel indicated her intent to exercise a peremptory challenge. The following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">TC: A little overly eager, sir. I\u2019m sorry. The Government would challenge Staff Sergeant [E], sir. And, in anticipation of the <em>Batson </em>issue\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">MJ: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">TC: \u2014 the Government\u2019s position is that it was Staff Sergeant [E\u2019s] demeanor when Captain [S] [defense counsel] questioned him about whether he would be influenced at all by other members of the panel, and just his demeanor, in general. I was observing him during <em>voir dire, </em>and he seemed to be blinking a lot; he seemed uncomfortable. The Government\u2019s not challenging him at all based on his race. MJ: And the fact that he\u2019s the junior member \u2014 does that have any bearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">TC: No, sir, it does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">MJ: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">DC: Your Honor, I\u2019d object to that based upon <em>Batson. </em>His answer was very unequivocal. He showed no emotions throughout. There was no [e]motions noted; there was no emotions throughout. His entire answer \u2014 he answered one question-just like \u2014 I mean, that could \u2014 you could \u2014 every panel member who answered a question could be struck for that reason, and we object that that is a subterfuge, that there is something else here, and we object to that striking \u2014 that challenge for \u2014 the peremptory challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">MJ: Captain [K] [trial counsel]\u2019s been very forthright with the Court in the past. I assume, Captain [K] that you\u2019re, likewise, being forthright this time; that you have no other reason for substituting \u2014 or for excusing this member?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">TC: No, sir, we do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">MJ: And it\u2019s particularly not race \u2014 although I do note that [of 11 members] there are several other minority members on the panel, including the sergeant major who was just in, as well as one female member\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">TC: Sir, Sergeant First Class [B] and Sergeant First Class [KA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">ATC: And, for the record, sir, Lieutenant Colonel [B] is also a minority member, based on his worksheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-19\">MJ: Okay. Well, I\u2019m satisfied that the Government has exercised its peremptory challenge on a non-discriminatory basis, just as the defense, by observing the demeanor of members, may perceive a member to be glaring at the accused or at counsel and feel uncomfortable with that member\u2019s demeanor. The Government is similarly entitled to excuse a member. Defense, any peremptory challenge?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">At the outset I acknowledge that these issues arise from the lower court\u2019s attempt to deal with a difficult and complex issue \u2014 what the military judge must do when there is a factual dispute relating to the race-neutral explanation for the exercise of a peremptory challenge governed by <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). This issue implicates the fundamental concern of how to prevent use of a subterfuge race-neutral explanation. <em>See Ford v. Norris, 67 </em>F.3d 162, 168 (8th Cir.1995) (holding race-neutral basis for preemptory challenge was pretext where stated reasons for challenge not supported by venireperson\u2019s statements); <em>Bennett v. Collins, </em>852 F.Supp. 570, 578-85 (E.D.Texas 1994) (holding lack of factual basis for preemptory challenge renders avowed reason for challenge a pretext).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-22\">The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process of law to servicemembers and citizens regardless of race. <em>See Bolling v. Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). To exclude a potential court member based on race, gender, or ethnicity would violate these guarantees. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>28 MJ 366, 367-68 n. 3 (CMA 1989); <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 MJ 380, 390 (CMA 1988). There is a package of rights guaranteed by <em>Batson </em>and its progeny: the right to a trial free of racial prejudice; and the right of perspective ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>rors to participate in a criminal justice system. <em>Batson </em>applies to prosecutors, <em>id., </em>and defendants, <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992), regardless of the race, ethnicity, or gender of the defendant, <em>see, e.g., Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">HISTORICAL CONTEXT</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">While peremptory challenges have existed since Roman times, <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 119, 106 S.Ct. at 1735 (Burger, C.J., dissenting), citing J. Pettingal, <em>An Enquiry into the Use and Practice of Juries Among the Greeks and Romans </em>115, 135 (1769), they have only existed in the military since 1920. <em>Compare </em>Article of War (AW) 18, Act of June 4, 1920, Pub.L. No. 66-242, 41 Stat. 787 (\u201c[T]he accused or the trial judge advocate ... shall be entitled to one peremptory challenge____\u201d) <em>with </em>AW 18, Act of August 29, 1916, Pub.L. No. 64-242, 39 Stat. 653 (1916)(\u201cMembers of a general or special court-martial may be challenged by the accused, but only for cause stated to the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Court members may be challenged for cause or peremptorily. RCM 912(f) &amp; (g), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). RCM 912(f) lists bases for challenges for cause. A peremptory challenge is the right to challenge a member without stating a reason. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 91,106 S.Ct. at 1720. While there is no limit on the number of challenges for cause, each party in the military generally has only one peremptory challenge. Art. 41(b), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 841(b) (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The impetus for <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824,13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), was state laws prohibiting African-Americans from sitting as jurors. Hoffman, <em>Peremptory Challenges Should be Abolished: A Trial Judge\u2019s Perspective, </em>64 U. Chi. L.Rev. 809, 828-29 (1997). Some states simply enacted statutes that prohibited their participation on juries. <em>Id. </em>When that practice was invalidated, there were a number of other \u201ccomprehensive patent and latent exclusion mechanisms (not to mention widespread physical intimidation)\u201d used to exclude blacks as perspective jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 207-08, 85 S.Ct. at 829 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">When Swain was tried in Talladega County, no African-American had ever sat on any criminal jury in that county. 380 U.S. at 223, 85 S.Ct. at 837-38. It was against this background that <em>Swain </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">In <em>Swain </em>the Supreme Court held that it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause for prosecutors to exercise systematically peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner. 380 U.S. at 204, 226-27, 85 S.Ct. at 826-27, 839-40. However, that Court held that the defendant had the burden to demonstrate that the prosecutor made \u201csystematic use of peremptory challenges\u201d to exclude African-American jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 85 S.Ct. at 839-40. This burden proved too onerous for the defense and led to the <em>Bat-son </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">In <em>Batson, </em>however, the Court recognized that this practice placed a \u201ccrippling burden of proof\u2019 on defendants and rendered \u201cperemptory challenges ... largely immune from constitutional scrutiny.\u201d 476 U.S. at 92-93, 106 S.Ct. at 1720-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">The concern expressed in <em>Swain </em>and <em>Bat-son </em>for combating racial discrimination which had existed for years and gone unchecked in the civilian systems has not existed in the military. Rather than having six to ten per-emptories per side as in civilian courts, military counsel generally have only one peremptory challenge. Although African-Americans serving in the military have sat as panel members for years, there is no evidence of a pattern of systematic use of peremptory challenges against these members.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Even the largest military post has only a handful of lawyers. Their weaknesses and excesses are subject to daily scrutiny by their superiors, peers, and subordinates. How they interact with one another is subject to periodic review and would be known within the community. This same constant observation ordinarily is not present in the civilian community. Thus, in the military it is difficult to mask a peremptory challenge based on race, <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra, </em>gender, <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama ex re\u00ed. T.B., </em>511 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994); or ethnicity, <em>United States v. Santiago-Davila, </em>26 MJ 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">HARD v. SOFT DATA</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">A peremptory challenge might be based on \u201chard data\u201d or \u201csoft data.\u201d Hard data would include being an accuser, RCM 912(f)(1)(C); a witness, RCM 912(f)(1)(D); or an investigating officer for the offense charged, RCM 912(f)(1)(F). Hard data as a basis for a challenge for cause also includes a member\u2019s possessing a rigid notion of punishment, <em>United States v. Smart, </em>21 MJ 15, 19-20 (CMA 1985)(holding military judge erred when he denied challenge for cause against captain who indicated he would not consider a no-punishment option), or being the principal law enforcement officer for a command, <em>United States v. Swagger, </em>16 MJ 759 (ACMR 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Both the Supreme Court and this Court have relied on soft data. In <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 355-58, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1864-65, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991), the prosecutor challenged peremptorily four potential jurors with Latino surnames. The defense objected. Without waiting for the judge to ask for a reason, \u201cthe prosecutor volunteered\u201d that he was striking two of the jurors, Munoz and Rivera, because each juror had a brother who had been convicted of crimes, and one brother was being prosecuted by the same district attorney\u2019s office. As to the other potential jurors, Mikus and Gonzalez, he challenged them because he believed through their words and actions that their Spanish language fluency might hinder their ability to accept the interpreter\u2019s official translation. He explained that they \u201clooked away\u201d from him and responded \u201cwith some hesitancy\u201d when asked whether they would follow the official version. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 111 S.Ct. at 1865. The defense then moved for a mistrial. Justice Kennedy, writing for a plurality, held that the prosecutor had set forth a race-neutral basis. Justice O\u2019Connor, concurring in the result, emphasized that if \u201cthe trial court believes the prosecutor\u2019s nonracial justification, and that finding is not clearly erroneous, that is the end of the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 111 S.Ct. at 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">in <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995), challenged one of the jurors because of his long uncut, unkempt hair, mustache, and beard. The Supreme Court stated: The prosecutor</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Under our <em>Batson </em>jurisprudence, once the opponent of a peremptory challenge has <em>made out a prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination (step one), the burden of production shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a <em>race-neutral explanation </em>(step two). If a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must then decide (step three) whether the <em>opponent of the strike </em>has <em>proved </em>purposeful racial discrimination. The second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. \u201cAt this [second] step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 767-68,115 S.Ct. at 1770-71 (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The Court in a per curiam opinion (7-2) upheld the peremptory challenge, noting that the prosecutor had satisfied step two by \u201carticulating a nondiscriminatory reason for the strike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769,115 S.Ct. at 1771. Additionally, the trial judge found no discriminatory intent by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Breyer dissented as to misuse of a per curiam decision. He also commented: \u201cToday the Court holds that it did not mean what it said in <em>Batson.\u201d Id. </em>at 771, 115 S.Ct. at 1772. But Justice Stevens noted, \u201cIn some cases, conceivably the length and unkempt character of a juror\u2019s hair and goatee-typed beard might give rise to a concern that he is a nonconformist who might not be a good juror. In this case, however, the prosecutor did not identify any such concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777, 115 S.Ct. at 1775.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>33 MJ 101, 105-06 (1991), this Court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that he challenged the member because the member thought it was an educational experience to sit on the court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>We unanimously held that the judge\u2019s acceptance of this explanation was not error. Also, in <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>30 MJ 201 (1990), this Court held that <em>Batson </em>was marginally satisfied when the prosecutor explained the basis for the challenge was the member\u2019s prior experience, current duty position, and a review of her personnel records. <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The Federal courts have also relied on soft data as justifying reasons for peremptory challenges, to include the following: posture and demeanor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> eye contact,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> body language and facial expressions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> mannerisms and inattentiveness,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gut reaction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appearance and demeanor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and poor attitude.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue should not be whether a peremptory challenge is based on hard data or soft data, but whether the challenge was based on discriminatory intent that results in purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Many military trial attorneys will make a decision based on body language, tone of voice, hair style, and dress. Generally, these attorneys are not motivated to eliminate a person from the jury because of race, ethnicity, or gender. The majority advocates holding peremptory challenges valid only when there is objective evidence of a race-neutral reason. During trial, a judge must often make decisions where there is no objective evidence available. For example, a military judge may decide whether to grant a challenge for cause based on a panel member\u2019s inelastic attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In most instances, the contest will not be over whether there was blinking, certain body language, or a particular tone of voice. Instead, the contest will be over whether there was an underlying reason for the challenge, that is, an improper motive. The judge can assume the court member blinked or that there was particular body language or tone of voice. Even challenges based on objective evidence such as schooling, unit assignment, or awards do not present a question of the objectivity of the evidence, but rather the underlying motive for the peremptory challenge. To avoid a credibility issue among the attorneys, the majority would prohibit an attorney from using intuition as a sufficient reason for exclusion of a member and require resort to hard data.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">I now must ask whether this Court intends to prohibit use of soft data altogether as a basis for a peremptory challenge or whether that prohibition only applies when a prospective court member belongs to a racially cognizable group. Likewise, is it only the Government that is barred from using soft data or does the majority\u2019s ban also apply to the accused and his or her counsel? Will we allow double or multiple standards, or will we follow the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in providing even-handed equal protection of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">What the majority appears to require is a specific verifiable reason that will be within the judge\u2019s actual knowledge. There are many decisions the judge must make at trial that are not based on the actual knowledge the majority is demanding. Furthermore, what may appear as a demeanor concern to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>one side in a criminal trial may not be observed or even a concern at all to the other side. Surely we do not expect military judges to verify an intuition or subjective concern unique to either a prosecutor or defense counsel. The judge is not and cannot be in the shoes of counsel. Rather, it is the responsibility of the judge to determine if there is purposefiil discrimination in employing a peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">DECISION BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The Court of Criminal Appeals perceived a <em>Batson </em>violation based on the challenge by trial counsel against a member of the panel who was of the same race as the accused. The court relied on the three-step analysis required by <em>Batson </em>as well as our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>28 MJ 366 (1989). The first step arises when a peremptory challenge is made (presumably by trial counsel) \u201cto exclude from membership of a court-martial a member of a cognizable racial group who is also of the same race as the accused,\u201d and defense counsel objects. <em>Moore supra </em>establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination at this point. 44 MJ at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The second step occurs when the Government offers \u201ca (facially) race-neutral explanation\u201d for its use of the peremptory challenge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The lower court properly acknowledged the importance of trial counsel\u2019s explanation of her peremptory challenge. The court stated, \u201c[Tjhe clarity and persuasiveness of the trial counsel\u2019s explanation becomes highly significant: ambiguous or implausible justifications \u2018may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination.\u2019 \u201d 44 MJ at 574, quoting <em>Elem, supra </em>at 768,115 S.Ct. at 1771. Further, the lower court scrutinized the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, attempting to understand her motive in exercising the peremptory challenge. The court carefully reviewed what the prosecutor stated she observed of the member\u2019s demeanor (he \u201cblink[ed] a lot\u201d and \u201cseemed uncomfortable\u201d during <em>voir </em>dire) and what that observation indicated about the member\u2019s ability to execute his court-martial duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">I would hold that the court below erred in giving inadequate deference to the military judge. Trial counsel gave a race-neutral explanation and the judge accepted her explanation as credible, relying on her integrity as an attorney and officer of the court. The defense made no further objection and did not request a hearing regarding the challenge. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869 (plurality opinion), \u201c[T]he best evidence [of truthfulness] often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.\u201d On this record, there was no basis to overturn the judge\u2019s determination that trial counsel\u2019s explanation was credible. In reversing the judge, the lower court did not adhere to the proper standard of review, <em>i.e., </em>that the judge\u2019s lading should be given \u201cgreat deference\u201d and should be reversed only if it is \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 364-65, 111 S.Ct. at 1868-69; <em>Curtis, </em>33 MJ at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The lower court properly stated the law as it reaffirmed <em>Batson\u2019s </em>step three: \u201cthe party objecting to the challenge must prove purposeful racial discrimination.\u201d 44 MJ at 574. Moreover, the lower court explicitly referred to the accused\u2019s obligation to \u201ccarry his burden of proof by persuading the judge that the trial counsel\u2019s asserted justification is \u2018merely a pretext for intentional race-based discrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting incorrectly Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 93, 106 S.Ct. at 1721). Yet the effect of the lower court\u2019s decision was to shift the burden to the Government to show no purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">By concluding that the record was incomplete to resolve the issue of purposeful discrimination, the lower court shifted the burden of proof regarding purposeful discrimination. Effectively, that court faulted the Government for the failure of the defense to establish purposefiil discrimination. Accordingly, the second certified question should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">The fundamental error of the lower court was to adopt and retroactively apply a new rule requiring the trial judge to articulate the bases of factual findings related to <em>Batson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>challenges when the record presents a dispute among the parties as to the factual predicate for the peremptory challenge. 44 MJ at 576. This Court has not required these factual findings in the past. The lower court, however, may find solace in the First Circuit\u2019s support of such a rule. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>35 F.3d 632, 636 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In the present case, as in <em>Perez, </em>the absence of these factual findings does not justify the lower court\u2019s reversal of the military judge\u2019s ruling. After the judge allowed SGT [E] to be challenged peremptorily without making express factual findings as to the race-neutral explanation, there was no further defense comment, thought, objection, or other expression of dissatisfaction with the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Additionally, the defense made no request for examination or presentation of evidence. Since defense counsel failed to pursue the matter further during <em>voir dire, </em>a belated post-trial evaluation of the matter makes little sense. <em>See McKeel v. City of Pine Bluff, </em>73 F.3d 207, 210 (8th Cir.l996)(holding that although opponent of a peremptory challenge is not required to offer proof to establish purposeful discrimination, failure to do so \u201cmay impact on whether the party has carried its burden of persuasion to show purposeful discrimination\u201d). Finally, the ruling of the judge was not clearly erroneous. Trial counsel volunteered a race-neutral explanation and the judge properly assessed this explanation as credible. Absent other evidence, the accused has not carried the burden to establish purposeful discrimination. <em>See United States v. Curtis, supra </em>This Court should uphold the military judge and reaffirm that a race-neutral explanation may be based on the prosecutor\u2019s perception of the member\u2019s demean- or. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>40 MJ 726, 733 (NMCMR 1994)(reasoning that \u201ca look or gesture is often the cue for the lawyer\u2019s intuition that the prospective member is not well-disposed towards the lawyer\u2019s side of the ease\u201d). The judge\u2019s ruling is further supported by the fact that the prosecution only challenged one minority member of the panel, while not seeking to challenge for cause the remaining two or more minority court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In examining whether racial discrimination was involved in a peremptory-challenge decision, courts often rely upon \u201cthe number of racial group members in the venire panel\u201d if there is more than one member of the group in the jury pool. Austin, <em>Twenty-Sixth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure </em>\u2014 Part <em>III: Right to Jury Trial, Peremptory Challenges: Equal Protection Issues, </em>85 Geo. L.J. 1240, 1257 n. 1734 (1997). In addition, <em>United States v. Chalan, </em>812 F.2d 1302 (10th Cir.1987), provides that if \u201cthe Government used its peremptory challenges to strike the last remaining juror of defendant\u2019s race\u201d (two were challenged for cause and one could have been challenged for <em>cause </em>\u2014 id. at 1312) it \u201craise[s] an inference\u201d that that \u201cjuror was excluded\u201d because of his race (Native American). <em>Id. </em>at 1314. In addition, <em>United States v. Wills, </em>88 F.3d 704, 714-15 (9th Cir.1996), reasoned that the defendant had not made a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination where the prosecutor challenged two African-Americans in the jury pool but where three others remained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">I would hold that the judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to sustain defense counsel\u2019s <em>Batson </em>objection. Even following our more stringent decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>28 MJ 366,1 am convinced that the prosecutor adequately set forth the basis for her peremptory challenge. The judge concluded that the prosecutor had been forthright in the past and that there was no evidence of a discriminatory intent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. <em>Some </em>examples include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Right to counsel. <em>Compare Nichols v.
