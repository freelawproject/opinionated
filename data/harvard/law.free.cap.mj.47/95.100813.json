The adjudged and approved sentence provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 18 months, and total forfeitures. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Our Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">WHETHER THE DEFENSE COUNSEL, SPECIALLY DETAILED TO ASSIST PVT [PRIVATE] HOOD [TO] PREPARE HIS POST-TRIAL SUBMISSIONS, RENDERED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL BY NEVER CONTACTING PVT HOOD AFTER THE COURT-MARTIAL, BY NEVER INFORMING PVT HOOD THAT HIS CLEMENCY MATTERS WERE DUE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONVENING AUTHORITY, AND BY <em>SUA SPONTE </em>SUBMITTING MATTERS TO THE CONVENING AUTHORITY WHICH UNDERCUT PVT HOOD\u2019S CHANCES OF RECEIVING CLEMENCY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We hold that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he failed to consult with his client concerning a clemency petition, but that appellant was not prejudiced by the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">At the beginning of appellant\u2019s court-martial on March 23, 1995, his detailed defense counsel, Captain (CPT) Hollers, informed the military judge that he would be leaving the Army on May 1, 1995. Major (MAJ) M, the Senior Defense Counsel, was seated at the counsel table and announced to the military judge that he had detailed himself to represent appellant after the trial. The military judge asked appellant, \u201cHave you talked to him? Do you at least know who he is?\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d The military judge then asked appellant, \u201cDo you agree to have him as your post-trial attorney?\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yes, sir, I do.\u201d MAJ M was then excused from participation in the court-martial, left the counsel table, and withdrew to the spectator area.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">At the end of the court-martial, after the sentence was announced, the military judge asked appellant, \u201c[D]o you remember having MAJ [M] in here?\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yes, I do, sir.\u201d The- military judge then asked, \u201cHe\u2019s the one you want \u2014 who has been detailed to assist you in the post-trial process; is that right?\u201d Appellant responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">MAJ M was served with the record of trial and the staff judge advocate\u2019s post-trial recommendation. On behalf of appellant, he submitted a clemency request based on appellant\u2019s problem-filled family background, his mother\u2019s deteriorating health, and her need for appellant\u2019s support and care. In support of the clemency request, MAJ M attached three letters frqm appellant\u2019s mother, letters from several doctors describing appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s poor health, and a three-page \u201crough draft\u201d of appellant\u2019s unsworn statement that appellant had presented at the court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">The first of the three letters from appellant\u2019s mother, dated April 4, 1995, begins by thanking CPT Hollers, the two noncommis-sioned officers who escorted appellant to the trial, and two other noncommissioned officers \u201cfor their professionalism, courtesy and respect shown [her] during those proceedings.\u201d She then complained of the \u201crudeness and lack of respect\u201d shown by two captains, a first sergeant, a sergeant, and a \u201cchief.\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother complained that they snickered, laughed, and made snide remarks in her presence during the trial and photographed her son while he was handcuffed. She asked that they be reprimanded and required to apologize. She concluded her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>letter by writing, \u201cI was also upset so much more by their misconduct, than the actual proceedings, that I forgot to thank the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In her letter of April 13, 1995, appellant\u2019s mother referred to the \u201chorror\u201d in appellant\u2019s personal life and \u201chow confused he was about everything mentally shoved down inside all his life.\u201d She also informed the convening authority that she was \u201ctotally and permanently disabled\u201d and had incurred $50,000 in medical bills that were not covered by insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In her letter of April 16, 1995, appellant\u2019s mother transmitted the \u201crough draft\u201d of appellant\u2019s unsworn statement at trial. She described appellant as \u201ca responsible, caring, contributing young man capable of many things.\u201d She said that \u201c[w]ith proper therapy, [appellant] can learn to dig all those things out and deal with them ... and heal.\u201d She concluded by saying that appellant \u201cis worthy of consideration for mercy. And I so desperately need him home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In two affidavits submitted to the court below, appellant asserts that MAJ M did not discuss the clemency package with him before submitting it. Appellant also asserts that he did not want the April 4, 1995, letter from his mother submitted to the convening authority because it \u201cwas extremely negative in nature,\u201d because she \u201cexpressed her belief that [his] court proceeding was unfair, and that the trial counsel and other government representatives were rude and unprofessional.\u201d Regarding the \u201crough draft\u201d of the unsworn statement, appellant does not complain about its content, but only its appearance. He asserts that it was unsigned, improperly formatted, contained bad grammar, and \u201clooks like it was written by a fourth grader.\u201d Appellant also asserts that he had clemency matters he would have submitted, but that he was denied an opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Unlike the defense counsel in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>45 MJ 149 (1996), MAJ M established an attorney-client relationship with appellant, as required by RCM 1106(f)(2), Manual for Courts-martial, United States (1995 ed.). MAJ M\u2019s appearance in court, the military judge\u2019s questioning of appellant, and appellant\u2019s affirmative agreement to accept MAJ M as substitute counsel were sufficient to comply with RCM 1106(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Because appellant\u2019s two post-trial affidavits are unrebutted, we accept as true appellant\u2019s assertion that MAJ M did not discuss the contents of the clemency package with him. We hold that MAJ M\u2019s failure to consult with appellant and submission of clemency materials to which appellant objected was deficient performance within the meaning of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">Defense counsel has primary responsibility for strategic and tactical decisions, \u201cafter consultation with the client where feasible and appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. MacCulloch, </em>40 MJ 236, 239 (CMA 1994), quoting Standard 4-5.2(b), <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, The Defense Function </em>(3d ed.1993). When preparing a post-trial clemency package, defense counsel is \u201crequired to make an evaluative judgment on what items ... [are] to be submitted to the convening authority.\u201d <em>United States v. MacCulloch, supra </em>If defense counsel thinks that certain matters should not be submitted, he should so advise his client. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel may not, however, refuse to submit matters offered by the client or submit matters over the client\u2019s objection. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>47 MJ 90, 93 (\u201cJust as the accused controls the right to testify at trial, ... the accused also has the right to submit or not submit material to the convening authority over defense counsel\u2019s objection.\u201d); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>42 MJ 1, 4 (1995) (\u201cCounsel\u2019s duty is to advise, but the final decision as to what, if anything, to submit rests with the accused.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must show that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his case. To satisfy this burden, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694,104 S.Ct. at 2067.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>We hold that appellant has not carried his burden of showing prejudice. Although appellant characterizes his mother\u2019s April 4 letter as \u201cextremely negative,\u201d it was a mix of positive and negative comments. Appellant\u2019s mother expressed regret at neglecting to thank the judge. She praised appellant\u2019s defense counsel and appellant\u2019s guards. While she complained of rude and inappropriate behavior by some military members, we conclude that her complaints could not have prejudiced appellant when considered in the context of her entire letter. We hold that appellant has not shown a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of more favorable action by the convening authority if the letter had not been submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">With respect to the \u201crough draft\u201d of appellant\u2019s statement, we agree with appellant that the appearance of the document could have been improved. Appellant has not shown, however, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the convening authority would have granted clemency but for the quality of appellant\u2019s typing and grammar..</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">With respect to appellant\u2019s assertion that he had additional clemency materials to submit, we hold that he has not met his burden of showing prejudice because he has not identified any matters that he would have submitted. <em>See United States v. Moseley, </em>35 MJ 481, 486 (GMA 1992) (Gierke, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (appellant must proffer what he would have submitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Chief Judge COX and Judges CRAWFORD and EFFRON concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b134-8\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AOF\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The majority is hard-pressed to distinguish this case from <em>United States v. MacCulloch, </em>40 MJ 236 (CMA 1994). I dissented in that case, and my affirmance in appellant\u2019s case is consistent with that vote. <em>Id. </em>at 240-41 (Sullivan, J., dissenting). I am not sure that the majority can say the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
