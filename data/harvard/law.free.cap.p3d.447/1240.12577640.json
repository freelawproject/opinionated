Gary Wilson (Plaintiff) sued his sister Elisabeth W. Sanders (Sister) and her husband Hiram Sanders (collectively, Defendants), seeking an order invalidating Mother's most recent testamentary instrument on the grounds that Defendants had subjected her to undue influence, and alleging that Defendants had intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him. The case was eventually tried to a jury, which was persuaded by Plaintiff's arguments and not only found that Defendants had unduly influenced Mother, but also awarded Plaintiff $170,000 on his emotional distress claim, most of which was for punitive damages. Defendants now appeal, and raise various arguments assailing the jury's verdict. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In December 2000, Plaintiff permanently relocated from Colorado to Utah to help care for his aging parents, and moved into their house. Plaintiff paid monthly rent and lived in the basement, while his parents lived upstairs. Plaintiff was employed as a school\n   bus driver, which allowed him to spend time at home caring for his parents and maintaining the house. Plaintiff testified that, during this time, Defendants-who lived in Utah-came to the house to visit only once or twice a year, usually on major holidays. In 2006, Mother created a revocable trust (First Trust) that listed both Plaintiff and Sister as beneficiaries, each slated to receive an equal distribution of trust assets. In 2008, Plaintiff and Sister's father passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In February 2015, at the age of eighty-five, Mother fell in a parking lot and hit her head, requiring emergency cranial surgery. Following the surgery, Mother had difficulty speaking and forming sentences, and even had a hard time recognizing her children. According to Plaintiff, she seemed \"eager to please\" and \"very susceptible to suggestion and manipulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In April 2015, at Defendants' suggestion, Mother revoked the First Trust and created a second trust (Second Trust), changing the identity of the trustee to an attorney selected by Sister, but not changing the identity of the beneficiaries. One month later, Mother amended the Second Trust to alter the percentage of assets her children would receive, changing the arrangement from fifty-fifty to sixty-forty in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In July 2015, without informing Plaintiff, Defendants took Mother out of her home and placed her in a hotel room, where she resided for six weeks. During this time, Defendants did not allow Mother to make or receive phone calls and Plaintiff was unable to contact her. While still living in the hotel and out of contact with Plaintiff, Mother met with the attorney/trustee and again revised her trust (Third Trust), this time removing Plaintiff as a beneficiary entirely and leaving everything to Sister and Sister's children. At the time, Plaintiff was unaware that Mother had disinherited him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Defendants finally allowed Mother to return to her home on the condition that Plaintiff vacate the basement apartment. Plaintiff complied, and Defendants moved into the basement apartment, a series of events that caused the relationship between Plaintiff and Defendants to become even more tense. After they moved into Mother's house, Defendants continued to deny Plaintiff visits with Mother, and on multiple occasions they called the police when Plaintiff tried to visit Mother in her home. However, on each such occasion Plaintiff was allowed to see Mother after the officers spoke to her and confirmed that, as far as she was concerned, Plaintiff was welcome in her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Also during this time, Plaintiff claimed that his emotional and mental health went into decline. According to Plaintiff, not being able to contact Mother caused him \"significant emotional distress\" and \"affected his work performance in such a way that his job was in jeopardy.\" Indeed, Plaintiff's supervisor testified that, on one occasion, Plaintiff appeared so distraught at work that she feared he could not perform his job safely, so she sent him home for the day. In addition, his coworker and neighbor testified that his lighthearted personality disappeared and that he began to vocalize suicidal thoughts. Plaintiff testified that he ended up in the hospital on two occasions, and underwent \"numerous therapy sessions\" in an effort to restore his mental health. On one occasion, Plaintiff drew a bullet on a calendar, indicating the date on which he planned to commit suicide. Plaintiff's neighbor was so concerned about Plaintiff that he called both the police and Defendants to inform them about Plaintiff's suicidal comments. When the neighbor told Defendants about the calendar, Sister remarked, \"Wouldn't that make things easier?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In January 2016, Mother slipped into a coma, but Defendants did not promptly notify Plaintiff about Mother's declining condition; Plaintiff did not learn about her condition until three days later. Shortly thereafter, Mother passed away. Plaintiff first heard the news from Sister when he called to check on Mother. Although Plaintiff was at work only a few minutes away at the time of Mother's passing, Defendants did not inform him when Mother had \"only hours to live.\" Plaintiff testified that not being with Mother at the time of her death was traumatic-something \"[t]hat's going to mess with [him] the rest of [his] life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 After Mother's passing, Plaintiff discovered that he had been completely disinherited under the Third Trust. Plaintiff then filed suit seeking to invalidate the Third Trust on the basis of undue influence. He also brought a claim against Defendants for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). Following a three-day trial, Defendants' counsel moved for a directed verdict as to Plaintiff's undue influence claim. The trial court denied the motion and the case was sent to the jury, which found in favor of Plaintiff and invalidated the Third Trust on the basis of undue influence. The jury also found in favor of Plaintiff on his IIED claim, awarding him both non-economic and punitive damages. The jury found Defendants each separately liable to Plaintiff for $10,000 in compensatory non-economic damages, and in addition awarded Plaintiff $150,000-for which Defendants were jointly and severally liable-in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Following the trial, Defendants timely filed a motion, grounded in rule 60 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, to vacate the judgment. On March 29, 2018, the court entered final judgment on the verdict, and a few days later, on April 8, 2018, the trial court issued a written minute entry denying the rule 60 motion. Then, on April 24, 2018, Defendants filed a notice of appeal (Notice), which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Appeal is taken from the Final Judgment entered March 29th, 2018, and against orders or rulings upon motions such that if the Final Judgment be reversed ... that necessarily shall be of same effect on any such irrevocably linked byproduct of the Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants now appeal from the trial court's entry of judgment on the jury verdict and from its post-judgment denial of their rule 60 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Defendants raise five issues for our review. The first two issues consist of challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. First, Defendants contend that \"the jury's award of damages for [IIED should] be vacated\" because it was not supported by sufficient evidence. Second, Defendants contend that \"the jury's award of punitive damages [should] be vacated because it was not based on sufficient evidence,\" and it \"exceeds established limits for punitive damages awards.\" When considering an insufficiency of the evidence claim on appeal, \"we do not weigh the evidence de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Water &amp; Energy Sys.

We review a trial court's decision on a motion for a directed verdict for correctness, and a trial court may enter a directed verdict \"only if, after looking at the evidence and all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\" it \"concludes that there is no competent evidence which would support a verdict in the nonmoving party's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    USA Power, LLC v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 When challenging the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a jury's verdict, the party making the claim must demonstrate \"that the [verdict] lack[s] substantial evidentiary support.\"\n   <em>\n    Water &amp; Energy System Tech., Inc. v.

During this period, they refused to allow Mother to use her phone and they brought about Plaintiff's eviction from the home he had been sharing with Mother for the past fifteen years. After Mother returned home, Defendants sometimes called the police on Plaintiff when he tried to visit Mother. But the police reports contain evidence that the calls were frivolous and that Plaintiff was not actually a threat to Mother.

Denial of Directed Verdict\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 Defendants next contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a directed verdict on Plaintiff's undue influence claim. This claim fails for the same reasons articulated above; namely, Defendants have failed to meet their burden of persuasion. Our \"standard of review of a directed verdict is the same as that imposed upon a trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Gables at Sterling Village Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v.

In fact, as discussed above, there was evidence that Mother amended her trust after sustaining a head injury, which left her disoriented, and during the time when Defendants had sequestered Mother in a hotel where she was cut off from all contact with the outside world. While a jury could reasonably have reached the opposite conclusion, and found in favor of Defendants on this point, the jury's decision to believe Plaintiff's version of events over Defendants' was not unreasonable and was supported by competent evidence. The trial court therefore did not err in denying Defendants' motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III. Denial of Rule 60 Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Defendants also challenge the trial court's denial of their rule 60 motion. But this challenge falls outside the scope of our jurisdiction because Defendants did not identify this issue in their Notice. Rule 3(d) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that a notice of appeal \"designate the judgment or order, or part thereof, appealed from.\" Utah R. App. P. 3(d). Defendants' Notice, which was filed on April 24, 2018, states that the \"Appeal is taken from the Final Judgment entered March 29th, 2018, and against orders or rulings upon motions\" that are bound up with the final judgment. But the Notice does not identify the trial court's later order denying their rule 60 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 Our appellate jurisdiction is limited to considering only the orders and judgments specified in the notice of appeal. If the notice fails to identify the specific order sought to be appealed, we cannot assume jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

Because Defendants referenced the entire final judgment in their Notice rather than merely discrete parts of it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20UT%2018\">\n    2019 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 25-27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576694\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/1217/\">\n    443 P.3d 1217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we have jurisdiction to consider a challenge to the final judgment itself as well as any earlier intermediate orders bound up or subsumed in the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b629 Accordingly, the question we must address is whether the trial court's order denying Defendants' rule 60 motion was subsumed in the final judgment. Defendants' Notice states that their \"[a]ppeal is taken from the Final Judgment entered March 29th, 2018.\" But the trial court did not deny the rule 60 motion until April 8, 2018, more than a week after the entry of the final judgment. Because they are issued\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   final judgment, post-judgment orders are ordinarily not subsumed in the final judgment, and generally parties must either file a separate notice of appeal regarding those orders or, if they are entered before the filing of the notice of appeal, at least specifically mention them in the notice of appeal being taken from the final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dennett v.

Here, entry of the trial court's order denying Defendants' rule 60 motion occurred post-judgment, and Defendants offer no argument for how such an order could possibly have been subsumed within the earlier entered final judgment, or been part of the progression that led to it. Accordingly, because Defendants did not specifically state, in their Notice, that they intended to appeal from that order, we lack jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the order denying the rule 60 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IV. Impermissible and Prejudicial Trial Testimony\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b630 Next, Defendants contend that the trial court erred in \"permitting inadmissible and prejudicial testimony throughout the trial.\" But Defendants failed to object at trial to any testimony as being \"prejudicial,\" and therefore did not present the issue to the trial court \"in such a way that the court ha[d] an opportunity to rule on it.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
