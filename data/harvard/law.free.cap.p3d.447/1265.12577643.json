(Salmon) in which the court concluded that no reasonable jury could find the existence of a valid contractual relationship between Bergdorf and Salmon. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Bergdorf is a healthcare professional who, in 2012, purchased a building for use as a medical clinic. Although the building was move-in ready, Bergdorf wanted to remodel some areas of the building to better suit her needs (Project). Bergdorf reached out to Randy Krantz and asked if he was able to help her with both the financing and the construction work associated with the Project. Krantz had been involved in many construction projects as a general contractor, and he expressed a willingness to become involved with the Project, even taking Bergdorf to look at two other medical clinics he had constructed in the past. Bergdorf eventually became \"comfortable\" with Krantz \"doing the construction\" on the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Bergdorf's initial plan was to finance the Project through a loan (Loan) with U.S. Bank (Bank). To secure the Loan, the Bank required Bergdorf and Krantz to submit, among other things, a building permit (Permit)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   and a contract outlining the work to be performed. But there was a problem: Krantz's contractor license was expired and he was therefore unable to obtain the Permit. So, Krantz arranged for Salmon-whom Krantz had worked with in the past, and who had a valid license-to be the general contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Krantz thereafter acted as an intermediary between Bergdorf and Salmon, and he even visited the Project with Bergdorf and Salmon, but not with the two together, to discuss the budget and scope of the Project. Krantz testified that he \"made a list of things that were going to be done in the contract ... that identified the costs for each of the items that [Bergdorf] wanted done and the amount of ... overhead that [Salmon] needed in the contract to do the job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Krantz then prepared a proposed contract detailing Bergdorf's wishes for the property and the budget for each area of the remodel (Proposed Contract). The Proposed Contract recited that Bergdorf was the owner and that Salmon was the general contractor. Importantly, the parties never signed the Proposed Contract. Indeed, Bergdorf indicated at her deposition that she had never actually seen the Proposed Contract:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Attorney]: Let me show you ... the proposed contract that was prepared by Randy Krantz. I think he indicated he prepared it and he submitted it to you and [Salmon], and I'm wondering whether or not you remember ever seeing this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Bergdorf]: I've never seen this. I don't need to look. I have never seen it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Attorney]: You have not seen it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Bergdorf]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Krantz also set about obtaining and gathering the other documents necessary to secure the Loan. Krantz asked Salmon to prepare certain documents, including a builder's statement, a W-9 form, and a credit authorization, that Salmon had filled out and signed in July 2012. Later that month, Krantz submitted the documents and unsigned Proposed Contract to the Bank as part of the Loan application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In September 2012, while the Loan application was pending, Salmon obtained the Permit from Bountiful City for the Project. The Permit listed Bergdorf as the owner and Salmon as the general contractor. When the Permit was issued, Salmon's secretary emailed Krantz a copy of the Permit. Bergdorf never saw the Permit or the Permit application, and understood that it had been procured under Salmon's name only because Krantz told her so. The Permit expressly stated, \"This [P]ermit becomes null and void if work or construction authorized is not commenced within 180 days, or if construction or work is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days at any time after work is commenced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Sometime in the fall of 2012, while the Loan application was still pending, Krantz hired a subcontractor to perform demolition work for the Project. The subcontractor removed some carpet from the building and demolished an interior wall. Importantly, Krantz did not inform Salmon or Bergdorf that he had arranged for this work to be completed. And when Krantz was asked at his deposition about Salmon's involvement with the demolition, he indicated that Salmon had none:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Attorney]: Okay. Because that contract was not signed, you undertook to hire [a subcontractor] to perform that work ... ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Krantz]: Right. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Attorney]: Okay. So Salmon, to your knowledge, had no involvement with hiring [the subcontractor]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Krantz]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Attorney]: Is that correct, [Salmon] didn't have any involvement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Krantz]: None.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Krantz also stated that Salmon's Permit was not used for this demolition work or any work that was done on the Project, at any time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Attorney]: Did [Salmon] hire any general contractors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Krantz]: I-I don't think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Attorney]: Any subcontractors?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Krantz]: There was never-the [P]ermit was never used. There was never any work done on this [Permit]. There was a contract-a building contract was drawn up\n   that was-[Bergdorf] had a copy, the [B]ank had a copy that has never been signed. So if the-there was never anything done because the [P]ermit-or the [Loan] had never been closed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Upon learning that the wall had been demolished, Bergdorf was unhappy with Krantz. Though she had spoken with Krantz about the possibility of removing the wall, she did not consider the plan finalized. After this episode, Bergdorf told Krantz to stop construction because funds were not yet available from the Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b69 After the demolition was performed in the fall of 2012, no additional work was completed on the Project for the next two years. Bergdorf testified that although the Loan was eventually approved, she \"was very busy\" and decided to \"[give] up\" on closing the Loan and starting work on the Project. Because construction did not commence on the Project, Salmon's Permit self-terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b610 In September 2013, about one year after the unauthorized demolition, Bergdorf contacted Bountiful City and, without Salmon's knowledge or consent, somehow \"renewed\" the Permit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither Bergdorf nor Bountiful City contacted or otherwise notified Salmon about the renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b611 With a renewed Permit in hand, Bergdorf independently obtained bids from several contractors, and because Krantz submitted the low bid, Bergdorf entered into a new contract with him to act as the general contractor. Salmon was not invited to bid, nor did Krantz or Bergdorf contact Salmon about serving as the general contractor. Indeed, Bergdorf testified that when the Project resumed in 2014, she had no general contractor in place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Attorney]: [L]et me ask you this: Who did you view as the general contractor for that work in 2014?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Bergdorf]: I didn't have anyone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, Bergdorf plainly stated that she never had any kind of contractual relationship with Salmon, at any time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Attorney]: And you, yourself, never entered into any contractual relationship with Salmon to do either any subcontract work or general contracting work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Bergdorf]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Attorney]: Is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Bergdorf]: Yes. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Later in her deposition, Bergdorf was asked to explain why Krantz was not listed on the Permit when it was renewed. Bergdorf testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Bergdorf]: In the beginning as we restarted or rekindled that working relationship, I said don't you want to change [the Permit] with the City, because it was due for renewal. I said don't you want to change it under your name. [Krantz] said, no, it doesn't matter. We'll continue under [Salmon].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Attorney]: In terms of who the [P]ermit would be under?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Bergdorf]: Yes. As a general contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Attorney]: But all of your contractual relationships were directly with [Krantz]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Bergdorf]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Attorney]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Bergdorf]: I don't know contract. All my relationships were with [Krantz].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b612 Bergdorf and Krantz entered into a contract under the newly submitted Krantz bid-which Krantz did not purport to be on behalf of Salmon-and resumed work on the Project in 2014. At this time, Bergdorf viewed Krantz, and only Krantz, as the general contractor. Accordingly, Krantz hired subcontractors, obtained materials, and performed labor. In turn, Bergdorf issued payments to Krantz and his company, Eastwind. Bergdorf testified that she believed use of Salmon's Permit was proper, despite the fact that she issued payments only to Krantz, because Krantz told her, \"[Salmon] is [my] friend and partner and [I] work[ ] with [Salmon, so] it doesn't really matter.\" In January 2015, Bergdorf's lawyer wrote Krantz to terminate him from the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b613 Later, an allegedly unpaid subcontractor sued Bergdorf and sought to foreclose a mechanic's lien on the Project. In response, Bergdorf filed a third-party complaint against Krantz seeking damages for the $130,000 she had paid Krantz and for physical damage to the building that left the building unsafe and unusable. Only later did Bergdorf recall that Salmon was identified as the general contractor on the Permit obtained in 2012 in connection with the abandoned Loan. Based upon Salmon's name being on the Permit, Bergdorf sued Salmon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b614 Salmon filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it had never consummated a contractual relationship with Bergdorf, that Bergdorf's only true contractual relationship was with Krantz, and that Krantz was not Salmon's agent. Salmon also pointed to Bergdorf's deposition testimony that \"all of [Bergdorf's] contractual relationships were directly with [Krantz]\" and \"[a]ll [Bergdorf's] relationships were with [Krantz].\" After briefing and oral argument, the district court granted Salmon's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b615 Bergdorf appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b616 Bergdorf argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment, because there is sufficient evidence that a contractual relationship between her and Salmon exists and therefore Salmon is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review a \"grant of summary judgment for correctness, granting no deference to the district court's legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Mission v.

Whether Salmon manifested its consent for Krantz to enter into a contract with Bergdorf on Salmon's behalf\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b622 The first\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor is whether \"the principal has manifested his or her consent to the exercise of such authority or has knowingly permitted the agent to assume the exercise of such authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    2015 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    345 P.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). To be clear, the law focuses not on just any manifestation, but only on manifestations of the principal (i.e., Salmon) to the third party (i.e., Bergdorf). See id. \u00b6 22. There is simply no evidence in the record that Salmon manifested its consent to Krantz to contract with Bergdorf on Salmon's behalf. Bergdorf points to three facts she claims meets this factor: (1) Salmon's secretary signed and paid for the Permit for the Project, (2) Salmon filled out and allowed to be submitted a number of documents connected with the Loan application,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) Krantz had been telling Bergdorf all along that he was acting through Salmon. These facts do not constitute manifestations of consent to Krantz's exercise of authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, representations by Krantz are not manifestations of the principal-Salmon. Second, Bergdorf's two remaining alleged manifestations of consent go only to whether Salmon agreed to act as a general contractor in connection with the Loan that never closed. These were not manifestations endowing Krantz with apparent authority to bind Salmon to a contract. Thus, manifestations of \"such authority\"-in this case, the authority to enter into a contract-are simply missing as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B. Whether Bergdorf knew of the manifestations, had reason to believe, and did actually believe, that Krantz had authority to bind Salmon\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b623 The second\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor is whether the \"third person knew of the facts\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ,\n   acting in good faith, had reason to believe,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   did actually believe, that the agent possessed such authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    2015 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    345 P.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (cleaned up). As stated above, all three\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factors must be shown to establish apparent authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, all three discrete components of the second\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor must be shown.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, to satisfy the second\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor, Bergdorf must have (1) known of the \"facts\" (manifestations of authority), (2) had reason to believe, and (3) actually believed that Krantz had authority to bind Salmon contractually.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But because Bergdorf did not know of the facts now claimed in support of a finding of apparent authority, none of these assumed facts can establish a reasonable belief of apparent authority under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b624 Specifically, there is no evidence in the record that Bergdorf had any knowledge-at the relevant time-of Salmon applying for or paying for the Permit. The record actually establishes that Bergdorf first learned of Salmon's obtaining the Permit when the construction recommenced in 2014. Likewise, there is no evidence that Bergdorf was aware of any of the documents that Salmon allegedly filled out in connection with the Loan application. Whether others may have known of these facts is immaterial. To rely on a theory of apparent authority to bind Salmon, it is Bergdorf who must have known of these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b625 Perhaps even more importantly, there is no evidence in the record that Bergdorf actually believed that Krantz was acting as Salmon's agent for the purpose of entering into a contract. Indeed, when deposed, Bergdorf testified that all of her contractual relationships were directly with Krantz. Granted, Bergdorf's testimony was inconsistent as to whom she thought was acting as the general contractor. But Bergdorf did not claim that she thought she had a contract with Salmon. Nor does Bergdorf's testimony establish that she believed Krantz was Salmon's agent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At most, a jury could reasonably infer only that Bergdorf believed Salmon had agreed to serve as the general contractor for the Project if the Loan closed-but it never did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b626 At oral argument on appeal, Bergdorf relied heavily on an email sent by the Bank confirming that Salmon was approved as the general contractor. This email confirmed only the understanding that Salmon agreed to act as the general contractor if the Loan was approved. But it does not support a finding that Bergdorf reasonably believed that Krantz had the authority to agree to the terms of a contract with Bergdorf on Salmon's behalf. Similarly, Salmon's silence at that time signifies little as to the apparent authority of Krantz to contract on Salmon's behalf. Since no contract had been entered into, and no funding had yet been obtained, Salmon had no reason to object to the Bank's email. It was true that should the Bank actually close the Loan, and should the parties agree on the terms of a contract, Salmon was agreeable to serving as the general contractor. But this email, which was not even copied to Krantz, did not manifest Salmon's intent that Krantz act as Salmon's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   C.

In this case, the record reflects no change of position or injury suffered by Bergdorf flowing from any reliance on Krantz's apparent authority. Initially, this third factor must still be connected to the manifestations, or \"the facts,\" identified in the first two factors. In this case, the record establishes that at no relevant time did Bergdorf even know of \"the facts\"-that the Loan documents signed by Salmon had been submitted to the Bank or that Salmon had submitted an application and paid for the Permit. In short, Bergdorf cannot rely on knowledge she did not have.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luddington v. Bodenvest Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10354271\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/855/204/#p209\">\n    855 P.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210-11 (Utah 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b628 Further, Bergdorf cannot show a change of position or injury stemming from reliance on Krantz's alleged apparent authority in connection with the 2012 demolition work because Bergdorf did not authorize that work. The record exhibits that Krantz undertook-and paid for-the demolition without informing Salmon or Bergdorf. Indeed, \"upon learning that the interior wall had been demolished, Bergdorf was unhappy, stating that she had only wanted the carpet to be removed at the time. Though she had spoken with Krantz about the possibility of removing the wall, she did not consider the plan finalized.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   One can hardly claim that Bergdorf acted in reliance on Salmon's alleged manifestation of Krantz's authority when she only found out about this activity after the fact, claimed to have not wanted it to happen, and did not consider the plans finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b629 The only thing Bergdorf apparently did-based upon Salmon's agreement to serve as the general contractor-was apply for the Loan, which never closed. Because the Loan never closed, no work was done pursuant to that financing. Further, Salmon did not engage any subcontractors to do anything. The fact that Krantz, unbeknownst to both Bergdorf and Salmon, hired a subcontractor to perform demolition work that was not approved by Bergdorf or Salmon, cannot be considered reliance by Bergdorf on Salmon's manifestations. In other words, the record does not support the assertion that Bergdorf initiated any work based upon the belief that she had a contract with Salmon to be her general contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b630 When work recommenced in 2014, Bergdorf testified that she viewed Krantz, not Salmon, as her general contractor-and Bergdorf viewed Krantz as such for the remainder of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, neither the work in 2012 (the demolition that Bergdorf was unaware of) nor the work in 2014 (where Bergdorf believed Krantz was the general contractor) meets the requirement of reliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b631 Under these facts, reasonable minds could not differ in concluding that apparent authority did not exist.\n   <em>\n    Penunuri v.

Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b632 Because Bergdorf cannot show that Salmon cloaked Krantz with apparent authority, it follows that a jury could not find that Krantz entered into a contractual relationship with Bergdorf on Salmon's behalf. If anything, the only agreement between Salmon and Bergdorf (via Krantz) was for Salmon to act as a general contractor for the Project funded by a Loan from the Bank. Since the Loan never closed, no contractual obligations attached to Salmon. Indeed, it would likely come as a shock to many contractors that a preliminary agreement to act as a general contractor contractually obligates them to be answerable in damages for any work done on that project when they never agreed to terms, did not oversee the work, and were not paid for doing the job. Thus, we agree with the district court's conclusion that there was never mutual assent sufficient to form a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b633 On summary judgment, Bergdorf is entitled to have factual inferences construed in her favor.\n   <em>\n    Heslop v.

Rather, Bergdorf is only entitled to reasonable inferences.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]o be reasonable, the inference must present something more than pure speculation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b634 Bergdorf concedes that there was neither a signed offer nor an acceptance as between Bergdorf and Salmon. Nevertheless, Bergdorf urges us to hold that issues of fact exist whereupon a jury could conclude that the parties mutually assented through conduct. Again, Bergdorf focuses on the representations of Krantz and thus is dependent on apparent authority and the specific representation of Krantz that Salmon was his friend and partner. In our view, this contorts the evidence beyond any reasonable inference. As previously pointed out, the conversation about Salmon being Krantz's \"partner\" took place in 2014, after the Permit had expired and after Bergdorf had abandoned the Loan. At best, Krantz was representing-without Salmon's knowledge-that he could use his \"partner's\" contractor's license to renew the Permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b635 Bergdorf places great significance on the fact that Salmon agreed to act as a general contractor if and when Bergdorf's Project moved forward with Bank financing. But that Loan never closed. The record in this case demonstrates that Bergdorf did not think she had a contract with Salmon. At most, there was an agreement to act as a general contractor on a remodeling project that was not defined or funded. A preliminary agreement to act as a general contractor on an undefined project, contingent on financing, neither establishes a basis for finding that a contract exists or otherwise concluding that an implied contract resulted. Similarly, while Bergdorf argues that Salmon's silence in response to a single email from the Bank-approving Salmon as a general contractor-ratified something, we are hard pressed to see how that silence ratified anything other than the same agreement to serve as a general contractor\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the Project proceeded and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the Project was funded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b636 Further, as highlighted by the district court, it is undisputed that the Permit obtained by Salmon self-terminated when work was not commenced within, or ceased for a period of, 180 days. The demolition work was not completed by Salmon or at the direction of Salmon. And except for the demolition, no work was done for more than 180 days after the Permit was issued. Therefore, the Permit expired. Although the Permit was renewed, it is undisputed that it was renewed without the consent or knowledge of Salmon. And similarly, in 2014, when work was performed under the Permit, Salmon was not notified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b637 In any event, an implied contract based on mutual assent does not obtain under these facts. Bergdorf looks to\n   <em>\n    Ellsworth v. American Arbitration Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8443502\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/983/\">\n    2006 UT 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8443502\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/148/983/\">\n    148 P.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that mutual assent can be evidenced by things other than a signed contract. This is a correct but incomplete statement of the law. First, the ultimate holding in\n   <em>\n    Ellsworth\n   </em>\n   was that a person's name appearing on an unsigned\n   contract as a party-as is the case here-is not direct evidence of assent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. This is especially true here, where there is no evidence that Salmon (or Bergdorf) participated in any way in negotiating or drafting Krantz's Proposed Contract. Second, when mutual assent is based on conduct or performance, the law requires that words or actions of a party must be reasonably \" 'interpretable as indicating an intention to make a bargain with\n   <em>\n    certain terms or terms which reasonably may be made certain\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    Heideman v.

In\n   <em>\n    Heideman\n   </em>\n   , this court affirmed a grant of summary judgment and concluded that no mutual assent could be shown as a matter of law even though one of the parties had accepted payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Heideman\n   </em>\n   , a developer, argued that because Washington City accepted payment for sixty-six water impact fees at a lower rate, even though the rate had been raised effective the day the plaintiff paid, a contract had been formed and the higher rate could no longer be sought.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 9. This court determined that a contract could not be found because there was \"no communication that would indicate any type of meeting of the minds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. In short, the acceptance of payment without other terms was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b638 The same can be said here. There was simply no communication between Bergdorf and Salmon that exhibits a meeting of the minds on any certain terms. Indeed, it is undisputed that Bergdorf never saw, much less signed, the Proposed Contract. Bergdorf never met Salmon. Bergdorf and Salmon never agreed on a definite price. And Bergdorf testified that there was not a definite plan when Krantz ordered the demolition work to be completed in 2012. Likewise, there is no evidence Salmon agreed to perform any certain scope of the work for the Project. Therefore, we conclude that Salmon's agreement to be listed as a general contractor and apply for the Permit in 2012, without more, did not indicate assent to a contract with certain terms sufficient to be binding.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\" 'The application for an issuance of a building permit does not constitute a voluntary agreement between the parties to enter into binding contract.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Trevino &amp; Gonzalez Co. v.

Ct. App. 1997) )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b639 Bergdorf, as in her agency analysis, grounds her position on the activities of Salmon in supplying documents for the Loan. Again, the most that Salmon thereby assented to was to act as the general contractor if and when the Loan closed. It is an undisputed fact in this case that the Loan never closed. It is also undisputed that Bergdorf abandoned the Loan. The record is devoid of any evidence that Salmon agreed to do any work for any price to be paid directly by Bergdorf. Therefore, an implied contract simply does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b640 Bergdorf also places weight on payments made during the Project. However, these payments were not made to Salmon; instead they were made to Krantz or entities owned by Krantz. Indeed, at any time that Bergdorf made payments related to the Project, she unequivocally testified that she thought Krantz, not Salmon, was her general contractor. These payments are therefore only possibly evidence of performance if Krantz is considered the agent of Salmon. Because we conclude that apparent authority cannot be found here, these payments are evidence that Bergdorf's contract, if it existed, was with Krantz and not Salmon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b641 Bergdorf also places significance upon the fact that, until December 2014, Salmon did not take any steps to remove its name from the Permit. But since the Permit had expired by its own terms and the Loan had never closed, there was no reason for Salmon to anticipate that Krantz would-without Salmon's knowledge-renew its expired Permit. Bergdorf and Krantz's unauthorized renewal of the Permit cannot constitute assent by Salmon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b642 For these reasons, we conclude that no contract between Bergdorf and Salmon was\n   formed as a matter of law and that the district court therefore properly granted summary judgment in favor of Salmon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b643 Bergdorf's position rests primarily on her reliance on Krantz's apparent authority to contract with Bergdorf on Salmon's behalf-with which we do not agree.

First, the dissent argues that Salmon conferred authority on Krantz because Salmon had worked with Krantz on over one hundred construction projects and they were business partners on another. These facts do not demonstrate a manifestation of Salmon's consent to Krantz entering into a contract on its behalf. As an initial matter, there is no indication in the record that Bergdorf was ever aware of these facts, let alone during the relevant time period (2012-2014). Further, the fact alone that Krantz and Salmon had worked together in the past does not show or even imply that Krantz was authorized to enter into contracts for Salmon.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Second, the dissent relies on the fact that Krantz listed himself as a project manager for Salmon in a 2013 email concerning renewal of the Permit.\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 48. This email, however, is the manifestation of Krantz, not Salmon-and was sent in an effort to renew Salmon's Permit without Salmon knowing. Further, Krantz sent this email in May 2013 after the Permit had self-terminated and after Bergdorf had solicited new bids for the Project. In other words, Salmon was no longer involved in the Project at the time this email was sent. Thus, this 2013 email cannot lend support to the dissent's conclusion that a reasonable jury could find apparent authority \"at least during the 2012 part of the project's timeframe.\"\n    <em>\n     Infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 55.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    The dissent argues that a jury could reasonably infer such belief from Bergdorf's statement, \"I don't know contract.\" We disagree.

Here, Bergdorf's testimony can be construed as a representation either that she did not hold such a belief or that she had no belief one way or the other. To construe Bergdorf's statements as expressing an actual belief that Krantz had authority to bind Salmon stretches the permissible inference beyond reasonableness to speculation. Under oath, Bergdorf testified that she did not enter into a contract with Salmon. And later in her deposition when she stated, \"I don't know contract,\" she then broadly testified, \"All my relationships were with [Krantz].\" The only reasonable inference-in context-is that Bergdorf's actual belief was that\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of her relationships-contractual or otherwise-were with Krantz.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Indeed, this testimony is consistent with Bergdorf's third-party complaint which alleges: \"Krantz, before approval to proceed with work and approval of plans and the scope of work, entered the Property and removed carpet, demolished walls, and removed other property leaving the Property in an unsafe and unusable state resulting in more expense for [Bergdorf].\" We find no support in the record, and indeed Bergdorf did not allege below, that she authorized Krantz to begin work on the Project as stated in the dissent.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 54.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The payments Bergdorf made all occurred in 2014 or later when Bergdorf considered Krantz to be the general contractor and when Bergdorf and Krantz had completely bypassed Salmon and engaged subcontractors on their own.

Utah Ry.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994350\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/219/\">\n    2009 UT 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994350\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/219/\">\n    221 P.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b646 The majority correctly recites this standard,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 1, but I disagree that it has appropriately applied it. In my view, the majority emphasizes the (ample) evidence supporting Salmon's position, while minimizing some of the (less copious) evidence supporting Bergdorf's position. Certainly, the question about whether \"a reasonable jury\" could possibly find in favor of a party on a specific claim is the type of inquiry upon which reasonable minds might reasonably differ, and on the record presented here I respectfully disagree with the majority's general conclusion that no reasonable jury could possibly find for Bergdorf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b647 Chiefly, I disagree with the majority's conclusion that no reasonable jury could find that Krantz had apparent authority to act as Salmon's agent. The majority correctly recites the elements of apparent authority: (1) that the principal has either \"manifested\" consent to the agent's exercise of authority or at least \"knowingly permitted the agent\" to exercise authority; (2) that the third person, based on actions of the principal, reasonably believed that the agent had apparent authority; and (3) that the third person has relied to her detriment on the appearance of authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdick v. Horner Townsend &amp; Kent, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    2015 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    345 P.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). But I disagree with the majority's application of those elements to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b648 The first\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor is satisfied simply by the principal's manifestation of consent to the agent's exercise of authority, or even by the principal's knowing decision to \"permit[ ] the agent to assume the exercise of such authority.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified). And in this case there exists ample evidence to support a finding that Salmon took actions intended to clothe Krantz with authority to act as its agent on Bergdorf's Project. At trial, the jury would have learned, by way of background, that Salmon and Krantz had worked together on over a hundred construction projects, and that they were business partners in a commercial development project. Indeed, Krantz was familiar enough to Salmon's employees that he had the power to tell them to carry out tasks-like apply for and pay for the Permit-and they would follow Krantz's orders. On this particular Project, Salmon agreed-at Krantz's request-to act as the general contractor on Bergdorf's Project, and Salmon provided information to Krantz to assist him in drafting the written (but ultimately unsigned) Contract that listed Salmon as the contractor and Bergdorf as the client/owner. Salmon filled out a set of documents-including a W-9 form, a credit authorization, and a \"builders statement\" that listed Salmon as the \"contractor\" on the Project-for submission to the Bank in connection with the Loan, and then Krantz submitted those documents to the Bank. And according to Salmon's principal\n   Chad Salmon, Krantz walked into Salmon's offices and asked the secretary there to submit an application for the Permit on Bergdorf's Project that listed Salmon as the general contractor on the Project, and the secretary complied, including paying the four-figure permit fee out of Salmon's funds. Moreover, in later communications, Krantz listed himself as \"Randy Krantz, Project Manager, Salmon Electrical Contractors.\" In my view, there is no question that sufficient evidence exists, viewed in the light most favorable to Bergdorf, to satisfy the first\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b649 Salmon's best argument lies with the second\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor, which is where Bergdorf's knowledge of these events becomes relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing the second factor as whether \"the third person knew of the facts and, acting in good faith, had reason to believe, and did actually believe, that the agent possessed such authority\" (quotation simplified)). I acknowledge that this is the closest question presented, and that the evidence of Bergdorf's knowledge is thinner than the evidence of Salmon's assent to Krantz's agency or of Bergdorf's reliance. But even here, I think there is enough to support a finding by a reasonable jury that Bergdorf reasonably believed that Krantz was acting as Salmon's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b650 Certainly, there is evidence that Krantz told Bergdorf that he and Salmon were \"partners\" and that Salmon would be the general contractor for the Project. But the majority correctly notes that Bergdorf's reasonable belief needs to be based, at least in part, on some action of the principal; an agent's representations are not enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. However, a principal's action endorsing the act of the agent can occur even after the agent's act has taken place, if the principal acts to ratify the previous act of the agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw v. McBride\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429229\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/649/74/#p78\">\n    649 P.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78 (Utah 1982). Ratification \"need not be express,\" and \"silence with full knowledge of the facts may manifest affirmance and thus operate as a ratification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429229\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/649/74/#p78\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified). A principal may not \"escape ratification\" through being \"wilfully ignorant, nor may he purposely shut his eyes to means of information within his possession and control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10429229\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/649/74/#p78\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b651 In this case, Salmon filled out the Loan application paperwork, and allowed Krantz to submit it to the Bank; that documentation listed Salmon as the general contractor on Bergdorf's Project. While there is no evidence that Bergdorf knew about the loan documentation when it was submitted, she certainly learned later-when the Bank sent a confirmation email, copied to both Bergdorf and Chad Salmon, notifying them that Salmon \"has been accepted as the General Contractor\" on the Project-that Salmon had submitted some form of application to the Bank seeking to be treated as the contractor on her Project. After receiving this email, Salmon took no action to disabuse anyone, including Bergdorf, of the notion that it was the general contractor on the Project. A reasonable jury could conclude that this email-and Salmon's decision not to contradict it-confirmed, in Bergdorf's mind, all of the things Krantz had been telling her about his relationship with Salmon, and could infer from this evidence that Bergdorf reasonably believed, based in part on Salmon's actions, that Salmon had authorized Krantz to act as its agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b652 The majority believes that, because the Loan never closed, the documents related to the Loan-including the email-somehow lose their relevance. I simply disagree. Whether the Loan ever closed does not necessarily have anything to do with whether Salmon agreed to act as the general contractor on the Project or with whether Salmon agreed to allow Krantz to act as its agent. Bergdorf correctly points out that a contract to build a structure, and the financing for that contract, are entirely different conceptually, and that \"the fact that [Bergdorf's] construction loan was not approved means she needed to get funding elsewhere, not that she needed a new construction contract.\" I therefore disagree with the majority's contention that \"a jury could reasonably infer only that Bergdorf believed Salmon had agreed to serve as the general contractor for the Project if the Loan closed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Contractors generally do not care where the money that pays them comes\n   from, as long as they get paid. There is a reasonable inference to be drawn-certainly \"more than pure speculation,\"\n   <em>\n    Heslop v. Bear River Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338297\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/390/314/\">\n    2017 UT 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338297\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/390/314/\">\n    390 P.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -that Salmon's agreement to act as the general contractor on Bergdorf's Project was not conditional on the Loan closing, but instead was only conditional on it getting paid from some source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b653 I acknowledge that some of Bergdorf's own deposition statements are harmful to her cause regarding the second\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor. As the majority notes, at one point during her deposition Bergdorf stated that she did not believe she had entered into any contractual relationship with Salmon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. But at other points in Bergdorf's deposition, she testified that she believed that Salmon was the general contractor on the Project, and that Salmon and Krantz were \"partners\" on the Project. And she clarified that, while she believed that \"all [her] relationships were with\" Krantz, she does not understand the legal niceties of contractual relationships. Bergdorf's seemingly contradictory deposition testimony is admittedly confusing, and would require some explanation at trial, but in my view a reasonable jury could view that testimony as consistent with the notion that, while all of her person-to-person relationships were with Krantz, he was acting as Salmon's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b654 Moving now to the third\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factor, in my view there exists sufficient evidence that Bergdorf took action in reliance on her belief that Krantz was acting as Salmon's agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    2015 UT 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879887\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/531/\">\n    345 P.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Bergdorf submitted a Loan application to the Bank seeking financing for the Project on which Salmon was to be the general contractor. Bergdorf knew that Krantz did not have a valid contractor's license at the time, and Krantz told her that his \"partner\" Salmon was going to be acting as the general contractor on the Project. Bergdorf hired Krantz to perform work on the Project, and Krantz-with or without her knowledge-hired a demolition subcontractor who removed one of the building's interior walls, an act that Bergdorf alleges led to damages. Moreover, Bergdorf began the building process pursuant to the Permit listing Salmon as her general contractor, thereby believing that she had a licensed general contractor on her Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b655 In short, I think there is enough evidence on all three of the\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   factors to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that-at least during the 2012 part of the Project's timeframe-Krantz had apparent authority to act as Salmon's agent. And once that conclusion is drawn, it necessarily follows that a jury could also reasonably find in Bergdorf's favor on the question of whether a valid contract ever existed between her and Salmon. It is undisputed that Bergdorf asked Krantz to work on her Project, and that Krantz did so. To the extent that Krantz was taking those actions in the capacity as Salmon's agent, Salmon and Bergdorf had a contractual relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b656 As noted, merely because I believe that summary judgment was improvidently granted here does not mean that I believe that Bergdorf has a fantastic case against Salmon. In the end, the factfinder might find this evidence unpersuasive, or at least less persuasive than the evidence that unquestionably exists on the other side of the ledger. But that should be the jury's choice to make, and I cannot say that a determination in favor of Bergdorf on the contractual question would be unreasonable. For these reasons, I would reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Having a licensed general contractor on a project is important for several reasons, not the least of which is that licensed general contractors are required to have liability insurance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Admin.
