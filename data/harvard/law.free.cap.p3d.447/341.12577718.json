Apache argues the court abused its discretion because issuance of the stay was effectively a denial, without proper consideration, of Apache's pending request for a preliminary injunction. Because we conclude the court effectively denied the preliminary injunction request without considering it under the proper legal standard, we vacate the stay and remand the case for consideration of the preliminary injunction request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The present action stems from an ongoing dispute between Apache, a produce distributor, and International Greenhouse Produce S.A. de C.V. (\"IGP\"), a Mexican corporation that grows and markets produce. In 2008, IGP and Apache agreed that Apache would be IGP's produce distributor for ten years, but IGP disputes that, in 2016, it extended that agreement for five more years. That dispute is the subject of ongoing litigation in Mexico related to IGP's corporate governance, and also in Arizona, where IGP has sued for a declaration that the extension is invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Greenhouse Produce, S.A. de C.V. v.

Apache then applied for a temporary restraining order and a hearing on its preliminary injunction request. Four weeks later, Malena moved to\n   stay the case. Without addressing Apache's pending request for injunctive relief, the trial court granted the stay, finding it would \"save[ ] substantial resources\" and \"avoid[ ] multiple suits on the same subject matter, piecemeal litigation, difficult questions of foreign law that bear upon important policy issues, and conflicting judgments by different courts.\" Apache filed a special action, in which this court summarily declined to accept jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apache Produce Imports, LLC v.

Because the considerations for stays and preliminary injunctions differ, granting a stay without considering a pending preliminary injunction request effectively denies speedy relief to a party facing allegedly irreparable harm without properly considering whether such relief is justified. None of the general considerations for a stay bears on the likelihood that\n   a party will prevail at trial or suffer irreparable injury, for example.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tonnemacher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505959\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/186/125/#p130\">\n    186 Ariz. at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1505959\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/186/125/#p130\">\n    920 P.2d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the court's findings and conclusions reflect the general considerations for a grant of stay, they do not reflect the proper considerations for a preliminary injunction request and therefore were not sufficient to determine whether a preliminary injunction was warranted. While we acknowledge the court's concern that determining Apache's likelihood of ultimate success on the merits may not be easy, the burden is on Apache to establish the requisite likelihood of success. By pre-empting a hearing on the preliminary injunction and imposing the stay order, the court foreclosed Apache's opportunity to provide information shedding light on its chances. Moreover, the court's concern for conflicting judgments does not warrant denial of the preliminary injunction request, as the preliminary injunction standard expressly contemplates uncertainty as to the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shoen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1544593\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/167/58/#p62\">\n    167 Ariz. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1544593\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/167/58/#p62\">\n    804 P.2d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 We vacate the trial court's stay order and remand for consideration of Apache's preliminary injunction request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    As we have found jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 12-2101(A)(5)(b), we need not reach Apache's contention that jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 12-2101(A)(3).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    We reject Malena's contention that there is no difference between the stay here and the stay the trial court issued in Apache's litigation with IGP, which we declined to overturn. In that case, Apache did not request a preliminary injunction until after the court granted the stay; thus the grant of stay did not effectively deny a preliminary injunction request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Int'l Greenhouse Produce\n    </em>\n    , No. 2 CA-CV 2018-0147, \u00b6 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    As Malena did not prevail, we decline its request for attorney fees and costs under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-341.01 and 12-342. We do not consider Malena's arguments that A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1802(5) and the common law bar injunctive relief, that Apache's request for preliminary injunction fails under the\n    <em>\n     Shoen\n    </em>\n    standard, and that Apache's request is vitiated because it cited to its original complaint rather than its amended complaint in its motion. These arguments, which concern the merits of the preliminary injunction request, may be raised when the trial court considers that request on remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
