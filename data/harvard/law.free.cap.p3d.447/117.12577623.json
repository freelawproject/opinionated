The trial court did so and concluded that Tirado received ineffective assistance of counsel.

When asked about the methamphetamine, Cousin allegedly told Officer that \"if he needed to sell [methamphetamine], he would sell from that specific amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Officer also took Tirado into custody. Although Officer found no drugs or paraphernalia on Tirado's person, officers ultimately discovered drug paraphernalia at Tirado's residence after obtaining permission from Tirado's fianc\u00e9e to search it. Tirado was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, a class A misdemeanor, and arranging the distribution of a controlled substance, a second-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The same appointed counsel (Attorney) represented both Tirado and Cousin. Cousin eventually pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. Attorney was unable to obtain a plea deal for Tirado, and his case went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At trial, Attorney did not call Cousin as a witness or object when Officer testified regarding Cousin's statement about his intent to sell methamphetamine. Tirado was ultimately convicted of both charges and appealed his conviction for arranging the distribution of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 On appeal, Tirado asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because Attorney's concurrent representation of both Tirado and Cousin constituted \"an\n   actual conflict of interest which adversely affected counsel's performance.\" Specifically, he alleged that the conflict affected Attorney's decision \"not to challenge the evidence relating to Cousin and not to call Cousin as a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tirado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    2017 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    392 P.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Concurrent with his appeal, Tirado moved this court to remand the case pursuant to rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure to enable the trial court to make factual findings regarding Attorney's alleged conflict. We granted Tirado's motion, directing the trial court to determine \"(1) whether Attorney's representation of Cousin resulted in an actual conflict of interest with respect to his representation of Defendant, to which Defendant did not consent, and (2) whether that conflict of interest caused Attorney's representation of Defendant to be constitutionally ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On remand, the trial court held a three-day evidentiary hearing to assess Tirado's ineffective assistance claims. The court determined that Attorney had read the police reports upon being assigned to Tirado's case and was aware that Cousin was arrested at the same time and that Attorney had also been assigned to represent Cousin, whom he had represented in other cases. The trial court further found that Cousin had told Attorney that he was willing to testify on Tirado's behalf. Specifically, Cousin was prepared to testify that he and Tirado \"were not working together to sell those drugs, he did not have Tirado contact [Informant] on the phone to arrange a drug deal, and Tirado was not acting\" as an agent for Cousin. Cousin also told Attorney that he would deny that he ever admitted to police that he intended to sell the drugs found in his pocket. The court found that such statements would have been inconsistent with the admission Cousin made in his plea agreement that he knowingly and intentionally possessed and attempted to distribute methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Based on the information submitted at the evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded that Attorney had labored under an actual conflict of interest because \"[s]imultaneously representing both Tirado and [Cousin] created a substantial risk that [Attorney's] representation of Tirado would be materially limited by his responsibilities to [Cousin].\" Moreover, because Tirado's case rested on his assertion that he did not intend to distribute drugs, Cousin's plea, which Attorney arranged and in which Cousin admitted his intent to distribute, had the potential to undermine Tirado's defense. The court further concluded that this conflict affected Attorney's ability to adequately represent Tirado because Attorney could not call Cousin as a witness in Tirado's case without violating his duties to Cousin, due to the possibility that Cousin's testimony would open Cousin up to perjury charges, and because Attorney could not put himself in a position where he would be forced to cross-examine Cousin, as \" '[a]n attorney who cross-examines former clients inherently encounters divided loyalties.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Voigt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046179\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1050/#p1078\">\n    89 F.3d 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (3d Cir. 1996).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The court also assessed Tirado's assertion that Attorney performed ineffectively by failing to object to the hearsay statement in Officer's testimony. It concluded that the State's theory at trial was bolstered by what Cousin allegedly told Officer about his intent concerning the drugs-that \"if he needed to sell it, he would sell from that specific amount.\" The court found that the failure to object to this testimony was not supported by any reasonable trial strategy and that Tirado was prejudiced by the statement because the State relied on it as evidence of Tirado's intent to distribute, since Tirado was allegedly acting as the go-between for Cousin and Informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 After the trial court issued its findings and conclusions, the State challenged the court's determination that Tirado received ineffective assistance, asserting that the findings did not support a conclusion that Attorney's conflict adversely affected his performance and that the trial court exceeded the scope of its mandate on remand by reaching conclusions concerning Attorney's failure to object to Officer's hearsay statements. Tirado, on the other hand, requests that we accept the trial court's findings and conclusions and reverse his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Tirado's ineffective assistance of counsel claim turns on his assertion that Attorney was laboring under an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his performance. \"In ruling on an ineffective assistance claim following a Rule 23B hearing, we defer to the trial court's findings of fact, but review its legal conclusions for correctness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Attorney claims he ultimately believed it would hurt Tirado to be associated with Cousin. However, Tirado was already associated with Cousin and his criminal record even without Cousin's in-court testimony, as the State's case rested on the assertion that Tirado was acting as a conduit between Cousin and Informant. The trial court on remand found that Cousin's testimony would have been helpful to Tirado, and we are not convinced that further associating Tirado and Cousin, when the State had already done so, would have undermined Tirado's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Even if Attorney's effort to distance Tirado from Cousin could be considered a sound trial strategy based upon the circumstances of this case, we think it likely that other counsel, unhampered by a conflict of interest, would have approached the case differently. Because Attorney could not ethically call Cousin to the stand without compromising his duties to Cousin, he was inherently more likely than a conflict-free attorney to adopt a strategy that did not require him to call Cousin as a witness. Another attorney, without conflicting representation, would have been more likely to determine that because Tirado was already associated with Cousin, the additional association the jury might make if Cousin testified in Tirado's defense was outweighed by the potential exculpatory value of Cousin's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 Likewise, we are concerned that Attorney's failure to object to Officer's statement was influenced by the conflict in representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statement was inadmissible hearsay, offered \"to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

Absent conflicting representation, it is likely that another attorney would have called Cousin to testify in Tirado's defense and would have objected to the admission of Officer's hearsay statement.

Voigt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046179\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1050/#p1078\">\n     89 F.3d 1050\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1078 (3d Cir. 1996) (\"An attorney who cross-examines former clients inherently encounters divided loyalties.\" (quotation simplified));\n    <em>\n     Castillo v. Estelle\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"109655\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/504/1243/#p1245\">\n     504 F.2d 1243\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1245 (5th Cir. 1974). Thus, the trial court's mandate included assessing whether Attorney's conflict of interest adversely affected his decision not to object to Officer's trial statement and whether Tirado received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result. On rule 23B remand, the trial court framed its conclusion a bit differently-it determined that the failure to object constituted ineffective assistance regardless of whether that decision was the result of Attorney's conflict of interest. But the trial court's framing of the issue-at least in the context presented here-did not take the issue outside the scope of the court's mandate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    We are also troubled by Attorney's negotiation of a plea agreement for Cousin that ultimately affected Tirado in a negative way. The trial court found that Attorney \"did not consider how [Cousin's] plea to a distribution offense in this case might affect Tirado's case\" and \"did not discuss [Cousin's] plea with Tirado.\" Police found no drugs on Tirado's person and found only drug paraphernalia at his home, so the State's ability to prove that Tirado was involved in the distribution of drugs turned on its theory that Tirado was acting as the go-between for Cousin and Informant. Without Cousin's alleged statement to Officer regarding his own intent and Cousin's conviction for possession with intent to distribute, the State's only significant evidence that Tirado was involved in a drug transaction was his vague phone call with Informant, in which there was no actual discussion of drugs. While separate representation likely would not have precluded introduction of Cousin's plea agreement at Tirado's trial, it is concerning that Tirado's counsel was involved in negotiating that primary piece of evidence against him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
