Because Dennis was eligible to retire when he became disabled, and certainly would have retired prior to the parties' dissolution, his disability allowance was more akin to deferred compensation and should have been characterized as community property. Further, the trial court's failure to divide Dennis's disability allowance-the parties' most substantial asset-indicates that the final division of property was unfair, unjust, and inequitable. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Dennis joined the Seattle Fire Department on February 11, 1963, and became a lieutenant in 1979. Dennis and Mary married on November 18, 1991; they did not have any children together. In October of 1992, Dennis was injured in the line of duty while fighting a fire. After his injury, the Seattle Firefighters Pension Board doctor determined that Dennis was no longer able to physically handle the duties of a firefighter. Accordingly, on April 15, 1993, the Seattle Firefighters Pension Board approved Dennis's line of duty disability. That decision was subsequently affirmed by the State Department of Retirement Systems on May 5, 1993. Since then, Dennis has received a monthly disability allowance set at approximately 60 percent of the salary of a fire department lieutenant. At the time of trial Dennis was receiving $5,784 a month in disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The majority of the couple's assets were brought into the marriage by Dennis. Mary owned a small equity in a condominium and a small IRA deferred compensation account. The mortgage balance on Mary's condominium was fully paid using Dennis's separate liquid investments early in the marriage. The condominium was rented during the marriage and the community shared the revenue. Upon sale, the proceeds from the sale of the condominium were placed in Dennis's investment accounts. During their marriage, the couple lived in a house that Dennis had separately purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On November 12, 1998, the couple signed a community property agreement. The agreement provided that all of their separate property would be transferred to community property. On the agreement, Dennis hand wrote \"Our intention is to now own all of our property together as community property.\" After signing and having the agreement notarized, the couple drove to three different counties to record the agreement and quit claim deeds that they made out to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On October 21, 2016, after nearly 25 years of marriage, Dennis petitioned for dissolution. Both parties cross moved for summary judgment on the validity of the community property agreement and the characterization of Dennis's disability allowance. On the community property agreement, the trial court rejected Dennis's argument that he was coerced into signing the agreement or that he did not know what he was signing. The trial court found that the agreement was valid and that the parties' actions were \"consistent with an intent to make all of their property community.\" The court reserved on the characterization of Dennis's disability allowance until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 After trial, the trial court awarded each party half of their collective assets except Dennis's disability allowance. The court awarded both parties 50 percent each of the net proceeds from the sale of the family home, 50 percent each of various savings bonds, and 50 percent each of Mary's IRA account, a money market account, and a joint account. But the trial court determined that Dennis's disability allowance was his separate property and was not \"in any part community in character.\" Further, the court concluded that \"any service related pension/allowance is owned for the most part (97.5%) by Dennis as his separate interests\n   as he worked for the [Seattle Fire Department] for 28.5 years before marriage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The trial court also granted Mary a monthly maintenance of $1,600 for five years. The five-year time frame was intended to last until Mary qualified for Medicare and Social Security payments. At the time of trial, Dennis was 75 years old and Mary was 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Mary argues that the trial court erred in characterizing Dennis's disability allowance as his separate property and then abused its discretion by awarding the full allowance to Dennis.

Dennis contends that he accumulated 95 percent of his retirement pension before his marriage to Mary and consequently at most only 5 percent of his retirement pension could be considered community property, of which Mary would only be entitled to half or 2.5 percent of his entire retirement account. The trial court agreed with this proposition when it found that \"[a]ny service related pension/allowance is owned for the most part (97.5%) by Dennis as his separate interests as he worked for the [Seattle Fire Department] for 28.5 years before marriage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b630 But this argument ignores the presence of the community property agreement, which the trial court expressly found to be valid. The community property agreement states that it was Dennis and Mary's intention \"to now own all of our property together as community property.\" There was no exception for retirement accounts that the parties earned prior to the marriage, as is evident by the trial court's equal division of Mary's previously earned IRA account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b631 Dennis's disability allowance was one of the most substantial assets that the parties had. At the time of trial, Dennis was collecting $5,784 a month in disability and will continue to do so until his death. And while the trial court split virtually every other asset equally, it awarded Dennis the entirety of his disability allowance. Therefore, the trial court's mischaracterization of Dennis's disability allowance likely affected its distribution of property. While the trial court divided everything the parties owned evenly, it left Mary with a $1600 a month for five years maintenance while Dennis will receive nearly $6000 a month for life. This is not a fair, just, and equitable division of property under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b632 Accordingly, this is one of the rare cases where the appellant has met their heavy burden to show that the trial court manifestly abused its discretion by exercising it on untenable grounds.\n   <em>\n    Landry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1134114\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/103/807/#p809\">\n    103 Wash.2d at 809-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20214\">\n    699 P.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
