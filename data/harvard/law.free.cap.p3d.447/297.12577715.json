He was sentenced to death for the first-degree murder. We have jurisdiction over this direct appeal under article 6, section 5(3) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4031. For the following reasons, we affirm Champagne's convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On June 23, 2011, Champagne and three friends drank alcohol and used methamphetamine at his apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   One friend, Elise Garcia, spent the night. Early the next morning, she was in the bathroom when two people entered the apartment with Champagne. As she walked into the living room, Garcia heard a gunshot and then saw Tapaha on the couch with a bullet wound to his head, blood on the walls and the couch, and Champagne standing next to him holding a gun. Tapaha's girlfriend, Hoffner, cried at the sight of her dead boyfriend, saying, \"I loved him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Champagne attempted to calm Hoffner and asked if she wanted to get high. Hoffner nodded affirmatively, and he led her into the bedroom and gave her a bong and methamphetamine for her to smoke. Garcia followed them into the bedroom and sat in the doorway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Champagne left the room briefly, placing a gun in Garcia's lap before he exited the room. Garcia testified that when she locked eyes with Hoffner, Hoffner understood she would not be allowed to leave. When Champagne returned, he came behind Hoffner as she was smoking and slipped an electrical cord fashioned into a noose around her neck. Hoffner struggled, clawing with both hands at the cord trying to breathe as Champagne used a wrench to tighten the cord with each turn. Garcia recalled Hoffner's face turning purple as Champagne strangled her to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After Champagne killed Hoffner, he kept the bodies in his apartment for approximately one week. Eventually, Champagne placed the decomposing bodies into a large wooden box, which he buried in his mother's backyard. About twenty months later, a landscaper discovered the box containing the bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The State charged Champagne with two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Tapaha and Hoffner, one count of kidnapping Hoffner, and two counts of abandonment or concealment of the bodies. The jury found Champagne guilty on all charges, except that it found him guilty of second-degree murder for the killing of Tapaha. The jury found three aggravating circumstances: (1) Champagne had been previously convicted of a serious offense, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2) ; (2) he murdered Hoffner in an especially cruel manner, \u00a7 13-751(F)(6) ; and (3) he was convicted of multiple homicides during the commission of the offense, \u00a7 13-751(F)(8). The jury found that the proffered mitigation was not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency and Champagne was sentenced to death for Hoffner's murder. This automatic appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Request for Change of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Champagne contends that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing his request to change counsel and failing to adequately inquire into whether a true conflict existed, thus violating his constitutional right to conflict-free counsel. We review a trial court's decision to deny a request for new counsel for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cromwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    211 Ariz. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    119 P.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 453 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Before trial, Champagne filed a pro per motion to change counsel, which the trial court described as a \"[bare] bones hand-written motion\" that cited \"no particular reason\" why counsel should have been changed. Defense counsel maintained that Champagne had a \"good faith basis to ask for new counsel\" and informed the court that there was a bona fide conflict of interest because Champagne said he was filing a complaint against her with the State Bar of Arizona. Because of that conflict, counsel asserted that she and her co-counsel needed to be \"removed from representing Mr. Champagne any further.\" The trial court denied counsel's oral motion to remove capital counsel, who had been working on the case for eighteen months, and instructed counsel to file a motion if she believed it was appropriate for Champagne to obtain new counsel. She did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Three-and-one-half months later, Champagne wrote a letter to the court, repeating his request for new counsel and alleging his current counsel had fallen asleep during his recent, unrelated trial, which resulted in over a 700-year sentence. But after the court reviewed his letter, Champagne informed the court that he wanted his attorney to visit him in jail to explore whether they could \"reach some type of an understanding or working relationship.\" Despite a productive jail visit, Champagne indicated to the court that he still wanted to change his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The court treated Champagne's letter as a motion to change counsel and addressed it at a hearing. The prosecutor noted that a delay in trial due to change in counsel would impact witness availability and the victims' rights to a speedy trial. The court then conducted an ex parte hearing in the presence of only Champagne and his attorney on the purported conflict. Champagne told the court he wanted to change counsel because his lawyer fell asleep during his previous trial-which, according to Champagne, alone constituted adequate grounds to change counsel-and that she was not visiting him or discussing the current case with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 In response, Champagne's counsel explained that Champagne was extremely unhappy about the outcome of his prior trial, that he became hostile and uncooperative, and that he refused visits from counsel's mitigation specialist. She detailed the extensive amount of time and work that she spent preparing for this case. Moreover, she told the court she was willing to assist Champagne in accurately and adequately preserving a record of the allegations surrounding her perceived behavior during his prior trial. Ultimately, Champagne's counsel asserted that a change of counsel was not in Champagne's best interests and that she did not believe the relationship was irretrievably broken but that they could work together and proceed to trial. The trial court denied Champagne's request for new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 The trial court did not abuse its discretion. Champagne argues that the Court should \"\n   <em>\n    presume\n   </em>\n   the prejudice because there was a showing of actual conflict of interest.\" He relies considerably on counsel's initial statement that he had a good-faith basis for requesting a change of counsel, maintaining that the court's denial of his request resulted in structural error tainting his entire trial. But that statement came shortly after Champagne informed his attorney that he intended to pursue a bar complaint against her. And Champagne ignores counsel's subsequent statements that the relationship was not irretrievably broken, that a change of counsel was not in his best interests, that she was dedicated to his current case, and that she was willing to help him establish a record of his allegations relating to her perceived behavior in his prior trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Although the Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused the right to counsel, a \"defendant is not, however, entitled to counsel of choice or to a meaningful relationship with his or her attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Cromwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    211 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   186 \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    119 P.3d at 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, \"[a]lthough the trial court could have engaged\n   in a more searching exploration\" of the responses from Champagne's attorney as to the truthfulness behind his claim that she fell asleep during his prior trial and the repercussions of that alleged behavior on their attorney-client relationship,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    232 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   318-19 \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    305 P.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-84, the court did not abuse its discretion because it sufficiently inquired into the purported conflict and considered the\n   <em>\n    LaGrand\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 First, the court determined that there was no irreconcilable breakdown in communication between Champagne and his counsel. Champagne had the burden of proving \"either a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict,\" and, to satisfy that burden, he needed to \"present evidence of a severe and pervasive conflict with his attorney or evidence that he had such minimal contact with the attorney that meaningful communication was not possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    232 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   318 \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    305 P.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that the circumstances did not amount to an irreconcilable breakdown in communication, that Champagne was able to communicate with his lawyer, and that he was receiving effective representation. And while the court noted that Champagne may understandably be upset and have \"some trust issues\" if counsel truly fell asleep during a brief period of his prior trial, \"[a] mere allegation of lost confidence in counsel does not require appointing substitute counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bible\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501172\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/549/#p591\">\n    175 Ariz. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501172\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/549/#p591\">\n    858 P.2d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1194 (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Second, the court noted that new counsel would likely be confronted with the same conflict. Other than the allegation that counsel slept during part of his previous trial, Champagne's main concern was that his attorney was not adequately communicating with him. However, counsel told the court that she had visited Champagne multiple times in jail, as had her mitigation specialist, but that he sometimes refused visits. Additionally, counsel said that her challenging trial schedule had made it difficult to see Champagne for a few months, but that she was nonetheless preparing for his trial and ready to move forward. Based on that information, the court found that a change in counsel would likely result in the same purported conflict because new counsel might also be unable to visit and confer with Champagne as often as he would like, making it conceivable that the court could find itself in the same circumstance with a change of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Third, the court found that granting Champagne's request would delay trial, which could ultimately inconvenience witnesses. The prosecutor explained how a change of counsel would delay trial and make it difficult for the State to get certain witnesses to court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cromwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    211 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   187 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57659\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/181/\">\n    119 P.3d at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the fact that appointing new counsel would cause delay and inconvenience to witnesses was part of a \"proper balancing of relevant interests\" under\n   <em>\n    LaGrand\n   </em>\n   ). Here, not only would a delay stemming from change in counsel have resulted in inconvenience to witnesses, but it may have prejudiced the State's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Fourth, the court explicitly noted the quality of counsel. The court observed that Champagne's counsel was \"one of the best capital defense attorneys in the State of Arizona\" and that she was \"aggressively\" working on his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Finally, the court considered the timing of Champagne's motion and the time that had already elapsed since the alleged offense. Champagne's request for new counsel came after counsel had invested substantial time and effort into the case, nearly two years after Champagne committed the murders, over a year after he was indicted, less than a year before trial was scheduled to begin, and only after Champagne lost his previous trial and was sentenced to more than 700 years. The court considered the \"substantial\" delay that would be caused by a change in counsel, concluding that \"[i]t would absolutely prejudice the victim[s'] interest[s] and the community interest in a speedy resolution of this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 2.1 (A)(10);\n   <em>\n    Phx. Newspapers, Inc. v.

But one factor weighing in Champagne's favor does not necessitate a finding that he was entitled to change counsel when the other factors weighed in support of denying his request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaGrand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1475979\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/152/483/#p486\">\n    152 Ariz. at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1475979\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/152/483/#p486\">\n    733 P.2d at 1069-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Champagne's request for change of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 The trial court did not explicitly refer to the\n   <em>\n    LaGrand\n   </em>\n   factors, but the record indicates that the court considered these factors in assessing and denying Champagne's request for change of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    232 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   321 \u00b6\u00b6 34-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063499\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/313/\">\n    305 P.3d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding trial court did not abuse its discretion when it considered the\n   <em>\n    LaGrand\n   </em>\n   factors but \"did not explicitly refer to the aforementioned factors\").

Question 78 of the Jury Questionnaire\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b622 Champagne argues that the trial court erred by telling the jury during voir dire and in the jury questionnaire that a life sentence could result in the possibility of Champagne's release after twenty-five years.

Specifically, question 78 read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If you determine that the appropriate sentence is life, the judge will determine if the sentence will be life without the possibility of release or\n   <em>\n    life with the possibility of release only after at least 25 years have been served\n   </em>\n   .

Here, Champagne requested that the trial court provide a\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   instruction and the trial court did just that.

Thus, contrary to Champagne's assertions, this case is not one in which the jury \"was given a false choice between an un-releasable death sentence and the prospect that if given life [Champagne] could just be cut loose, set free, released in a mere 25 years.\" Instead, there was no risk that the jury believed that, absent a death sentence, Champagne could be released from prison because the jury received a proper instruction that Champagne was ineligible for parole and counsel repeatedly affirmed that he would never be released from prison.

Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b629 Before trial, Champagne moved to suppress statements he made to undercover Detective Egea, arguing that they were made in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, as well as article 2, sections 4, 8, 10, and 24 of the Arizona Constitution. The State responded that Champagne's statements to Egea before initiation of formal charges did not violate any of Champagne's constitutional rights but conceded that Egea's meeting with Champagne on March 19, 2013, violated Champagne's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The following evidence was presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b630 On October 20, 2011, police received an anonymous tip about a double homicide, naming Champagne as a potential suspect. Champagne was arrested for unrelated crimes and taken into custody on March 3, 2012. Champagne was properly read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and told he was under arrest. Detective Korus, who was investigating the disappearances of Tapaha and Hoffner, interviewed Champagne about the unrelated crimes. When Korus mentioned the missing persons investigation, Champagne's demeanor changed, and he asked, \"[d]o I need a lawyer or something?\" Korus responded, \"[y]ou tell me.\" But when Korus continued to reference the missing persons, Champagne said, \"if you have any more questions about that, I want a lawyer present.\" Korus immediately\n   ceased questioning Champagne regarding Tapaha and Hoffner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b631 In October 2012, Detective Korus approached Detective Egea, an experienced undercover officer, about \"befriending\" Champagne while he was incarcerated for the unrelated crimes and seeking information about Champagne's involvement in the missing persons case and the location of the bodies. They decided Egea would go undercover as an unscrupulous private investigator named \"Chino.\" A gang member incarcerated with Champagne told investigators that Champagne admitted killing two people. At the request of law enforcement, the gang member thereafter told Champagne about Chino and arranged a meeting between the two so Chino could \"help [Champagne] with whatever problem he may have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b632 Detective Egea, undercover as Chino, met with Champagne seven times from October 2012 to March 2013. On October 23, Champagne told Egea, \"I got bigger problems. I got some buried assets I need relocated.\" On October 30, Champagne gave Egea a police report authored by Detective Korus regarding the missing persons, stating, \"[t]his is my problem, know what I mean?\" Champagne also said, \"[h]ey, Chino, it's going to be a big mess.\" On February 14, 2013, Champagne again alluded to the missing persons and indicated that their remains needed to be moved. On March 4, Champagne told Egea that if the police found the bodies \"he would face the death penalty because of his criminal past.\" The bodies were found the next day and the State charged Champagne with the murders of Tapaha and Hoffner on March 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b633 Detective Egea visited Champagne on March 19, the only visit that occurred after Champagne was indicted for the charges in this case. During that visit, Champagne told Egea that the female victim was a prostitute and the male victim her pimp. He claimed that he lent them his apartment for a few hours and when he returned home they were dead. According to Champagne, the pimp killed the prostitute and then committed suicide. Champagne also told Egea that despite the charges, \"he didn't think they had a death penalty case on him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b634 Following the evidentiary hearing, the trial court granted in part Champagne's motion to suppress statements to Detective Egea, ruling that Champagne's statements on March 19 violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and were therefore inadmissible. The court held that Champagne's Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached on March 8, when he was charged with the murders. As such, the court found that the State obtained Champagne's statements before March 8 without violating his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Additionally, the court ruled that no\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation occurred and that Champagne's statements were voluntary. Champagne challenges those rulings here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    a.

Champagne did not know he was speaking to Detective Egea, an undercover officer. Rather, Champagne believed he was speaking to Chino, a corrupt private investigator willing to engage in criminal activity.

But even if Champagne invoked his right to counsel during his custodial interrogation with Korus, his subsequent statements to Detective Egea did not violate the Fifth Amendment because conversations between suspects and undercover agents \"do not implicate the concerns underlying\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122654\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/292/#p296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the trial court properly ruled that no Fifth Amendment violation occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    b.

The court emphasized that, based on the parties' agreement, evidence from the meeting between Champagne and Detective Egea on March 19 was suppressed, and it found under Evidence Rule 403 that allowing a restricted portion of the conversation to be admitted out of context would confuse and mislead the jury. Champagne argues now that because the trial court failed to admit his statement from March 19, \"the jury likely thought [he] was all but confessing to murder,\" and that the \"complete statement was necessary to put the remainder, which the [S]tate had introduced, into context.\" According to Champagne, the State was permitted to \"cherry-pick what it thought was incriminating and leave out the complete statement that explained what Mr. Champagne actually said.\" The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b644 Rule 106 -the rule of completeness-provides that \"[i]f a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part-or any other writing or recorded statement-that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time.\" The same rule generally applies to non-recorded statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before trial, the State moved in limine to preclude any questioning regarding, among other things, Garcia's mental health diagnoses. Champagne maintained that Garcia's\n   diagnoses of bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression spoke to her mental state and her ability to perceive events accurately, as did the fact that she was not medicated for those disorders and was drinking alcohol and using methamphetamine before the crimes occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b649 At oral argument on the motion in limine, the State conceded that Garcia's drug use was relevant to her ability to perceive the events surrounding the murders but argued that her mental health diagnoses were irrelevant. The trial court subsequently granted in part and denied in part the State's motion in limine. As relevant here, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant has not demonstrated either the existence of, or whether or how, any mental health diagnosis may affect the witness'[s] ability to observe or perceive the events to which she may testify. Moreover, the Court has not heard any evidence to support that the mere fact that Ms. Garcia has a mental health diagnosis ... affects [her] credibility or capacity to recall or communicate. Therefore, the Court finds that evidence of Ms. Garcia's mental health diagnoses lacks relevance in this case and that any probative value is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice. Of course, the witness may be cross-examined regarding her ability to perceive, observe, or recall the events to which she testifies; however, the Court will not allow cross-examination regarding the mere fact that Ms. Garcia was diagnosed with any particular mental health diagnosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Citations omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b650 The court allowed Champagne limited inquiry into Garcia's ability to perceive, observe, and recall the events. The court invoked Rule 403 to preclude Champagne from asking whether prescription medication Garcia was taking during trial was mental health medication because Champagne failed to present sufficient evidence suggesting a connection between any medication and her ability to recall and observe the matters to which she testified. The court permitted Champagne to question Garcia regarding the fact that in June 2011 she was prescribed medication and that she was not taking that medication, as well as her perception of the effect, if any, of her failure to take such medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b651 During her direct examination, Garcia admitted that her methamphetamine use made it difficult for her to remember details but not major events, and she maintained that she never experienced hallucinations while using methamphetamine. Additionally, Garcia acknowledged that methamphetamine use affected her memory, that she was taking methamphetamine and not her prescribed medication during the summer of 2011, and that she used methamphetamine the night before the murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b652 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Champagne's cross-examination of Garcia regarding her mental health.

Doing so may prevent needlessly discharging juries and prematurely declaring mistrials in circumstances where it might be appropriate and helpful for judges to offer assistance.

The jury's question indicated that it was struggling with the definition of felony murder and needed clarification on the law despite the court's standard instruction on that charge. Given the jury's confusion in the face of a straight-forward instruction, referral to that instruction would have been useless. Presentation of supplemental argument was an effective and efficient way to ensure a fair verdict without risk of jury coercion. Although we encourage trial judges to make findings explaining why they chose not to refer the jury to an original instruction or further instruct the jury, the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in permitting supplemental argument to resolve the jury's confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b669 Even if permitting supplemental argument was error, it was clearly harmless. \"Error, be it constitutional or otherwise, is harmless if we can say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to or affect the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Champagne did not object to such appointments, but counsel expressed concern that, if his mother's and sister's attorneys advised them to remain silent and not participate in the trial, that would \"eviscerate approximately 25 percent of the possible mitigation evidence.\" The court granted the State's request and appointed counsel for Champagne's mother and sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b680 The court heard oral argument on the parties' numerous motions regarding the testimony of Champagne's mother and sister. When the prosecutor proffered the topics the State intended to cross-examine the witnesses about, Champagne's mother and sister,\n   as well as their attorneys, maintained that they would invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to silence if questioned by the State during the guilt and penalty phases. The court ruled that Champagne's mother and sister both had a valid Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in response to any questions asked during the guilt and penalty phases involving their connection to or involvement with Champagne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b681 Additionally, considering the position taken by Champagne's mother and sister-that they would answer questions asked by defense counsel but invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to any of the State's questions on cross-examination-the court found that preclusion of their testimony entirely was the necessary result to the State's inability to cross-examine the witnesses. The court noted the unusual nature of the case but emphasized that \"if allowed to testify, the witnesses would answer questions on direct by Defense and invoke to all questions asked by the State, thus placing the Court in the virtually certain position of striking their testimony and instructing the jury to disregard anything either witness said.\" The court also emphasized that its order precluding the witnesses' testimony did not strip Champagne of his ability to present the identified mitigation evidence through his mitigation witness in place of his mother and sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b682 Defendants in capital cases are entitled to present mitigation evidence and, pursuant to \u00a7 13-751(C), \"the prosecution or the defendant may present\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   information that is relevant to any of the mitigating circumstances ... regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials.\" (Emphasis added.)

However, the trial court properly overruled his objections because the 1991 murder and 2012 shootout demonstrated Champagne's character, propensities, and criminal record. \"The facts establishing an aggravating circumstance, or the circumstances of the murder more generally, 'are relevant during the penalty phase because they tend to show whether the defendant should be shown leniency.' \"\n   <em>\n    Guarino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041935\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/437/\">\n    238 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   440 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041935\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/437/\">\n    362 P.3d at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, Korus's testimony regarding the events that occurred during the shootout case, including narrating video footage from the crime scene, constituted proper mitigation rebuttal.

Morales testified that Champagne, who had been huffing paint, ingesting LSD, and drinking alcohol, and another member of the East Side Locos 13th Street gang arrived at a house party with knives and eventually they were \"swinging wildly at people ... stabbing people ... total melee.\" Morales testified that Champagne murdered a \"clean-cut\" only child-a nineteen-year-old man with no criminal record or gang ties-by stabbing him through the heart and skull, and that the victim had numerous defensive wounds. Additionally, Morales testified that Champagne fled the scene and hid in Nevada and California before he was found three months later. Morales noted that the presentence report demonstrated that Champagne had failed on probation and \"posed an unreasonable risk and danger to the community,\" dating back to 1991. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding this testimony was relevant mitigation rebuttal and not unduly prejudicial because Morales simply provided details about the crime scene, the victim's injuries, Champagne's fleeing from the scene, and other details about the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    d.

Evidence that Champagne took steps to silence Garcia was relevant to his character and propensities and rebutted mitigation testimony that there was humanity and good in Champagne. Contrary to Champagne's assertion that this testimony was inappropriate because the informant inmate was mentally ill, the trial court did not err in permitting the testimony. And the testimony did not unduly prejudice Champagne because the defense cross-examined Davis on the inmate's mental competency, including his Rule\n   11 proceedings, and established that Davis never actually met the inmate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    f.

Knudson testified about how they entered the house, that Garcia was screaming frantically, and that the bullets were coming at them through the walls. Johnson testified that Champagne was submissive when Johnson restrained him during the breach and that Champagne did not fight back as the officers recovered Garcia. Additionally, Johnson testified on cross-examination that Champagne said he was \"sorry\" when he was apprehended, but on re-direct he testified that Champagne never inquired as to whether he injured or killed anyone. The officers' testimonies were not cumulative because they provided different information about the shootout incident. Also, contrary to Champagne's assertion, their testimonies were not impermissible victim impact statements but rather statements as factual witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b697 Moreover, all the State's proffered evidence of Champagne's 2012 hostage situation and shootout with police was relevant mitigation rebuttal because it demonstrated that Champagne did not value human life and that he intended to kill numerous police officers. After he was apprehended in the shootout case, Champagne indicated the ammunition in his AR-15 rifle was hollow point, which causes more damage on impact than other types of ammunition. The specific AR-15 ammunition is known on the streets as a \"cop killer round.\" Also, Champagne said he was intentionally shooting at police knowing that his ammunition could go through walls. Additionally, when Champagne released his son, he used Garcia as a human shield. When Champagne was apprehended, he never asked if he injured or killed anyone. Thus, evidence related to the shootout was relevant to Champagne's character and propensity for violence, and it was not unduly prejudicial as it was a factual account of his prior criminal actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    g.

She also indicated that her husband did not want her to testify, and that he wrote multiple letters to the judge, defense, and prosecution begging that she not be forced to testify because it would be \"extremely traumatic\" for her to speak about her childhood. The State's questioning of Champagne's niece was appropriate and relevant mitigation rebuttal because the questions went to possible bias of the witness's testimony and why she testified the way she did. And we reject as baseless Champagne's contention that a mistrial should have been declared because the prosecutor said, \"I'm so sorry you are here,\" thus purportedly implying that the defense had \"done something wrong or unsavory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    h. Tape of Shootout Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b699 During trial, Champagne objected to playing an audio recording of the shootout incident, contending it constituted a retrial of the 2012 case. The trial court accepted the State's contention that playing the recording provided probative value distinct from the prior testimony by officers at the scene. But the court thereafter paused the recording when it played Garcia screaming as police entered the house, and the trial court stated to counsel, \"[w]e're stepping up to the line of unfairly prejudicial at this point.\" When the court asked the State to explain the probative value of the remaining portion of the recording, the prosecution reasoned that it \"[c]aptures the crime that [Champagne] committed\" and \"essentially shows his demeanor as he continues to shoot at the police as they continue to advance.\" The trial court decided to preclude the remainder of the recording and found, \"we have reached the moment where it is unfairly prejudicial to continue to hear Ms. Garcia simply scream in agony during this incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6100 The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recording because it provided\n   factual details of the prior crime and Champagne's character in a way unique from testimony a witness could provide. And even if the court abused its discretion in admitting the recording, it was not unduly prejudicial because the court stopped playing the recording when continuing to play it would have become unfairly prejudicial, and because it was admitted by stipulation and thus could be considered by the jury regardless of whether it was played in open court. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the portion of the recording that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6101 Therefore, contrary to Champagne's arguments, the trial court's admission of the State's mitigation rebuttal did not allow a rehashing of the guilt and aggravation phases. Rather, the evidence rebutted the thrust of Champagne's mitigation evidence and was relevant to his character, propensities, and criminal record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Victim Impact Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6102 Champagne contends that the trial court erred in allowing Hoffner's adopted brother and sister to present victim impact statements because they are not \"victim's family.\" According to Champagne, because Hoffner's siblings were adopted, \"they were not statutory victims\" under \u00a7 13-752(S)(2) and their impact statements were impermissible. We review for abuse of discretion a trial court's admission of victim impact evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Victims are permitted to provide information during the penalty phase about the murdered person and the impact of the murder on the victim's family. \u00a7 13-752(R). Victim is defined as \"the murdered person's spouse, parent, child, grandparent or\n   <em>\n    sibling\n   </em>\n   , any other person related to the murdered person by consanguinity or affinity to the second degree or any other lawful representative of the murdered person.\" \u00a7 13-752(S)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6104 Adopted siblings are clearly \"victims\" under the statute, and Champagne's argument that adopted siblings are not \"statutory victims\" belies the plain meaning of the statute and would result in absurd consequences. The statute does not limit \"siblings\" to blood siblings, and indeed expressly includes relatives by affinity (marriage). Champagne did not raise this spurious argument at trial and he offers no authority to support it now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    J.

Evidence presented during the aggravation phase overwhelmingly established that Champagne was convicted of numerous felonies satisfying the (F)(2) aggravator, including his second-degree murder conviction for the 1991 murder and his convictions for the attempted\n   first-degree murder and aggravated assault of twenty-four police officers for the 2012 shootout case. Similarly, reasonable evidence supported the jury's convicting Champagne of the second-degree murder of Tapaha and thus the jury's finding of the (F)(8) aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6107 Moreover, the State presented reasonable evidence to sustain the jury's finding that Champagne murdered Hoffner in an especially cruel manner, satisfying the (F)(6) aggravator. Hoffner witnessed Champagne murder her boyfriend, Tapaha, when Champagne shot him in the head, placing her in apprehension of her own possible demise. Immediately thereafter, Champagne, holding a gun, led her into the bedroom and gave her methamphetamine. Champagne left Hoffner in the bedroom with Garcia, who was positioned in front of the doorway with a gun in her lap. Champagne quickly returned and strangled Hoffner with an electrical cord. Hoffner unquestionably suffered mental anguish about her own fate while being strangled so shortly after seeing her boyfriend killed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The thrust of Champagne's mitigation evidence was related to his dysfunctional family, but the State's proffered evidence showing that his mother was loving and supportive tended to rebut his claims that he was an unloved and neglected child. Moreover, the jury reasonably could have given little weight to the impact of his allegedly tumultuous family situation because he was nearly forty-one years old when he murdered Hoffner.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.
