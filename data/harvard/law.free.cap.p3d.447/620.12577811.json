Franz (collectively DNR), and Columbia Riverkeeper, Washington Environmental Council, and Sierra Club (collectively Intervenors) appeal the superior court's order concluding that DNR acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying Northwest Alloys, Inc.'s (NWA) consent to sublease state-owned aquatic lands to Millennium Bulk Terminals-Longview, LLC (Millennium). DNR and Intervenors argue that DNR's decision to deny consent to sublease was not arbitrary and capricious due to NWA's refusal to provide requested financial information about Millennium and DNR's legitimate concerns about Millennium's financial condition and business reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 NWA and Millennium cross-appeal and argue that the superior court applied the incorrect standard of review. NWA and Millennium contend that under RCW 79.02.030, the superior court should review de novo DNR's denial of consent to sublease by applying the \"reasonably prudent person\" test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We agree with DNR and Intervenors, and reverse and vacate the superior court's orders, and order the superior court to issue a new order affirming DNR's denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. HISTORY OF THE SITE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Reynolds Metals Company, which was owned by Alcoa Corporation, owned property adjacent to the Columbia River navigation channel in Longview. In 2004, Chinook Ventures, Inc. purchased a smelter located on the property and entered into a long-term ground lease with Reynolds. In 2005, Alcoa transferred the property from Reynolds to another of its subsidiaries, NWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Alcoa-most recently through NWA-leased the state-owned aquatic lands adjacent to the property from DNR. NWA used the dock and associated infrastructure on the aquatic lands for shipping alumina to Alcoa's Wenatchee Works smelter in eastern Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2008, DNR renewed its aquatic lands lease with NWA for an additional 30-year term. Under the terms of the lease, NWA could not sublease the property without the written consent of DNR, which DNR could not unreasonably withhold. The lease provided that in considering whether to consent to a sublease, DNR could consider, among other items, \"the proposed transferee's financial condition, business reputation and experience, the nature of the proposed transferee's business, the then-current value of the [p]roperty, and such other factors as may reasonably bear upon the suitability of the transferee as a tenant of the [p]roperty.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) 16890.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 After renewing its lease with DNR, NWA subleased the aquatic lands to Chinook with DNR's consent. Chinook imported alumina as an operator for NWA, and also used the property to store petroleum coke and transfer it onto ships at the dock. During its subtenancy, Chinook failed to obtain the required state and local regulatory permits\n   for its petroleum coke business and failed to provide adequate environmental controls. Chinook built improvements such as a remodeled ship loader and overwater conveyor system without obtaining the required permits or authorization under the lease. Chinook amassed a significant number of environmental violations issued by the Department of Ecology, received a stop work order from Cowlitz County, received a notice of violation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, exacerbated environmental concerns at the site, and put NWA in default of its lease with DNR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. MILLENNIUM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 In the fall of 2010, while still in default of the lease, NWA sought DNR's consent to sublease the property to Millennium. Millennium was a limited liability company organized in 2010 for the purpose of acquiring Chinook's assets, leasing the smelter property, and subleasing the aquatic lands. Millennium's purported plan was to continue the alumina handling operations at the site using the existing equipment and planned upgrades. Millennium's undisclosed long-term objective, however, was to construct a large coal export terminal on the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 According to the original permit application from Millennium's corporate parent, a subsidiary of Ambre Energy Inc. (Ambre), the terminal project would allow coal handling and exportation of 5.2 million metric tons of coal per year. A State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   determination for the original permit application resulted in a mitigated determination of nonsignificance finding, meaning that a full environmental impact study was not required. However, internal Ambre documents later revealed that Millennium intentionally concealed the extent of its plans for the coal export facility in order to avoid full environmental review. After Millennium's deception made national and local news, Millennium withdrew its terminal proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In early 2012, Millennium filed a revised permit application, this time disclosing the full scope of its plans for facilities on the property. Millennium sought to build, operate, and maintain the largest coal export terminal on the west coast, exporting 44 million metric tons of coal per year. Millennium planned to add two large docks to the property. Operating the docks would have required significant new dredging of the aquatic lands within and outside of the geographical areas covered by the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III. FINANCIAL CONCERNS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 During a severe coal market downturn in late 2014, Ambre sold its North American assets-including a 62 percent ownership stake in Millennium-to a creditor, Lighthouse Resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 In late 2015, Alcoa announced it would curtail production at Wenatchee Works. Wenatchee Works had used the Longview dock leased by NWA to import alumina. Following the suspension of production at Wenatchee Works, the dock was not in use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Due to continued poor coal market conditions, several United States coal producers filed for bankruptcy in 2016. Arch Coal, Inc., which owned 38 percent of Millennium, declared bankruptcy in early 2016. As part of its bankruptcy, Arch Coal sold its interest in Millennium to Lighthouse Resources, Millennium's only remaining corporate parent. In return for its interest in Millennium, Arch Coal received only a release of its obligation to provide capital support of Millennium's projects. Arch Coal stated that the capital contributions Millennium needed from Arch Coal to stay afloat were so significant that Arch Coal's entire ownership share in Millennium, which it valued at nearly $38 million, would have been completely drawn down in a matter of weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   IV. NEGOTIATIONS &amp; DNR'S REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 On November 18, 2010, shortly after NWA sought DNR's consent to sublease to Millennium, DNR requested information about Millennium from NWA, including at a minimum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The financial condition of Millennium Bulk Logistics, Inc., including the extent of\n   its assets, to help DNR determine whether it has the financial wherewithal to comply with the terms of the lease-especially in terms of abiding by requirements related to authorized improvements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. The business reputation and experience of Millennium Bulk Logistics, Inc., and if this Incorporation has been formed just to operate this site, the business reputation of any of its affiliates, owners, or partners. DNR would like to understand the history of this company and any of its individual owners in terms of the conduct of their business(es) and whether they have any history of causing environmental damage or failing to comply with applicable law and regulatory requirements. As a steward of state-owned aquatic lands and responsible for this site, DNR would like to understand that the new proposed sublessee will be able to perform its obligations under the lease that relate to site stewardship and otherwise. Please inform us of each of the owners of the Incorporation and their experience with site uses such as the one proposed for the sublease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. Any information that you can provide that will inform us of site operating protocols that will protect state-owned aquatic lands from the release of hazardous substances and that will provide environmental protection. If Millennium or any of its partners has experience with the types of systems that would be put in use at the Longview site, please describe what controls are in place to prevent harm to the aquatic environment in which the facility would exist, and how upland operations may affect state-owned aquatic lands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CP at 17023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 Four days later, Millennium responded to DNR and explained that Millennium was a LLC organized for the sole purpose of the Longview site project and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ambre. Millennium directed DNR to Ambre's website to review Ambre's annual reports and noted that, at closing, Millennium planned to post a $10 million irrevocable standby letter of credit to NWA to provide security for Millennium's lease commitments. Millennium also provided a follow-up letter summarizing the assets devoted to the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 On November 29, 2010, DNR clarified that the information Millennium had provided did not fully satisfy DNR's requests. Millennium resisted DNR's requests, stating that \"the thought that Millennium has to demonstrate financial capability to DNR is misplaced. Certainly, DNR can make reasonable inquiry into the sublease and its plans. However, the obligations of Millennium flow to Northwest Alloys, Inc., the tenant.\" CP at 337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 16 After Millennium's full plan for the coal terminal came to light in early 2011, DNR informed Millennium and NWA that it would not make a decision on the request for consent to sublease until the related shoreline permit and SEPA processes were resolved and until the companies obtained the permits required for any and all planned improvements. DNR explained that NWA's and Millennium's inconsistencies regarding the scope of the proposed coal project made evaluating the proposed sublease difficult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17 By late 2015, DNR's, NWA's, and Millennium's negotiations appeared to be in their final stages. On December 14, 2015, DNR suggested two revisions to the consent to sublease, which NWA and Millennium accepted. NWA and Millennium replied, \"From our standpoint, we believe these document[s] now to be final, and that all we need to do is 'accept' the changes in both and route for signature.\" CP at 1512.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 However, after Arch Coal's bankruptcy in January, DNR sent a letter dated February 3, 2016, to NWA explaining that DNR needed additional information to complete its review of the request for consent to sublease. DNR emphasized its concern about Arch Coal's bankruptcy and the potential impact on Millennium's financial capability.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The financial capability of Millennium to perform is critical. As the conditions on the leased property and adjoining uplands resulting from the operations of [NWA's] previous subtenant Chinook Ventures demonstrate, when a subtenant in possession of the property lacks the wherewithal to maintain the property and comply with other lease requirements, it may cause significant\n   damage to the property and improvements that takes substantial amounts of time and resources to address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CP at 1539.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 DNR also questioned Alcoa's recent decision to shutter the Wenatchee Works operation and how that would impact NWA's and Millennium's plans for using the Longview property. DNR requested that NWA provide audited financial statements from Millennium, all documents related to Millennium filed in Arch Coal's bankruptcy case, a statement indicating whether Arch Coal would make any disclosures in its bankruptcy proceeding related to the sublease between NWA and Millennium, and a statement from Millennium regarding its plans for using the existing dock on the property. Millennium responded that the financial statements DNR sought were confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 After the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Arch Coal's ownership interest in Millennium in June 2016, DNR sent another letter to Alcoa, expressing concerns about Millennium's obligations to NWA. DNR noted that as a result of Arch Coal's sale, Lighthouse Resources had become the sole owner of Millennium. DNR explained, \"Given the difficult market conditions in the coal industry and the fact that [Lighthouse Resources] now has the sole financial responsibility for Millennium, DNR seeks assurance that Millennium has the financial capability to meet its significant ongoing financial obligations and comply with the requirements of [NWA's] lease with DNR.\" CP at 1741.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 To assist its evaluation of Millennium's financial condition, DNR requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, prepared in accordance with GAAP Accounting Standards[ ] that accurately states the current assets, liabilities, and capital of [Millennium] and its income and cash flow for the year ending June 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A copy of the January 1, 2011 Lease between [NWA] and [Millennium] for the uplands adjacent to [NWA] leasehold under its lease with DNR and the June 5, 2104 amendment to the lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A copy of Millennium's business plan for the existing dock on [NWA's] leasehold that identifies the income that Millennium expects to receive from operations on the existing dock and the sources of income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Any additional information which [NWA] can provide to shed light on the financial condition of Millennium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CP at 1742. NWA did not respond to this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   V. INVOLVEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 22 A group of environmental non-profit organizations contacted state and county regulatory agencies including DNR in October 2010, expressing their concerns about the development of a large coal terminal on the aquatic lands. The groups reiterated their concerns to DNR in November 2010, and requested a meeting with the Commissioner of Public Lands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 23 On March 16, 2011, the environmental groups sent a letter to the Commissioner regarding Millennium's business reputation based on Millennium's strategy to conceal their long-term plans for the property in an attempt to evade SEPA review. The groups attached several documents that they had obtained regarding Millennium. The letter urged DNR to consider Millennium's deceitful practices when evaluating Millennium's business reputation under the terms of the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 24 On January 25, 2016, as DNR, NWA, and Millennium were finalizing the documents for DNR's consent to sublease the aquatic lands, the environmental groups sent DNR a memo \"to lay out some of the facts and legal considerations attendant to DNR's pending decision.\" CP at 1532. The memo urged DNR to deny consent to sublease based on Millennium's weak financial condition, the international coal market's dismal economics, and Millennium and its parent company's poor business reputation and lack of experience managing a coal terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   VI. DNR DENIES CONSENT TO SUBLEASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 25 On January 5, 2017, the Commissioner of Public Lands issued a letter denying DNR's consent to sublease the aquatic lands to Millennium. The letter explained, \"DNR's decision is based on Northwest Alloys' failure\n   to provide requested information regarding the financial condition and business of Millennium as well as other factors that bear on the suitability of Millennium as a subtenant.\" CP at 16855. The denial letter highlighted DNR's concern about Millennium's financial condition given the bankruptcy of Arch Coal, Wenatchee Works' indefinite closure, coal's historically poor market conditions, and Millennium's commitments to NWA under the ground lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 26 The denial letter noted, \"As the steward of Washington's state-owned aquatic lands, the financial capacity of a subtenant to perform is important to DNR.\" CP at 16856. Referencing Chinook's damage to the property during its subtenancy, the letter explained, \"The recent history under the lease supports the need for careful examination of the capacity of subtenants at the site to comply with lease obligations.\" CP at 16856.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 27 The denial letter also referenced Millennium's \"significant error\" in failing to disclose in its original permit application its plans to significantly increase the amount of coal shipped from the facility. CP at 16857. \"That Millennium does not have a lengthy track record on which to judge performance and in its short history has made a significant error with respect to its planned activities on the leased property supports the need for a thorough review of Millennium's potential suitability as a subtenant, including its financial condition.\" CP at 16857.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28 The denial letter concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [NWA] has failed to provide information reasonably requested by DNR as permitted under the lease for review of [NWA's] request for consent to sublease. As detailed above, DNR's requests for information are supported by the bankruptcy of Arch Coal; Millennium's commitments to [NWA]; market conditions facing Millennium's sole remaining owner, [Lighthouse Resources]; the history of subleasing under the lease; and the absence of a significant track record supporting Millennium. Accordingly, [NWA's] request for consent to sublease has been denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CP at 16857.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   VII. SUPERIOR COURT PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 29 NWA and Millennium appealed the Commissioner's letter denying DNR's consent to sublease to the superior court under RCW 79.02.030. The superior court granted Columbia Riverkeeper, Washington Environmental Council, and Sierra Club's motion to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 30 After extensive briefing and argument, the superior court entered an order on the merits of whether DNR's decision to deny consent to sublease was unreasonable. The superior court concluded that in considering the request to sublease, DNR was performing an administrative proprietary function, not a quasi-judicial function. Accordingly, the superior court concluded that the proper standard of review in the matter was whether DNR's actions were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 31 Addressing the reasonableness of DNR's decision, the superior court concluded that it must consider the unique statutory mandates that apply to DNR and evaluate DNR's denial from the standpoint of a reasonable landlord in DNR's position. The superior court concluded that DNR's reasons for denying consent to sublease were not supported by facts and that DNR's denial was arbitrary and capricious. As a remedy, the superior court ordered DNR to \"undertake further consideration\" of NWA's request for consent to sublease to Millennium. CP at 17815.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 32 DNR and Intervenors appeal and NWA and Millennium cross-appeal the superior court's orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 33 The parties disagree as to our standard of review. DNR and Intervenors contend that we sit in the same position as the trial court and conduct a de novo review of the agency record to determine whether DNR's consent to sublease was unreasonable. NWA and Millennium argue that we should review the superior court's findings for substantial evidence and determine de novo whether the superior court's conclusions\n   flow from those findings. We agree with DNR and Intervenors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 34 RCW 79.02.030 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Any applicant to purchase, or lease, any public lands of the state ... and any person whose property rights or interests will be affected by such sale or lease, feeling aggrieved by any order or decision of the ... commissioner, concerning the same, may appeal therefrom to the superior court of the county in which such lands or materials are situated .... The hearing and trial of said appeal in the superior court shall be de novo before the court, without a jury, upon the pleadings and papers so certified ....

NWA and Millennium contend this is so because \"[c]ontracts fix the parties' obligations to one another and eliminate the discretion inherent when an agency is exercising its regulatory authority.\" Response Br. at 44. It is undisputed that DNR is beholden to the terms of its lease with NWA and that, pursuant to the lease, DNR could not unreasonably withhold its consent. However, DNR cannot contract itself out of its statutorily mandated duty to exercise discretion in furtherance of the public trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 43 Nothing in the lease purports to extinguish DNR's statutory authority to exercise its discretion to approve a sublease, so long as it does not unreasonably withhold consent. Indeed, RCW 79.105.210(4) states, \"The power to lease state-owned aquatic lands is vested in the department, which has the authority to make leases upon terms, conditions, and length of time\n   <em>\n    in conformance with\n   </em>\n   the state Constitution and chapters 79.105 through 79.140 RCW.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 44 It follows that the courts could not constitutionally make a sublease determination in the first instance. Nor have courts historically managed aquatic lands held in public trust because that is a function DNR performs.

That approval cannot be unreasonably withheld. The lease expressly authorizes DNR to consider, among other things, \"the proposed transferee's financial condition, business reputation and experience, the nature of the proposed transferee's business, the then-current value of the [p]roperty, and such other factors as may reasonably bear upon the suitability of the transferee as a tenant of the [p]roperty.\" CP at 16890. Because DNR reasonably considered the factors identified in the lease in light of attending facts and circumstances, its decision was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 49 DNR's careful consideration of Millennium's financial condition and business reputation was especially reasonable given the circumstances surrounding the potential sublease. At the time DNR made its decision, coal market conditions were not promising, with U.S. coal production dropping. DNR had concerns because of the recent shuttering of Wenatchee Works, the primary importer of the alumina unloaded at the dock leased by NWA. Finally, additional financial concerns existed after Millennium's corporate parent, Ambre Energy, sold its interest in Millennium, and Millennium's other corporate parent, Arch Coal, filed bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 50 DNR was also acutely aware of the damage a negligent subtenant could inflict on the sensitive aquatic lands, given its recent negative experience with NWA's prior subtenant, Chinook. Millennium had intentionally misrepresented the scope of its plans for the property in 2011. Millennium sought to build, operate, and maintain the largest coal export terminal on the west coast. Such a project posed significant financial demands and high environmental risks if Millennium followed in the previous subtenant's footsteps with lax oversight from NWA. Accordingly, DNR had significant, well founded reasons for carefully considering the financial condition and business reputation of Millennium before consenting to sublease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 51 NWA and Millennium do not dispute that a landlord has an interest in a subtenant's financial condition. However, NWA and Millennium make several arguments in support of their position that DNR's denial of consent was unreasonable. First, they argue that because NWA would remain liable under the lease for any default by Millennium, DNR was necessarily unreasonable in denying consent. We reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 52 Section 9.1 of the lease expressly authorizes DNR to consider a potential subtenant's financial consideration in determining whether to grant consent. Accepting NWA's argument would mean rendering section 9.1 meaningless. And we must construe contract language in a manner that gives effect to the words used and does not render the chosen language meaningless.\n   <em>\n    MacLean Townhomes, LLC v. Am. 1st Roofing &amp; Builders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4105477\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/133/828/#p831\">\n    133 Wash. App. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=138%20P.3d%20155\">\n    138 P.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Under NWA's argument, DNR's right to grant or deny consent to sublease would be reduced to mere ritual because under section 9.1(c) of the lease NWA would always remain liable under the lease in the event of a default by a subtenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 53 The fact that the tenant remains liable under the lease is less significant where, as here, a subtenant's actions have the potential to significantly impact sensitive public lands. As seen in the situation with Chinook, the fact that NWA would remain liable for Millennium's default under the lease does not remove the risk of long-term damage to a sensitive public resource, which DNR has been charged with managing in the public trust. NWA's liability under the lease would not prevent such damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 54 Second, NWA and Millennium argue that DNR's denial of consent was unreasonable because the financial documents DNR requested were irrelevant. NWA and Millennium explain that Millennium's financial statements would \"only have shown what DNR already knew,\" namely that Millennium had no positive revenues to cover its operating expenses and that it relied on regular infusions of cash from its parent company. Response Br. at 28, 31. NWA and Millennium further argue that the ground lease between NWA and Millennium had no relevancy to DNR because DNR was not a party to that lease and Millennium's obligations to NWA were otherwise secured by a $10 million letter of credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 55 But as noted above, the lease expressly stated that in considering whether to grant consent to sublease, DNR could consider \"the proposed transferee's financial condition\" as well as \"such other factors as may reasonably bear upon the suitability of the transferee as a tenant of the [p]roperty.\" CP at 16890. Therefore, the lease language supported DNR's requests for information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 56 In addition, the fact that Millennium's financial statements would have confirmed DNR's suspicions that Millennium's financial condition remained precarious does not render the financial statements irrelevant. Millennium's financial statements would have\n   shown Millennium's assets, liabilities, income, and cash flow, all of which were relevant, critical considerations in assessing Millennium's financial condition. Even if Millennium relied entirely on its parent company for operating income, the financial statements would have shown DNR how much the parent company was regularly investing and how Millennium used those investments. This information was especially relevant given the disclosures in Arch Coal's bankruptcy proceedings that its entire ownership share in Millennium, which it valued at nearly $38 million at the time of bankruptcy, would be eliminated within a matter of weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 57 Third, NWA and Millennium argue that, given what DNR already knew about Millennium, DNR should have requested information on Millennium's parent company's financial condition. But because Millennium's parent company would have no legal obligation to DNR, its financial condition was of little value in alleviating DNR's concerns about Millennium's ability to manage its obligations, particularly in light of the recent restructuring of its corporate ownership following Arch Coal's bankruptcy and Ambre Energy's sale of its ownership stake. And DNR's requests for information from Millennium were not so narrow as to preclude Millennium from providing financial information it believed would be helpful to DNR in understanding Millennium's financial condition. Millennium knew what DNR's concerns were; Millennium could have provided its parent company's information if it believed it would be helpful in answering DNR's inquiry. Instead, NWA refused to respond at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 58 Fourth, NWA and Millennium suggest that DNR acted arbitrarily and capriciously by considering Millennium's earlier failure to disclose its long-term plans for the coal terminal in determining whether to consent to sublease. They argue that DNR's willingness to negotiate a nearly-finalized sublease agreement with Millennium in 2015 undercuts DNR's contention that Millennium's failure to fully disclose its plans for the property was a contributing factor to its ultimate decision to deny consent. But the lease expressly authorized DNR to consider Millennium's business reputation in considering whether to grant consent to sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 59 Further, DNR's decision to not reject all consideration of a sublease agreement with Millennium after Millennium's deception came to light in 2011 did not prohibit DNR from weighing that deception as it evaluated Millennium's business reputation. Millennium's history remained part of the context in which DNR ultimately determined whether Millennium would be a suitable subtenant for the aquatic lands. Thus, considering Millennium's business reputation, as expressly permitted by the lease, was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 60 In conclusion, DNR's consideration of Millennium's financial condition and business reputation was expressly authorized under the lease. And the additional information DNR sought from Millennium, which Millennium failed to provide, was relevant to DNR's inquiry. Accordingly, we conclude that DNR's denial of consent to sublease was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 61 We reverse the superior court's order concluding that DNR acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying NWA consent to sublease state-owned aquatic lands to Millennium, and we vacate the superior court's remedy order, and order the superior court to issue a new order affirming DNR's denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Maxa, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Melnick, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    NWA and Millennium also cross-appeal the superior court's remedy order, which remanded the sublease decision back to DNR for further consideration.
