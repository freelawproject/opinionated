The District Court sentenced Laird to incarceration for 100 years with no time suspended. Laird appeals. He raises three issues, which we restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Did the fifteen-year preaccusation delay unconstitutionally prejudice Laird?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2. Did the State present sufficient evidence in its case-in-chief to overcome Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting statements a forensic pathologist made while he performed the autopsy when he was unavailable to testify at trial?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 We conclude the fifteen-year preaccusation delay did not unconstitutionally prejudice Laird and determine the State presented sufficient evidence in its case-in-chief to overcome Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. We further conclude, however, that the District Court abused its discretion by admitting the unavailable pathologist's statements. We therefore reverse this case on issue three and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In the early-morning hours of July 31, 1999, Kathryn Laird drowned in the afterbay area of the Yellowtail Dam of the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. The circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death were suspicious, and a criminal investigation ensued. Fifteen years later, in September 2014, the State charged Kathryn's husband, Laird, with deliberate homicide for Kathryn's death. Following a one-week trial, a jury found Laird guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Kathryn grew up in Texas, where she and her siblings spent many hours swimming in their backyard pool. She had extremely poor eyesight and could not see without her glasses or contact lenses. Kathryn met Laird in college and they eventually married in February 1999. Kathryn had a dog, Ralphie, who she adored. In July 1999, the couple lived in a trailer park in Fort Smith, Montana, near the afterbay area of the Yellowtail Dam. A walking trail ran from the\n   trailer park down to the afterbay area. Laird worked as lawyer in Billings and also worked as a fishing guide out of Fort Smith. Kathryn worked multiple jobs in the Fort Smith area. In the mornings, she worked with Greg Heidrich (Heidrich) at Quill Gordon's, a fly and tackle shop, where she set out a continental breakfast for fishing guests. In the evenings, she worked for Tanya Warren (Warren) at Bighorn River Country Lodge, a fishing lodge, where she provided the guests' dinner. Kathryn also periodically drove shuttles for fishing guests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 During its case-in-chief, the State questioned numerous witnesses who testified that Kathryn was unhappy in the days leading up to her death and that Laird and Kathryn argued throughout the day on July 30, 1999. A few days before Kathryn died, she spoke with her mother, Mary Lou, on the phone. Kathryn was upset and crying during their conversation. Kathryn also spoke with her brother around that time, and she was distraught and crying during their conversation as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In the afternoon on July 30, 1999, Don Lyman (Lyman) saw the Lairds arguing outside of their trailer home. Laird chased Kathryn around the yard, smacked her in the head with a plastic bag filled with cookies, and repeatedly said something along the lines of, \"You bitch, you burnt my fucking cookies.\" Later that day while Kathryn was at work, Warren, Kathryn's boss at her evening job, observed a second heated conversation between Laird and Kathryn. Warren's husband eventually asked Laird to leave; Laird complied. Kathryn worked late that night, leaving after 11:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Kathleen and Eric Anderson (the Andersons) spent their weekends recreating on the water around Fort Smith. When they were in town, the Andersons stayed in a camper that was parked on a lot near the Lairds' trailer and near the walking trail that ran from the afterbay to the trailer park. They overheard the Lairds arguing over the course of several weekends before Kathryn's death. Kathleen took a shower close to midnight\n   on July 30, 1999, and could clearly hear the couple arguing in raised voices through the vent in the shower ceiling. A male voice stated, \"You fucking bitch,\" over and over again, while a crying female voice repeated, \"No, no, no.\" The argument went on the entire time Kathleen was in the shower, but then suddenly completely stopped. Eric also heard the Lairds arguing that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Shortly after the argument ended, the Andersons heard a vehicle start. They looked outside and saw a person slowly driving the Lairds' white SUV, known by most to be Kathryn's car, by their camper and out of the neighborhood. Kathleen observed that the driver was a man. Eric assumed the driver was male because the person driving was\n   large. Thankful it would finally be quiet because the man had driven away, the Andersons went to sleep. However, between 45 minutes and an hour later, the Andersons' daughter's dog, which was tied up outside, started barking loudly and became very upset. There was an open area between where the dog was tethered and the walking path that led down to the afterbay, and the dog was barking in the open area's direction. The dog was known to be very aggressive towards males, even male members of the Andersons' family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Laird did not testify at trial, but a few years after Kathryn died, Laird applied to practice law in Missouri. The Missouri Board of Law Examiners (Board) questioned Laird about the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death. Laird answered the questions under oath and, accordingly, the State read the transcript from that questioning into evidence at trial. When asked whether he and Kathryn verbally argued during their marriage, Laird told the Board that Kathryn was \"argumentative during her premenstrual time.\" Laird classified their disagreements as Kathryn being argumentative with him, not the other way around, and further testified that they never had any physical confrontations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Laird explained the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death, specifically his perception of the events on the night of July 30, 1999, to the Board. He was supposed to go to Billings the next morning to do law work and wanted to get rest before making that trip. Kathryn came home from work later than normal that evening and the two got into a discussion around 11:30 p.m. It was \"during her premenstrual period\" so \"she was very tired and very grouchy.\" Laird told Kathryn that she should quit her morning job, because the money she made was not worth her having to wake up so early, at 4:30 or 5:00 a.m., and being so tried. Kathryn \"wanted to argue\" about her morning job and \"things in general,\" but Laird wanted to go to sleep. The two argued for ten or fifteen minutes, Laird \"refused to have an argument because it was a small point and it was late at night and [he] had to go to Billings\" the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Before the couple moved to Fort Smith, Laird would sleep in his car near the afterbay if he had to guide the next day. To avoid the argument that night, Laird got in his car, drove to that spot near the afterbay, and went to sleep. He awoke to Kathryn knocking on his car window; she was \"furious\" Laird decided to go sleep in his car. He told her to let him go back to sleep, but she refused, saying that she wanted to fight. They eventually agreed to not fight and to go back to the trailer together. They each drove a car back to the trailer; Laird arrived first and went to bed. Kathryn got to the trailer about twenty\n   minutes later, and was \"going all around\" the trailer, slamming drawers. Laird told Kathryn to calm down and asked her what the problem was. She was very upset, would not say what was wrong, and kept slamming things around and digging through drawers. She was acting \"like a mad woman\"; Laird told her to settle down. Kathryn suddenly stormed out of the trailer, telling Laird to \"take care of Ralphie.\" Laird fell asleep; he assumed Kathryn had cooled off and then come home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The next morning, July 31, 1999, Kathryn did not show up for work at Quill Gordon's. Heidrich, Kathryn's co-worker, called the Lairds' trailer looking for Kathryn. The phone rang, but no one answered it. Heidrich waited a few minutes and called a second time. Laird groggily answered. Heidrich asked if something was wrong with Kathryn, Laird replied, \"No, she's at work,\" and\n   Heidrich responded that she was not. Heidrich called his girlfriend, asked for her help setting out breakfast, and briefly left work to go pick her up. As he drove back to work around 6:30 or 7:00 a.m., he saw Laird driving away from the afterbay towards his trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Warren was in bed sleeping that morning, when a knock at the door awakened her. By the time she got out of bed, Laird was already standing in the kitchen. Laird asked Warren if Kathryn was there, and Warren responded that she was not. Laird angrily reported that Kathryn's morning job had called and said she did not show up, so he was looking for her. Laird left immediately after speaking with Warren, and Warren began to prepare breakfast for the fishing guests. Warren became worried, however, and called Laird to see if he had found Kathryn. He had not, but said he had gone down to the afterbay and that Kathryn's car was parked there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Warren finished serving breakfast and called Laird for an update. He reported that Kathryn was still missing. Warren decided to go look for Kathryn and drove to the Lairds' trailer, where she found Laird sitting in the rocking chair on the porch. Laird reported that when Kathryn got home the night before, she took a shower and then initiated an argument with him. Laird told Warren a similar version of events that he later told the Board: that he did not want to argue with Kathryn and, therefore, went to the afterbay to sleep in his car. Kathryn followed him to the afterbay; the two eventually went home, where the argument continued. Laird reported that Kathryn eventually said, \"I'm going to kill myself, take care of Ralphie,\" and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Warren got in Laird's car, and the two began to search for Kathryn. Laird drove to Kathryn's car in the afterbay parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Warren got out of Laird's car, approached Kathryn's car, opened the door, and noticed Kathryn's purse and keys were in the car. After looking in Kathryn's car, Warren went back to Laird's car and asked him if he was going to get out and help her look for Kathryn. Laird got out of his car and walked around, slowly dragging his feet and not putting much effort into any type of search. They decided to go look elsewhere, and when Warren asked Laird if they should lock Kathryn's car to protect Kathryn's purse, Laird replied that they should not, because then Kathryn would not be able to access the vehicle. Laird did, however, take his fishing rods out of Kathryn's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 The two left the parking lot and Laird drove them around while they looked for Kathryn. They got out of the car again at a different parking area, where Warren loudly yelled Kathryn's name, while Laird shuffled around and repeated Kathryn's name quietly. They eventually went back to Laird's trailer, where Laird called 911 at Warren's insistence. Warren later described Laird as angry and worried. Warren also noticed that all of the photographs had been turned down at the trailer. After Laird called 911, Warren left the trailer and proceeded to ask various people if they had seen Kathryn-no one had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Warren began to think of all the places that she and Laird searched, and realized that they had not searched one parking area, the \"overflow\" parking lot near the afterbay. While driving over a bridge, Warren stopped her car to look over toward the overflow parking lot. From there, she could see something floating on the water's surface. It looked like some sort of air bubble from that distance. Warren then drove down to the overflow parking lot, where she could see that it was Kathryn's body floating in the water, face down. Realizing Kathryn was floating face down and therefore no longer alive, Warren drove to her friend's home and asked her to call 911. Dispatch said Officer Morrison was already at the Lairds' trailer, so Warren drove over there. Ranger Bredow also responded to Laird's emergency call, and she arrived at the Lairds' trailer just after Warren. When Warren arrived, she said that she found Kathryn in the water near the overflow parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Laird jumped into his car and raced off. Warren followed in her own car, as did Officer Morrison and Ranger Bredow. Laird arrived at the overflow parking lot first and pulled Kathryn's body partially out of the water onto her back. That area of the afterbay was shallow and the shoreline was rocky.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Laird was wailing and crying over Kathryn's body-officers had to physically remove him from Kathryn's body. Kathryn was wearing gray sweatpants, which were at the bikini line in front and exposing half of her buttocks in back. She was wearing a\n   bra and a button-up shirt, with only one or two buttons buttoned at the top. She also had on earrings, a ring, and a wristwatch. Kathryn was not wearing shoes, socks, contact lenses, or glasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 FBI Agent Jackson arrived at the scene and noticed there were a number of different law enforcement officers representing a variety of different agencies. The officers had an impromptu meeting to discuss the situation; Agent Jackson took an informal investigatory lead. Laird willingly spoke with Agent Jackson about the events that had transpired the night before. Laird told Agent Jackson the same story he told Warren and later told the Board: he and Kathryn argued when she got home from work around 11:30; he left to sleep in his car in the afterbay parking lot; he awoke when Kathryn showed up wanting to continue the argument; she drove away; he left as well, going home where he arrived before Kathryn; he laid down; Kathryn arrived about fifteen minutes later and made a lot of noise, wanting to argue more; Kathryn eventually left, slamming the door behind her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 Laird and Warren eventually left the overflow parking area in their own vehicles. Warren picked up one of her friends and they went to the Lairds' trailer to check on Laird. Laird was agitated and commented to Warren, \"I'm bad. I'm bad. I never should have left her.\" Warren stayed with Laird until his friend, Russell Renner (Renner), arrived. Awhile later, Warren and her husband drove Laird to the hospital in Hardin to help Laird calm down. They dropped Laird off at the hospital, went to the store, and returned to pick Laird up. Laird reported that there was not a doctor available to see him and that he did not want to wait for one. On the way back to Fort Smith, Laird asked to stop the car so he could use the restroom. When he got back into the car, he asked Warren and her husband, \"So, what do you guys think?\" Warren described Laird's demeanor as inquiring, matter-of-fact-he did not appear upset. They dropped Laird off at his trailer when they got back to Fort Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 That afternoon, Laird called Kathryn's mother, Mary Lou, and informed her that Kathryn died. Mary Lou and Kathryn's sister, Sheri, immediately booked airline tickets to Montana. They arrived in Billings at 2:00 a.m. on August 1, 1999 and went to Fort Smith in the morning. Laird's family also made their way to Fort Smith. Mary Lou and Sheri went to the Laird's trailer. Both women noticed a pair of jeans, wet from the knee down, hanging over the bathtub. They also noticed Laird's mother pick up a second pair of wet jeans from the hallway floor. Laird grabbed the jeans out of his mother's hands, angrily telling her to put the jeans down, that those were the jeans he was wearing when he pulled Kathryn's body from the water. Mary Lou\n   learned Laird planned to cremate Kathryn, but asked if he would let her take Kathryn's body back to Texas for a funeral. Laird angrily insisted on cremation, but Mary Lou hired an attorney to prevent as much, knowing Kathryn would not have wanted to be cremated. The family eventually held a funeral service in Texas, where Kathryn's family laid her to rest. Laird left Montana a few days after Kathryn's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 The county coroner, Terry Bullis (Bullis), also responded to the overflow parking lot shortly after Kathryn's body was found. Bullis transported Kathryn's body to the mortuary in Hardin and contacted Dr. Mueller, a forensic pathologist, to arrange an autopsy. Before Dr. Mueller performed an autopsy, Bullis drew Kathryn's blood for toxicology testing and embalmed her body. Bullis testified that embalming may cause bruises to become darker-more prominent-but will not cause them to appear larger. Bullis noticed bruises on Kathryn's hands, right thigh, arms, the top of her feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 On August 1, 1999, Dr. Mueller performed an autopsy on Kathryn's embalmed body. Bullis and Agent Jackson both attended the autopsy. Agent Jackson documented each photograph taken during the autopsy. Dr. Mueller observed bruises around Kathryn's neck he contemporaneously described as \"troubling.\" Dr. Mueller asked Dr. Bennett,\n   another forensic pathologist, to join him for a second autopsy later that day. Agent Jackson attended the second autopsy as well. Dr. Bennett also observed the bruises on Kathryn's neck. In his portion of the autopsy report, Dr. Bennett noted, \"Internally, the neck bruises overlaid prominent dark red-violet fresh bruising into both sternocleidal mastoid muscles, which in my opinion was clearly real and premortem.\" Dr. Bennett further noted the bruising \"appeared to be fresh,\" but decided to excise the bruised tissue for microscopic examination. Bullis filled out Kathryn's death certificate, on which he indicated that Kathryn's \"immediate cause\" of death was \"asphyxia by drowning\" and that her \"manner of death\" \"could not be determined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 Agent Jackson continued to investigate the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death, seeking information from any potential witnesses. Agent Jackson did not, however, speak with the Andersons (the Lairds' neighbors who heard the couple fighting on the night of July 30, 1999). On August 2, 1999, Agent Jackson and Assistant Chief Ranger Ryan executed a search warrant on Laird's trailer. Ranger Ryan recalled seeing a pair of wet-looking jeans in the hallway. Agent Jackson seized a pair of jeans that were hanging on the side of the bathtub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 On August 6, 1999, Agent Jackson received a note from Ranger\n   Ryan. The note read, in part, \"Josh Anderson, who works at [the marina], stated that his parents ( [Eric and Kathleen Anderson] ) heard an argument going on at Trailer #9 the night of July 30th. [The Andersons] live right across the alley on B Street in the Trailer Court.\" The note provided the Andersons' Fort Smith and out-of-town phone numbers. Agent Jackson enclosed the note in an envelope, and the envelope remained with the case file. Kathleen Anderson later testified she spoke about the Lairds' late-night July 30, 1999 argument with a male ranger during the day on July 31, 1999, but thereafter did not speak about Kathryn's death with any law enforcement officers until the summer of 2012. Eric Anderson testified he did not speak with any law enforcement officers about Kathryn's death until the summer of 2012. In 2004, Agent Jackson received a promotion and transferred to FBI headquarters. The case remained open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 In 2012, another FBI agent reviewed the case file and noticed Ranger Ryan's August 6, 1999 note about the Lairds' late-night argument the Andersons overheard. The agent interviewed the Andersons in the summer of 2012, and the case subsequently gained traction-the authorities had renewed reason to suspect Laird killed Kathryn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 In September 2012, the FBI contacted Mark Majerus (Majerus), a biologist who specialized in identifying grasses. Majerus examined the sweatpants Kathryn was wearing when her body was found in the afterbay. At trial, Majerus testified he found two species of grass on Kathryn's sweatpants: (1) needle and thread, and (2) cheatgrass. Majerus found some grass on the inside of the pants near the waistband. He explained that the tallest of the grasses grew to about 36 inches under ideal growing conditions. Majerus also explained that the pieces of grass on Kathryn's sweatpants included parts of the plants that do not simply fall off-those parts would have only come off if some sort of force was applied to the plants. In 2012, Majerus visited the overflow parking lot area of the afterbay where Kathryn's body was found. He observed needle and thread and cheatgrass on the slope between the parking lot and the water. Majerus opined that the vegetation in the area was likely very similar in 2012 to how it was in 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 After reviewing all of the case information and gathering the Andersons' statements and Majerus's grass studies, the State formally charged Laird with deliberate homicide in September 2014. Laird pleaded not guilty and the case moved towards trial. Before trial, Laird filed a motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay, arguing the fifteen-year delay between Kathryn's death and the official accusation\n   violated his due process rights. The District Court reserved its ruling on Laird's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b629 The State presented the testimony of seventeen witnesses during its case-in-chief: Mary Lou, Kathryn's mother; Sheri, Kathryn's sister; Thomas, Kathryn's brother; Lyman, who witnessed the argument between\n   Laird and Kathryn in the afternoon of July 30; Heidrich, Kathryn's co-worker who called Laird when Kathryn did not come to work on the morning of July 31; Warren, Kathryn's boss who witnessed an argument between Laird and Kathryn at work the night of July 30, searched for Kathryn with Laird on the morning of July 31, and found Kathryn's body; Eric and Kathleen Anderson, who heard the Lairds arguing on the night of July 30 and watched a large figure drive away in a white SUV; Officer Morrison, who first responded to Laird's 911 call and met Laird at the trailer; Ranger Ryan, responding and investigating ranger; Agent Jackson, FBI responder and lead investigator; Bullis, coroner; Majerus, botanist; and four other individuals who were familiar with Kathryn, the afterbay area, and/or the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b630 The State did not, however, present testimony from Dr. Mueller or Dr. Bennett, the forensic pathologists who performed the autopsies on Kathryn's body, during its case-in-chief. Dr. Mueller died before Laird's 2016 trial. The State did not call Dr. Bennett. The State claimed that, in 2012, investigators interviewed Dr. Bennett who recalled injuries to Kathryn's neck and opined that Kathryn was strangled and throttled. However, Dr. Bennett subsequently changed his opinion regarding Kathryn's injuries and, in 2016, observed one premortem injury to Kathryn's hand and no other incapacitating premortem injuries. The State attributed Dr. Bennett's change of opinion to the fact that, in 2015, the State of Montana stopped contracting with Dr. Bennett to perform its autopsy work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b631 Instead, the State introduced evidence of Dr. Mueller's autopsy and the appearance of Kathryn's postmortem body though the testimony of Bullis, Agent Jackson, and Kathryn's family members. The State sought to admit some statements Dr. Mueller made during the first autopsy through Agent Jackson. Agent Jackson explained the tone of Dr. Mueller's autopsy changed when Dr. Mueller observed the condition of Kathryn's neck. Agent Jackson testified that \"Dr. Mueller pointed to multiple areas of hemorrhaged blood in the muscles of Kathryn's neck and said, 'This is troubling.' He said it repeatedly.\" Laird objected to Agent Jackson's recitation of Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements on hearsay and confrontation grounds. The District Court overruled the objection, permitting Agent Jackson to testify about\n   Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements not for the truth of the matter they asserted-that the hemorrhaged blood in Kathryn's neck muscles was troubling-but instead for the limited purpose of explaining what Agent Jackson did next in his investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b632 When the Board questioned Laird about the circumstances regarding Kathryn's death, the Board and Laird discussed Dr. Mueller's autopsy findings. The District Court, accordingly, excluded portions of the conversation discussing Dr. Mueller's findings from the transcript it allowed the State to read at trial. The State, however, inadvertently read a portion of Dr. Mueller's findings to the jury: The forensic pathologist's \"opinion was Kathryn Laird died of asphyxia by drowning, she sustained a bruise to the left thumb at least several hours before her death, multiple scattered bruises to back and extremities around the time of death and recent unusual bruises of muscle of neck.\" Laird objected. The District Court instantaneously provided a curative jury instruction: \"[W]e've not had the testimony from any pathologist at this point and so that opinion is not properly before you and you are not to consider it....\" The State replied, \"I didn't see the line, Your Honor. Forgive me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b633 The State also sought to admit some photographs of the state of Kathryn's body at the autopsy through Agent Jackson. Agent Jackson testified the photographs accurately depicted the physical condition of Kathryn's body during the first autopsy. Laird objected to the photographs' admission, arguing the State did not have adequate foundation to admit the photographs because it was not presenting testimony from a medical examiner and that, even if proper foundation existed, the photographs were more prejudicial than probative, especially because Bullis embalmed Kathryn's body before the autopsy and photographs. The District Court overruled Laird's objection, allowing the State to\n   admit the photographs through Agent Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b634 At the close of the State's case-in-chief, Laird again moved for dismissal based on preaccusation delay, arguing he was most prejudiced by Dr. Mueller's death. Laird argued that, because Dr. Mueller had passed away during the delay, he did not now have the opportunity to cross examine Dr. Mueller regarding his \"troubling\" statements. The District Court again reserved its ruling on the preaccusation delay issue, noting it could not determine how prejudicial Dr. Mueller's death was until the trial concluded. Laird also moved for dismissal based on insufficient evidence, arguing the State failed to prove that a criminal act caused Kathryn's death. The District Court denied the motion, concluding the State presented evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find Laird purposely or knowingly\n   caused Kathryn's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b635 Laird questioned two witnesses during his case-in-defense: Agent Jackson and Dr. Bennett. Agent Jackson's testimony was minimal; he laid the foundation for some photographic evidence, including photographs of a note Laird wrote to Kathryn on the back of an envelope postmarked July 15, 1999, which stated, in part, \"I am sorry we have been fighting. I know you work hard [and] are helping a lot. I really appreciate all you do for me. I hope you have a great day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b636 At the start of his testimony, Dr. Bennett explained the complex phenomenon of freshwater drowning. He observed that Kathryn's body had bruising, but concluded most of the bruises occurred postmortem. He came to that conclusion after microscopically examining tissue samples excised from the bruised areas. He explained how, if tissue is injured prior to death, it will show microscopic evidence of vitality-that is, evidence of an inflammatory response. The only bruise that showed signs of vitality was the bruise on Kathryn's thumb. When asked about the internal bruising observed in Kathryn's neck area-the same bruising Dr. Mueller described as \"troubling\" and Dr. Bennett noted on his report as \"real and premortem\"-Dr. Bennett explained that type of bruise-looking injury can occur from the drowning or autopsy processes. In Dr. Bennett's opinion at trial, Kathryn's neck injury occurred postmortem. He testified that, while the bruising may have initially suggested strangulation or some other premortem-incapacitating injury, those conclusions were not ultimately supported by the microscopic analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b637 On cross-examination, the State sought to impeach Dr. Bennett's credibility. It began by asking, in front of the jury, whether he was once a pathologist in Iowa. Laird objected, the State responded, \"His credibility is clearly at issue here about his diagnosis of causation of death.\" The District Court excused the jury and heard arguments from the parties regarding the State's attack on Dr. Bennett's credibility. The State asserted it could impeach Dr. Bennett's credibility because he asserted an expert opinion regarding Kathryn's cause of death. The State further stated that, in 1997, Dr. Bennett resigned as a medical examiner in Iowa because of misdiagnosis; in a 2012 interview with detectives, Dr. Bennett opined Kathryn was strangled and throttled; and in 2015, the State told Dr. Bennett he could no longer perform autopsies in Montana. The State attributed Dr. Bennett's change in opinion between 2012 and the trial to the fact that the State terminated its contract with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b638 The District Court decided the State could perform a limited challenge to Dr. Bennett's credibility. Back in front of the jury, the\n   State asked Dr. Bennett whether the State terminated his services. Dr. Bennett stated he was never the State's employee and, therefore, he could not have been terminated. The State rephrased its question: \"Between 2012 and today's date, ... were you either terminated, not rehired, or unappointed as an assistant state medical examiner?\" Dr. Bennett responded, \"I don't even know unappointed, what it was.\" The State pushed, \"It's a yes or no.\" Dr. Bennett replied, \"I was never appointed, so I guess if I was never appointed-even your office testifies I was never appointed prior to-.\" The State cut him off, \"Nothing further, Your Honor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b639 After the defense rested, the parties presented their closing statements to the jury. In its closing statement, the State discussed Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The State reminded the jury that, through Agent Jackson, it learned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Mueller initially indicated that Kathryn Laird's death in the afterbay appeared nothing other than a simple drowning. That's how it began. That is until he got to the internal exam of Kathryn Laird's neck, inside. When doing this, Dr. Mueller pointed out the extensive hemorrhaging in her neck, in and around the sternocleidal mastoid muscles and longus colli muscles. He then expressed a wholly new reaction to what he had been seeing. It was troubling. An impression he repeated numerous times. That reaction changed the entire course of the investigation. From that point, Brian Laird was the one and only suspect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b640 The jury found Laird guilty of deliberate homicide. After trial, Laird renewed his motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay. The District Court ultimately denied the motion, explaining its reasoning in a post-trial order. The District Court sentenced Laird to incarceration for 100 years with no time suspended.

The District Court ultimately denied Laird's motion. On appeal, Laird asks us to reverse the District Court's ruling and dismiss the prosecution. He argues the State violated his due process rights by waiting fifteen years after Kathryn's death before it prosecuted him for deliberate homicide. He contends he can meet the heavy burden of proving the delay caused him to suffer actual, substantial prejudice. Laird further reasons the actual prejudice he suffered, combined with the length of the delay, outweighs the State's justification for the delay. The State responds, arguing Laird failed to meet his heavy burden of proving the delay caused him to suffer actual, substantial prejudice, and that, even if he did meet the burden, the State's justifications for the delay outweigh any prejudice Laird suffered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b651 We first consider whether Laird suffered actual, substantial prejudice from the State's delay, as evidenced by definite, nonspeculative proof. Laird argues he was prejudiced-as in, his right to a fair trial was impaired-by the death of two witnesses (Dr. Mueller and Renner) and by the loss of physical evidence (tissue samples).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b652 First, Laird asserts Dr. Mueller's death prejudiced him. The District Court permitted the State to present Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements regarding Kathryn's neck bruises through Agent Jackson for the limited purpose of explaining the investigation. To establish prejudice, Laird must present definite, nonspeculative proof showing Dr. Mueller's death impaired his ability to meaningfully defend himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. Laird asserts prejudice based on his\n   inability to cross-examine Dr. Mueller about his \"troubling\" statements-that, absent the delay, he would have been able to ask Dr. Mueller about his post-autopsy opinion regarding the hemorrhaging in the neck area. Laird argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [T]he prejudice comes from not being able to cross-examine Mueller. Did he make this statement? If so, what did he mean? What was troubling? Was he still troubled when the autopsy was over? Was he still troubled 15 years later? Would he still be troubled if he had read the medical research Dr. Bennett had brought with him to testify? Not being able to cross-examine Dr. Mueller is what caused the prejudice and it impaired Laird's ability to effectively present a defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Laird's prejudice argument is a series of questions in which he speculates as to Dr. Mueller's post-autopsy opinions; he does not present any definite evidence showing Dr. Mueller's death impaired his ability to present a meaningful defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. Dr. Mueller's death only becomes problematic when we examine the District Court's limited admission of Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements and the manner in which the State utilized those statements throughout trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Compelling Laird to stand trial for homicide when the State's only forensic pathologist was unavailable, thus leaving the State without any testimony\n   regarding Kathryn's cause of death, did not prejudice Laird and result in unconstitutional preaccusation delay. If the State had not introduced Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements and thereafter repeatedly and inappropriately utilized them throughout trial, Dr. Mueller's death-by itself-would not have actually, substantially prejudiced Laird. Accordingly, Laird has not met his heavy burden of showing prejudicial preaccusation delay due to Dr. Mueller's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b653 Second, Laird maintains Renner's death prejudiced him. The record before us contains very little information about Renner. Warren testified Renner was Laird's friend. When Warren and Laird left the overflow parking area where Kathryn's body was discovered and went back to the Lairds' trailer, Warren stayed with Laird until Renner arrived. Renner then stayed with Laird until Warren returned to take Laird to the hospital. Renner passed away before Laird's 2016 trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b654 Laird and the State agree that Renner gave a statement to the FBI in 1999. Laird asserts Renner's statement corroborated his version of the events on the night of Kathryn's death-specifically, the number of trips the Lairds took in and out of the trailer park. Laird claims Renner told the FBI that, the night Kathryn died, Renner saw the Lairds arguing outside, Laird leave in is car, Kathryn follow in her car,\n   both come back, and then one of the cars leave again. Laird did not, however, provide Renner's FBI statement to the District Court for review and consideration, and also did not provide the statement to this Court. Without Renner's FBI statement, we have no evidence to consider. Laird failed to present definite, nonspeculative proof that Renner's death prejudiced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b655 Third, Laird claims the loss of physical evidence-specifically, tissue samples-prejudiced him. Before trial, Laird tried to find the tissue samples Dr. Bennett excised from Kathryn's bruises. He contacted Yellowstone Pathology Institute looking for the samples, and the Institute said it would notify him if it could locate the samples. Laird never received a notification. On appeal, Laird asserts the tissue samples were lost at the time of trial and argues their loss prejudiced him because of the way the State portrayed Dr. Bennett's use of the samples during its closing argument. The State criticized Dr. Bennett for failing to review the tissue samples during its closing argument, stating, \"[Dr. Bennett] comes in 2016 having done no follow-up reports, having not once since that time reviewed any of the evidence or microslides for a second or subsequent time, ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b656 While we are critical of the way the State portrayed other evidence in its closing argument,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80, we cannot find the State's criticism during its closing statement of Dr. Bennett's failure to review the tissue samples prejudiced Laird's right to a fair trial. Laird must show the delay actually, substantially prejudiced him by presenting definite, nonspeculative proof. We cannot rest upon Laird's speculative proof-an assumption that the State's closing statement comment led the jury to discredit Dr. Bennett's opinion of the slides and that a pre-trial review of the slides would have strengthened his credibility-to conclude the purported loss of tissue samples prejudiced Laird's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b657 Laird has not met his heavy burden of showing actual, substantial prejudice as evidenced by definite, nonspeculative proof. Because Laird did not prove he was actually prejudiced by the delay, we do not address the State's reasons for the delay or perform a balancing inquiry. Compelling Laird to stand trial did not violate the Due Process Clause's fundamental conception of justice that defines our community's sense of fair play and decency. We accordingly affirm the District Court's order denying Laird's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b658\n   <em>\n    2.

Therefore, to survive Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence, the State's case-in-chief needed to contain sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, from which a rational trier of fact could find Laird purposely or knowingly caused Kathryn's death beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b662 At the end of the State's case-in-chief, Laird moved to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence. The District Court denied Laird's\n   request, and Laird appeals that decision. He argues the State failed to prove a criminal act caused Kathryn's death in its case-in-chief, focusing his argument on the lack of physical evidence. Laird reminds us that a person may drown as the result of a criminal action (homicide), but that a person may also drown because of an accident or suicide. Laird contends that, if the State's theory was true-if Laird drug Kathryn from the overflow parking lot, down the embankment, into the water, and caused her death by drowning her-he would have had to incapacitate her before doing so. Laird maintains the State did not provide any physical evidence of Kathryn's incapacity during its case-in-chief. Therefore, Laird argues the State did not prove Kathryn's death was the result of a criminal act. The State responds, arguing the totality of the evidence it presented in its case-in-chief contained sufficient evidence proving Laird caused Kathryn's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b663 Viewing the State's case-in-chief evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude a rational trier of fact could have found Laird purposely or knowingly caused Kathryn's death beyond a reasonable doubt. While the State may not have presented precise physical evidence indicating Kathryn was incapacitated before she died, it did present a multitude of other evidence during its case-in-chief, the quality and quantity from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded Laird caused Kathryn's death beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b664 The State presented the testimony of seventeen witnesses during its case-in-chief. Three of Kathryn's family members testified that Kathryn was unhappy in the days leading up to her death. Lyman testified about the argument he witnessed between Laird and Kathryn outside of their trailer on the afternoon of July 30. Warren testified about the argument she witnessed between Laird\n   and Kathryn while Kathryn was at work on the night of July 30. The Andersons testified about the argument they overheard at the trailer park on night of July 30. The Andersons further testified that the argument stopped suddenly and that, a few minutes later, they saw a large person driving the Lairds' white SUV away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b665 Heidrich testified that Kathryn did not come to work on the morning of July 31. Warren testified that Laird came looking for Kathryn and about her and Laird's subsequent search for Kathryn. Laird took Warren to the afterbay parking lot where he found Kathryn's car, but notably did not take Warren to the overflow parking lot where Warren ultimately found Kathryn's body. Officer Morrison, Ranger Ryan, and Coroner Bullis testified about their responses to Laird's 911 call, the state of Kathryn's body when it was found, and the\n   subsequent investigation. Kathryn's car was found in the afterbay parking lot, not in the overflow parking lot closest to where her body was found. Majerus, the botanist, testified about the grass pieces found in Kathryn's sweatpants, which matched the vegetation on the shoreline near where her body was found. Kathryn was not wearing any shoes when she was found, yet the shoreline was rocky. Kathryn was not wearing contact lenses or glasses when she was found, yet her brother testified that Kathryn had extremely poor eyesight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b666 Bullis testified about Dr. Mueller's autopsy. Kathryn's death certificate indicated Kathryn's \"immediate cause\" of death was \"asphyxia by drowning\" and her \"manner of death\" \"could not be determined.\" Agent Jackson testified about the FBI's investigation. A few years after Kathryn's death, Laird applied to practice law in Missouri and told his version of events to the Board; the State read Laird's sworn testimony into evidence at trial. Kathryn's mother and sister recounted seeing two pairs of wet jeans in the Lairds' trailer following Kathryn's death and remembered Laird's reaction to his mother picking up the pair he said he was wearing when he found Kathryn. Laird wanted Kathryn's body cremated immediately, while her family asserted Kathryn's wishes were to be buried. The State questioned four other individuals who were familiar with Kathryn, the afterbay area, and/or the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b667 The District Court explained the difference between direct and circumstantial to the jury. It instructed: \"Direct evidence is when a witness testifies directly of his or her knowledge of the main fact or facts to be proven. Circumstantial evidence is proof from which the jury may infer other and connective facts which follow according to common experience. Both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence are acceptable as means of proof. Neither is entitled to greater weight than the other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b668 While the State did not present forensic evidence proving Kathryn was incapacitated before she drowned, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude the State presented sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found Laird purposely or knowingly caused Kathryn's death beyond a reasonable doubt. The State presented enough circumstantial evidence and connective facts from which the jury could have inferred that Laird caused Kathryn's death. We therefore affirm the District Court's decision denying Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b669 On appeal, Laird asserts the State's reliance on circumstantial evidence mandates reversal. He claims the State did not prove a\n   criminal act caused Kathryn's death because it did not provide expert medical testimony regarding Kathryn's cause of death. Citing cases from other jurisdictions, Laird argues the State must present expert medical testimony about the victim's cause of death when the cause of death is not self-evident or where it could be subject to misinterpretation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We refuse to require expert medical testimony about the victim's cause of death when the cause of death is not self-evident or where the cause could be subject to misinterpretation-requiring as much would elevate direct evidence over circumstantial evidence. In cases like this one, where, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the defendant purposely or knowingly caused the victim's death beyond a reasonable doubt, a defendant's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence will fail, even if the State did not present expert medical testimony regarding the victim's cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b671\n   <em>\n    3.

The District Court found Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were probative of what Agent Jackson did next in his investigation, specifically why a second autopsy occurred. Therefore, the District Court allowed Agent Jackson to testify: \"Dr. Mueller pointed to multiple areas of hemorrhaged blood in the muscles of Kathryn's neck and said, 'This is troubling.' He said it repeatedly.\" The District Court permitted Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements not for the truth they asserted-that the hemorrhaged blood in Kathryn's neck was troubling-but instead to explain how the investigation proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b675 Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements are not hearsay if offered solely to explain the investigation. However, a thorough review of the record convinces us the State utilized Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements to explain more than just the investigation. Instead, the State clearly sought to have the jury believe Dr. Mueller found Kathryn's neck bruising \"troubling\"-that is, the State offered the statements for the truth of the matter they asserted and, throughout the trial, developed the idea that Dr. Mueller found Kathryn's neck bruising \"troubling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b676 In the State's opening statement, it told the jury investigating officers \"learn[ed]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   through autopsies and such that [Kathryn] had unexplained bruises on her neck and torso.\" However, the State did not thereafter question any witness who could properly speak about Kathryn's \"unexplained\" neck bruises. When the State elicited\n   Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements from Agent Jackson, it inquired about the statements in the context of Agent Jackson's investigation: \"Agent Jackson, so tell us very simply what Dr. Mueller stated while he was observing this condition at the point where the tone of the autopsy changed, that changed your investigation?\" Agent Jackson replied, telling the jury what Dr. Mueller said: \"Dr. Mueller pointed to multiple areas of hemorrhaged blood in the muscles of Kathryn's neck and said, 'This is troubling.' He said it repeatedly.\" The State inquired, \"[W]ere you aware whether there was a second autopsy conducted?\" Agent Jackson replied that he was aware a second autopsy occurred, which he was present for. The State, however, did nothing with that information. It did not call Dr. Bennett, who performed the second autopsy with Dr. Mueller, as a witness. The fact that a second autopsy occurred could have been addressed in a manner that did not involve admission of an accusatory hearsay statement. Instead, the State used Dr. Mueller's statements to highlight Kathryn's neck bruising and to ensure the jury knew the pathologist found the bruising \"troubling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b677 Exacerbating the error, the State mishandled Dr. Mueller's opinion of Kathryn's bruises when it read Laird's Missouri Bar testimony into the record. The District Court specifically excluded portions of the conversation that discussed Dr. Mueller's findings. The State, however, inadvertently read a portion of Dr. Mueller's findings to the jury: \"[T]he forensic pathologist['s] ... opinion was Kathryn Laird died of asphyxia by drowning, she sustained a bruise to the left thumb at least several hours before her death, multiple scattered bruises to back and extremities around the time of death and recent unusual bruises of muscle of neck.\" Laird objected and the District Court immediately provided a curative jury instruction. The State replied, \"I didn't see the line, Your Honor. Forgive me.\" While the State's error was unintentional, the jury heard again from the State's pathologist, Dr. Mueller, that the autopsy had \"troubling\" implications because Dr. Mueller found recent, unusual bruises on Kathryn's neck muscle. Yet, Laird had no opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Mueller about the \"unusual\" bruising. Moreover, the statements pertained to a crucial element of the offense-the cause of Kathryn's death. It was clear that, following Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements, the focus of the investigation turned to Laird. Through Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements, the State was able to produce expert testimony as to the cause of Kathryn's death without calling the pathologist himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b678 As the trial proceeded, the State continued to utilize Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements inconsistently with the limited manner for which the District Court admitted them. In closing arguments, the\n   State emphasized Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements: \"Dr. Mueller pointed out the extensive hemorrhaging in her neck, in and around the sternocleidal mastoid muscles and longus colli muscles. He then expressed a wholly new reaction to what he had been seeing. It was troubling. An impression he repeated numerous times. That reaction changed the entire course of the investigation. From that point, Brian Laird was the one and only suspect.\" Instead of using the statements to explain how the investigation proceeded-that a second autopsy occurred-the State used the statements to tell the jury that, after Dr. Mueller noticed the \"troubling\" neck bruising, the \"entire course of the investigation\" changed and, thereafter, \"Brian Laird was the one and only suspect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b679 Further, the State emphasized the extent of Kathryn's bruising when it questioned other witnesses. The State asked multiple witnesses about the state of Kathryn's postmortem body and asked Kathryn's sister if she noticed any bruises on Kathryn's body. We can come to no other conclusion but that the State was trying to make it appear as though the bruising around Kathryn's neck supported its theory that Laird incapacitated Kathryn and drug her down the embankment into the afterbay. The State, however, did not present a forensic pathologist or any other\n   individual qualified to comment on the origin of Kathryn's neck bruising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b680 Based on the manner in which the State elicited testimony about Kathryn's bruising from its witnesses and the State's comments about Kathryn's bruising in opening and closing statements, we conclude Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were out-of-court statements offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted-they were hearsay. The State repeatedly presented evidence of Kathryn's \"troubling\" and \"unexplained\" neck bruises to the jury, but did not provide a qualified expert's opinion. As hearsay, Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were inadmissible. We accordingly conclude the District Court abused its discretion by allowing them into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b681 At trial, the State asserted that, if Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were hearsay, they were nevertheless admissible because they fell under the present-sense impression hearsay exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M. R. Evid. 803(1) (stating a present sense impression-\"a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter\"-is not excluded by the hearsay rule, regardless of declarant availability). While hearsay is generally inadmissible, certain statements are admissible because they fall under an exception to the general rule. M. R. Evid. 802 - 804. Many hearsay exceptions are\n   premised upon the logic that the hearsay statements are admissible because the circumstances surrounding the statements establish their reliability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , M. R. Evid. 803(1)-(2). For example, present sense impressions are reliable because \"[t]he guarantee of trustworthiness is provided by the spontaneity of the event and the reduced likelihood of deliberate misrepresentation.\" Commission Comments to M. R. Evid. 803. Many other hearsay exceptions are premised upon the logic that the hearsay statements are admissible because they were prepared for a reason other than in anticipation of litigation and are, therefore, trustworthy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , M. R. Evid. 803(4) (statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment); M. R. Evid. 803(6) (records of regularly conducted activities); M. R. Evid. 803(9) (records of vital statistics); M. R.

Evid. 803(13) (family records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b682 The District Court found that Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were not hearsay and, accordingly, did not consider any hearsay exceptions. During oral argument before this Court, the State asserted that, if this Court disagreed with the District Court and concluded Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were hearsay, we should still affirm the District Court's admission of the statements because the statements were present-sense impressions. The Dissent takes that route, finding the statements were present-sense impressions and determining the District Court correctly admitted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b683 We conclude Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements remain inadmissible, regardless of whether they fall under the present-sense impression hearsay exception, because the District Court violated Laird's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him when it admitted the statements. A hearsay statement is not unquestionably admissible just because it fits into a hearsay exception-the defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation right remains a fundamental consideration that may not be infringed upon, state evidentiary rules aside.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz v.

We\n   recently applied\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   and addressed a Confrontation Clause issue in\n   <em>\n    State v. Porter\n   </em>\n   .

We are considering very precise hearsay statements: Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements, conveying his opinion that Kathryn's neck injuries were \"troubling,\" which he made during the first autopsy performed on Kathryn's body. We are not considering factual statements Dr. Mueller made during the autopsy consisting of straightforward factual observations of Kathryn's injuries. We are not considering whether the admission of some sort of document-such as Dr. Mueller's autopsy report or Kathryn's death certificate-would violate Laird's confrontation right. We do note, however, that the District Court admitted Kathryn's death certificate into evidence but required the State to redact the phrase \"unexplained bruises to neck\n   and trunk\" due to confrontation concerns. We are also not considering a situation where a second forensic pathologist looked at autopsy photographs and/or Dr. Mueller's report containing factual observations about the state of Kathryn's body, developed his own expert opinion about Kathryn's injuries, and then testified about any conclusions he was able to draw about the cause of her death. For purposes of a Confrontation Clause analysis, those situations are completely distinguishable from the hearsay statements at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b699 The hearsay statements presently at issue are Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements. To determine whether the statements are testimonial, we must closely examine whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed objectively, the statements' primary purpose was to create an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26 ;\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , 576 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590213\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2173/#p2179\">\n    135 S.

Agent Jackson asked to speak with Laird in order to gather facts about the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death, and Laird agreed. The two spoke in the afterbay parking lot less than two hours after Agent Jackson responded to the scene. Following his conversation with Laird, Agent Jackson had concerns that \"led [him] in the subsequent investigation.\" Agent Jackson explained at trial: \"[W]hen we completed the interview, it was my belief that we needed to do a postmortem\n   examination on Kathryn's body. We had a young, well-educated female who had drowned and there was no ... obvious explanation for the circumstances surrounding her drowning.\" Because there were unexplained circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death, Agent Jackson decided an autopsy was necessary to determine whether \"criminal activity was or was not the cause of the death.\" Agent Jackson had to request authorization in order to schedule the autopsy because autopsies are expensive; the FBI does not \"just do postmortem examinations on every deceased individual.... [It tries] to be judicious about when [it] choose[s] to do [one].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6101 Coroner Bullis transported Kathryn's body away from the crime scene. Bullis testified that, because Kathryn's death was \"unattended,\" it was his responsibility as coroner to determine who she was, when she died, where she died and, if possible, how she died. Dr. Mueller performed the autopsy the next day. Agent Jackson, Bullis, and a detective from the sheriff's office were present at the autopsy. Agent Jackson kept a photo log during the autopsy-the other\n   detective took photographs and Agent Jackson explained each photograph in the log.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6102 At trial, the State questioned Agent Jackson about the autopsy. It asked, \"Was there a point in the autopsy when the tone of the autopsy changed from your perspective?\" Agent Jackson replied, \"Yes. There was clearly a time when it changed.\" The State asked, \"[D]id Dr. Mueller make any statements to you, describe it or explain any condition of the body while he was perceiving that condition at the time when the tone of the autopsy changed.\" Laird objected to that question, noting he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Mueller and, therefore, a \"confrontational issue\" existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6103 The District Court ultimately allowed Agent Jackson to recite Dr. Mueller's statements purportedly for the purpose of explaining what he did next in his investigation. The State asked Agent Jackson, \"[T]ell us very simply what Dr. Mueller stated while he was observing this condition at the point where the tone of the autopsy changed, that changed your investigation?\" Agent Jackson replied, \"Dr. Mueller pointed to multiple areas of hemorrhaged blood in the middle of Kathryn's neck and said, 'This is troubling.' He said it repeatedly.\" As explained above, the State continually utilized Dr. Mueller's troubling statements throughout the trial to support its theory that Laird incapacitated Kathryn before dragging her down the embankment and drowning her in the afterbay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6104 After considering the circumstances surrounding Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements, we can come to no other conclusion but that the statements' primary purpose was to create an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. First, there was no ongoing emergency to address when Dr. Mueller made the statements-Kathryn was already dead and an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death had ensued. Further, the circumstances in which Dr. Mueller made the statements were sufficiently formal-he was performing an autopsy at the request of law enforcement and methodically noting the state of Kathryn's postmortem body while law enforcement officers observed. Just because Dr. Mueller did not make his statements under oath or memorialize them into a sworn writing does not render them too informal to qualify as testimonial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bullcoming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334192,12450500\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/647/\">\n    564 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131 S.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , where a law enforcement officer did not\n   participate in the medical exam, here, Dr. Mueller performed his autopsy accompanied by two detectives and a coroner. In\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , Michelle made her statements to a doctor, while here Dr. Mueller made his statements to Agent Jackson, another detective, and the coroner. The detectives and coroner were individuals \"principally charged with uncovering and prosecuting criminal behavior\"-Agent Jackson testified that he only sought authorization for the autopsy after he spoke with Laird and determined he needed to further investigate the circumstances surrounding\n   Kathryn's death, and Bullis testified that one of his objectives as coroner was to, if possible, figure out how Kathryn died.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 ;\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , 576 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590213\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2173/#p2179\">\n    135 S.

He was not simply commenting that Kathryn had bruising on her neck. He was stating his opinion, to law enforcement officers actively investigating the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death, that the bruising on Kathryn's neck was \"troubling.\" That type of opinion statement is functionally identical to any live, in-court testimony the State would have elicited from Dr. Mueller on direct examination, just like how the certificates at issue in\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   were functionally identical to live, in-court testimony that a witness would have given on direct examination. The State utilized Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements as a substitute for Dr. Mueller's testimony at trial, using the statements \"for the purpose of establishing or proving\" that Kathryn's neck bruising was \"troubling\"-i.e., that her death was not the result of an accident or suicide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melendez-Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/#p324\">\n    557 U.S. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657952\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/305/#p324\">\n    129 S.

While Dr. Mueller made his \"troubling\" statements contemporaneously with his observations of Kathryn's neck bruising, the statements were testimonial. Even if Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements fell under the present-sense impression hearsay exception, admitting the statements violated Laird's constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. Because admission of Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements violated Laird's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights, we conclude Laird is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6109 The State urges us to find harmless any error in admitting Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements. The State cites \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, which provides, \"A cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\" The State argues the statements were not prejudicial because Agent Jackson was at the autopsy and observed the same things Dr. Mueller observed. We disagree. As explained above, considering how the State utilized the statements throughout the trial and in its closing statements, Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements were undoubtedly accusatory and, therefore, prejudicial to Laird. Admission of the statements violated Laird's right to confront witnesses the State presented against him. We therefore reverse Laird's conviction and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6110 The State further argues any error in admitting Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements was harmless because Laird was able to present Dr. Bennett's testimony, without contradiction from another medical doctor, that Kathryn's death resulted from drowning. The State argues Dr. Bennett's testimony was strong evidence presented in Laird's defense, which undermined its theory that Laird incapacitated Kathryn and then placed her body in the afterbay. During the State's cross-examination of Dr. Bennett, the District Court\n   permitted it to perform a limited challenge to Dr. Bennett's credibility, and the State stayed within those parameters as it questioned Dr. Bennett.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. However, in its closing argument, the State inaccurately characterized the testimony produced at trial. In closing, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   So before this prosecution was commenced in 2014, [Dr. Bennett] used the terms \"strangulation\" and \"throttling\" to connect the hemorrhaging seen in the interior of Kathryn Laird's neck with the events leading up to her being drowned in the afterbay. Now, however, in 2016, he says the exact opposite. What has changed? Well, in 2015, he was terminated as an assistant state medical examiner at the direction of ... the attorney general's office. You should totally disregard Dr. Bennett's new opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The State's characterization that the attorney general's office \"terminated\" Dr. Bennett is not supported by the evidence and went beyond the parameters the District Court set when it allowed the State to challenge Dr. Bennett's credibility. By improperly characterizing the evidence in its closing statement, the State undercut Dr. Bennett's testimony that Kathryn's neck bruising could have resulted from the drowning, embalming, or autopsy processes. When the State told the jury Dr. Bennett was \"terminated\" during its closing argument, it undermined a crucial defense witness's testimony and, consequently, undermined Laird's entire defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Cunningham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566002\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/289/12566002/\">\n    2018 MT 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566002\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/289/12566002/\">\n    390 Mont. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566002,12566003,12566004\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/414/289/\">\n    414 P.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that jurors may attribute significant weight to expert medical testimony). Because Dr. Bennett's credibility was inappropriately challenged when the State explained the attorney general's office \"terminated\" Dr. Bennett in its closing argument, we conclude Dr. Bennett's testimony does not render the error in admitting Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6111 Laird asserts a second evidentiary issue on appeal. He argues the District Court abused its discretion by permitting the State to admit autopsy photographs through Agent Jackson. He argues that, because the State did not have an expert testify about Kathryn's bruises, the photographs were misleading and more prejudicial than probative. Kathryn's body was embalmed before the autopsy photographs were taken, and both Bullis and Dr. Bennett testified that embalming often causes bruises to appear darker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6112 This Court consistently reasons that photographs of instructive value are relevant and admissible, provided their probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Dunfee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20MT%20147\">\n    2005 MT 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1607872\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/327/335/\">\n    327 Mont. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1607872\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/327/335/\">\n    114 P.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State explains that the autopsy photographs were admissible\n   to establish Kathryn's injuries, explain and apply the evidence, and assist the jury in understanding the case. While we do not necessarily disagree with the State's reasoning, we also note that the State utilized the photographs as part of its strategy to make Kathryn's \"unexplained\" bruises seem \"troubling\" while not providing any expert medical testimony to prove as much. Because we reversed Laird's conviction based on Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements, we decline to decide whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting the autopsy photographs. On remand, the District Court may consider the photographs' probative value compared with the danger of unfair prejudice in the context of the State's proffered evidence, and determine at that time whether or not to admit the photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6113 We conclude the fifteen-year preaccusation delay did not unconstitutionally prejudice Laird and determine the State presented sufficient evidence in its case-in-chief to overcome Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient\n   evidence. We further conclude, however, that the State utilized Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements for the truth of the matter they asserted. The statements were, therefore, inadmissible hearsay, and we must conclude, based on the record as it exists before us, the District Court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Mueller's \"troubling\" statements into evidence.

According to Laird, \"[i]n his statement, Renner said he saw the Lairds arguing outside their trailer on the night [Kathryn] died. Renner then saw Laird drive away, followed closely by Kathryn in her car. Renner saw Laird and Kathryn return to the trailer, then saw one of the cars\n   leave.\" Laird asserts Renner's statement was important as it contradicted the testimony of the Andersons in key respects and corroborated statements he made to the Missouri Bar. The majority concludes that since Renner's statement was not included in the record, we have no evidence to consider and thus Laird failed to present definite, nonspeculative proof Renner's death prejudiced him. This conclusion is rather disingenuous as the State did not refute Laird's characterization of Renner's statement and, in essence, conceded it to be inconsistent with the testimony of the Andersons and corroborative of Laird's statements\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Missouri Bar. Anyone with trial experience knows the tremendous value of presenting an independent witness, with no apparent motivation to deceive, who corroborates the defendant's version of events. I would conclude Laird was prejudiced by Renner's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   \u00b6117 Laird also contends he was prejudiced by the loss of physical evidence-primarily, tissue samples from Kathryn's body. Prior to trial, Laird attempted to locate the tissue samples Dr. Bennett excised from Kathryn's body by requesting such from Yellowstone Pathology Institute (YPI). YPI did not provide him any samples or otherwise respond to his request. At trial, the State, knowing that the samples were lost or unavailable to Laird, criticized Dr. Bennett for failing to review the tissue samples and do any follow-up report. The majority, while ignoring the State's clear failure to preserve the tissue samples collected by the State in its investigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   baldly concludes \"we cannot find the State's criticism during its closing statement of Dr. Bennett's failure to review the tissue samples prejudiced Laird's right to a fair trial.\" This flies in the face of common sense. The State has an obligation to disclose evidence, including tissue samples, to Laird. None were disclosed to him and the State did not refute the loss or lack of availability of the samples. To then use this loss or unavailability of the samples-which were collected during the State's investigation and should have been maintained by the State-to discredit the testimony of Dr. Bennett was inappropriate and very prejudicial. There is no place for such tactics in a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6118 By concluding Laird suffered no prejudice from the fifteen-year preaccusatory delay, the majority determined it did not need\n   to address the State's reasons for the delay or perform a balancing inquiry. The State's delayed prosecution was not based on discovery of new information, but instead based on information known to law enforcement within hours to days after Kathryn's death. I would conclude the State's failure to interview the Andersons-who were known and available witnesses-within days of Kathryn's death, until well over a decade later, and the resulting presentation of their invariably time-dimmed recollections as critically key evidence in this wholly circumstantial case, was extremely prejudicial to Laird and unfairly impaired his ability to mount a defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00b6119 Issue 2:\n   <em>\n    Did the State present sufficient evidence in its case-in-chief to overcome Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   \u00b6120 Although the majority takes great pains to point out the number of witnesses called by the State and details incidents of verbal altercation between Laird and Kathryn and an incident where Laird threw a bag of cookies at Kathryn, hitting her in the head, in the days preceding Kathryn's death, the majority overlooks the most critical element the State must prove-that the manner or cause of death was at the hands of another rather than resultant from accident, suicide, or natural cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6121 In viewing the State's case-in-chief evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, although a rational trier of fact could conclude the Lairds had arguments in the days preceding Kathryn's death, it could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Kathryn's death resulted from a criminal element versus accident or suicide. While not every homicide prosecution will require expert medical testimony where the mechanism of injury and manner of death is obvious-such as gunshot wounds or the like-where, as here, there is a body and the physical evidence is equally supportive of suicide or accident, I would conclude medical testimony to be necessary to establish the manner or cause of death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, I would conclude there\n   was insufficient evidence presented in the State's case-in-chief such that it was error for the District Court not to grant Laird's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6122 Issue 3:\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting statements a forensic pathologist made while he performed the autopsy when he was unavailable to testify at trial?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6123 I concur in the majority's holding that the statements made by Dr. Mueller were out-of-court statements offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted were hearsay and inadmissible. I further concur the error in admitting these hearsay statements was not harmless and violated Laird's rights of confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6124 Laird also asserts the District Court abused its discretion by permitting the State to admit autopsy photographs through Agent Jackson. It is clear the State was attempting to lead the jury to conclude marks on Kathryn's head and neck demonstrated bruising and evidence of premortem incapacity. The problem with this is that the State, as noted by the majority, did not in its case-in-chief provide any expert medical testimony to establish the bruising or marks were resultant from premortem injury. The only medical testimony presented at all was that of Dr. Bennett during Laird's case. Dr. Bennett specifically testified the markings did not come from premortem injury and were consistent with drowning or the embalming process. Upon retrial, unless the State can present expert medical testimony to establish the markings on Kathryn's body were resultant from pre-death injury, the photographs lack any probative value and would serve no purpose other than to inject unfair prejudice into the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Justice Dirk M.

Memories of an event can be distorted through misinformation effect which is \"a distortion in an original memory or creation of a false memory after being exposed to misleading information related to the memory. The 'misinformation' is considered 'misleading' in that it distracts from the true memory, not because it is purposefully deceitful.\" Misleading information is often subtle and unintentionally given. Distortions can also result from feedback provided to the witness. \"Distortions can also occur simply with the passage of time and with repeated recounting of events.\" For example, in a study following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, individuals were asked to recall the event one to two weeks after 9/11, one year later, and three years later. In year one, memories of the details had changed in 37% of individuals and in 43% of individuals three years later. These changes resulted from media attention and by talking about the event during the intervening time. Further, these types of memory distortions increase as a person ages. \"[A]s people age, memory for the gist of an event may remain intact, but memory for specific details of the event degrades and individuals are more likely to falsely incorporate similar information into [their] memories.\" \"[E]xperiencing an event can lead to the automatic retrieval of information that is not present but has been previously associated with similar events ... As a result, whatever happens in this event becomes associated not just to elements that are actually present, but also to what we expect to be present based on our prior experiences and biases.\" Joyce W.

The Andersons, who over the preceding years had occasion to repeatedly discuss the event amongst themselves and with others in the community and who had aged an additional 12 years, provided details inconsistent with Laird's statements based in large part on their perceptions about their dog barking primarily when men versus women were present. I am particularly troubled that due to the significant passage of time and the ability to create memories based on outside influences such as community gossip or integration of prior similar experiences, the Andersons's recollections of events, although firmly believed by them, are unreliable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    I do not conclude that lack of a body precludes homicide prosecution.

Recognizing that the issue turns on the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay, the Court concludes that Dr. Mueller's statements constituted the former. \"Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p42\">\n    541 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p42\">\n    124 S.

Notably, the District Court carefully considered Confrontation Clause issues at trial. It did not admit Dr. Mueller's first autopsy report into evidence in this case.

The challenged statement is not from the official autopsy report. It was a spontaneous statement Dr. Mueller made during the autopsy. If there are questions whether the report itself is testimonial for Sixth Amendment purposes, it is even less likely that spontaneous statements made during the autopsy will be held testimonial. Dr. Mueller conducted the autopsy to determine the cause of death. During his examination, he spontaneously remarked that bruising around Kathryn's neck was \"troubling.\" This statement was not made with the primary purpose of establishing or proving \"past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275498\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/813/\">\n    547 U.S. at 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275498\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/813/\">\n    126 S.

Agent Jackson ordered the autopsy to investigate the circumstances surrounding Kathryn's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion, \u00b6 105. And because Kathryn's death was unattended, Bullis had the responsibility as coroner to determine, if possible, how Kathryn died. Opinion, \u00b6 105. As the Supreme Court of California explained, autopsies \"serve several purposes, only one of which [is] criminal investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dungo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20527\">\n    147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20P.3d%20442\">\n    286 P.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I would hold that Dr. Mueller's spontaneous statement is not testimonial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6136 I disagree further with the Court's summary rejection of the State's harmless error argument. Of course, there is no need for harmless error analysis if, as discussed above, there was no error. The Court's added concerns flow largely from its mistaken conclusion about the Mueller statement. For example, the Court concludes that the State piled on when it continued to reference the \"troubling\" nature of the neck bruises. Opinion, \u00b6 77. Because the District Court properly allowed the statement, the State's references also were permissible. The Court also notes the prosecutor's inadvertent improper reading of an excluded portion of Dr. Mueller's findings to the jury. Opinion, \u00b6 77. But the record shows, as I discuss below, that Dr. Bennett confirmed each of those findings during his testimony-asphyxia by drowning,\n   pre-mortem bruising to the left thumb, and multiple scattered bruises with \"recent unusual bruises of muscle of neck\"-and explained each one. He suggested no area of disagreement with Dr. Mueller's report. Finally, the Court relies on a statement the prosecutor made in closing argument that Dr. Bennett \"was terminated as an assistant state medical examiner at the direction of ... the attorney general's office.\" Opinion, \u00b6 110. Defense counsel made no objection to this comment at trial, and Laird does not seek reversal on appeal under the plain error doctrine for prosecutorial misconduct. Laird instead mentions the prosecutor's comment in the argument summary of his opening brief, suggesting that it led the jury to convict him in spite of the State's alleged failure to present sufficient proof of a homicide. The Court rightly rejects Laird's sufficiency of evidence claim. Opinion, \u00b6 70. But it fails, in my view, to analyze the closing argument in the full context of the trial or to apply a proper standard of review in deciding to reverse the conviction on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6137 Dr. Bennett gave lengthy, detailed, and scientific testimony, beginning with a recitation of his considerable qualifications and experience-forty years of forensic pathology, having performed over 12,000 autopsies, including four or five thousand during his seventeen years in the State of Montana. He was the only witness to present forensic evidence of the manner of Kathryn's death, and his testimony unmistakably assisted Laird's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6138 Dr. Bennett opened by describing his profession and practice, offering that he currently serves Wyoming coroners, \"and then families [and] others across Montana, Wyoming and other states doing forensic autopsies and consultations.\" After discussing his extensive experience, Dr. Bennett described his work on this case. He and Dr. Mueller were business partners. Dr. Mueller and Agent Jackson asked Dr. Bennett to participate in the second post-mortem examination of Kathryn's body. All three were present when Dr. Bennett conducted the second autopsy, and he \"was lucky Dr. Mueller was there ... so [he could] pick[ ] his brain.\" Dr. Mueller assisted in the second autopsy and ultimately included both his and Dr. Bennett's report in the final autopsy report. Both participated in the collection of the tissue samples that would be microscopically examined. Though the State argued that Dr. Bennett had changed his opinion about the manner of Kathryn's death, Dr. Bennett was able to explain-by acknowledging and concurring with the concern Dr. Mueller had over the bruising on Kathryn's neck-that the additional microscopic examination of the neck tissue convinced him that the bruising was not a result of strangulation. Without Dr. Mueller there, the State could not challenge\n   Dr. Bennett's\n   explanation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout his testimony, Dr. Bennett used the term \"we\" when discussing the autopsy and its findings, suggesting that he and Dr. Mueller had no variance of opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6139 Dr. Bennett explained to the jury in fine scientific detail how the process of drowning occurs. Within this discussion, he explained how the comprehensive sample of tissues he collected from Kathryn's body showed the physiological effects of drowning. Once the person's head is submerged, she begins to pull water into the larynx area; for a brief time, the larynx will spasm and block that, but then it opens up and fresh water is pulled into the lungs. At that point, he explained, it starts to have some involuntary neural, or seizure-like, activity, involuntarily pulling the muscles. \"[T]he violent muscle activity can actually tear the muscles. Tear them enough, so that when you embalm them, the damaged blood vessels in the muscle will then get these bruises like we saw here.\" Dr. Bennett concluded from this analysis, especially given the location of the hemorrhaging and the lack of any evidence of facial petechiae, that Kathryn suffered no \"inflicted trauma to her neck\" but that \"[i]t is a process of drowning that caused these hemorrhages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6140 After the State began its cross-examination, the District Court entertained lengthy arguments from counsel outside the presence of the jury about the proper scope of the prosecution's inquiry and of permissible rebuttal evidence. The State wanted to probe two primary lines of inquiry, Dr. Bennett's change of opinion and his history with alleged autopsy errors and false testimony. The prosecutor had asked Dr. Bennett about statements he made to an FBI Agent and an Assistant Attorney General in 2012 about Kathryn's body showing signs of throttling and strangulation; Bennett replied that they may have discussed that, but he did not acknowledge such statements as reflecting his own opinion. When the prosecutor began to ask about Dr. Bennett's work in Iowa, Laird's counsel objected, and the Court excused the jury to consider the parties' positions. It refused to allow the State to pursue Dr. Bennett's past troubles and advised that it would not allow the State to call either the FBI agent or Assistant Attorney General in rebuttal. The court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   [The State] can challenge credibility, that's allowed. But it goes to this, he gave an opinion, he was terminated, fired, let go, asked to\n   leave. I don't know exactly how it happened. And - you know, I don't know the reasons are [sic] - I know enough to know that there was concern that - on autopsies of children. Not autopsies of adults, but autopsies of children. And clearly, that's not Kathryn Laird's category.... On the basis of autopsy error in the past, that's not a basis to challenge his - the credibility of the Kathryn Laird autopsy. But you can challenge the sequence of events. He gave an opinion in 1999. You purport he gave an opinion in 2012. He was fired in 2015. He's giving a different opinion today. Is he doing that in retaliation for his firing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6141 Cross-examination continued, and the prosecutor legitimately probed Dr. Bennett about the basis for his newly formed opinion that Kathryn sustained the bruises in the process of drowning and they were made to appear worse during embalming. Laird agreed that this line of questioning was \"fair game.\" Laird does not dispute-nor could he-that Dr. Bennett's falling out with the State was a proper area of inquiry for cross-examination. As the District Court observed, a party must be able to challenge the credibility of another party's witness, and it properly allowed the State to make the point that Dr. Bennett \"was asked to leave, let go, whatever it was,\" to probe whether it biased him against the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6142 We have been insistent that a trial court abuses its discretion if it does not allow a party to impeach a witness for the purpose of challenging the witness's credibility.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Applied sparingly, the doctrine \"may be used in situations that implicate a defendant's fundamental constitutional rights, and where failing to\n   review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Other cases involved error more troubling than a mischaracterization of the evidence. We upheld Ritesman's conviction, for example, despite the prosecutor's improper plea to the jury in concluding her rebuttal argument-when the defendant had no opportunity to respond-that it must do \"your job as jurors\" to \"make sure that [the victim] is safe, to make sure that she is heard, and that we give the control back to her.\"\n   <em>\n    Ritesman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9, 28.

In a rare exception, we reversed Lawrence's conviction because the prosecutor incorrectly told the jury in argument that the presumption of innocence had been removed, violating the \"bedrock, axiomatic, and elementary tenet of our criminal justice system\" that the presumption is not overcome until the jury has determined, based on evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6144 Unlike in today's Opinion, we have been careful to examine the prosecutor's improper comment in light of the argument as a whole. Such an examination in this case reveals that the prosecutor's comment was an isolated one as he summarized the evidence to argue why the jury should not credit Dr. Bennett's opinion and why the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Laird was guilty. In the State's closing argument, the prosecutor meticulously tied together all of the circumstantial evidence to show the jury how it proved that Laird was responsible for Kathryn's death and why Laird's theory didn't add up. Turning to Dr. Bennett's testimony, the prosecutor\n   pointed out areas of discrepancy with his original findings and with other evidence. He then reminded the jury that, \"despite [Dr. Bennett's] claim that there was no forensic evidence that this was a homicide, he also admitted that he can't rule it out.\" The only thing that had changed after Dr. Bennett used the terms \"strangulation\" and \"throttling,\" the prosecutor argued, was that he was terminated at the direction of the attorney general's office. He concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   You should totally disregard Dr. Bennett's new opinion. It is completely inconsistent with the facts. And if it's just a drowning, then why does Brian Laird lie to the Missouri\n   Bar and so many others? Because he knows that only he knows what actually happened that night. And if he misleads you enough, you'll think that's a reasonable doubt. That's why.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6145 Laird's trial counsel had the opportunity to respond to the prosecutor's remark and did. Referring to the \"civil dispute\" between the State and Dr. Bennett, defense counsel said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   He's not going to come in here and jeopardize his otherwise very busy practice and reputation and somehow that he's going to misinform you folks of the jury under oath, because he's got some type of squabble going on with the State. And he denies what deny [sic] - they say happened, but he denies it. But you know, really, that's not part of this case. Let them handle it someplace like adults, but don't bring it in here and muddy up the waters. That's not fair to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   He, too, then discussed the evidence in detail, concluding that \"there is no evidence proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a homicide. None. And it's not backed up forensically. It is not backed up forensically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6146 In its rebuttal closing, the State asked the jury not only to find Dr. Bennett not credible, \"but we'd ask that even if you find that pathologist credible, to look what he really says and realize that he doesn't have anything to say about the case.\" Of course, the prosecutor noted, Kathryn died of freshwater drowning. When asked his opinion whether the death was caused by human agency, the prosecutor quoted, Dr. Bennett said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   \"I found no evidence.\" Then he corrects himself, \"forensic evidence that indicated that Ms. Laird died at the hands of another.\" Really? Do you know why he corrected himself from evidence to forensic evidence, because the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, is overwhelming that someone put her in that water and that's why she drowned.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The prosecutor then returned to the other circumstantial evidence,\n   responding to defense counsel's closing points, arguing to the jury that it left no reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6147 Reviewing the arguments as a whole, it is plain that they were properly focused on the evidence presented at trial. \"The prosecutor buried [his improper] statement[ ] within an otherwise well supported, and permissible, commentary on the evidence and the credibility of witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Lacey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26. Recall that Dr. Bennett had told the jury as he began his testimony that he performed autopsies for \"coroners across Wyoming\" and for \"families\" and \"others\" in Montana and elsewhere. Though the State's explanation that the Attorney General's office \"terminated\" him lacked a record basis, there is no dispute that by the time of trial, Dr. Bennett no longer had a working relationship with the State of Montana. This lone misstep, placed in the context of a complicated case, well-tried by counsel for both sides and conscientiously overseen by the District Court, did not render Laird's trial unfair. The trial court's judgment should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Justices Jim Rice and James Jeremiah Shea join in the dissenting Opinion of Justice Baker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    When arguing this issue below, the State specifically related to the District Court, \"they had their own client's words support the exact same story that Russell Renner would have provided.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
