The policy expressly excluded coverage for diminished value and loss of use. Pacheco sought discretionary review from denial of his motion to determine that both exclusions are contrary to RCW 48.22.030 and violate public policy. We hold that the exclusion for diminished value violates the language of the statute, but that the exclusion for loss of use does not violate either the language of the statute or public policy. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On May 15, 2016, an uninsured driver damaged Carlos Pacheco's 2014 Audi. Pacheco made a claim to Oregon Mutual Insurance Company under the policy's underinsured motorist coverage. Oregon Mutual accepted coverage, and made $16,115 in payments on the claim, including the $1,050 limit for rental car expenses. Oregon Mutual did not pay for alleged diminished value damages, nor did it pay for loss of use damages beyond the amount provided for rental car coverage. Oregon Mutual informed Pacheco, \"The uninsured motorist property damage provisions of the policy ... unambiguously exclude such coverage\" for loss of use and diminished value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Pacheco filed suit against Oregon Mutual in King County District Court. The complaint sought payment of the excluded damages for \"diminished value and loss of use,\" attorney fees, and interest. Pacheco then filed a motion for partial summary judgment, requesting a determination that, \"while the plain language of the policy excludes those damages from the benefits recoverable, said exclusion is void as contrary to public policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted the motion as to the diminished value exclusion where the diminished value is caused by \"unrepairable\n   continuing physical damage.\" But, the court ruled that there was no basis to void an exclusion for loss of use damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Both parties filed motions for reconsideration. The district court denied both motions, leaving its original decision in place. Oregon Mutual filed a notice of appeal to the King County Superior Court, and Pacheco filed a notice of cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The superior court reversed the district court's order as to the finding that exclusions for diminished value damages are void, and affirmed the finding as to loss of use damages. Pursuant to CR 54(b), the trial court certified that its order is eligible for discretionary review. Pacheco sought review, which this court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 An appellate court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Bostain v.

The purpose of the UIM statute is \"to protect innocent victims of motorists of underinsured motor vehicles.\" RCW 48.22.030(12).

If a named insured or spouse has rejected underinsured coverage, such coverage shall not be included in any supplemental or renewal policy unless a named insured or spouse subsequently requests such coverage in writing. The requirement of a written rejection under this subsection shall apply only to the original issuance of policies issued after July 24, 1983, and not to any renewal or replacement policy. When a named insured or spouse chooses a property damage coverage that is less than the insured's third party liability coverage for property damage, a written rejection is not required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (5) The limit of liability under the policy coverage may be defined as the maximum limits of liability for all damages resulting from any one accident regardless of the number of covered persons, claims made, or vehicles or premiums shown on the policy, or premiums paid, or vehicles involved in an accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (6) The policy may provide that if an injured person has other similar insurance available to him or her under other policies, the total limits of liability of all coverages shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (7)(a) The policy may provide for a deductible of not more than three hundred dollars for payment for property damage when the damage is caused by a hit-and-run driver or a phantom vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (b) In all other cases of underinsured property damage coverage, the policy may provide for a deductible of not more than one hundred dollars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (8) For the purposes of this chapter, a \"phantom vehicle\" shall mean a motor vehicle which causes bodily injury, death, or property damage to an insured and has no physical contact with the insured or the vehicle which the insured is occupying at the time of the accident if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (a) The facts of the accident can be corroborated by competent evidence other than the testimony of the insured or any person having an underinsured motorist claim resulting from the accident; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) The accident has been reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency within seventy-two hours of the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (9) An insurer who elects to write motorcycle or motor-driven cycle insurance in this state must provide information to prospective insureds about the coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (10) An insurer who elects to write motorcycle or motor-driven cycle insurance in this state must provide an opportunity for named insureds, who have purchased liability coverage for a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, to reject underinsured coverage for that motorcycle or motor-driven cycle in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (11) If the covered person seeking underinsured motorist coverage under this section was the intended victim of the tort feasor [sic], the incident must be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency and the covered person must cooperate with any related law enforcement investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (12) The purpose of this section is to protect innocent victims of motorists of underinsured motor vehicles. Covered persons are entitled to coverage without regard to whether an incident was intentionally caused. However, a person is not entitled to coverage if the insurer can demonstrate that the covered person intended to cause the event for which a claim is made under the coverage described in this section. As used in this section, and in the section of policies providing the underinsured motorist coverage described in this section, \"accident\" means an occurrence that is unexpected and\n   unintended from the standpoint of the covered person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (13) The coverage under this section may be excluded as provided for under RCW 48.177.010(6).\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (14) \"Underinsured coverage,\" for the purposes of this section, means coverage for \"underinsured motor vehicles,\" as defined in subsection (1) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 10 Pacheco argues that the superior court erred in failing to find that RCW 48.22.030 requires coverage for damages for diminished value and loss of use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, Pacheco argues the exclusions for diminished value and loss of use in the underinsured motorist policy he holds are void as contrary to the UIM statute and public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He reads RCW 48.22.030(2) as requiring coverage for all damages because of bodily injury, death, or property damage, including consequential damages. The statute provides, \"Property damage coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall mean physical damage to the insured motor vehicle unless the policy specifically provides coverage for the contents thereof or other forms of property damage.\" RCW 48.22.030(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 11 Framing this case first as one of statutory interpretation, Pacheco asserts, \"While the statute notes that 'property damage' 'shall mean' 'physical damage,' this is a definition as to what risks are covered, not a limitation to the covered damages, and it impacts nothing but the phrase it defines: i.e., 'property damage.' \" He asserts, \"Applying the statutory definition language as to the covered risks, the purpose is still clear:\n   <em>\n    coverage must be provided to protect insureds 'legally entitled to recover damages' 'because of' 'physical damage\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 12 We begin by analyzing the language of the subsection that mandates the insurance offering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) No new policy or renewal of an existing policy insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, or property damage, suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage is provided therein or supplemental thereto for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles, and phantom vehicles because of bodily injury, death, or property damage, resulting therefrom, except while operating or occupying a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, and except while operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned or available for the regular use by the named insured or any family member, and which is not insured under the liability coverage of the policy. The coverage required to be offered under this chapter is not applicable to general liability policies, commonly known as umbrella policies, or other policies which apply only as excess to the insurance directly applicable to the vehicle insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   RCW 48.22.030(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 13 The statutory mandate language, \"No new policy or renewal of an existing policy insuring against loss resulting from liability\n   imposed by law for bodily injury, death, or property damage, suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state\" is based on the definitions of motor vehicle, RCW 48.22.005(1), and automobile liability policy, RCW 48.22.005(8). It could be replaced by \"No automobile liability insurance policy shall be issued ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 14 The exceptions in this subsection to the mandated coverage offering also derive from the definitions of automobile and automobile liability insurance policy found in RCW 48.22.005, and of passenger car found in RCW 46.04.382 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [E]xcept while operating or occupying a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, and except while operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned or available for the regular use by the named insured or any family member, and which is not insured under the liability coverage of the policy. The coverage required to be offered under this chapter is not applicable to general liability policies, commonly known as umbrella policies, or other policies which apply only as excess to the insurance directly applicable to the vehicle insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   RCW 48.22.030(2). Offering UIM motorcycle coverage is optional under RCW 48.22.030(9) and (10). The exceptions are of no interest in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 15 The focus here is on the remaining language, stating that no automobile liability insurance policy shall be issued \"unless coverage is provided ... for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles, and phantom vehicles because of bodily injury, death, or property damage, resulting therefrom.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 48.22.030(2). The key is that the clause which begins with \"who,\" modifies \"persons insured.\" It is a limitation on whether an insured has coverage following an accident. The insured may recover under UIM coverage only if (1) the insured is legally entitled to recover damages; (2) those damages will be recovered from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles, and phantom vehicles; and (3) the damages are because of bodily injury, death, or property damage, resulting from the accident. The use of the phrases \"legally entitled to recover damages\" and \"because of bodily injury, death, or property damage\" does not change the clause from a limitation on whether an insured is covered for the accident into one defining the scope of coverage under the UIM policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 16 While subsection (2) requires that UIM coverage be offered and defines when it is applicable, subsection (3) identifies the minimum scope of coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Except as to property damage, coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall be in the same amount as the insured's third party liability coverage unless the insured rejects all or part of the coverage as provided in subsection (4) of\n   this section. Coverage for property damage need only be issued in conjunction with coverage for bodily injury or death. Property damage coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall mean physical damage to the insured motor vehicle unless the policy specifically provides coverage for the contents thereof or other forms of property damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   RCW 48.22.030(3). This subsection treats property coverage differently from bodily injury or death coverage in several ways. Property damage coverage need be issued only in conjunction with coverage for bodily injury or death, not as a stand-alone coverage. Property damage need not be the same amount as the insured's third party liability coverage, while other coverages must be. \"Property damage\" is defined, and defined narrowly, as \"physical damage to the insured motor vehicle.\" Coverage of vehicle contents or other forms of property damage is optional. And, under subsection (7), minimal deductibles for property damage coverage are prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 17 The plain reading of the statutory language requires that physical damage to the insured motor vehicle must be covered. Other property damages, including consequential damages, are not require to be covered by the UIM policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Exclusions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 18 UIM insurers cannot reduce statutorily mandated UIM coverage through language in the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    McIllwain v.

Thus, under Washington case law, the diminished value of a vehicle from physical injury is property damage as defined in the UIM statute. An express policy exclusion for coverage for diminished value of the damaged vehicle is therefore contrary to the UIM statutory language. Having answered the first question under\n   <em>\n    Greengo\n   </em>\n   in the affirmative, we need not answer the second question of whether it conflicts with public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 20 Addressing the loss of use exclusion, we must ask first whether the exclusion for loss of use conflicts with the express language of the UIM statute. Loss of use may flow from physical damage to a vehicle, but it is not physical damage to the\n   vehicle. Loss of use is not property damage as defined in RCW 48.22.030. Because it is not required by the statute, it does not violate the express language of the statute to exclude it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 21 Having answered the first question in the negative, under\n   <em>\n    Greengo\n   </em>\n   , we ask next whether the exclusion for loss of use violates public policy. The declared public policy of the UIM statute is to protect innocent insureds. RCW 48.22.030(12). The protection afforded by the statute is not absolute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislature defined property damage coverage narrowly as \"physical damage to the insured motor vehicle.\" RCW 48.22.030(3). It made additional coverage optional rather than mandatory with the clause \"unless the policy specifically provides coverage for the contents thereof or other forms of property damage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20P.3d%20998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This language, contained in the same section as the declared public policy, makes plain that damages such as loss of use are not required to be covered. An express UIM policy exclusion for loss of use of a vehicle is not inconsistent with the stated public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 22 We conclude that a UIM policy exclusion for diminished value resulting from physical damage to a vehicle is void. The trial court erred in finding that the exclusion for diminished value is not void. However, because the statutory language and declared public policy do not require coverage for loss of use as property damage, the trial court did not err in upholding the exclusion for loss of use in the UIM policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 23 Pacheco requests attorney fees under\n   <em>\n    Olympic S.S.
