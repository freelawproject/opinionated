At the time, Washington's registration statute did not require Batson to register as a sex offender because his Arizona conviction was not legally comparable to a crime in Washington.

Because Batson is homeless, he must also report weekly to the sheriff of the county of registration and maintain an \"accurate accounting\" of each location he stayed during the week.

RCW 9A.44.132(1). RCW 9A.44.130(1)(a) in turn requires any adult convicted of a sex offense to register with the county sheriff for the county of the person's residence. RCW 9A.44.128(10)(h) then defines those \"sex offenses\" for which registration is mandatory. The provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Any out-of-state conviction for an offense for which the person\n   <em>\n    would be required\n   </em>\n   to register as a sex offender while residing in the state of conviction; or, if not required to register in the state of conviction, an offense that under the laws of this state would be classified as a sex offense under this subsection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 The duty to register thus is an element of Batson's crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11 WASHINGTON PRACTICE: WASHINGTON PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS: CRIMINAL 49C.02 (4th ed. 2016). The State had to establish that Batson had this duty during the period he was charged with violating RCW 9A.44.132. The only way to establish this element of the crime was to prove that during any alleged charging period, Batson \"would be\" required to register under Arizona law if he lived in that state. The definition of an out-of-state \"sex offense\" does not link the duty to register to any specific point in time in the past but instead conditions that duty on whether Arizona law imposes a duty to register in the future. Batson's duty to register in this state is thus completely dependent on whether the Arizona Legislature retains or removes his crime of conviction on its list of registrable crimes. If the Arizona Legislature eliminates Batson's crime of conviction from this list, any duty to register in Washington evaporates. If, however, the Arizona Legislature then reinstates the registration requirement, Batson's duty under Washington law would be resuscitated. As in\n   <em>\n    Dougall\n   </em>\n   , the sex offender registration statute permits future Arizona law to define an element of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617\n   <em>\n    Diversified\n   </em>\n   is not analogous.

The statute now reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    Any out-of-state conviction for an offense for which the person would be required to register as a sex offender while residing in the state of conviction; or, if not required to register in the state of conviction, an offense that under the laws of this state would be classified as a sex offense under this subsection.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    RCW 9A.44.128(h). This is the current version of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Batson also argues the statute is an ex post facto law, violates double jeopardy and violates equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. Because we invalidate the statute under article II, section 1, we need not reach these additional constitutional claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
