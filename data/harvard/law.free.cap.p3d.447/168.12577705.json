They later established their right to assert a claim under Washington's \"Wrongfully Convicted Persons Act\" (WCPA), chapter 4.100 RCW, which provides damages to a wrongly convicted individual based on years of incarceration, damage-based attorney fees, and certain costs. The three men also filed a\n   federal lawsuit against Spokane County and two of its law enforcement officers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Section 1983 action). They reached a $2.25 million settlement against the defendants in that lawsuit at around the same time they established their rights under the WCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 At issue is whether their judgment for money damages under the WCPA remained viable after the three men settled the Section 1983 action. Given the operative provisions\n   of the WCPA and the legislative intent that its remedies and compensation be exclusive, we hold that their judgment for WCPA compensation no longer remained viable. The superior court's order vacating the judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In 2008, Messrs. Larson, Gassman, and Statler (the plaintiffs) were arrested in connection with a Spokane robbery. At their trial in February 2009, they presented alibi evidence. A jury nonetheless found each guilty of first degree robbery, first degree assault, and drive-by shooting. Each was sentenced to more than 20 years of incarceration. They began serving their sentences in July 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In 2012, the superior court granted their CrR 7.8 motion for relief from judgment, finding they had received ineffective assistance from trial counsel, who failed to investigate potentially exculpatory evidence. Their convictions were vacated and they were released from prison. Rather than retry them, the State dismissed the charges against them in May and July 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In May 2013, the Washington Legislature enacted the WCPA. LAWS OF 2013, ch. 175. It became effective on July 28, 2013, and afforded individuals wrongly convicted before that date a three year period within which to file suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9 (codified at RCW 4.100.090 ). It expressly addresses its relationship to other civil remedies that a wrongly convicted person might have. As more fully examined below, it states the intent of the legislature that WCPA remedies and compensation \"be exclusive to all other remedies at law and in equity\" against the state and its political subdivisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 8 (codified at RCW 4.100.080 ). It effectuates that intent by requiring that a WCPA claimant (1) waive other remedies against the state and certain state actors related to the claimant's wrongful conviction and imprisonment, including remedies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2) execute a\n   legal release before receiving payment of any WCPA compensation, and (3) reimburse the State in whole or in part if the claimant's release is held invalid and the claimant later recovers a tort award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 In January 2014, the plaintiffs brought this action, asserting claims for compensation under the WCPA. At the conclusion of a 2015 bench trial, the superior court concluded they had not met their burden of proof and entered judgment in favor of the State. The plaintiffs appealed. While the State appeal was pending, the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court against Spokane County and two of its law enforcement officers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In June 2016, this court held that the superior court had applied too high a burden of proof on the plaintiffs in certain respects, and remanded for the court to reconsider the required element of actual innocence.\n   <em>\n    Larson v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451666\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/194/722/#p725\">\n    194 Wash.

Reading RCW 4.100.080(1) as a whole, the federal district court construed it as allowing concurrent actions, even though \" '[p]laintiffs must execute a legal release of all their other claims, including \u00a7 1983 claims, prior to the payment of compensation under the WCPA.' \" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 59 (boldface and underscore omitted). Accordingly, the Section 1983 action proceeded, as did the WCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 In April 2017, after applying the law as clarified by this court, the superior court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover under the WCPA. The WCPA provides that a wrongfully convicted individual is entitled to $50,000.00 per year of actual incarceration,\n   attorney fees capped at the lesser of 10 percent of the claimant's damages or $75,000, costs, and any child support payments that went unpaid due to a claimant's incarceration. RCW 4.100.060(5)(a), (c), (e). The superior court determined that the\n   plaintiffs were entitled to $710,697.70 in WCPA damages, $78,380.06 in attorney fees and costs, and that Mr. Larson was entitled to $1,299.97 in unpaid child support payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 In mid-June 2017, the plaintiffs moved the court to enter judgment for their WCPA remedies. The State opposed the motion, notifying the superior court that it had learned on June 26 that the plaintiffs had settled their Section 1983 claims for a total of $2.5 million. The State also represented that the settlement had been paid, but admitted relying only on hearsay. It argued that having obtained a federal remedy against Spokane County and its officers, the plaintiffs could not recover compensation under the WCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 The superior court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, as requested. Although a transcript of the hearing has not been made a part of the record, the superior court would later explain that in entering the judgment, it had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   attempted to emphasize the distinction between obtaining a judgment versus enforcing a judgment. [When the judgment was entered], the plaintiffs hadn't been compensated on their [ Section] 1983 claim or there was no evidence that they'd been compensated under their [ Section] 1983 claim. Rather, they had just settled the claim. The language consistently used in RCW 4.100 relates to being compensated rather than just making other claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 31-32. The superior court later explained that at the time it agreed to enter judgment,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I found that the plaintiffs were entitled to a judgment because they had met all the requirements of the statute and there was no evidence that they'd been compensated on another claim. I then predicted everyone would be back when the plaintiffs try to enforce the judgment if they get compensated on their [ Section] 1983 claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. To ensure the State's ability to return to court if the plaintiffs received the federal settlement and then took\n   steps to collect the Washington judgment as well, the judgment provided that \"[p]laintiffs shall notify [the State's attorneys] at least 14 days in advance of seeking payment from the State.\" CP at 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 In August 2017, the plaintiffs sought payment of the state court judgment, moving the superior court to direct the clerk of court to furnish a certified copy of the judgment to the Washington Office of Risk Management. The State opposed their motion and obtained an order to show cause why the court should not vacate the judgment under CR 60(b). This time, the State provided a copy of the Washington Counties Risk Pool check in payment of the settlement amount, which turned out to be $2.25 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Following a hearing on the cross motions, the superior court denied the plaintiffs' motion and granted the State's, vacating the plaintiffs' money judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.

Having suffered tremendous injustice by being stripped of their lives and liberty, they are forced to endure imprisonment and are later stigmatized as felons. A majority of those wrongly convicted in Washington state have no remedy available under the law for the destruction of their personal lives resulting from errors in our criminal justice system.

This is implied by the fact that before WCPA compensation is paid, the claimant must execute a legal release.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%201230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Execution of a release\n   would be unnecessary if the waiver was binding at the inception of a\n   request for relief under the WCPA. It is also implied by the subsection's recognition that even a claimant who has requested relief and signed a legal release might recover a tort award if the release were held invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20P.3d%201230\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b618 We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the requirement that a WCPA claimant release claims operates only prospectively, and has no application if a claimant's first recovery is for non-WCPA claims, followed by the payment of compensation under the WCPA. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by allowing the legislature's stated intent to create an \"exclusive remedy\" to trump plain language of the WCPA's operative provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We begin our analysis with the operative provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b619 The gloss that the plaintiffs wish to put on the WCPA conflicts with its plain language. They argue that \"[t]he WCPA creates a narrow,\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   waiver of remedies by conditioning the payment of compensation on a release of\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   claims, actions, or proceedings.\" Appellants' Opening Br. at 18 (emphasis added). But the relevant language in RCW 4.100.080 does not say, \"As a requirement to making a request for relief under this chapter, the claimant\n   <em>\n    prospectively\n   </em>\n   waives any and all other remedies, causes of action, and other forms of relief or compensation ... related to the claimant's wrongful imprisonment ... [and] must execute a legal release\n   <em>\n    of future claims\n   </em>\n   prior to the payment of any compensation under this chapter.\" It says, instead:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   As a requirement to making a request for relief under this chapter, the claimant waives any and all other remedies, causes of action, and other forms of relief or compensation ... related to the claimant's wrongful ... imprisonment ... [and] must execute a legal release prior to the payment of any compensation under this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b620 Elsewhere, the plaintiffs contend that there is a \"particular way in which the legislature codified a waiver and any idea of 'exclusive remedies' within the Act: there must be a legal release; it must then be held invalid; and there must be a\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   tort payment 'related to his or her wrongful conviction and incarceration.' \" Appellants' Opening Br. at 25 (emphasis added). That is the manner in which\n   <em>\n    reimbursement\n   </em>\n   language of RCW 4.100.080(1) operates, because one can only reimburse something that was previously disbursed. When the tort award or settlement is received first, the way in which the legislature effectuated the requirement that WCPA compensation be an exclusive remedy was with the requirement that \"[t]he claimant must execute a legal release prior to the payment of any compensation under this chapter.\" RCW 4.100.080(1). A claimant who has received a tort award or settlement will not be able to waive claims and execute a legal release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b621 \"Waiver\" and \"release\" have well-settled legal meanings. \"Waive\" means:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   To abandon, renounce, or surrender (a claim, privilege, right, etc.); to give up (a right or claim) voluntarily. \u2022 Ordinarily, to waive a right one must do it knowingly - with knowledge of the relevant facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY at 1894 (11th ed. 2019). Relevant meanings of \"release\" are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   Liberation from an obligation, duty, or demand; the act of giving up a right or claim to the person against whom it could have been enforced &lt; the employee asked for a release from the noncompete agreement&gt;. - Also termed discharge; surrender.\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   The relinquishment or concession of a right, title, or claim &lt; Benson's effective release of the claim against Thompson's estate precluded his filing a lawsuit&gt;.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1530 (some emphasis omitted). To \"give up a right or claim\" is a meaning common to both terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b622 Whether an individual is waiving or releasing a past or future claim will generally be determined from the description of the claim being waived or released, not from the use of the words \"past\" or \"future.\" Thus, upon buying a ticket for a baseball game, one\n   might give up a claim for any injury arising from the playing of that game, a claim that would inherently arise in the future. Conversely, an agreement to waive or release a claim for injury of a baseball game that occurred last year gives up a claim that inherently arose in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b623 The claims that the WCPA requires be waived are \"remedies, causes of action, and other forms of relief or compensation against the state, any political subdivision of the state, and their officers, employees, agents, and volunteers\n   <em>\n    related to the claimant's wrongful conviction and imprisonment\n   </em>\n   .\" RCW 4.100.080(1) (emphasis added). \"[T]he claimant's wrongful conviction and imprisonment\" necessarily refers to the conviction and imprisonment that occurred in the past and gives rise to the claimant's rights under the WCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b624 Having settled their federal claims, the plaintiffs no longer had the ability to give up the relevant claims: they had already given them up.

It is addressed to the \"majority of those wrongly convicted in Washington state\n   <em>\n    [who] have no remedy available\n   </em>\n   under the law for the destruction of their personal lives resulting from errors in our criminal justice system,\" to \"provide\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   avenue for those who have been wrongly convicted in Washington state.\" RCW 4.100.010 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b630 Fairly read, the WCPA conditions compensation on a wrongly convicted person's ability to provide an effective waiver and legal release of claims.

Citing case law that characterizes subsection (11) as \" 'a catch-all provision, intended to serve the ends of justice in extreme,\n   <em>\n    unexpected\n   </em>\n   situations,' \" the plaintiffs argue their settlement with the federal defendants was\n   <em>\n    expected\n   </em>\n   at the time their judgment was entered, and the judgment was not\n   appealed.

The former subsection authorizes a trial court to relieve a party from a final judgment when \"[t]he judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\" The plaintiffs argue that it would be untenable to find inequity, because even the trial court recognized that $2.25 million was not sufficient compensation for three individuals' wrongful incarceration for four years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b634 In orally granting the motion, the trial court used language suggesting it might be relying on CR 60(b)(1), stating that it would vacate the judgment\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   under CR 60(b) due to\n   <em>\n    irregularities\n   </em>\n   that have occurred here with two different actions proceeding at the same time, one of those occurring after this case had been finalized and on appeal.

CR 60(b)(1) identifies, as a reason authorizing a trial court to relieve a party from a final judgment, \"[m]istakes, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect or\n   <em>\n    irregularity\n   </em>\n   in obtaining a judgment or order.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b635 We can affirm a trial court on any basis supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Nast v.

The State reasonably identified CR 60(b)(6) as providing authority to vacate. CR 60(b)(6) does\n   not turn on whether the judgment provides a\n   <em>\n    remedy\n   </em>\n   that is inequitable; it turns on whether \"it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\" Applying the rule of ejusdem generis, inequity in a \"judgment ... hav[ing] prospective operation\" should be construed to embrace reasons similar to the reasons for vacating judgments that have been satisfied, released, discharged, or that were based on a judgment that has been reversed or otherwise vacated. In this case, the similar inequity is that the judgment was predicated on the plaintiffs' waiver and release of other\n   claims-claims that, as it turns out, were not waived and could not be released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b636 The plaintiffs also make a passing challenge to the fact that the statutory procedure of presenting the plaintiffs with a legal release to execute was not followed.
