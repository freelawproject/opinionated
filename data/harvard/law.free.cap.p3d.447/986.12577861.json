Henderson appeals the district court's decision revoking his probation and ordering him to serve his underlying prison sentence. But this appeal is not about the probation revocation order. For the first time on appeal, Henderson claims his original sentence imposed on January 7, 2015, is illegal because the district court erred in classifying his 2005 Mississippi conviction of burglary of a dwelling as a person offense for criminal history purposes. In an unpublished memorandum opinion filed on May 31, 2019, we vacated Henderson's sentence and remanded for resentencing with directions to classify the Mississippi burglary conviction as a nonperson felony.\n   <em>\n    State v. Henderson\n   </em>\n   , No. 119,172,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202306621\">\n    2019 WL 2306621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kan. App. 2019) (unpublished opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State timely moved for rehearing or modification based on\n   <em>\n    State v. Newton\n   </em>\n   , 309 Kan. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576504\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/442/489/\">\n    442 P.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019). Henderson responded and argued that we should either (1) deny the State's motion because the State waived its newly asserted argument, or (2) even if we address the State's newly asserted argument, we should still find that Henderson's Mississippi burglary conviction should be scored as a nonperson felony. For the reasons stated in this modified opinion, we grant the State's motion for rehearing or modification, and we now conclude the district court did not err in classifying Henderson's 2005 Mississippi burglary conviction as a person offense for criminal history purposes. As a result, we reject Henderson's claim that his sentence is illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We will briefly state the facts. On September 19, 2012, the State charged Henderson with one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. Henderson later pled guilty as charged. The amended presentence investigation (PSI) report listed a 2005 Mississippi conviction for \"burglary of a dwelling\" and classified it as a person felony resulting in a criminal history score of C. On January 7, 2015, based on Henderson's criminal history score, the district court sentenced him to 68 months' imprisonment but granted a dispositional departure to probation for 36 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During his probation term, Henderson served two three-day \"quick dips\" for probation violations as well as a 180-day intermediate prison sanction. The State later moved to revoke Henderson's probation, and he stipulated to using controlled substances and failing to report to his probation officer. On April 24, 2017, the district court revoked Henderson's probation and ordered him to serve the remainder of his prison sentence. In the journal entry of probation revocation, the district court did not award credit for time served during Henderson's 180-day intermediate sanction. Henderson timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, Henderson first claims the district court erred in failing to award jail credit for 105 days of the 180-day intermediate sanction he was ordered to serve while on probation. The State has conceded this claim and filed a second nunc pro tunc journal entry on January 24, 2019, which awarded credit for the extra 105 days. Thus, this issue has been resolved in Henderson's favor and we need not address it further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, Henderson claims the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score by classifying his 2005 Mississippi conviction of burglary of a dwelling as a person felony instead of a nonperson felony, making his sentence illegal under K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-3504. Whether a sentence is illegal is a question of law over which an appellate court has unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

L. 2019, ch. 59, \u00a7 15. The amendment became effective on publication in the Kansas Register on May 23, 2019. The statute now provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"(a) The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time\n   <em>\n    while the defendant is serving such sentence\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(c)\n   <em>\n    For the purpose of this section:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) 'Illegal sentence' means a sentence: Imposed by a court without jurisdiction; that does not conform to the applicable statutory provision, either in character or punishment; or that is ambiguous with respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served at the time it is pronounced.

Generally, issues\n   not raised before the district court cannot be raised on appeal. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417279\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/965/#p971\">\n    298 Kan. 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417279\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/965/#p971\">\n    318 P.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). But K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-3504(1) provides that \"[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\" The 2019 amendment to K.S.A. 22-3504 provides that \"[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time while the defendant is serving such sentence.\" L. 2019, ch. 59, \u00a7 15(a). Henderson is still serving his sentence. So because of the statutory mandate that the court may correct an illegal sentence at any time the defendant is still serving the sentence, we will address Henderson's claim for the first time on appeal from his probation revocation. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Dickey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418099\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/1018/#p1034\">\n    301 Kan. 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1034,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418099\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/1018/#p1034\">\n    350 P.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin our analysis by reviewing the statutory scheme in Kansas for determining a defendant's criminal history for sentencing in the revised Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA), K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6801 et seq. When determining a defendant's criminal history score, all felony convictions that occurred before the current sentencing are considered. K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6810(a). Prior burglary convictions are addressed in K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6811(d). Under K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6811(d), a prior burglary offense will only be classified as a person felony for criminal history purposes if the burglary was committed within a dwelling. See K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-5807(a)(1) and (c)(1)(A)(i). However, whether Henderson's Mississippi burglary was committed within a dwelling is not at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kansas' sentencing statutes also address out-of-state convictions in classifying the offender's criminal history in K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6811(e), which provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"(e)(1) Out-of-state convictions and juvenile adjudications shall be used in classifying the offender's criminal history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) An out-of-state crime will be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the convicting jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (3) The state of Kansas shall classify the crime as person or nonperson. In designating a crime as person or nonperson, comparable offenses under the Kansas criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of conviction was committed shall be referred to. If the state of Kansas does not have a comparable offense in effect on the date the current crime of conviction was committed, the out-of-state crime shall be classified as a nonperson crime.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We again note that the 2019 Kansas Legislature amended K.S.A. 21-6811. L. 2019, ch. 59, \u00a7 13. But the Legislature did not express any intent that the 2019 amendment to this section shall be construed and applied retroactively. Neither party has argued that the 2019 amendment to K.S.A. 21-6811 applies to Henderson's case, so we will not address the amendment in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In our memorandum opinion on May 31, 2019, we applied the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held that \"for an out-of-state conviction to be comparable to an offense under the Kansas criminal code, the elements of the out-of-state crime cannot be broader than the elements of the Kansas crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    307 Kan. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    412 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on the purposes and objectives of the sentencing guidelines, the court found that the identical-or-narrower test to determine comparable offenses is what the Kansas Legislature originally intended when it passed the KSGA in 1993.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    307 Kan. at 561-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    412 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State has never challenged Henderson's claim that the applicable Mississippi burglary statute is broader than Kansas' burglary statute in effect when Henderson committed his current crime of conviction. So applying\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   , we found that Henderson's Mississippi burglary conviction should be classified as a nonperson felony because there was no comparable offense\n   in Kansas.\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202306621\">\n    2019 WL 2306621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But the State's main argument in its original briefing was that our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   was a \"change in the law\" that occurred after Henderson's sentence was pronounced on January 7, 2015. As a result, the State argued that Henderson's sentence was not illegal under the 2017 amendment to K.S.A. 22-3504(3), which provides that \"[a] sentence is not an 'illegal sentence' because of a change in the law that occurs after the sentence is pronounced.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We at first rejected the State's argument, relying on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Weber pled guilty to attempted robbery in 2007, and his criminal history included Michigan convictions from 1976 and 1979. The district court scored the Michigan convictions as person felonies. Like Newton, after\n   <em>\n    Murdock I\n   </em>\n   , Weber moved to correct illegal sentence, arguing that his pre-KSGA Michigan convictions should have been scored as nonperson offenses. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While Weber's appeal was pending before our court in 2015, the Kansas Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Keel\n   </em>\n   . Thus, as we did in Newton's appeal, this court affirmed Weber's sentence, holding that the Michigan crimes were similar enough to the Kansas crimes to be classified as person crimes, despite Weber's assertion that the Michigan statute was broader.\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   , 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1046-47. While Weber's petition for review was pending, our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   , and Weber asserted in a supplemental brief that\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   rendered his sentence illegal. The State did not respond to the argument or file a supplemental brief. But after review was granted and the briefing deadlines passed, it submitted a Rule 6.09 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 39) letter noting the 2017 legislative amendment to K.S.A. 22-3504 and argued that the amendment precluded application of\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our Supreme Court first held that the State had waived its statutory preclusion argument by failing to timely assert it in a supplemental brief.\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   , 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1048-49. The\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   court then applied\n   <em>\n    Murdock II\n   </em>\n   and, for the first time, expressly stated that \"\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   was a change in the law as contemplated by\n   <em>\n    Murdock II\n   </em>\n   .\" 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1049. The court observed that \"[b]efore\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   , no Kansas case construed the term 'comparable' as used in [the applicable Kansas statutes for determining criminal history], to incorporate the identical-or-narrower requirement.\" 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1049. The\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   court noted that prior Kansas caselaw had construed the statutes to mean that an out-of-state crime need only be comparable, not identical to the Kansas crime, and \"\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   substituted the statute's new interpretation for the old one.\" 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1049. So under\n   <em>\n    Murdock II\n   </em>\n   , because Weber's sentence was legal when it was imposed, the court rejected Weber's claim that his sentence was now illegal. 309 Kan. at ----, 442 P.3d at 1049. The\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   court did not mention or discuss the court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   that its decision in that case was based solely on statutory construction and that the identical-or-narrower test to determine comparable offenses is what the Kansas Legislature originally intended when it passed the KSGA in 1993.

Because\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   changed the law, the State now asserts that Henderson received a legal sentence on January 7, 2015, and that sentence does not become illegal based on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In his response to the State's motion, Henderson first argues that we should not consider the State's new arguments because the State did not make the arguments in its original briefing. He cites an unpublished decision from our court for the proposition that a motion to reconsider is not a place to raise new issues or obtain a second chance to present a stronger case. He argues that the State failed to raise the specific issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   in its brief, so it may not raise the issue for the first time in its motion. Finally, he points out the State's motion fails to argue that Henderson's Mississippi burglary conviction is comparable to any Kansas crime under the applicable law in\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We reject Henderson's procedural arguments because the State's motion for modification is mainly based on Kansas Supreme Court decisions issued after we filed our memorandum opinion on May 31, 2019. This is not a situation like in\n   <em>\n    Weber\n   </em>\n   where our Supreme Court found that the State had waived an argument for failure to timely file a supplemental brief. It would be untenable\n   for this court to remand Henderson's case to the district court for resentencing with directions to classify the Mississippi burglary conviction as a nonperson felony if, according to the most recent Kansas Supreme Court precedent, the Mississippi burglary conviction was properly classified as a person felony. And although the State has provided no comparable offense analysis in its motion for modification, this issue presents a question of law that we can resolve by applying the applicable Kansas law to Henderson's sentence on the date the sentence was imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, turning to the merits, Henderson argues that even if we apply the new law, his 2005 Mississippi conviction of burglary of a dwelling should still be classified as a nonperson felony. Henderson correctly points out that we need to decide whether his sentence was legal when it was pronounced on January 7, 2015. So we will now proceed to decide that question based on the law in effect at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On January 7, 2015, K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6811 governing the determination of an offender's criminal history classification stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"(e) Out-of-state convictions and juvenile adjudications shall be used in classifying the offender's criminal history....

But we note that the result would be the same even if we compare the 2005 Mississippi burglary of a dwelling statute with the comparable offense in Kansas in effect on September 13, 2012, the date Henderson committed his current crime of conviction. The definition of burglary of a dwelling did not change in Kansas from 2005 to 2012, and in each instance the crime was classified as a person felony. Compare K.S.A. 21-3715(a) (Furse 1995) with K.S.A. 2012 Supp. 21-5807(a)(1), (c)(1)(A). In fact, the definition of burglary of a dwelling has not changed in Kansas since the KSGA went into effect in 1993, and the crime has always been classified as a person felony. See K.S.A. 1993 Supp. 21-3715(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As Henderson acknowledges, when he was sentenced Kansas caselaw construing the statutory term \"comparable offenses\" made it clear that \"the offenses need only be comparable, not identical,\" and that the comparable Kansas offense was \"the closest approximation\" to the out-of-state crime.

Code Ann. \u00a7 97-17-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), burglary of a dwelling is \"breaking and entering the dwelling house or inner door of such dwelling house of another, whether armed with a deadly weapon or not, and whether there shall be at the time some\n   human being in such dwelling house or not, with intent to commit some crime therein.\" In 2005, the Kansas burglary statute provided: \"Burglary is knowingly and without authority entering into or remaining within any: (a) Building, manufactured home, mobile home, tent or other structure which is a dwelling, with intent to commit a felony, theft or sexual battery therein.\" K.S.A. 21-3715(a) (Furse 1995). Burglary of a dwelling was person crime in Kansas in 2005. K.S.A. 21-3715 (Furse 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Henderson argues that the 2005 Mississippi burglary of a dwelling statute is not comparable to K.S.A. 21-3715(a) (Furse 1995) under the\n   <em>\n    Vandervort\n   </em>\n   test for comparable offenses. He points out that the Mississippi burglary statute is broader than the Kansas burglary statute as to the intent requirement because the Mississippi statute prohibits entry into a dwelling to commit any crime while the Kansas statute only prohibits entry into a dwelling to commit a felony, theft, or sexual battery. He also argues that the Mississippi burglary statute is broader than the Kansas burglary statute because (1) there is no requirement in Mississippi that the burglary must be committed without authority and (2) the Mississippi burglary statute prohibits breaking into a room within the dwelling house, while the Kansas burglary statute has no similar proscription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Henderson's arguments all go to the fact that the elements of the Mississippi burglary statute are broader than the elements of the Kansas statute. But he can only avail himself to these arguments if we were using the\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   test to define comparable offenses. As we have already found, the\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   test does not apply to Henderson's case because the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   was a change in the law that occurred after Henderson was sentenced. Under\n   <em>\n    Vandervort\n   </em>\n   , the offenses need only be comparable, not identical.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163507\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/276/164/#p179\">\n    276 Kan. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163507\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/276/164/#p179\">\n    72 P.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on our review, K.S.A. 21-3715(a) (Furse 1995) is the \"closest approximation\" in Kansas to the 2005 Mississippi burglary of a dwelling statute. See\n   <em>\n    Vandervort\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163507\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/276/164/#p179\">\n    276 Kan. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12163507\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/276/164/#p179\">\n    72 P.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The two statutes define crimes that are similar in nature and cover a similar type of criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    Barajas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799027\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/43/639/\">\n    43 Kan. App. 2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799027\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/43/639/\">\n    230 P.3d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We find that Henderson's 2005 Mississippi conviction of burglary of a dwelling is comparable to a conviction of burglary of a dwelling under the Kansas burglary statute in effect in 2005. Because burglary of a dwelling was a person crime in Kansas in 2005, we conclude the district court correctly scored Henderson's 2005 Mississippi conviction of burglary of a dwelling as a person felony. As we said before, the result would be the same even if we compared the 2005 Mississippi burglary of a dwelling statute with the comparable offense in Kansas in effect on the date Henderson committed his current crime of conviction. Henderson's sentence was legal when it was pronounced and does not become illegal based on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   . As a result, we reject Henderson's claim that his sentence is illegal under K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-3504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
