In these appeals, we address whether the defendant counties are immune from Plaintiffs' quiet title lawsuits under NMSA 1978, Section 42-11-1 (1979) (\"Granting immunity; providing for exceptions.\"). In two separate quiet title suits, Plaintiffs named the County of Valencia (Valencia County) and the Board of County Commissioners of Catron County (Catron County) (collectively, the Counties) as parties who claimed or may claim an interest in the subject properties. In both actions, the Counties responded by filing motions to dismiss on the ground that Section 42-11-1 provided them with immunity and barred the lawsuits. In the Valencia County suit, the district court determined that Valencia County was not immune from suit and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. In the Catron County suit, the district court reached the opposite conclusion and dismissed the lawsuit. Because these appeals raise substantially similar issues, we exercise our discretion to consolidate them for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 12-317(B) NMRA. We conclude that Section 42-11-1 grants the Counties immunity from these lawsuits, and that there is no statutory exception to the Counties' immunity in these cases. We therefore reverse the district court in the Valencia County suit and affirm the district court in the Catron County suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Development of Immunity in New Mexico\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {2} Before presenting the factual and procedural background of these cases, we provide a brief overview of the history and development of the law of immunity relevant to this appeal. In 1876, our territorial legislature \"adopted the common law as the rule of practice and decision[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Beals v.

And one year after\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   was decided, the Legislature reestablished immunity in property actions by enacting Section 42-11-1, which provides that \"[t]he state of New Mexico and its political subdivisions ... may not be named a defendant in any suit, action, case or legal proceeding involving a claim of title to or interest in real property except as specifically authorized by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    The Valencia County Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {6} In the Valencia County suit, Plaintiff Belen Consolidated School District (School District) sought to quiet title to a piece of real property in order to sell it. The School District named Valencia County as a party defendant, alleging that Valencia County had claimed an interest in the property. Valencia County filed a motion to dismiss, claiming immunity from suit pursuant to Section 42-11-1. And although it never asserted a specific claim to title, Valencia County stated that it used the land in question as a park and sports facility for area youth. In response, the School District claimed that Section 42-6-12 provides an exception to Valencia County's immunity and allows for quiet title lawsuits against political subdivisions of the state, including counties. At the hearing, the district court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   was controlling and denied Valencia County's motion to dismiss. We accepted Valencia County's appeal on a writ of error pursuant to Rule 12-503(B) NMRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The Catron County Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {7} In the Catron County suit, Plaintiffs Gregory A. Nash and Susie K. Nash (the Nashes) filed a complaint against Catron County and others to quiet title to a piece of real property that they owned in fee simple pursuant to a recorded warranty deed. The Nashes' property is located adjacent to and shares a boundary line with a property located in Reserve, New Mexico, which is owned by Catron County and apparently houses the Catron County courthouse complex. The Nashes named Catron County as a party that may claim an interest in their property due to a later-recorded deed and \"to the extent [Catron] County may not agree with the location of the boundary line of the [p]roperty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {8} Catron County moved to dismiss the Nashes' complaint for failure to state a claim\n   upon which relief may be granted, arguing that it was immune from suit pursuant to Section 42-11-1. Catron County acknowledged that Section 42-6-12 provides an exception to immunity but argued that our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Maes\n   </em>\n   controlled and limited the state's consent to be sued to foreclosure suits in which the state claims an interest in the mortgaged property. In response, the Nashes relied upon\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   , particularly its statement that \"[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity may not be interposed to bar quiet title actions if its effect is to deny one a remedy for the taking of his property without compensation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1978-NMSC-098\">\n    1978-NMSC-098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1557039\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/92/328/\">\n    92 N.M. 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1557039\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/92/328/\">\n    587 P.2d 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After reviewing the School District's constitutional argument, we find it insufficiently developed for consideration on the merits. The School District states that \"[t]he taking of property without compensation, as [Valencia] County seeks to do here, is a violation of both state and federal constitutional rights,\" but has failed to demonstrate that the Takings Clause is applicable in a case involving public lands or that other remedies, such as inverse condemnation proceedings, are unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
