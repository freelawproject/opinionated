At the outset, the employee assisted the Drews in the acquisition and sale of multiple annuities. Later on, and with the assistance of another RSN employee, the initial employee informed the Drews that, even though they were approaching eighty, they could purchase a life insurance policy with a high death benefit and resell it on the secondary market for a large profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this information, the Drews purchased two $1.5 million life insurance policies, the first from PHL Variable Insurance Company (PHL) and the second from Pacific.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To fund the premiums on the policies, the RSN employees advised the Drews to obtain a reverse mortgage on their home. The Drews followed this advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 RSN was unable to sell the policies on the secondary market. After the Drews paid more than $300,000 in premiums and lost much of the equity in their home, the policies lapsed when the Drews could no longer afford the premiums. In total, they lost three-fourths of their life savings, and interest on their reverse mortgage is accruing at a rate of approximately $1,000 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 The Drews sued Pacific, claiming that it was vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of RSN's employees, whom the Drews contended were acting as Pacific's agents. Pacific and the Drews submitted cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment to Pacific. Although the court did not address whether an agency relationship existed between Pacific and RSN, it concluded that, even assuming such a relationship existed, RSN's employees were not acting within the scope of their authority as agents of Pacific. The Drews appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The Drews contend that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of Pacific and that judgment should have been entered in their favor. \"We review a district court's decision to grant summary judgment for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Bodell Constr.

Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339873\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/61/1009/\">\n    2002 UT 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339873\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/61/1009/\">\n    61 P.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in order to determine whether Pacific is vicariously liable for the misrepresentations of RSN's employees, we must answer two questions. First, we must decide whether an agency relationship existed between Pacific and RSN. If we conclude that an agency relationship did exist, we must then determine whether RSN's employees acted within the scope of their authority in their dealings with the Drews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I. Agency Relationship\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Given its conclusion on the scope of RSN's authority, the district court deemed it unnecessary to determine whether an agency relationship existed between Pacific and RSN. The parties disagree about whether such a relationship existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The Insurance Code suggests that the existence of an agency relationship turns on whether an insurance salesperson is a \"producer for the insurer\" or a \"producer for the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 31A-1-301(88) (LexisNexis 2010).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a producer is \"compensated directly or indirectly by an insurer for selling, soliciting, or negotiating an insurance product of that insurer,\" that producer is a producer for the insurer and is therefore its agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339873\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/61/1009/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31A-1-301(88)(b)(i). In contrast, if a producer is \"compensated directly and only by an insurance customer,\" that producer is a producer for the insured and is not an agent of the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339873\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/61/1009/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31A-1-301(88)(b)(ii)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 It is clear from the record that the RSN employees received compensation directly from Pacific. Thus, under the plain terms of the Insurance Code, RSN's employees were producers for Pacific and were therefore acting as its agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Nevertheless, Pacific argues that RSN's employees were independent insurance brokers rather than its agents. In support of this argument, Pacific relies on\n   <em>\n    Vina v.

In\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   , we articulated some relevant considerations, including the discretion of the salesperson, the salesperson's role as an intermediary between the insurance company and the prospective insured, and the salesperson's ability to bind the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397668\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/761/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   predates the current statutory regime,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 n.5, and we qualified our decision in that case by stating that it was made \"under the controlling statutes\" in effect at the time,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397668\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/761/581/\">\n    761 P.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, given\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   's reliance on an outdated statute and the plain language of the now-controlling statute, the analysis in our previous decision is of limited utility at best. In any event,\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   is readily distinguishable from the case before us because the salesperson in\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   \"was not specifically authorized to solicit insurance or otherwise act on behalf of\" the insurance company.\n   <em>\n    Vina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397668\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/761/581/\">\n    761 P.2d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under both the common law and the revised statute, principals are liable for the tortious acts of their agents when the agents act within the scope of their authority.
