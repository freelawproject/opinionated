NATURE OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   In an appeal arising out of Bannock County, Tom Katsilometes challenges the Idaho Senate's order granting over $18,000 in attorney fees to Senator W. Marcus W. Nye, awarded after Nye prevailed against Katsilometes in a contest over the results of the 2016 general election. The Senate confirmed Nye's election and awarded him costs and attorney fees. Because Katsilometes refused to pay the attorney fees, Nye brought an action in district court seeking a declaratory judgment ordering Katsilometes to pay him the amount ordered by the Senate. The district court granted the declaratory judgment and further awarded Nye costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest. For the reasons stated below, we reverse the district court's judgment upholding the Senate's award of attorney fees, and vacate the award of costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Nye and Katsilometes were opponents in the 2016 general election for the Idaho Senate seat in District 29. After Nye defeated Katsilometes in the election, Katsilometes\n   challenged the election results by filing a Verified Complaint for Contest of Election with the Idaho Senate. The basis for the contest was Katsilometes' allegation that Nye had violated a provision of Idaho Code section 67-6603, one of the so-called \"Sunshine Laws\" that regulate election campaign contributions and expenditures. In response, the President\n   <em>\n    Pro Tempore\n   </em>\n   of the Senate issued an order entitled \"Procedural Order for Contest of Election,\" outlining the course of proceedings and referring the matter to the Senate State Affairs Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following hearings before the State Affairs Committee on January 16 and January 23, 2017, the Committee presented its findings to the Senate as a whole on January 24, 2017. The Senate voted on January 25, 2017, to adopt the Committee's recommendations that the Senate uphold Nye's election and order Katsilometes to pay Nye's witness fees and costs of discovery. Additionally, the Senate Journal reflects that the Senate separately approved a motion adopting the recommendations and findings\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Committee that (1) Katsilometes' petition contesting the election was \"brought and pursued frivolously, unreasonably, and without factual or legal foundation\" and (2) Katsilometes be ordered to pay attorney fees in the amount of $18,060.00. In so ordering, the Senate cited Article III, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution as its authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Katsilometes paid Nye the amount owed for the witness fees and discovery costs but did not pay the amount owed for the attorney fees. Subsequently, to assist him in collecting on the Senate's attorney fees order, Nye brought an action in district court seeking a declaratory judgment ordering Katsilometes to pay the attorney fees that had been awarded by the Senate. Following cross motions for summary judgment, the district court granted Nye's motion for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment action and entered judgment against Katsilometes for the $18,060.00 in attorney fees the Senate had awarded Nye. In so doing, the district court determined the Senate was acting within its authority pursuant to Article III, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution when it awarded Nye his attorney fees following Katsilometes' failed election contest. The district court concluded that it could not intrude on such an exercise of discretion from another branch of government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the district court's entry of judgment, Nye moved for an amended judgment awarding him prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees incurred in his declaratory judgment action. The district court granted Nye's motion and awarded costs as a matter of right, denied awarding discretionary costs, and awarded attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code section 12-120(1). The district court also awarded prejudgment interest from the date the Senate ordered attorney fees until the date the district court entered its judgment in the case. The district court entered an amended judgment and awarded Nye a total of $35,372.28. Katsilometes timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The election contest at the center of this controversy concerns a disputed Senate seat following a general election. It is only the second such contest in Idaho's history. In addition, in 129 years of legislative history since statehood, the Senate has never before awarded attorney fees against a private citizen contesting the results of an election on the grounds that the contest was frivolous. Thus, in addition to the important constitutional principles at stake here, this case presents an issue of first impression for the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     A. The Idaho Senate did not have authority to award attorney fees to Nye at the time of this election contest.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The primary issue before us is not whether the amount of attorney fees awarded to Nye was unreasonable, but whether the Senate had authority under the Idaho Constitution to award Nye any attorney fees at all. Katsilometes argues that the Senate did not have authority under Article III, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution to award attorney fees to Nye, regardless of the Senate's finding that the Contest of Election was \"brought and pursued frivolously, unreasonably, and without factual or legal foundation.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, he argues that the district court erred when it determined the Senate had such authority and entered a declaratory judgment against him. For the reasons discussed below, we agree that the Senate did not have the authority to award attorney fees to Nye in January 2017 and, therefore, the district court erred when it entered a declaratory judgment against Katsilometes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    As this Court examines the constitutional authority vested in a co-equal branch of the government-in this case, the legislative branch-we are respectfully mindful that this dispute involves the interplay of the bedrock principles of separation of powers and checks and balances enshrined in the Idaho Constitution. Article II, section 1 of the Idaho Constitution provides that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    The powers of the government of this state are divided into three distinct departments, the legislative, executive and judicial; and no person or collection of persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to one of these departments shall exercise any powers properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \"The separation of powers doctrine embodies the concept that the three branches of government, legislative, executive and judicial, should remain separate and distinct so that each is able to operate independently.\"\n    <em>\n     Sweeney v.

Yet, the dissent does not advocate for such an outcome. Instead, it describes the declaratory judgment in favor of Nye \"as a perfunctory enforcement mechanism which perfected the Senate's award.\" The dissent cannot have it both ways-this case either presents a justiciable controversy that the courts can address, or it does not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Neither side has argued that this case presents a nonjusticiable controversy. The Idaho Declaratory Judgment Act recognizes that \"[c]ourts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. I.C. \u00a7 10-1201. As the district court correctly noted, in considering \"whether to grant a declaratory judgment, the criteria is whether it will clarify and settle the legal relations at issue, and whether such declaration will afford a leave from uncertainty and controversy giving rise to the proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     Sweeney v. Am. Nat'l Bk.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4385113\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/62/544/\">\n     62 Idaho 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4385113\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/62/544/\">\n     115 P.2d 109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1941). Because we believe that addressing this case will be helpful in clarifying the extent of the constitutional authority granted to the legislative branch under its plenary powers, we affirm the district court's decision to take up this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Further, we note that by deciding this matter, the Court is not meddling in the affairs of the Senate-this case was brought to the district court by a member of the Senate invoking the judicial branch's power to impose an enforceable attorney fee award. As Nye aptly recognized, absent a judicial decree, the Senate's imposition of attorney fees against Katsilometes was essentially meaningless. Where, as here, a judgment of the judicial branch is required to create an enforceable obligation, we believe that a justiciable controversy exists.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Senate cited Article III, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution as its authority for awarding Nye his attorney fees following Katsilometes' failed Contest of Election. The relevant portion of this constitutional provision provides: \"Each house when assembled shall choose its own officers;\n    <em>\n     judge of the election, qualifications and returns of its own members, determine its own rules of proceeding,\n    </em>\n    and sit upon its own adjournments ....\" Idaho Const. art. III, \u00a7 9 (emphasis added). The parties disagree on the interpretation of this language. Nye contends that this provision grants the Senate broad discretion as to the rules and procedure in a Contest of Election, including the imposition of attorney fees. Katsilometes acknowledges the Senate's broad authority granted to it by\n    the Idaho Constitution, but contends that the provision does not allow the Senate to award attorney fees against him. Instead, he asserts that the Senate is bound by a statute it enacted concerning monetary awards in contested general elections- Idaho Code section 34-2120 -which, prior to its amendment in 2017, only provided for an award of costs and witness fees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The version of Idaho Code section 34-2120 in place at the time Katsilometes filed his Contest of Election stated as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    Security for costs-Assessment of costs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (a) The contestant shall file with the secretary of state a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) conditioned to pay the contestee's\n    <em>\n     costs\n    </em>\n    in case the election be confirmed by the legislature.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (b) The contestants are liable for\n    <em>\n     witness fees and the costs of discovery\n    </em>\n    made by them respectively. If the election is upheld by the legislature, the legislature may assess\n    <em>\n     costs\n    </em>\n    against the contestant. If the election is annulled by the legislature, the legislature may assess\n    <em>\n     costs\n    </em>\n    against the contestee.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Ch. 209, \u00a7 28,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1982%20Idaho%20Sess.%20Laws%20580\">\n     1982 Idaho Sess.

In July 2017, approximately six months after Katsilometes contested Nye's election, the entirety of Chapter 21, Title 34 of the Idaho Code was repealed and replaced with new statutes containing much of the same language.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ch. 293, \u00a7 2,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Idaho%20Sess.%20Laws%20774\">\n     2017 Idaho Sess.

However, the section relating to costs was rewritten to expressly allow for an award of attorney fees.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Idaho%20Sess.%20Laws%20774\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It now reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    Security for costs-Assessment of costs and fees-Assessment of attorney's fees\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    (1) The contestor must file with the secretary of state a bond in the amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) conditioned to pay the contestee's costs if the election be confirmed by the legislature.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    (2) The parties are liable for witness fees and the costs of discovery made by them respectively.

Thus, the revision that occurred in 2017 changed the statute to provide for attorney fees in cases where, as here, the Senate determines that the \"contest of election is frivolous and has no foundation in law or fact.\" Thus, Katsilometes argues that this change evinces that the Senate implicitly recognized it was without authority to award attorney fees at the time of his election contest.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Katsilometes further contends that this Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Noble v.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ada County Elections Board\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130523\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/135/495/\">\n     135 Idaho 495\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130523\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/135/495/\">\n     20 P.3d 679\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000), is dispositive of the attorney fee issue.

Pursuant to this authority, the legislature enacted Idaho Code section 34-2120. As discussed, that statute explicitly provided for an award of costs but not attorney fees. That the legislature later clarified Chapter 21 of Title 34, only months after Katsilometes' challenge, to provide for an award of attorney fees strongly suggests that it recognized it had not provided itself with authority to do so under the version of Idaho Code section 34-2120 in place at the time of this election contest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Saint Alphonsus Reg'l Med.

We are not intervening in the Senate's constitutionally-delegated powers or even in its power to define its own rules by statute. Rather, we merely recognize that where the Senate enacts a law or a rule which does not permit it to impose attorney fees in an election contest, it cannot do so on an\n    <em>\n     ad hoc\n    </em>\n    basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Although our conclusion regarding the effect of the previous version of Idaho Code section 34-2120 is dispositive of this case, we briefly address Katsilometes' additional argument that \"[t]he statutory scheme in place at the time this election contest was initiated and decided defined the substantive rights of the parties which could be impacted by an adverse decision by one house of the legislature.\" This assertion implicates important due process concerns. As to such matters of constitutional importance, we have previously held:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    A procedural due process inquiry is focused on determining whether the procedure employed is fair. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits deprivation of life, liberty, or property without fundamental fairness through governmental conduct that offends the community's sense of justice, decency and fair play. Procedural due process is the aspect of due process relating to the minimal requirements of notice and a hearing if the deprivation of a significant life, liberty, or property interest may occur. A deprivation of property encompasses claims where there is a legitimate claim or entitlement to the asserted benefit under either state or federal law. The minimal requirements are that there must be some process to ensure that the individual is not arbitrarily deprived of his rights in violation of the state or federal constitutions. This requirement is met when the defendant is provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard. The opportunity to be heard must occur at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner in order to satisfy the due process requirement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     Bradbury v.

The ordering of attorney fees against a private citizen on an\n    <em>\n     ad hoc\n    </em>\n    basis, without prior notice, raises significant due process concerns.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Conversely, the Senate had notice of our decision in\n    <em>\n     Noble\n    </em>\n    -which concerned a similar provision in Chapter 21, Title 34 of the Idaho Code-for more than ten years before it imposed attorney fees against Katsilometes under a statute that did not expressly provide for them. We also recognize that, as counsel for Katsilometes averred during oral argument, there is no case law over the last 250 years in the United States affirming that a legislative body, through its plenary powers, can impose attorney fees against an individual who is not a member of the legislative body without a statutory basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Again, as we have approached this dispute, we have strived to honor the doctrine of separation of powers and respect the constitutional role of the legislature-a co-equal branch of our government. Therefore, we have not attempted to define or limit the Senate's constitutional authority and discretion in determining its internal \"rules of proceeding\" and regulating the conduct of \"members\" of the Senate. Idaho Const. art. III, \u00a7 9. It is unnecessary for us to do so here because in adopting the earlier version of Idaho Code section 34-2120, the Senate defined and limited its own power to impose such fees. In essence, we are merely holding that the Senate, as part of a bicameral legislative body, cannot ignore laws duly passed by both chambers of the legislature and impose attorney fees against a private citizen on an\n    <em>\n     ad hoc\n    </em>\n    basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In conclusion, it is important to recognize that at its core, this case does not concern a rule of the Senate; rather, it concerns the Rule of Law. Contrary to the hyperbolic assertion of the dissent, this is hardly an attempt by the judiciary to \"muscle\" itself into the affairs of the Senate. Indeed, this action was initiated by a member of the Senate seeking judicial assistance in enforcing a decision of the Senate. This Court is merely responding to a case that has been brought before it-and fulfilling its constitutional role-by applying well-settled legal principles to an unsettled question of law. This is a judicial function almost as old as our republic. Indeed, as Justice John Marshall observed, in perhaps the most notable appellate ruling in the last 230 years: \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n     5 U.S. 137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 177,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6760011,6759998,12121622\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cranch/1/137/\">\n     1 Cranch 137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n     2 L.Ed. 60\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1803). In short, this Court is merely holding that the Senate, notwithstanding the provisions of Article III, section 9 of the Idaho Constitution, is subject to the very laws it enacts. This is entirely consistent with another renowned statement by Justice Marshall contained in\n    <em>\n     Marbury v. Madison:\n    </em>\n    \"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/#p177\">\n     at 163\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, we respectfully hold that the Senate's award of attorney fees to Nye was improper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Nye was not entitled to recover his litigation costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest in the district court action.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Following the district court's entry of the declaratory judgment, Nye sought an award of his litigation costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest for bringing his action in the district court. The district court awarded Nye, as the prevailing party, attorney\n    fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(1) and costs as a matter of right pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(A) ; however, no discretionary fees were awarded. Additionally, the district court awarded Nye prejudgment interest on the Senate's attorney fee award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In light of this opinion, Nye should not have been the prevailing party in the district court action. Therefore, the district court's award of costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest must be vacated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Neither side is entitled to attorney fees on appeal.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Katsilometes requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code section 12-120(1) and Idaho Appellate Rules 40 and 41. Katsilometes further seeks an opportunity on remand to recover his attorney fees incurred during the district court proceedings since he should have prevailed below. Nye requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code sections 12-120(1) or 12-121.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Section 12-120(1) applies to claims for monetary relief in which the amount pleaded is under $35,000, and entitles the prevailing party to an award of reasonable attorney fees. Here, Nye's claim was for a declaratory judgment effectuating the Senate's award of fees. Although this is a claim for money, the gravamen of the action is a dispute concerning the legal authority of the Senate to impose attorney fees in January of 2017 under the then-existing statutory scheme. As such, this case does not arise under the circumstances contemplated by section 12-120(1). Rather, it is, at its core, a constitutional issue. As a result, Katsilometes is not entitled to attorney fees on appeal under 12-120(1), and may not seek his fees on remand. Nye did not prevail on appeal, so he is not entitled to fees on appeal, and his award of fees by the district court must be vacated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Attorney fees under section 12-121 are only permissible \"if the appeal was brought or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation.\" \"Fees will generally not be awarded for arguments that are based on a good faith legal argument.\"\n    <em>\n     Easterling v.

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    For the reasons stated above, we reverse the district court's order enforcing the award of attorney fees to Nye pursuant to the order of the Idaho Senate, and vacate all costs, attorney fees, and prejudgment interest awarded to Nye by the district court. Neither side is entitled to attorney fees on appeal; however, as the prevailing party, Katsilometes is entitled to his costs on appeal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Justices BEVAN, STEGNER, and Justice Pro Tem KIDWELL concur.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-81\">\n     The Senate appears to have applied the standard from Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(1), which provides that \"the court\" may award attorney fees when a case is \"brought, pursued or defended frivolously, unreasonably or without foundation.\" This judicial rule of procedure is expressly applicable only to the courts. Although the legislature later included this language in the current version of Idaho Code section 12-121 (approved and effective March 1, 2017), it did not exist in that statute as worded on January 25, 2017. Additionally, as will be discussed later in this opinion, the revised statute for election contests now incorporates a similar standard for imposing attorney fees.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     I.C. \u00a7 34-2118(3)(a) (\"Attorney's fees may be awarded against the contestor if the legislature determines the contest of election is frivolous and has no foundation in law or fact.\") (effective July 1, 2017).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-82\">\n     We are mindful, as the dissent has properly noted, that Katsilometes asked for attorney fees when he filed his contest of the election in the Senate.

In my view, the Senate's power to assess attorney's fees is well within its constitutionally granted power to adjudicate election contests.

First, I do not infer from section 34-2120 's repeal and replacement that the Senate lacked the power to award attorney's fees under the predecessor statute. That the new enactment clarified that attorney's fees may be awarded does not alter the Senate's underlying constitutional power to assess them in the first place. The award of attorney's fees serves the same purpose as the bond requirement and assessment of court costs under the same statute. These measures ensure the swift and proper resolution of an election by deterring unfounded attacks on election results which might undermine or unreasonably delay them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In addition, because election contests are a constitutionally distinct species of adjudication, the Senate may choose to interpret the applicable statutes as it sees fit so long as the interpretation is reasonable. Here, the Senate did not craft the award out of whole cloth. At the hearing, both the Attorney General's Office and the Senate signaled their understanding that attorney's fees were awardable as \"costs\" under Idaho Code section 34-2120. That this Court has imposed a limiting construction on \"costs\" to exclude attorney's fees is persuasive to the Senate tribunal, but not binding.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Burge,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4465592\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/88/149/#p154\">\n     88 Idaho at 154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4465592\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/88/149/#p154\">\n     397 P.2d at 237\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that this Court's decision denying a writ of mandamus to compel the counting of absentee ballots under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2034-1105\">\n     Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 34-1105\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -1109 was \"not binding\" on the Legislature but \"may be considered ... for what weight or effect the senate may see fit to give it, in the final determination of the election ... should a proceeding for that purpose be initiated ....\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The majority's reasoning that the Senate \"cannot ignore laws duly passed by both chambers of the legislature\" subverts the plain words of the Idaho Constitution. Section 9 provides that \"each house\" acts with autonomy; the power is not subject to bicameral or Executive approval. The Legislature cannot diminish a constitutional power by statutory fiat just as one session of the Legislature cannot tie the hands of the Senate in a future session by rewriting the scope of its power.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     v.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Diefendorf,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2345468\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/56/620/\">\n     56 Idaho 620\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2345468\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/56/620/\">\n     57 P.2d 1068\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1075 (1936) (\"A legislative session is not competent to deprive future sessions of power conferred on them, or reserved to them, by the constitution.\"). Likewise, the language in\n    <em>\n     Noble\n    </em>\n    relied on by the majority has no application to the present case because that decision that involved a primary-election contest, rather than a general\n    election.\n    <em>\n     Noble v.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ada Cty.

This is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    a distinction without a difference-primary contests are determined in the district court, rather than the Senate, and their jurisdiction is statutory, rather than Constitutional.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    I.C. \u00a7 34-2123\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    I.C. \u00a7 34-2105 ; Idaho Const. art. III, \u00a7 9. So when the majority notes that the Legislature is aware that the courts interpret \"costs\" to exclude attorney's fees, this has no bearing on whether the Legislature intended \"costs\" to exclude attorney's fees when the forum charges each house with interpreting the statute. Interpreting \"costs\" to include attorney's fees is not so unreasonable an interpretation to require this Court's intrusion into the Senate's adjudication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary 423 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"legal costs\" as \"[a]ttorney's fees and other expenditures related to a lawsuit.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Senate's award of attorney's fees did not violate Katsilometes's due-process rights.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Because section 34-2120 only stated \"costs,\" the majority characterizes the Senate's award of attorney's fees as an ad hoc assessment of fees against private citizens without prior notice. I cannot view this case through such a broad lens and believe that Katsilometes received procedural due process under the circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Legislature must still comply with procedural due process even when it is acting within its constitutional power.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re SRBA Case No. 39576,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11922133\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/128/246/#p261\">\n     128 Idaho 246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 255,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11922133\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/128/246/#p261\">\n     912 P.2d 614\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 623 (1995).

Katsilometes filed the petition. Katsilometes voluntarily submitted himself to the Senate's jurisdiction and its Section 9 powers. Katsilometes was aware that this was a unique judicial proceeding subject to special rules. Katsilometes specifically asked for attorney's fees in his petition. And Katsilometes was provided \"with notice and an opportunity to be heard\" when the Senate gave him the procedural order and a hearing.\n    <em>\n     Bradbury,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428415\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/63/#p72\">\n     136 Idaho at 72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428415\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/63/#p72\">\n     28 P.3d at 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Senate informed Katsilometes that it would operate under Article III, section 9 and that the procedural order did not \"limit[ ] or restrict[ ]\" the performance of that duty. Katsilometes persisted in his claim and received a hearing. Katsilometes submitted a brief and was given time to present his case. As mentioned, the Attorney General's Office gave a summary of the governing law and stated that attorney's fees were a matter of discretion and the Senate could determine how to interpret \"costs\" in the statute. If the Attorney General's Office was able to research and come to this conclusion, then Katsilometes either failed to research this fact or simply disagreed with it. Either way, Katsilometes had notice that assessment of attorney's fees was a possibility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Given these considerations, I cannot say that the Senate \"arbitrarily deprived\" Katsilometes of his rights by failing to meet the \"minimal requirements\" of procedural due process when it awarded attorney's fees against him.\n    <em>\n     Bradbury,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428415\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/63/#p72\">\n     136 Idaho at 72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428415\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/63/#p72\">\n     28 P.3d at 1015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
