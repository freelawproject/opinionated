He argues that the trial court erred when it imposed bail and denied him pretrial release based on personal recognizance and by ruling that the validity of a foreign protection order\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not an element of the offense of violation of a\n   domestic violence court under RCW 26.50.110(1)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that although the bail issue is moot, we reach the issue because it is a matter of public importance; the trial court was not required to enter findings; the trial court erred by imposing bail without first considering less restrictive alternatives and Ingram's financial resources; and the validity of the foreign protection order is not an element of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we hold that remand for reevaluation of several legal financial obligations (LFOs) is required and do not reach Ingram's pro se ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised\n   in his statement of additional grounds (SAG)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because that claim involves matters outside the appellate record. Accordingly, we affirm Ingram's convictions, but we remand for the trial court to reexamine the LFOs consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. CHARGES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On November 30, 2016, Tiffany Ingram obtained a restraining order in Oregon (Oregon order), prohibiting her husband Ingram from entering or remaining in the area within 150 feet of her current or future residence. The Oregon order stated that the addresses of these locations were being withheld for safety reasons. In another section, the Oregon court struck additional language that stated, \"Stay away from home on Rossiter, mother[']s on Alder, Sister[']s on Hood pl [sic] and Grandmother[']s on Riverview.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 56. Tiffany\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided the Oregon\n   court with a \"safe\" \"[r]esidence/[c]ontact [a]ddress,\" in Portland. CP at 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 On December 1, Tiffany, who had been staying with relatives in Oregon, returned to the home on Rossiter Lane that she and Ingram had shared, locked up the home, and turned off the lights. The next day, she drove past the home and saw that there were lights on inside. Tiffany called the police. The police found Ingram inside the home, and Ingram showed them a copy of the Oregon order. The police arrested Ingram.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. PRETRIAL AND TRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The State charged Ingram with residential burglary (domestic violence) and a gross misdemeanor violation of a domestic violence court order. Ingram pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A. RISK ASSESSMENT AND BAIL HEARINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Ingram was booked into jail on December 2. On December 4, based on the statement of probable cause, a judge certified that there was probable cause to arrest Ingram. A court date was set for December 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 In a December 4 risk assessment, the Clark County Corrections Release Unit assigned Ingram a \"risk score\" of four, which fell between a medium risk (three) and a high risk (five). The release unit's assessment noted that Ingram reported that (1) he had lived by himself in Vancouver, Washington, for the past two and a half years, (2) he had previously lived in Portland, Oregon, (3) he had no family in Clark County, (4) he had not provided any references, and (5) he was unemployed. The assessment further stated that Ingram (1) had a history of escape, (2) was currently on probation on an Oregon driving-related charge, (3) had a criminal history, (4) had prior failures to appear but no bail jump convictions, and (5) had mental health issues including anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder and had\n   received prior psychiatric treatment. Based on these facts and its risk assessment, the release unit recommended that Ingram be denied release \"due to extensive criminal, [failure to appear], and escape record.\" CP at 3. On December 4, a judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   also issued an order of conditions for release on bail stating that Ingram was not subject to bail until a court hearing set for December 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 At Ingram's first appearance on December 5, the State requested $60,000 bail. The State justified this request based on Ingram's prior convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm in 2007, second degree assault in 1997, second degree burglary in 1997, first degree escape in 1995, first degree robbery in 1994, and second degree robbery in 2001. The State also commented that Ingram had \"six different cases [in Oregon] that have gone to warrant\" and that he had \"prior [failures to appear] on his cases.\" 1 Report of Proceedings (RP) at 5. Defense counsel, who had just been appointed to Ingram's case and had just received the statement of probable cause, requested $5,000 bail after noting that the no contact order violation did not involve violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 The trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   set bail at $60,000 after commenting that when Tiffany applied for the restraining order, she had asserted that Ingram \"had recently held a gun to her head.\" 1 RP at 6. The trial court also stated that it would reexamine bail at the next hearing. It does not appear that the trial court entered any written findings related to the bail decision following the December 5, 2016 hearing. At no point during the hearing did the trial court discuss any less restrictive alternatives to bail or Ingram's financial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 On December 16,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingram was arraigned. He pleaded not guilty. Although the trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   had stated at the December 5 hearing that it would reexamine bail at the next hearing, no one raised any bail issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 On December 21, before a different judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingram requested that the court grant him supervised release. After arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the charges because the Oregon order was invalid, Ingram requested that the trial court amend the bail order and grant him supervised release because he did not \"have the funds to bail out\" and he had a legitimate challenge to the charges. 1 RP at 12. After hearing Ingram's criminal history and argument from the parties, the judge deferred this decision to the original trial court judge, effectively denying Ingram's request for supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 On December 28, before the first judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingram asked for a bail reduction based on his legal argument that the Oregon protection order was invalid. The trial court denied this request. The trial court commented that it had originally set bail based on \"criminal history, failures to appear, and [the] likelihood of reappearance in court,\" and that nothing had changed in relation to those factors. 1 RP at 22. During this hearing, there was no discussion of Ingram's financial status or any less restrictive conditions of release other than release on recognizance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. VALIDITY OF OREGON ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 At various stages of the pretrial proceedings, the parties addressed whether the validity of the Oregon order\n   could be raised before the jury. The trial court\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   ruled that Ingram could not \"challenge the validity of the order in Oregon in a Washington criminal case\" and that validity of the Oregon order was not an element of the offense. 1 RP at 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The State presented testimony from Tiffany and the officers who arrested Ingram. Ingram did not call any witnesses. The jury instructions for the violation of the court order did not require the jury to find that the Oregon order was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 The jury found Ingram guilty of residential burglary and violation of a domestic violence court order. Ingram appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I. BAIL ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Ingram contends that the trial court erred when it set his bail and refused to release him on his own recognizance and when it denied his renewed motions to reduce his bail requirement. Specifically, Ingram argues that the trial court (1) failed to enter oral or written findings, (2) failed to consider the factors required in CrR 3.2(c) and (e) and the record does not support findings under either subsection, (3) failed to consider less restrictive conditions of release or Ingram's financial resources before imposing the bail requirement, and (4) denied him effective assistance of counsel by not allowing\n   appointed defense counsel time to prepare for the initial bail hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   A. MATTER OF CONTINUING AND SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC INTEREST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 We must first address whether this issue is moot.

FINDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Ingram argues that the trial court was required to make \"specific findings under CrR 3.2(a)(1) or (2)\" and that the court failed to comply with this requirement. Appellant's Opening Br. at 29. He suggests that the absence of specific findings demonstrates that the trial court ignored the presumption of release on personal recognizance pending trial. Ingram fails to establish that oral or written findings are required, but we review the record to determine if the trial court considered the relevant factors before determining whether release on personal recognizance was appropriate or whether bail was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 Whether oral or written findings are required is a question of law, which this court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

And the trial court was aware of Ingram's current charges and was able to review the factual basis for those charges, including the fact that Tiffany had informed law enforcement officers that she had applied for the no contact order after Ingram held a gun to her head. Additionally, the State described Ingram's criminal history, including his escape conviction and prior failures to appear in several Oregon cases. The information before the trial court also showed that the release unit considered Ingram to be a medium to high flight risk; Ingram had a history of escape and failure to appear; he had no employment tying him to the community; no one had vouched for him; Ingram had ties to another state, including formerly residing in Oregon; and he had mental health issues.

FAILURE TO CONSIDER LESS RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS OF RELEASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b633 Ingram next argues that the trial court failed to comply with CrR 3.2(d) by failing to consider less restrictive conditions of release and when setting the bail amount. Because the trial court did not consider less restrictive conditions of release or Ingram's financial resources before imposing the $60,000 bond as required under both CrR 3.2(b) and CrR 3.2(d), this argument has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b634 CrR 3.2(b) requires that if the trial court determines that the accused is not likely to appear if released on personal recognizance, it must impose the least restrictive of several enumerated conditions.\n   <em>\n    Huckins\n   </em>\n   , 5 Wash.

CrR 3.2(b) also requires that if the trial court imposes a bond, the court must consider the defendant's financial resources. CrR 3.2(b)(7). Similarly, CrR 3.2(d) requires that if the trial court determines that the accused poses a substantial danger, the court is allowed to impose one or more of several enumerated conditions. If the trial court requires the defendant to \"post a secured or unsecured bond,\" the court can impose this condition only \"if no less restrictive condition or combination of conditions would reasonable assure the safety of the community.\" CrR 3.2(d)(6). Additionally, if the trial court requires a bond, the court must consider, \"on the available information, the accused's financial resources for the purposes of setting a bond that will reasonably assure the safety of the community and prevent the defendant from intimidating witnesses or otherwise unlawfully interfering with the administration of justice.\" CrR 3.2(d)(6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b635 Regardless of whether the trial court imposed bail to ensure Ingram's appearance or to protect the public, the court was required to consider less restrictive alternatives\n   and to consider Ingram's financial resources. CrR 3.2(b)(7), (d)(6). There is nothing in the record suggesting that the trial court did either before setting bail. Thus, Ingram can show that the trial court erred by imposing the $60,000 bond. But because Ingram has been convicted and is no longer subject to pretrial bail or conditions, there is no relief that we can offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   E. DENIAL OF EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b636 Ingram also argues that the bail hearing \"might have gone a different way\" if he had not been forced to rely on newly assigned counsel who had no knowledge of the case or Ingram's personal circumstances. Appellant's Opening Br. at 46. He suggests that with time to prepare, defense counsel would have been better prepared in relation to the facts and the law. Because Ingram cites no law in support of this argument beyond general law stating that effective assistance of counsel requires more than just having counsel physically present, we decline to address this issue.
