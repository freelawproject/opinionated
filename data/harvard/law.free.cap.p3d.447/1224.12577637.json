We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Dominguez went to a club with three male friends-his eventual codefendants Eric Duran, Davy Ray Martinez (D. Martinez), and Jaime Martinez (J. Martinez)-and two female friends. The group met Victim for the first time at the club. Victim had been drinking heavily. Victim invited the group, along with another woman (Witness) and her two male friends to come to his apartment to continue drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 While walking to Victim's apartment from the car, Victim put his arm around one of Dominguez's female friends and touched her breast.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This upset J. Martinez, who told Victim not to touch his \"girl.\" Victim made some form of apology, which apparently diffused the situation, and the group continued to Victim's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 When the group arrived at Victim's apartment, they continued drinking. Victim was pushy with Dominguez and his friends, insisting that they \"sit down\" when they did not want to and telling them they could not play music on their phones. According to Dominguez, Victim then began goading them, stating, \"You guys think you're so bad. I bet I could take all four of you on.\" He then pushed Duran, who retaliated by punching Victim. The fight escalated, and all four codefendants attacked Victim, punching and kicking him in the face and body. At some point,\n   the fighting stopped long enough for Victim to run into his bedroom and lock the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 When the fight between the men first began, and before Victim escaped to his bedroom, Dominguez's two female friends were in the bedroom. At some point during the fighting, they left the bedroom and apparently saw the fight going on in the hallway. Dominguez and one of the women testified that the two women ran back into the bedroom when they saw the fighting and were inside the room when Victim ran in and locked the door behind him. In contrast, Victim and Witness testified that the women did not go back into the bedroom and were outside the room when Victim locked himself inside. And another witness, one of Witness's male friends, testified that he did not see anyone else in the bedroom when Victim shut the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 After Victim locked himself in his bedroom, the codefendants broke down the door. According to Dominguez, their purpose for breaking down the door was to rescue the two women because they could hear the women screaming and were worried about their safety due to Victim's earlier aggressiveness and his touching one of the women. When the door gave way, the codefendants rushed in and began punching and kicking Victim again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Eventually, the codefendants finished beating Victim and ran out of the apartment. When they left, Witness went into the bedroom to check on Victim. While she was there, Duran returned to the apartment. According to Witness, Duran held up Victim's keys and told him, \"We've got your keys. Give me your wallet.\" Victim began to pull out his wallet, and Witness stood in the door and told Duran to leave. He responded, \"Move, bitch, I'm going to stab this fool.\" Witness told him, \"Nobody's stabbing nobody,\" at which point D. Martinez \"walked up ... behind\" Duran and punched Witness in the face. Witness fell to the floor and blacked out. When she regained consciousness, Dominguez was in the room, and she saw him punch Victim three more times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 All four codefendants were charged with aggravated burglary based on the allegation that they broke into the bedroom for the purpose of assaulting Victim, along with lesser included offenses of assault. Duran and D. Martinez were also charged with aggravated robbery, and D. Martinez was charged with an additional assault in connection with the allegation that he hit Witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Following the incident, Witness gave a statement to police regarding the location of Dominguez's two female friends during the fighting. She stated, \"The girls were in the back bedroom and ran out when the boys went in the bedroom.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, defense counsel confronted Witness with this statement, attempting to impeach her trial testimony that the women left the room before Victim locked himself inside. Witness explained the discrepancy by clarifying, \"What I meant by 'running out,' is running out of the apartment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Prior to trial, the court granted a motion in limine to exclude Dominguez's criminal record from the State's case-in-chief. Nevertheless, at one point in the trial, one of the police officers who investigated the case (Officer) was asked, \"[D]id you run Julio Dominguez's history and access his driver's license photograph?\" Officer responded, \"I don't remember exactly how I was able to identify him. I believe it was through his mug shot that we have on file.\" Defense counsel objected, and the court conducted a discussion at the bench off the record. The prosecutor then continued with a different line of questioning. Defense counsel subsequently moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, concluding that although the statement was clearly inadmissible and potentially prejudicial, Officer's statement was inadvertent\n   and any damage was mitigated because defense counsel did not draw attention to it and the prosecution moved to a different line of inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Dominguez's counsel requested a jury instruction on defense of others, and the primary defense asserted at trial was that Dominguez and his codefendants were justified in breaking down Victim's bedroom door because they did so with the purpose of protecting the women, who were locked in the room with Victim. Counsel approved the following jury instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A person is justified in threatening or using force against another when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that force is necessary to defend himself or a third person against such other's imminent use of unlawful force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In determining imminence or reasonableness, the trier of fact may consider, but is not limited to, any of the following factors:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) the nature of the danger;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) the immediacy of the danger;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) the probability that the unlawful force would result in death or serious bodily injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (4) the other's prior violent acts or violent propensities; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (5) any patterns of abuse or violence in the parties' relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A person does not have a duty to retreat from the force or threatened force stated above in a place where that person has lawfully entered or remained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A person is not justified in using force if the person was the aggressor or was engaged in a combat by agreement, unless the person withdraws from the encounter and effectively communicates to the other person his intent to do so and, notwithstanding, the other person continues or threatens to continue the use of unlawful force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant is not required to prove that the defense applies. Rather, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not apply. The State has the burden of proof at all times. If the State has not carried this burden, the jury should find the defendant not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Counsel also approved the placement of the defense-of-others instruction at the end of the instructions providing definitions for various terms rather than within the instructions setting forth the elements of the crime with which Dominguez was charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b612 Following a three-day trial, in which the codefendants were tried together, the jury found all four codefendants guilty of aggravated burglary but acquitted Duran and D. Martinez of the other charges. Dominguez was sentenced to ten years to life in prison for aggravated burglary. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b613 Dominguez first argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a jury instruction explicitly linking the defense-of-others instruction to the aggravated burglary charge. \"An ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on appeal presents a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334931\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/880/\">\n    2009 UT App 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7334931\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/204/880/\">\n    204 P.3d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b614 Dominguez next asserts that counsel was ineffective for inaccurately quoting Witness's police statement when attempting to impeach her and for failing to confront her with her recorded police statement. Because the record on appeal does not contain the recorded statement, Dominguez has requested that we remand the case pursuant to rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure to permit the trial court to supplement the record with additional findings. In determining whether rule 23B remand is appropriate, we must assess whether Dominguez has made \" 'a nonspeculative allegation of facts, not fully appearing in the record on appeal, which, if true, could support a determination that counsel was ineffective.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. P. 23B(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b615 Finally, Dominguez challenges the trial court's denial of his motion for mistrial. \"A trial court's denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be reversed absent an abuse\n   of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel Was Not Ineffective for Not Objecting to the Defense-of-Others Jury Instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b616 Dominguez first argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request jury instructions-or at least better placement of jury instructions-that would explicitly link the defense-of-others affirmative defense to the aggravated burglary charge. To prevail on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate, first, \"that counsel's performance was deficient, in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonable professional judgment\" and, second, \"that counsel's deficient performance was prejudicial-i.e., that it affected the outcome of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , although the defendant was charged with several crimes, the separate self-defense instruction specifically linked the affirmative defense to the murder charge and lesser-included manslaughter charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    2014 UT App 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 1, 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    318 P.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was charged with only one crime-aggravated assault-so there was no danger of the jury confusing which crime the affirmative defense applied to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Painter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6901717\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/339/107/\">\n    2014 UT App 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6901717\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/339/107/\">\n    339 P.3d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b619 Here, there is no language explicitly linking the defense-of-others instruction to the aggravated burglary charge. The instruction simply informs the jury of the legal standard for a defense-of-others affirmative defense as well as the State's burden of proof with respect to that defense. Dominguez claims that the instruction's failure to explicitly link defense of others to the aggravated burglary charge left the jury with no information as to how to apply the defense. He further asserts that defense of others does not intuitively apply to the elements of burglary and that there was therefore a danger that the jury would apply the defense to one of the other charges-aggravated robbery or assault-and not believe that defense of others is a defense to aggravated burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b620 In reviewing the adequacy of jury instructions, \"we look at the jury instructions in their entirety and will affirm when the instructions taken as a whole fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    2014 UT App 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    318 P.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). We must also \"consider a reasonable jury's understanding in the context of the jury instructions and the record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Crowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6948771\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/677/\">\n    2014 UT App 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6948771\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/677/\">\n    320 P.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). \"Even if one or more of the instructions, standing alone, are not as full or accurate as they might have been, counsel is\n   not deficient in approving the instructions as long as the trial court's instructions constituted a correct statement of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    2014 UT App 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272493\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1164/\">\n    318 P.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b621 There is no dispute that the defense-of-others instruction accurately instructed the jury regarding the applicable law, including the State's burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, as in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the jury was instructed that \"[a]ll the instructions are important,\" to \"consider them as a whole,\" and that the \"order in which [they] are given\" had no bearing on their importance.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. While the defense-of-others instruction was given in the context of multiple charges without specifying the charge to which it applied, we have no basis for concluding that the jury would have interpreted this lack of specificity to mean that the defense did not apply to the aggravated burglary charge. Rather, the lack of language linking the instruction to a specific charge would most logically have been read as an instruction that the State was required to disprove defense of others with respect to all of the charges, including aggravated burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b622 Further, even assuming, as Dominguez asserts, that defense of others is not intuitively linked to an aggravated burglary charge, the link was apparent in the context of this case. Indeed, as in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , this affirmative defense was \"the central theme of [Dominguez's] defense at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The entire trial focused on the question of the defendants' motivation for entering Victim's room-was it for the purpose of protecting two women trapped in the room with Victim, or was it for the purpose of continuing to assault Victim? If there was any question as to the applicability of defense of others to the aggravated burglary charges, it was cleared up by the codefendants' counsel in closing arguments, each of whom clearly argued that their clients should be acquitted of aggravated burglary based on defense of others. Dominguez's counsel stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   So if that's the purpose of their breaking down the door and going in there ... it's a defense of others. ... They had a right to defend those young ladies. They did what they should have done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   .... [I]n order to find ... any of the [defendants] guilty of the aggravated burglary, ... the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the intent when they broke in that door was to assault, and not to save these girls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   So at the end of the day I'm asking you to find [Dominguez] not guilty of aggravated burglary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Duran's counsel likewise explained that it was \"right\" for the defendants to \"break down the door to come to the aid of\" the two women, and J. Martinez's counsel explained that the defendants entered the room for the purpose of \"get[ting] the gals out.\" Finally, D. Martinez's attorney explicitly linked the defense-of-others instruction to the aggravated burglary charge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Instruction No. 60 is ... about defense of self or others. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Just be clear that we're not talking about these four individuals defending themselves against [Victim]. We're talking about them going into the bedroom to defend the two ladies from [Victim], okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   So that's what this instruction has to do with. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ....

She testified that the two women were in the bedroom when the fight initially broke out in the hallway but that they came out of the bedroom when \"the defendants were fighting\" and were no longer in the bedroom when Victim locked himself in. At trial, defense counsel attempted to undermine Witness's credibility on this point by confronting her with a prior statement she made to police in which she appeared to be stating that the women were in the room when the defendants broke in. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Witness whether she had previously told police, \"The girls were in the back bedroom and ran out when the boys went in the bedroom\" (the paraphrased statement). Witness did not deny making the statement but pointed out that while she had stated that the girls \"ran out,\" she did not \"specify where from.\" She then clarified, \"What I meant by 'running out,' is running out of the apartment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b627 In the affidavit supporting his rule 23B motion, Dominguez's counsel averred that she had listened to the audio recording of Witness's police statement and that Witness actually stated, \"They were in the back of the bedroom, and then once the boys all got in the bedroom, the girls ran out and went out probably to the car, I'm guessing\" (the recorded statement). In his rule 23B motion, Dominguez asserts that had counsel confronted Witness with the recorded statement, the jury would have been more likely to discount her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b628 Dominguez argues that the statement that \"the girls\n   <em>\n    ran out\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    went out\n   </em>\n   probably to the car,\" identifies two instances of leaving such that had the jury been presented with the actual recorded statement, it would have had no choice but to conclude that the first instance-\"the girls ran out\"-described their running out of the bedroom while the second instance-the girls \"went out\"-described their leaving the apartment. Because the paraphrased statement described only one instance of leaving-the girls \"ran out\"-Dominguez maintains that the jury was more likely to accept Witness's explanation that she meant that the girls \"ran out\" of the apartment than it would have been had it been confronted with the recorded statement. He also asserts that the phrase \"in the back\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   the bedroom,\" used in the recording, undermines Witness's explanation more than the phrase \"in the back bedroom,\" as paraphrased by defense counsel at trial, because being in the back of the bedroom as opposed to simply being in the bedroom \"supports more fully the testimony that the women were stuck in the bedroom with [Victim] and were afraid of him-they were in the back of the bedroom to get as far away from [Victim] as they could.\" Finally, he asserts that the recorded statement, \"once the boys all got in the bedroom, the girls ran out,\" is more supportive of the idea that the girls were in the bedroom when the defendants broke in than the paraphrase, \"The girls were in the back bedroom and ran out when the boys went in the bedroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b629 We agree with the State that the distinctions drawn by Dominguez between the recorded statement and the paraphrased statement are too subtle to have likely impacted the outcome of the trial. The jury was required to rely on its memory as to the precise wording of the statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was unlikely to have recalled this language so vividly that it would have parsed the individual phrases in the way that appellate counsel has done. And even if it had done so, the recorded statement is still ambiguous, just as the paraphrased statement was. Neither statement explicitly states whether the women \"ran out\" of the bedroom or whether they \"ran out\" of the apartment. There is no reason to believe that Witness would have responded any differently if confronted with the recorded statement than she did when confronted with the paraphrased statement. That is, she still would have offered her explanation that she meant that the women left the apartment when the defendants broke down the door, not that they left the bedroom, and the jury would have been left to determine which explanation it believed. We are not convinced that the jury was likely to have found Witness measurably less credible had it been presented with the recorded statement rather than the paraphrased statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   III. The Trial Court Did Not Err in Denying Dominguez's Motion for Mistrial, Because Officer's Reference to Dominguez's Mug Shot Was Harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b630 Finally, Dominguez asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial because he was unfairly prejudiced by Officer's reference to his mug shot. The State does not contest Dominguez's assertion that Officer's statement was improper but argues that it is not reversible error because \"a mistrial is not required where an improper statement is not intentionally elicited, is made in passing, and is relatively innocuous in light of all the testimony presented.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree. The question about running Dominguez's history was explicitly linked to Officer accessing his driver license photo as a means of identification. Thus, the question is more properly interpreted as a reference to Dominguez's driving history than a reference to his criminal history. Further, the single reference to the mug shot in the course of a three-day trial was innocuous, the discussion regarding Dominguez's objection was held off the record, and the prosecutor quickly moved on to different topics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, Dominguez has failed to show that remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure has the potential to establish facts that could support a determination that counsel was ineffective for using the paraphrased statement rather than the recorded statement to impeach Witness. Finally, because Dominguez's criminal record was admitted as impeachment evidence, the trial court did not exceed its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial based on Officer's innocuous reference to Dominguez's mug shot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we deny Dominguez's request for rule 23B remand and affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Testimony at trial conflicted as to whether the touching was intentional or unintentional.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    We quote the statement as recited by defense counsel in his questioning of Witness, since that is the statement contained in the record on appeal.
