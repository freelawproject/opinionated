As they continued to approach, they saw the man exit the pickup and attempt to get into their nearby parked car. At that point, Kelsey yelled at the man, causing him to run away with Kelsey in pursuit. Before Christopher caught up with them, McCarthy stopped, turned around, and struck Kelsey, scratching her chest with a pen. The man then again ran away with Kelsey in pursuit and Christopher still lagging behind. At some point, McCarthy stopped to confront Kelsey again. This time, however, Christopher had caught up, jumped between them, and briefly grappled with McCarthy before he broke free and ran out of sight. In response to Kelsey's 911 call, Bozeman police officers quickly arrived on scene in numbers and spoke with the couple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 After stepping away from police to see if anything was missing from their pickup, the couple saw McCarthy reappear, running past them toward the end of the street where it dead-ended at Bozeman Creek. Christopher pursued the man toward the creek while Kelsey alerted the police. As McCarthy went into the creek, Officer Lloyd caught up, drew his sidearm, and ordered McCarthy to\n   stop and raise his hands. When McCarthy was slow to respond, Officer Lloyd threatened to shoot him if he did not comply. McCarthy then complied. After a second officer arrived at the creek and held McCarthy at bay at Taser-point, Lloyd approached and gripped McCarthy by an arm to cuff and arrest him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Officer Lloyd testified at trial that McCarthy then tensed up and attempted to pull free. Lloyd testified that, as McCarthy continued to struggle to break free, he punched McCarthy several times in the midsection to terminate his resistance and force him to submit to arrest. Lloyd and McCarthy fell to the ground as the struggle continued, with McCarthy face-down, holding his hands in underneath his body. Lloyd testified that McCarthy continued to defiantly hold his hands in despite repeated commands to show his hands and unsuccessful attempts by Lloyd to physically pull his hands out to subdue and cuff him. Lloyd further testified that during the process, he again repeatedly punched McCarthy in the side in an attempt to force him to submit to arrest. Meanwhile, a third officer (Officer Chaffins) soon joined the fray and also repeatedly punched McCarthy to force him into submission. The officers' body cameras revealed the two officers on the ground struggling with McCarthy, punching and\n   kneeing him, with another standing nearby.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers eventually subdued and arrested McCarthy and had him transported to the hospital by ambulance for medical care. Officer Lloyd subsequently cited McCarthy into the City of Bozeman Municipal Court on two counts of assault, criminal trespass to a motor vehicle, obstructing a peace officer, and resisting arrest-all misdemeanors in violation of Title 45, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In a contentious pretrial discovery process, the State ultimately provided a broad swath of investigative information compiled by the Bozeman Police Department regarding the incident. The State refused, however, to permit discovery of the requested internal police department use-of-force policy, related use-of-force reports and dispositions regarding the McCarthy incident, and the involved officers' pre-incident \"personnel records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 On February 9, 2016, McCarthy filed a motion to compel discovery of the disputed information pursuant to \u00a7 46-15-322(1) and (5), MCA. Without further explanation, the motion cursorily asserted that the disputed items of information were relevant to the circumstances of McCarthy's arrest and his contemplated defense that he was physically unable to obstruct and resist his arrest as alleged. In opposition, the State asserted that the disputed items of information were outside the scope of discovery separately required by \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA (required scope of state disclosure in ordinary course), and the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (exculpatory information and other constitutionally material information\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Based on the \"abundance\" of incident-specific discovery already provided under \u00a7\u00a7 46-15-322(1), 45-7-301(2), and -302(2), MCA (legality of arrest no defense to obstructing or resisting arrest), and the written representation of the deputy police chief that the disputed information was not\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   information, the State asserted that McCarthy further failed to show \"substantial need\" for the disputed information under \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA (discovery information not otherwise provided for by \u00a7 46-15-322(1) - (2) ). In the contingent event that the court may nonetheless find that McCarthy had shown \"substantial need\" for the officers' incident-specific use-of-force\n   reports/dispositions or related prior disciplinary histories, the State asserted that an\n   <em>\n    in camera inspection\n   </em>\n   would be necessary to balance McCarthy's asserted need with the officers' rights to individual privacy under Montana Constitution Article II, Section 10. Asserting that a showing of \"substantial need\" under \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA, precludes any consideration of the officers' privacy rights, McCarthy opposed the State's request for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection.\n   \u00b68 Without conducting an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection, the Municipal Court compelled the State to provide discovery of the police department's use-of-force policy and related incident-specific use-of-force reports and dispositions regarding the officers. The court reasoned that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   all information ... pertaining to [McCarthy's] arrest is entirely within the purview of \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, because it\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   constitute a \"statement\" by the officers whom the State may rely on at trial ... and most, if not all, of the information could mitigate or negate [his] guilt or may reduce his potential sentence ... because it would provide additional details pertaining to the basis of the criminal charges against [him].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis added.) However, without reference to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   standards, the court denied McCarthy's request for discovery of the officers' prior personnel records, concluding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   employment records are subject to the right to privacy set forth in [ ] Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution ... [and that i]n balancing the Defendant's right to know with [the officers'] right to privacy in their respective personnel records, [the officers'] demand for privacy exceeds the merits of disclosure to the Defendant in this instance. [McCarthy]\n   <em>\n    has not shown substantial need\n   </em>\n   for the personnel records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69 In a separate pretrial matter, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   pursuant to M. R. Evid. 402 - 03 to preclude McCarthy from presenting examining physician testimony regarding the nature and extent of injuries he sustained incident to the arrest (five fractured ribs and a partially collapsed lung). The State conceded that information describing \"the sequence of events\" regarding McCarthy's \"arrest or actions by those involved\" was generally \"relevant\" to the charged offenses but asserted that any \"medical information collected thereafter does not have any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is [of] consequence\" to the charged offenses \"more or less probable....\" McCarthy contrarily asserted that the nature and extent of his injuries tended to prove that he was in fact physically unable to resist and obstruct the arrest as alleged. The Municipal Court reserved\n   judgment pending consideration in the context of the actual trial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 At trial, McCarthy made an offer of proof that the proffered testimony of the physician who examined him the next day was relevant to show the amount of force, i.e., excessive force, used by the arresting officers. The State reasserted its prior objections pursuant to M. R. Evid. 402 - 03. Noting that the physician did not examine McCarthy until the next day and that Officer Lloyd had already testified regarding his injuries, the Municipal Court rejected the offer of proof and excluded the proffered physician testimony. After a two-day trial, the jury found McCarthy guilty on all counts as charged. He appealed to the Montana Eighteenth Judicial District Court. The District Court affirmed. McCarthy timely appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 On appeal from municipal courts of record, district courts functions as intermediate courts of appeal with the scope of review limited to \"the record and questions of law. ...\" Sections 3-6-110(1), 3-5-303, MCA.

Accordingly, in explicitly denying McCarthy's motion with reference to the officers' rights to privacy, the Municipal Court implicitly rejected or subordinated his predicate assertion of \"substantial need\" under \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA. Though his asserted purpose was to discover any prior history of the arresting officers' use of excessive force, McCarthy has yet to particularly articulate or show what legitimate \"substantial need\" he had for that information in the defense of this case as required by \u00a7 46-15-322(5), MCA.

R. Evid. 402 - 03, the Municipal Court excluded defense-proffered physician testimony regarding the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by McCarthy incident to his arrest. The court reasoned that the testimony was only marginally relevant, if at all, given the elements of the offenses of obstructing and resisting a peace officer, the fact that Officer Lloyd had already testified regarding McCarthy's injuries incident to arrest, and that the physician did not examine him until the next day. The court thus essentially concluded that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value of the proffered testimony. McCarthy asserts that the court erroneously applied M. R. Evid. 403 because the nature and extent of his injuries were highly relevant to whether he \"was physically incapable of resisting or obstructing, and [that] his conduct was consistent with [merely] defending himself against the punches and kicks\" rather than knowingly obstructing and resisting the officers' attempt to arrest him as alleged. He asserts that Officer Lloyd's \"non-medical, brief and general narrative\" account of his injuries was insufficient to adequately support his asserted defense theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 All evidence probative of a fact at issue is generally admissible. M. R. Evid. 402. Here, the State tacitly concedes that the proffered physician testimony had at least some marginal relevance in furtherance of McCarthy's asserted defense theory. However, a trial court may nonetheless exclude otherwise relevant evidence if its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" M. R. Evid. 403. While all probative evidence is generally prejudicial to the opposing party, evidence is \"\n   <em>\n    unfairly\n   </em>\n   prejudicial only if it arouses the jury's hostility or sympathy for one side without regard to its probative value, if it confuses or misleads the trier of fact, or if it unduly distracts from the main issues.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lloyd testified that McCarthy was taken to the emergency room for x-rays and treated for a collapsed lung among other injuries. Two of the officers' body camera video/audio recordings captured the struggle with McCarthy on the ground, revealing at least two officers repeatedly punching, kneeing, and kicking him in the side, his verbal wailing and other expressions of pain, his resulting inability to stand and walk without assistance, and his repeated post-custody exclamations or questions as to why or how the officers \"kicked the shit out of [him].\" Though the physician could have testified that McCarthy's injuries were consistent with being repeatedly punched and kicked, the proffered testimony was limited to the nature and extent of McCarthy's injuries as observed the next day and could not account for the circumstances under which the injuries occurred or how they in fact affected his intent or ability to obstruct and resist as alleged by the State.

Evid. 402, the injuries sustained by McCarthy\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   his alleged refusal to comply with\n   officer commands and his pre-injury physical resistance to the officers' initial use of force are not probative of whether he obstructed or resisted prior to that resulting use of force and injury.

Under these circumstances, the primary, if not exclusive, purpose and effect of\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   evidence regarding the nature and extent of his injuries would have been to create sympathy for McCarthy, and prejudice against the officers regarding the amount of force used, thus inviting the jury to decide his guilt or innocence on that basis rather than the sufficiency of the State's proof on the elements of the charged offenses. Given these circumstances, we cannot say that the Municipal Court abused its discretion under M. R. Evid. 403.

The issue is therefore subject to review on direct appeal only as plain error, in our discretion. In that regard, substantial record evidence manifests that Officer Lloyd was immediately pursuing and then attempting to apprehend McCarthy in response to a 911 report of criminal activity and Kelsey's subsequent on-scene alert and identification of him as a suspect in that activity. Lloyd testified that after identifying himself as a police officer, he commanded McCarthy to place his hands in the air and that he did not immediately comply.
