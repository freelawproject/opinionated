The District Court held the Department could properly centrally assess Vision Net's property, resulting in a significant increase in the company's state tax liability. Vision Net argues that DOR's central assessment violated statute and the company's constitutional rights of equal protection and equalization under Article II, \u00a7 4 and Article VII, \u00a7 3 of the Montana Constitution. We affirm and address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by holding the Department properly centrally assessed Vision Net's property?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Vision Net is a Montana corporation headquartered in Great Falls, collectively owned by nine telephone companies, but is not a subsidiary of any other company. Vision Net provides internet-related services to Montana customers, including two-way video conferencing, internet connections, technical consulting, and network management, among other things. Vision Net owns telecommunications equipment that is positioned in thirty-two Montana counties and connected by fiber optic cables that transport customer data across the network. As of 2015, Vision Net owned 7.43 miles of fiber cable, all of which was located within the separate boundaries of Yellowstone County, Lewis and Clark County, and Flathead County. None of the cable owned by Vision Net physically crosses state or county lines. Vision Net also leases access to additional cable. Telephone companies and cooperatives own fiber optic cables that stretch across Montana and into other states. To connect its telecommunications equipment and create its state-wide network, Vision Net leases access to \"dark fiber\"-an industry term referring to individual strands of unused fiber within a fiber optic cable-from other telephone companies. By entering \"indefeasible right\n   of use\" agreements with telephone companies, Vision Net obtains access to fiber that crosses county lines, connects its equipment, and ultimately provides network services to its Montana customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Vision Net monitors and maintains its network from the company's Network Operations Center located in Great Falls. The Center\n   operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, and 365 days per year. The Great Falls location serves as Vision Net's principal office, which houses the company's CEO, business operations, and customer service call center. Vision Net also manages its centralized billing system from the Great Falls office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Historically, Vision Net's properties have been locally assessed by the counties in which the property is located, and were classified by the Department as Class Four commercial and Class Eight business equipment, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 15-6-134, -138, MCA. In 2015, the Department, pursuant to \u00a7 15-8-601(1), MCA, reclassified Vision Net as a centrally assessed company under \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA, placing its properties within Class Thirteen pursuant to \u00a7 15-6-156(1), MCA, which increased Vision Net's total tax liability by over 300%. To avoid a claim of double taxation, the Department removed the value of the fiber leased by Vision Net from the valuation of the company, choosing instead to tax the telephone companies for the entire fiber cable lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Vision Net filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment in April 2016, challenging the Department's decision to reclassify Vision Net's property as a violation of Montana statutory and constitutional rights. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the District Court held oral argument on the motions in January 2018, after which the District Court granted summary judgment to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 We review a district court's ruling on summary judgement de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court according to M.

Vision Net argues it is not subject to central assessment because \"[i]t does not operate a single and continuous intercounty property\" as required under the statute. Vision Net acknowledges that it owns property throughout the state, but contends because none of its owned property crosses county lines, it does not qualify for central assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 The Department answers that even though Vision Net's network includes some leased property, the company nonetheless still operates a single and continuous property in more than one county, subjecting it to central assessment. The Department argues Vision Net operates as a \"functionally integrated property\" that broadly provides internet services to Montana customers across the state. The District Court agreed, concluding Vision Net satisfied the operational requirements of \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA, and is subject to central assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b610 Vision Net argues it neither owns nor operates \"a single and continuous intercounty property\" because, first, only its leased fiber optic cables cross county lines. Vision Net cites to its fiber lease agreements with the telephone companies, which, as the District Court found, \"expressly assign[ ] to the telephone company the responsibility to design, engineer, install, and construct the fiber optic system.\" Comparing its use with the array of responsibilities vested in the\n   telephone companies to maintain and control the leased intercounty cables, Vision Net contends that, at most, its actions amount to \"use\" of the cables, not \"operation\" as required by \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 Initially, we note that \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA, is not a model of clarity, employing double uses of the terms \"property\" and \"operate\" within its single clause. Ownership of the property is considered in the determination of central assessment, but the operative phrase in the provision is \"a single and continuous property operated in more than one county,\" and thus the question is broader than a consideration of ownership. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Bresnan Communs., LLC v. State Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043150\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/29/4043150/\">\n    2013 MT 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041944,4043150\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/29/\">\n    373 Mont. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043150\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/373/29/4043150/\">\n    315 P.3d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[p]roperties that enjoy a unity of ownership and devotion to a single use qualify as single and continuous properties\" (citing\n   <em>\n    W.

Bresnan owned equipment in twenty Montana counties and upgraded its network so that it could also provide fiber optic internet and telephone service to customers in those counties.\n   <em>\n    Bresnan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47. We noted that Bresnan operated a continuous network across county lines, managed operations from a central location, enjoyed the benefits of centralized billing, and overall operated in an \"integrated fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Bresnan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 Similarly, here, Vision Net owns equipment in thirty-two counties across the state of Montana that are connected by fiber optic cables, some of which are intra-county cables owned by Vision Net, and other cables that are leased from telephone companies. This connected network is monitored from Vision Net's Operations Center, where other business operations such as centralized billing and customer support are also coordinated. Vision Net uses its network to provide internet-based services to customers throughout the state. Although Vision Net leases connecting cable, its network as a whole is \"functionally integrated over a wide area,\" allowing the company to \"enjoy a unity of use and management,\" and is operated as a single and continuous property.\n   <em>\n    Bresnan\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Despite these aspects of a single property, Vision Net argues it does not satisfy the definition of \"operating\" the leased fiber optic\n   cables as necessary under the statute. As Vision Net notes, \"operate\" is not defined under the statute or other applicable laws and therefore, offers various dictionary definitions to argue that \"operating\" requires physical and exclusive control. However, none of these offered definitions of \"operate\" require an act to be performed exclusively by one party at one time. In\n   <em>\n    Mont. Dep't of Revenue v. Priceline.com, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343029\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/380/352/\">\n    2015 MT 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343029\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/380/352/\">\n    380 Mont. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343029\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/380/352/\">\n    354 P.3d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we held that one definition of \"operate\" is \"to manage and put or keep in operation whether with personal effort or not.\"\n   <em>\n    Priceline\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pitt Cnty. v. Hotels.com, LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717487\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/308/#p313\">\n    553 F.3d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1580-81 (2002))). Vision Net satisfies this definition. The company manages traffic over the leased fiber and ensures that it continues to operate\n   within the network by constantly monitoring the flow of data across the state from its Network Operations Center. The fact that the fiber leasing agreements give the telephone companies exclusive right to physically repair and maintain the fiber does not mean Vision Net is not also using the lines to \"operate\" its connected system. Given its unfettered right to use and monitor the fiber, Vision Net's use of the lines in conjunction with the remainder of its network satisfies the definition of \"operate[ ]\" in \u00a7 15-23-101(2), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 After considering both the physical attributes and the use and functioning of the property, we conclude that Vision Net is operating a single and continuous property in more than one county, and that the District Court correctly held that it was subject to central assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 Finally, Vision Net argues the Department \"treat[ed] Vision Net differently than other similarly situated entities\" by centrally assessing Vision Net while not doing so to companies that also \"lease and use fiber to transport data,\" and therefore, as applied by the Department, \u00a7 15-23-101, MCA, violates its rights to equal protection and equalization under the Montana Constitution. Article II, \u00a7 4 of the Montana Constitution guarantees that no one \"shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.\" Article VIII, \u00a7 3 of the Montana Constitution carries equal protection into the tax realm by requiring the state to \"appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 We have long held that \"the first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.\"\n   <em>\n    PPL Mont., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \" 'If the classes are not similarly situated,\n   then ... it is not necessary for us to analyze the challenge further.' \"\n   <em>\n    Donaldson v.

Vision Net asserts it was unlawful for the Department to centrally assess its properties when \"[a] number of other entities including banking institutions, accounting firms, and law firms lease access to dark fiber to transfer data between locations in Montana,\" yet are not also centrally assessed.

As discussed above, a variety of factors are considered when determining whether central assessment is proper.
