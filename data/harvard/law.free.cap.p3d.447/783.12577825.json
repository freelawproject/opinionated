We have jurisdiction under article 6, section 5(3) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 In December 2010, Johnson entered Taiwan Massage. Inside, he encountered its owner, Fu. A struggle ensued, in which Johnson bound and repeatedly stabbed Fu, killing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Next door, Marvin Pearce and Terry Weathers heard the commotion. Weathers rushed to check on Fu. When he entered Taiwan Massage, he found the front entrance in disarray. Weathers shouted \"hello\" but got no response. After a moment, Johnson exited the bathroom at the end of the hall, drying his hands. Weathers asked where Fu was, and Johnson replied she had cut herself and left in an ambulance. Weathers then rushed next door to tell Pearce what he witnessed and called for help. Weathers and Pearce then watched as Johnson got into his truck and sped away. When officers arrived on the scene, they found Fu dead. Fu had been stabbed several times, including one laceration down her back that penetrated through her lung and a near four-inch cut into her neck. She also suffered superficial cuts across her stomach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Johnson fled to his girlfriend's apartment where he washed his clothes and truck. Three days later, Johnson robbed a Christmas\n   tree lot and was arrested. (Johnson pleaded guilty to armed robbery on December 21, 2010.) Based on similarities between the two crimes, police linked Johnson to the Taiwan Massage killing. Cell phone tower data and DNA evidence substantiated Johnson's involvement. The State charged Johnson with one count each of first degree murder, kidnapping, and burglary in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The State noticed its intent to seek the death penalty, alleging the following aggravating circumstances: (1) Johnson was previously convicted of a serious offense, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2) ; (2) Johnson committed the offense for pecuniary gain, \u00a7 13-751(F)(5) ; (3) Johnson committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, \u00a7 13-751(F)(6) ; and (4) Johnson committed the offense while on release, \u00a7 13-751(F)(7)(a), and while on probation for a felony, \u00a7 13-751(F)(7)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 After trial, the jury found Johnson guilty on all counts and found that the State had proved the (F)(2), (F)(6), and (F)(7)(a) and (b) aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. After considering mitigation evidence, the jury found that Johnson's proffered mitigation was not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency and sentenced Johnson to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As part of the challenge, the defendants requested but were denied an evidentiary hearing. The trial court denied the defendants' consolidated challenge to the constitutionality of Arizona's death penalty statutes. That litigation eventually led to our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hidalgo\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hidalgo I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310536\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/543/\">\n    241 Ariz. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549-52 \u00b6\u00b6 14-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310536\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/543/\">\n    390 P.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789-92 (2017).

And though Johnson points to Justice Breyer's statement respecting the denial of certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Hidalgo II\n   </em>\n   , Justice Breyer neither implied that the Constitution requires an evidentiary hearing in that case nor explained why an expanded record would provide a more compelling basis for granting review than the explicit finding that the defendant's factual claims were true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hidalgo II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610383\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1054/#p1057\">\n    138 S.

And to the extent Johnson argues that Hidalgo was unable to adequately present the issue to the Supreme Court, his argument ignores that Hidalgo was allowed to supplement the record on appeal with an expanded study of first degree murder cases in Arizona, which found that one or more aggravating circumstances were present in 856 of 866 murders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hidalgo I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310536\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/543/\">\n    241 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   549 \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310536\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/543/\">\n    390 P.3d at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But Johnson fails to develop the argument or offer any legal support as to why the Arizona Constitution would mandate a different result than that required by the Constitution of the United States.

Concerning this aggravating circumstance, all first degree murders are to some extent heinous, cruel, or depraved. However, this aggravating circumstance cannot be found to exist unless the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was especially cruel, especially heinous, or especially depraved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Especially\" means unusually great or significant. The terms \"especially cruel,\" or \"especially heinous or depraved\" are considered separately. Therefore the presence of any one circumstance is sufficient to establish this aggravating circumstance. However, to find that this aggravating circumstance is proven, you must find that the [sic] especially cruel has been proven unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt or that ... especially heinous or depraved has been proven unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Especially cruel.\" The term \"cruel\" focuses on the victim's pain and suffering. If you find the murder was committed in an especially cruel manner, you must find that the victim consciously suffered physical or mental pain, distress, or anguish prior to death. The defendant must know or should have known that the victim would suffer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Especially heinous or depraved.\" The term \"especially heinous or depraved\" focuses ... upon the defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense as reflected by the defendant's words and acts. A murder is especially heinous if it is hatefully or shockingly evil. In other words, grossly bad. A murder is especially depraved if it is marked by de[b]a[s]ement, corruption, perversion, or deterioration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 The court then instructed on the\n   <em>\n    State v. Gretzler\n   </em>\n   factors of gratuitous violence, helplessness, and senselessness, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   To determine whether a murder was especially heinous or depraved, you must find that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant exhibited such a mental state at the time of killing by inflicting\n   gratuitous violence on the victim beyond that necessary to kill. To find that the defendant inflicted gratuitous violence you must find the defendant intentionally inflicted violence clearly beyond what was necessary to kill the victim and that the defendant continued to inflict this violence after the defendant knew or should have known that the defendant had inflicted a fatal injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   To assist you in determining whether the murder is heinous or depraved, you may consider the helplessness of the victim and the senselessness of the murder. Helplessness means that the victim is unable to resist. All murders are senseless because of their brutality and finality, yet not all are senseless as the term is used to distinguish those first degree murders that warrant a death sentence from those that do not. Rather a senseless murder is one that is unnecessary to achieve the defendant's objective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A finding of helplessness and/or senseless[ness] alone or together is not sufficient to prove that a first degree murder was heinous or depraved. A first degree murder is not heinous or depraved unless you also unanimously find that the defendant inflicted gratuitous violence on the victim beyond that necessary to kill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737426\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/135/42/#p51\">\n    135 Ariz. 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51-53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"737426\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/135/42/#p51\">\n    659 P.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10-12 (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 First, Johnson argues that the (F)(6) \"especially cruel\" aggravator violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because it does not adequately limit the jury's discretion when deciding whether to impose the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

The jury instructions specifically noted that the burden was not so high \"as to constitute a defense to prosecution.\" And the State did not argue that Johnson was required to prove the impairment\n   <em>\n    fully\n   </em>\n   prevented him from knowing the criminal act was wrong, but instead that he was not so high on Xanax that he was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. Indeed, the State argued that impairment only referred to an \"impact [on] his ability to know right from wrong,\" and it argued that the jury had heard how Johnson acted when he was actually impaired-slurring his speech, being unable to stay awake-but that on the day of the murder nobody described any such impairment. Instead, the evidence showed that Johnson took affirmative steps to conceal his role in the murder-Johnson falsely claimed\n   that Fu had cut herself, reversed his truck when driving away to prevent his license plate from being seen, and went to his girlfriend's apartment to clean his truck and clothes-indicating that he knew his conduct was wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Further, the court instructed the jury that it was \"not limited to the mitigating circumstances offered by the defendant,\" but must \"also consider any other information that you find is relevant in determining whether to impose a life sentence so long as it relates to an aspect of the defendant's background, character, propensities, history or record or circumstances of the offense.\" Johnson presented a large mitigation case. He called several mitigation witnesses who testified that he was a student at Columbine during the infamous school shooting, about his history of substance abuse and a personality disorder, his family love and support, his adoption, and other struggles. Similarly, Johnson presented evidence of his behavior while on drugs. Yet, the jury heard and considered Johnson's mitigation and found it lacking when compared to the three aggravating factors and the nature of the murder.

The State responded that it intended to rebut Johnson's plea offers with evidence that the offers were conditioned on receiving a life sentence and that prisoners serving such sentences have better prison housing conditions than those on death row. While Johnson agreed that the State could rebut his plea offers by showing they were conditioned, he argued that the prison housing evidence was irrelevant because he was unaware of preferable prison housing conditions and the State had no evidence showing he offered to plead guilty to obtain them. The court granted Johnson's motion to admit his plea offers, but deferred ruling on the scope of the State's rebuttal until trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b647 During trial, Johnson repeated his objection, filing a motion to preclude the evidence. The State countered that it did not \"have to prove that this was the defendant's sole motivation,\" but that \"this is a man who's been to [the Department of Corrections] twice\" and thus was \"aware of classifications and movement systems and numbering.\" The court denied Johnson's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b648 At trial, Johnson introduced his conditioned plea offers. In rebuttal, the State presented the testimony of a Department of Corrections administrator, who explained the potential housing differences, based on custody levels, between an inmate serving a life sentence and one serving a death sentence. In her testimony, she described the \"privileges\" and \"incentives\" a life sentence inmate can receive as a result of potential lower custody levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b649 At the close of mitigation, Johnson allocuted.

That condition being you give me the sentence I want and I'll plead guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Nothing stops a defendant from pleading guilty if that's what they choose.

How worthy is that evidence when the defendant slaps a condition on it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   And you heard from [the Department of Correction's administrator] the possible benefits he can get with a natural life sentence, that being within the first five years and on a review period thereafter, being reduced all the way down from maximum custody, to closed custody, to medium custody, enjoying all of those privileges, freedoms and benefits.

Columbine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b668 Johnson was a student at Columbine High School at the time of the school shooting. Before trial, the State filed a motion to narrow the scope of Columbine mitigation to evidence \"relevant as it relates to defendant's character, prior record or the circumstances of his offense.\" The State sought to limit, at the time, roughly 23,000 pages of evidence touching on the effect Columbine had not only on Johnson, but on other students and the community generally. As such, the State sought to preclude irrelevant information and limit unduly cumulative\n   evidence. The court agreed. While it allowed Johnson to \"tell the story\" of the Columbine shooting with approximately three to five witnesses, introduce evidence of Johnson's reactions during and after the shooting, its effects on him, and its effects on the school and town generally, the court precluded testimony from fellow students of Columbine's impact on their lives and on the lives of other individuals, finding it irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b669 The court did not abuse its discretion. Johnson introduced evidence about the Columbine shooting, that he was a freshman at Columbine High School at the time of the shooting, its effects generally on the community, its effects personally on him, and that he was thereafter diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). Testimony by other Columbine survivors as to its effects on their lives does not bear specifically on Johnson's character. The trial court correctly noted that such testimony risks confusing the jury, unfair prejudice, and wasting time, and is cumulative to the other, admissible, Columbine-related evidence. The court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Adopted-child syndrome\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b670 Johnson argues the court incorrectly limited his presentation of adopted-child syndrome evidence. During the trial, Johnson introduced evidence that he was adopted from Korea as an infant and that Dr. Kirschner had diagnosed him with a dissociative disorder called \"adopted-child syndrome.\" But adopted-child syndrome is not officially recognized in any edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\"). Johnson claims the court prevented him from asking Dr. Kirschner why adopted-child syndrome was not yet recognized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b671 Reviewing the record, the court simply prevented Dr. Kirschner from speculating why the diagnosis was not officially recognized in the DSM, a matter outside of the scope of his testimony and the trial. The court did not prevent Johnson from asking whether the DSM was the \"be-all-end-all\" as it pertains to diagnoses to establish that it was not. Nor did it prevent Johnson from asking Dr. Kirschner to identify the basis for his diagnosis. No abuse of discretion occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Drug-seeking behavior\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b672 Johnson argues the court erred by preventing him from eliciting testimony during redirect examination that he sought counseling for psychological benefits and not to obtain prescription drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b673 During cross-examination of Dr. Abrams, the State elicited testimony that in 2008, Johnson \"wanted something to help him relax,\" \"that he was out of Xanax,\" and that \"[h]e was at the hospital asking for more Xanax.\" On redirect, Johnson sought to ask whether \"there [was] any indication at that point in time [that] Johnson [was] going to the hospital in order to obtain drugs?\" The State objected, arguing that it elicited only testimony showing that Johnson minimized his substance abuse issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735391\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/133/64/#p69\">\n    133 Ariz. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735391\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/133/64/#p69\">\n    649 P.2d 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272 (1982) (limiting redirect examination to the scope of cross-examination). Though the State claimed during its objection that it did not elicit testimony of drug-seeking behavior during its cross-examination of Dr. Abrams, the question implied that the reason for Johnson's hospital visit was to obtain drugs. The court's ruling sustaining the State's objection was therefore arguably error. But because Johnson admitted that the inference was only implied, not directly stated, and because his question was unclear, any error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b674 Further, the record reveals that some of Johnson's redirect questions on this issue were answered before the State's objection and Johnson addressed the alleged drug-seeking behavior by asking the same questions to Dr. DeMarte, who testified later during the trial. To the extent Johnson generally argues that the court improperly limited mitigation evidence regarding drug-seeking behavior, Johnson introduced evidence that he had a genetic predisposition to substance abuse, was an adolescent when he started abusing drugs, and that he had a history of substance abuse, which he tied back to Columbine and his PTSD diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    iv. PTSD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b675 Johnson argues that the court prevented him from fully detailing the effects of his PTSD. However, as discussed above, Johnson presented evidence of his PTSD diagnosis to the jury. To the extent Johnson argues the court improperly limited redirect on PTSD criteria, Johnson's objected-to question related to substance abuse, whereas, as Johnson acknowledged at trial, the portion of the State's cross-examination at issue related only to nightmares. After sustaining the State's objection, the trial court nevertheless allowed Johnson to ask, \"Why [are] nightmares important?\" to which Dr. Abrams answered that nightmares were \"one of the criteria for [PTSD].\" The court did not abuse its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    v. Counseling\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b676 Johnson argues the court limited his ability to discuss counseling as mitigation evidence. Johnson has waived this argument by not developing it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , 182 Ariz. at 298,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1467817\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/182/290/#p298\">\n    896 P.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, we note that Johnson introduced evidence that he attended counseling and therapy post-Columbine and sought out counseling when he was having issues with his marriage; he was not prevented from arguing that he fared better and improved with counseling. No error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <em>\n    vi. Antisocial personality disorder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b677 Last, Johnson inconsistently argues (1) that the State impermissibly implied that he had an antisocial personality disorder diagnosis the State knew did not exist, and (2) that he should have been allowed to introduce evidence that he had an antisocial personality disorder as mitigating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b678 In mitigation, Johnson introduced evidence that he displayed paranoid, avoidant, and alexithymic features and that Dr. Abrams diagnosed him with personality disorder \"NOS\" (\"not otherwise specified\"). However, neither Dr. Abrams nor Dr. Kirschner diagnosed him with a specified personality disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder. Nevertheless, Dr. Abrams and Dr. Kirschner discussed Johnson's antisocial tendencies, as well as antisocial and conduct disorders generally, effects of which dated back to Columbine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b679 In rebuttal, the State called Dr. DeMarte, who defined antisocial personality disorder as \"a personality disorder where an individual has a pervasive pattern of disregarding societal standards and following rules and engaging in society in a productive manner.\" She further testified that adolescent conduct disorder was indicative of later antisocial personality disorder, and thus a diagnosis of a conduct disorder in youth usually preceded a diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. Because she found evidence of a conduct disorder lacking, Dr. DeMarte determined there was no antisocial personality disorder, though Johnson displayed antisocial traits. The State then elicited testimony indicating that Johnson withheld instances of antisocial conduct from her which occurred when he was younger, and Dr. DeMarte answered that such adolescent behavior \"would support evidence for antisocial personality disorder.\" Johnson objected, arguing the State was attempting to back-door an antisocial personality disorder diagnosis, and moved for a mistrial. The State responded that it was only seeking to show that Johnson underreported his adolescent activities. The court denied Johnson's motion, and ordered the State to confirm with Dr. DeMarte that there was no diagnosis, which she did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b680 The court did not abuse its discretion. The court sustained Johnson's objection and remedied the improper inference by requiring the State to ask whether there was a diagnosis, to which Dr. DeMarte responded there was not. Nor was there any harm. Johnson introduced evidence of antisocial traits and his personality disorder. And he presented evidence generally describing antisocial personality disorders and conduct disorders. Lastly, he introduced evidence that doctors did not diagnose him with an antisocial personality disorder. The State's cross-examination, challenging Johnson's underreporting to Dr. Abrams, Dr. Kirschner, and Dr. DeMarte, was permissible rebuttal. To the extent Johnson argues evidence of an antisocial personality disorder should have\n   been allowed, he was not prevented from arguing that his personality disorder and antisocial traits were mitigating circumstances, which he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b681 Contrary to Johnson's claims, he presented evidence regarding the Columbine shooting, his PTSD, his history of substance abuse and his biological predisposition, and how his adoption affected him. Each of the court's rulings correctly excluded irrelevant, cumulative evidence, or testimony outside the scope of cross or redirect examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defense Counsel's Attorneys' Notes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b682 Johnson argues the court erred by ordering the disclosure of his attorneys' notes.

The State argued the summaries did not comply with Rule 15.2(h) and asked the court to order that Johnson turn over all written witness statements, not just summaries. Johnson responded that the notes were not subject to disclosure because they were investigatory notes of the defense team and reflected counsel's opinions, conclusions, and impressions. Johnson further asserted that counsel's notes of meetings were inaccurate because they did not reflect verbatim statements and instead were \"only quick notes of their own impressions of the statements made by the witnesses,\" and that a conflict might arise should counsel be called to verify the veracity of any statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dean v.

The court entered an order for Johnson to \"disclose as soon as possible ... any and all witness statements not previously disclosed, with defense team opinions, theories and conclusions redacted.\" The court further informed Johnson that he could seek in camera review if he believed disclosure of a specific witness statement would violate an ethical obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b684 Johnson sought special action relief, which was denied. The court of appeals concluded that the order allowed Johnson to redact opinions, theories, and conclusions from the handwritten notes, and stated that \"[p]ending the result of an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review,\" it was \"in no position to rule in the abstract on whether disclosure of any specific witness statement may raise ethical concerns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b685 Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 15.2(h)(1)(A)(ii) requires disclosure of any written or recorded statement.

In his questionnaire, juror 8 disclosed that he had a friend in the Phoenix Police Department and answered that he had favorable experiences with law enforcement because he \"work[ed] with law enforcement at [his] church.\" However, juror 8 answered that he would follow Arizona law requiring him to give no greater or lesser weight to a law enforcement officer's testimony, stated he would keep an open mind, and would follow the law as instructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   \u00b6117 During follow-up questioning, Johnson asked whether juror 8 would lean towards believing law enforcement based on his relationships. Juror 8 responded, \"You know, I'll be honest. I want to say no that I wouldn't, but I would do my best not to.\" When asked again whether his close relationship with law enforcement would prevent him from impartially judging the credibility of law enforcement officers, juror 8 answered \"no.\" Only when Johnson pushed further, asking \"in [juror 8's] heart of hearts\" whether it was not a \"no\" but a \"maybe,\" did juror 8 state that though he would do his best to check his prejudices, he would be lying if he said it was a definite no, and that his close friendship with a \"good\" officer might cause him to give other officers the benefit of the doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6118 But juror 8 also stated that he would do his best to check any prejudice or bias, and repeatedly answered that he would follow the instructions and law. Subsequently, juror 8 stated that he would not believe every word an officer said just because of his or her title but instead would look at what was being said and determine on his own whether it made sense to him.

Johnson argues that the court incorrectly relied on Rule 106 to limit Johnson's cross-examination of Ms. Legg-the DNA technician-as well as his examination of mitigation witness Jonathan W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6129 First, the State objected to Johnson's cross-examination of Ms. Legg. Johnson sought to impeach Ms. Legg by introducing evidence of lab errors. Although the court at one point stated the objection was on Rule 106 grounds, the State's objections focused on lack of foundation and relevance: Johnson failed to cite which records he was relying on and attempted to impeach Ms. Legg by introducing evidence of lab errors in unrelated cases. Regardless, the court allowed Johnson to cross-examine Ms. Legg on each of his proffered grounds, so no exclusion of evidence occurred. There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6130 Second, the State objected, citing Rule 106, to Johnson's introduction of an incomplete statement that Johnson's DNA could neither be included nor excluded from the zip ties found binding the victim. During cross-examination of Ms. Legg, Johnson asked whether she had emailed Detective Denning telling him that Johnson was not a match. The State objected and argued that Ms. Legg's full statement was that \"[i]t [was] not possible to include or exclude ... Johnson.\" The trial court correctly sustained the State's objection. And though Johnson claims error, he received the answer he wanted: that the test was inconclusive, and that Johnson could not definitively be considered a \"match.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b6131 Third, the State objected during Johnson's examination of family friend Jonathan W. Johnson asked Jonathan whether he thought Johnson \"was the type of person that is open to growth and change,\" based on a letter Jonathan had written on Johnson's behalf. The State objected, citing Rule 106, argued that Johnson was picking and choosing words from the letter, and asked that it be allowed to re-cross Jonathan if the court allowed Johnson to continue. The court sustained the State's objection. Rule 106 arguably applied, but the court allowed Johnson to continue asking Jonathan about his opinion, so even if its decision was wrong, no harm resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \u00b6132 Johnson argues the court improperly gave Rule 106 exclusionary effect, in that he believes the court precluded him from introducing evidence on Rule 106 grounds. Johnson's argument borders on the frivolous: in each instance, the court allowed Johnson to introduce the evidence he sought. No error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <strong>\n    P.

Ms. Legg testified that Johnson's DNA matched DNA left on the fourteen zip ties in at least ten of sixteen allele locations\n   and that his DNA was found at the other allele locations but at insufficient levels to contribute to a result. Ms. Legg testified that the random match probability of the result was one in 600 trillion Caucasians, one in 3.40 quadrillion Southwestern Hispanics, and one in 145 quadrillion African-Americans. While Korean statistics were not used, Ms. Legg testified that the random match probability was generated based on the expected population in a given area-here, Mesa, Arizona-so the inclusion of any Asian statistics would have likely only increased the rarity of a match. As to the zip ties found binding the victim, Ms. Legg testified that Johnson's DNA profile was present at between four and five allele locations, so his DNA could be included, but that there was not enough DNA present at enough allele locations to establish Johnson as a \"match.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \u00b6135 During closing, the State argued that Johnson's DNA was on the zip ties found binding the victim, stating this his \"DNA remains [at] up to five locations\" and that his \"DNA is there.\" During rebuttal closing, the State further argued, in response to Johnson's defense that his DNA was not on the zip ties, that \"[h]is DNA is on those zip ties .... He's there between four and five loci. He's just not there enough to call and he's there on the zip ties, not just at 10 locations.\" Johnson objected that the prosecutor's closing misstated the evidence but was overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b6136 Johnson argues the State's closing argument was improper because it misstated the strength of the DNA evidence, citing\n   <em>\n    Duncan v.

But in\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   , the court only concluded the state's argument-that \"not excluded\" meant \"included\" and that the defendant's DNA was a \"match\"-was improper because there was no scientifically valid estimate of the probability that alleles would match.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321209\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/81/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, by asking the jury to infer on the basis of the expert's testimony that the defendant was the source of the DNA, \"the prosecutor sought to wring from that testimony a conclusion it could not reasonably yield.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321209\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/81/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321209\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/81/#p91\">\n    at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6137 Here, Johnson's argument borders on frivolous. The evidence showed that Johnson \"matched\" the DNA found on the fourteen zip ties left at Taiwan Massage and that Johnson's DNA profile was consistent with the zip ties found on the victim at between four and five allele locations. The State did not use the word \"match\" to link Johnson's DNA to the ties found binding Fu, and its comment that Johnson's DNA \"is there\" was nothing more than a reasonable argument based on the evidence. Further, because the State itself emphasized during closing that Ms. Legg wrote in an email to Detective Denning that Johnson could neither be included nor excluded, the jury knew the State was arguing a reasonable inference and not mispresenting a determined fact.\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321209\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/81/#p91\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7321209\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/322/81/#p91\">\n    at 91-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The State correctly reiterated that the jurors \"must decide how compelling or persuasive the totality of the mitigating factors are against the totality of the aggravating factors.\" The State's comment was only an argument that, as to each of Johnson's ten proffered mitigating circumstances, the jurors should evaluate each one to determine whether it was proven by a preponderance of the evidence and whether it truly related to an aspect of Johnson's background, character, propensities, record or circumstance of the offense.

Naranjo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323338\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/233/\">\n    234 Ariz. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 \u00b6 89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323338\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/233/\">\n    321 P.3d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   \u00b6195 Johnson presented the following mitigating factors to the jury: (1) Johnson's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution; (2) Johnson has a genetic predisposition to substance abuse; (3) Johnson has a genetic predisposition to mental health issues; (4) Johnson was adopted as an infant and has been diagnosed as suffering from dissociative disorder as a result of his adoption, i.e., \"adopted-child syndrome\"; (5) Johnson was a freshman at Columbine High School at the time of the infamous school shooting and has been diagnosed with PTSD as a result; (6) Johnson was an adolescent when he started abusing substances and has a history of substance abuse; (7) Johnson has a history of mental illness; (8) Johnson's willingness to accept full responsibility for his actions and his willingness to plead guilty to all charges and agree to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole; (9) Johnson's life has value to his family and friends; and (10) Johnson has the love and support of his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   \u00b6196 Johnson's mitigation focused mainly on his substance abuse, the Columbine shooting, and his PTSD, but was countered by the State during rebuttal. Though Johnson argued that Columbine changed and affected him, the State produced evidence showing that Johnson abused drugs and acted recklessly before the Columbine shooting. The State also presented rebuttal showing the Columbine shooting's impact on Johnson was not as severe as he claimed. Johnson presented evidence that he was bullied because of his adoption and race, but the evidence also indicated that his family loved and supported him and that his cousins protected him from bullying. Further, although Johnson presented the testimony of Dr. Kirschner to establish adopted-child syndrome, family members testified that Johnson did not display anger about his adoption or otherwise show that it negatively affected him. And\n   despite his family's love and support, Johnson's family recognized he was untruthful and dangerous at times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   \u00b6197 Johnson argued that he had a genetic predisposition to substance abuse, but the State showed Johnson's erratic behavior was not limited to drugs: he street-raced cars, passed counterfeit money, and engaged in fights. To the extent medical experts diagnosed Johnson with PTSD and personality disorder NOS, the State produced evidence indicating that Johnson underreported or misrepresented his behavior. Last, to the extent Johnson claimed remorse, his sincerity was undercut by testimony from Dr. DeMarte that he laughed and was dismissive about the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   \u00b6198 Even if Johnson's mitigation evidence were given its full weight, the jurors could reasonably have concluded that it did not call for leniency in light of the brutality and senselessness of the murder along with the other aggravating factors. The jury did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced Johnson to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   <strong>\n    S. Excessive Page Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   \u00b6199 Though not raised by either party, we must address the excessive lengths of Johnson's briefs. Some cases are more complex than others, and in those cases, flexibility is required. But Johnson's filings stretch that flexibility too far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   \u00b6200 Johnson submitted an original opening brief totaling 105,621 words and covering more than 400 pages, nearly four times our limit, which itself is greatly expanded beyond page limits in civil and non-capital criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 31.14(a) (limiting opening briefs to 28,000 words). We struck it but nevertheless granted him 42,000 words to file a revised opening brief. In doing so, we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   In all capital cases, the Court independently reviews the record in its entirety, including all evidence, transcripts, and briefs. For that reason counsel's arguments regarding the need to file a brief far exceeding the extended page limits provided for capital cases are not well-taken, and in any event they should have been raised in advance of the due date to prevent further delay in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   \u00b6201 Johnson complied, submitting 41,958 words, but did so by shortening some of his arguments and relegating record citations and legal citations to footnotes without legal analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Crim. P. 31.10(a)(7)(A) (requiring arguments to contain (1) \"appellant's contentions with supporting reasons for each contention,\" along with (2) \"citations of legal authorities and appropriate references\" to the record). Johnson essentially \"evade[d] our page limit by manipulating the format of his brief,\" of which we disapprove.\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , 182 Ariz. at 298,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1467817\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/182/290/#p298\">\n    896 P.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   \u00b6202 In response, the State argued that Johnson had waived issues that were not sufficiently developed, specifically issues H, M, O, and P. Johnson then claimed this Court's previous order and imposition of a 42,000-word limit prevented him from fully developing his arguments. In\n   <em>\n    Bolton\n   </em>\n   , we rejected that exact argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1467817\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/182/290/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (noting the \"[d]efendant could very well have complied with our rules in the first instance\").

R. Crim. P. 31.14(a) (limiting reply briefs to 14,000 words), to further develop the arguments that the State claimed were waived. Johnson submitted a 41,853 word reply brief. By Johnson's own recording, 9,072 words were spent supplementing the challenged issues, while 32,781 words were for its regular reply. Its 32,781-word reply alone exceeds our order by over 10,000 words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   \u00b6204 Johnson argues he could not comply with our word limits because winnowing issues is unethical, citing ABA Guidelines 6.8(a)(5) and comment to Guideline 10.15.1.C, along with\n   <em>\n    Lockett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    438 U.S. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the importance of procedural protections to ensure the reliability of sentencing). We reject Johnson's argument. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    State v. Atwood\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-323\">\n   Each member of this court is acutely aware of the gravity of the decisions we are called upon to make in capital cases. Therefore, to argue that such deviations from professional appellate practice as occurred in this case are justifiable because the death penalty is at issue is unpersuasive. Rather than aiding our review of defendant's case by judiciously selecting, fully researching, and concisely arguing the colorable issues raised by the trial record, appellate counsel has bombarded this court with a salvo of dubious claims serving little purpose other than to detract from those issues having arguable legal merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1528611\" index=\"405\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/171/576/#p659\">\n    171 Ariz. 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1528611\" index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/171/576/#p659\">\n    832 P.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   \u00b6205 Good advocacy requires winnowing.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-326\">\n   Legal contentions, like the currency, depreciate through over-issue.

It may be that it is \"harder to write shorter and crisper,\" Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Interview with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , 13 Scribes J.

Here, we consolidated twenty-one arguments into seventeen issues, some of which were foreclosed by previous decisions.

Our conclusion is bolstered by our independent review of the record, finding no reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   \u00b6208 Johnson is entitled to a meaningful opportunity to be heard, but that does not mean that he may decline to comply with this Court's requirements and orders or that he is excused from the obligation to edit his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   <strong>\n    T.
