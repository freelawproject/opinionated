Wendell Reugh and as co-trustees of the Reugh revocable living trust. Nevertheless, the expanse of this opinion covers mainly the topics of subject matter jurisdiction and waiver by failure to assert an argument in the trial court. We uphold the trial court's removal of the co-personal representatives and co-trustees and the appointment of a successor personal representative and trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We introduce the parties. This complicated appeal concerns the estate of K. Wendell Reugh, who died in March 2015, at the age of 86. Wendell Reugh's wife, Mary Ann Reugh, died in 1996. Wendell and Mary Ann Reugh's three children, JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky, Mark Reugh, and James Reugh, initiated this appeal. We refer to the three collectively as \"the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The former co-personal representatives of Wendell Reugh's estate and former trustees of the K. Wendell Reugh revocable living trust (the Reugh trust), the daughter JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill, also appeal trial court rulings. Gill is a long-time business associate of Wendell Reugh. We refer to the two alternatively as \"Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill,\" \"co-personal representatives,\" \"personal representatives,\" and \"co-trustees.\" Notice that we refer to JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky differently depending on her role as a child or as a co-personal representative or co-trustee. The two respondents are Inland Northwest Community Foundation (Community Foundation), the purported residual beneficiary of the Reugh revocable living trust, and Northwest Trustee &amp; Management Services (Northwest Trustee), the successor personal representative of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh and successor trustee of the Reugh trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Now the background. On January 4, 2011, K. Wendell Reugh, a successful Spokane businessman, executed a will and a revocable living trust. The will identified as heirs Reugh's three children, James Reugh, Mark Reugh, and JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Reugh's close companion, Doreen Decker. The will bequeathed tangible personal property such as jewelry, household furniture, books, paintings, and automobiles to Reugh's heirs. The will then directed that the residuary estate pass to the \"K. Wendell Reugh Revocable Living Trust\" to be distributed in accordance with a separate trust agreement. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 337 (some capitalization omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 K. Wendell Reugh's January 2011 will named Dominic Zamora and James Simmons as personal representatives of the estate. Portions of Article IV of the will further read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. In the event either of said co-Personal Representatives is or becomes unwilling or unable to serve, then the other shall serve as co-Personal Representative and shall nominate three individuals to serve as co-Personal Representatives with him. My children shall, by majority vote, designate one of said nominees to serve as the other co-Personal Representative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   B. My estate shall be administered by my Personal Representative named in this Will without the intervention of any court and with all powers granted herein and by law to a Personal Representative acting with nonintervention powers.\n   <em>\n    I direct that such nonintervention powers be unrestricted\n   </em>\n   and that they may be exercised whether or not necessary for the administration of my estate. My Personal Representative shall act with full power to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Select any part of my estate in satisfaction of any partition or distribution hereunder, in kind, in money, or both (including the satisfaction of any pecuniary bequest), in shares which may be composed differently, and to do so without regard to the income tax basis of specific property allocated to any beneficiary (including any trust).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   D. Except to the extent fundamentally inconsistent with the provisions of this Will and of my estate plan, I hereby authorize my Personal Representative to disclaim, in whole or in part, any devise or legacy or any interest in any trust provided for my benefit under the Will of any person or under any trust instrument at any time within nine (9) months after the date of the transfer which created an interest in me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CP at 337-38 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Also, on January 4, 2011, K. Wendell Reugh signed a revocable living trust agreement. The trust agreement also identified K. Wendell Reugh's three children. The trust instrument listed Wendell Reugh as both settlor and initial trustee of the trust. The document read that \"[t]he Settlor hereby transfers to the Trustee the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).\" CP at 342. Reugh, however, never transferred the $100 or any other property into the trust, at least during his lifetime. On Reugh's death, the trust, according to the terms of the trust agreement, would convert to an irrevocable trust. The trust instrument directed the trust to pay funeral expenses, costs of administration, estate taxes and other taxes resulting from Reugh's death and any debts owed by Reugh from the trust estate before any distribution to the residuary beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 The revocable living trust instrument listed gifts to be paid before any distribution of the trust assets to the residual beneficiary. The gifts included $250,000 to Wendell Reugh's sister, $20,000 to Reugh's niece, $20,000 each to two nephews, $10,000 to the Spokane Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children, $25,000 to Spokane's United Central Methodist Church, $50,000 to Reugh's former daughter-in-law unless she had remarried, and $1.5 million to each of Reugh's three children. The Trust also directed that $1 million be transferred to a charitable remainder trust for the benefit of Doreen Decker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 The K. Wendell Reugh's Trust instrument anticipated that Wendell Reugh would establish a charitable foundation or a charitable donor-advised fund before his death. The revocable living trust agreement directed that the residuary of the trust estate, after payment of gifts, pass to either Reugh's charitable foundation, the donor-advised fund, or both if Reugh had created both. The trust instrument read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. If Settlor established neither a charitable foundation nor a charitable donor advised fund, said remainder shall be distributed to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation, to be held as an endowed donor-advised fund known as the Wendell and MaryAnn Reugh Family Fund. Such fund shall have Settlor's three children as its initial advisors. Upon the death, disability or resignation of any such advisors, a replacement shall be appointed by the Board of Directors of the Inland Northwest Community Foundation from among the descendants (including descendants by adoption) of the Settlor.\n   <em>\n    Settlor wishes that charitable distributions be made from the fund primarily to the kinds of charitable organizations Settlor has given to during his lifetime, serving the people of the Inland Northwest\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CP at 347-48 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 Similar to the will's identification of personal representatives for the estate of K. Wendell Reugh, Wendell Reugh named Dominic Zamora and James Simmons to serve as co-trustees \"of this Trust and of any testamentary trusts established by the terms of this Trust.\" CP at 349. If the trustees were unable or did not wish to serve, the Trust provided for the selection of successor trustees through the same process that the will established for appointment of successor personal representatives, by which process the children would, by majority vote, choose among nominees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610 K. Wendell Reugh died on March 22, 2015. Dominic Zamora and James Simmons thereafter declined their appointments as co-personal representatives of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh and co-trustees of the Reugh trust. On March 27, 2015, pursuant to Wendell Reugh's will and the revocable living trust instrument, the children of Reugh appointed JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill as successor co-personal representatives and co-trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b611 On March 27, 2015, co-personal representatives JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill petitioned, under Spokane County Superior Court cause no. 15-4-00471-1, for probate of the will and the grant of nonintervention powers afforded in the will. The trial court entered an order admitting the will to probate, declared the estate solvent, and granted nonintervention powers to the co-personal representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b612 The estate of K. Wendell Reugh's administration has been complex due to Reugh's high net worth. The co-personal representatives toiled for two and one-half years to value the estate and to file an estate tax return. Beginning in 2016, the Internal Revenue Service fastidiously examined estate records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b613 JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill, as co-trustees of the revocable living trust, distributed to each beneficiary named in the trust the gift listed, including $1.5 million to each of Wendell Reugh's children. The distributions totaled nearly $5 million. Oddly, despite the distributions in accordance with the trust agreement, Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill contend they never administered the trust, but only administered the estate. They claim the trust never held any assets to administer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 On June 29, 2015, an attorney for the co-personal representatives and co-trustees wrote to the Community Foundation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Please be advised that Inland Northwest Community Foundation has been named in the K. Wendell Reugh Revocable Living Trust to receive residue funds. The amount of the funds to be distributed to Inland Northwest Community Foundation is unascertainable at this time. It will be quite some time before an appraisal of the estate assets is completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The funds are to be held as an endowed donor-advised fund, known as the Wendell and Mary Ann Reugh Family Fund. Such funds shall have the three Reugh children as its initial advisors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   As soon as it can be ascertained as to the amount of funds involved, I will notify you in behalf of the trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   CP at 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b615 The three children of Wendell Reugh and representatives from the Community Foundation planned to meet on December 4, 2015. The parties later canceled the meeting with the intention of resetting the meeting after the co-personal representatives filed the federal estate tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b616 JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill met with Thomas Culbertson, the estate of K. Wendell Reugh's attorney, in late December 2015. Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill mentioned during the meeting that Reugh, preceding his death, uttered comments about his wishes, which comments conflicted with the revocable living trust language. The attorney responded that the law would not assign any weight to the comments, but that the trust language controlled disposition of the estate. On January 8, 2016, the attorney wrote a letter to Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill, which read in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   JoLynn, you have an obvious conflict of interest since on the one hand you are one of the specific beneficiaries and on the other hand you are a fiduciary as co-personal representative of Wendell's estate and co-successor trustee of his living trust. Conflicts of interest are common and permissible in the context of trusts and estates; it is not the conflict itself which gets people into trouble, but what they do in light of the conflict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   As fiduciaries, there are a number of duties and responsibilities which you owe to all the beneficiaries, but there are two duties which are paramount. First, you have a duty of impartiality to the beneficiaries; that is, you cannot favor the interests of any beneficiary or group of beneficiaries over the interests of another beneficiary. Second, you have a duty of full disclosure;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   that is, a duty to keep all the beneficiaries sufficiently informed that they are in a position to protect their best interests. In short, you cannot (consistent with your fiduciary duties) treat the Community Foundation as an adversary, as you might if you had a dispute with another party as to which you owe no fiduciary duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CP at 185-86 (emphasis omitted). We do not know how this confidential letter, covered by the attorney-client privilege, became part of the court record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b617 On January 26, 2016, Dominic Zamora, accountant for the estate of Wendell Reugh, sent a letter to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation's counsel, which letter read, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Our firm has been retained to prepare the associated state and federal estate tax returns for the Estate of K. Wendell Reugh. Mr. Reugh passed away on March 22nd, 2015. The personal representatives of the estate, Mrs. JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Mr. Steve Gill, have asked me to prepare this letter as it relates to a charitable contribution to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Mr. Reugh's will contains a charitable disposition. As such, we are prepared to transfer approximately $2.2 million to the Inland Northwest Foundation. The charitable contribution would consist of an IRA in the name of Mr. Reugh with an approximate fair market value of $1.5 million and approximately $720,000, which is the current actuarial value of the remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust created in Mr. Reugh's will. The transfers would be completed with a combination of cash and publicly traded securities by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   We ask that you talk with your client for the purposes of considering our proposal. If the Foundation finds this proposal suitable, we will have the necessary documents drawn up and complete the process of the transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   CP at 585. The letter did not disclose that the Community Foundation might receive $15 million through the trust. The Community Foundation rejected the co-trustees' offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b618 In June 2016, JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill, as executors of Wendell Reugh's estate filed a federal estate tax return. The return confirmed that the Inland Northwest Community Foundation, a charity, would receive the remaining residue of Wendell Reugh's wealth, estimated at $15 million. Despite Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill claiming to have never activated the Reugh trust, the two identify themselves in the estate return as co-trustees. JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill never informed the Community Foundation of entries in the estate tax return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b619 On July 7, 2016, counsel for the Community Foundation received a letter from an attorney for Mark and Jim Reugh. The letter reads, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   ... Jim and Mark hired us to ensure their late father's charitable objectives are carried out through the large charitable distribution in the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Reugh was a charitable man who wanted his charitable legacy continued by his children, his grandchildren, his great grandchildren, and to continue for a long time thereafter. Mr. Reugh openly discussed with his children, and his advisors, his desire to set up a private family foundation (hereinafter, \"Reugh Family Foundation\") to meet his charitable objectives. This discussion carried over to Mr. Tom Culbertson, who prepared the Trust and Mr. Reugh's Will. Mr. Culbertson drafted the Trust in anticipation that he would set up the Reugh Family Foundation for Mr. Reugh. For reasons unknown to Jim and Mark, Mr. Culbertson failed to set up the Reugh Family Foundation and failed to carry out Mr. Reugh's charitable objectives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The Reugh Family Foundation is critically important to Jim and Mark for two primary reasons. First, Jim and Mark desire to benefit charities that were important to their father during his lifetime. Most of these charities are outside the reach, and are not permissible donees, of the Inland Northwest Community Foundation. For example, charities to which Mr. Reugh contributed during his lifetime that would likely be donees of the Reugh Family\n   Foundation include: (1) St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; (2) Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation; (3) Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research; (4) American Macular Degeneration Foundation; (5) The Brain Aneurysm Foundation; (6) National Boy Scouts of America Foundation; (7) PATH; (8) Stand up for Kids; (9) Angel View; (10) Cure Alzheimer's Fund; (11) Literacy; and (12) Room to Read.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The second reason the Reugh Family Foundation is critically important to Jim and Mark is to continue their father's charitable ethic and instill this in their children (Mr. Reugh's grandchildren) and their grandchildren (Mr. Reugh's great grandchildren). Jim and Mark recognize and admire the great work the Inland Northwest Community Foundation does in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho. However, the legal control that would be exercised by Inland Northwest Community Foundation over the charitable funds received from the Trust and the ultimate decision of what organizations would receive distributions from these charitable funds is contrary to Mr. Reugh's charitable objectives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   We acknowledge that Mr. Culbertson, in drafting the Trust, inserted the Inland Northwest Community Foundation as the \"backup\" recipient of Trust's residuary assets. We also acknowledge that Mr. Culbertson, in failing to establish the Reugh Family Foundation during Mr. Reugh's life, knew these funds would likely end up being distributed to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation under the terms of the Trust he drafted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Instead of engaging in expensive litigation to change the charitable beneficiary of the Trust, involving extensive fact finding into why Mr. Culbertson behaved the way he did, Jim and Mark desire to reach a compromise with the Inland Northwest Community Foundation to ensure their father's charitable legacy continues to benefit the charities important to their father. Consequently, Jim and Mark propose a binding Trust and Estate Dispute Resolution Act (TEDRA) Agreement, subject to approval by JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky (as beneficiary and Co-Trustee), Steve Gill (as Co-Trustee), and the Washington Attorney General (as a necessary party under RCW 11.110.120 ). We anticipate that a settlement, memorialized by a binding TEDRA Agreement, would provide for an immediate distribution to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   As expressed by the Co-Trustees of the Trust, if we are unable to settle, the residuary charitable distribution (whether to the Reugh Family Foundation, the Inland Northwest Community Foundation, or both) will not be made until all estate tax matters are settled with the Washington Department of Revenue and the Internal Revenue Service. Due to the nature of the assets included in Mr. Reugh's estate, lifetime taxable gifts made by Mr. Reugh, the taxable distributions included in the Trust, and the provision in the Trust that requires all estate tax and administration expenses be paid from the residue of the estate/trust, the Co-Personal Representatives and Co-Trustees have indicated that they do not anticipate completing the administration of the estate and trust, including making large distributions of the residue, until an estate tax closing letter has been issued by the Internal Revenue Service and the Washington Department of Revenue. Because the size of the taxable estate, and the very high likelihood Mr. Reugh's estate will be audited by the Internal Revenue Service, this audit and estate administration could be as short as a couple of years or could stretch out for a decade (or longer) if there is any estate tax litigation. There is no way of knowing for certain the timing of when the Internal Revenue Service or the Washington Department of Revenue will begin its review of the estate tax returns filed for Mr. Reugh's estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   CP at 202-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b620 On January 27, 2017, legal counsel for the Reugh children sent the Community Foundation's counsel a letter. The children's counsel acknowledged an earlier offer, but stated a closer inquiry into the facts surrounding the trust had led the children to\n   conclude that Wendell Reugh never intended to activate the trust. The children now believed the trust to be invalid because the trustor named himself as the initial trustee and because the trust was to be funded with a $100 transfer that Reugh never consummated. The January 27 letter continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ... [I]n the event Inland Northwest Community Foundation (INWCF) still has designs on the Reugh family's assets, this letter is intended to encourage INWCF to spend its resources elsewhere. As explained herein, Mr. Reugh's intent was to ensure that his children received his assets directly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ... [I]f the beneficiaries are forced by INWCF to litigate to carry out their father's intent, then if they prevail, and benefit his estate thereby, they will seek recovery of all fees and costs. RCW 11.96A.150.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, this is notice of the beneficiaries' intent to claim their father's estate absent an invalid trust diverting his assets, and we will proceed in that vein. We are hopeful that INWCF will appreciate the foregoing, and Mr. Reugh's obvious intent, and avoid litigation in this distribution. If there are any issues, please let me know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   CP at 578, 582. Wendell Reugh's children have since sued Reugh's estate planning attorney and alleged that the attorney failed to prepare documents to fulfill the intent of Reugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b621 On February 27, 2017, the children of Wendell Reugh filed a petition, under Spokane County Superior Court cause no. 15-4-00471-1, the probate case number, contesting the Reugh revocable living trust's validity. The caption only mentioned the estate of K. Wendell Reugh. Paragraph 1.5 of the petition declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   1.5 This Court has taken jurisdiction over the above numbered probate of the Estate of K. Wendell Reugh, and thus also has jurisdiction to hear this petition to contest the validity of the K. Wendall Reugh Revocable Living Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   CP at 28-29. The paragraph referenced a footnote, which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    RCW 11.96A.040 (superior court has original jurisdiction in probate and trust matters); RCW 11.96A.020 (superior\n   </em>\n   courts has power and authority to administer and settle all matters concerning the estates and assets of deceased persons, including trust matters);\n   <em>\n    In Re Estate of Campbell,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5027492\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/46/292/#p297\">\n     46 Wn. 2d 292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 297 [\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20P.2d%20686\">\n     280 P.2d 686\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ] (1955) (Superior\n   </em>\n   court has inherent power in probate proceedings to clarify status at any time).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   CP at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b622 One week later, and on March 6, 2017, the children refiled the petition contesting the validity of the Reugh trust under Spokane County Superior Court cause no. 17-4-00311-7, without dismissing the petition filed in the probate proceeding. The caption for this petition named the estate of K. Wendell Reugh, but the caption added the children, JoLynn Kovalsky-Reugh, Mark Reugh, and Jim Reugh as petitioners. This second petition included the same paragraph 1.5 and footnote to the paragraph as found in the February 27 petition. The petition prayed for relief, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   This Court should declare:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   5.1 That Article III of the Reugh Will provision activating a trust is invalid.\n   <em>\n    Exhibit A, Last Will and Testament, Article III, Residuary Estate.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   5.2 That the Reugh Revocable Living Trust is an invalid trust.\n   <em>\n    Ex. B, K. Wendell Reugh Revocable Living Trust, Article II, \"Trust Property.\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CP at 368.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b623 On March 15, 2017, the superior court, on agreement of all parties, including the Community Foundation, consolidated the independent petition for declaration of trust invalidity with the probate proceeding. On March 20, 2017, JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill, as co-personal representatives of Wendell Reugh's estate, answered the petition for invalidity, wherein they admitted that the probate court held jurisdiction to determine the validity of the trust and they admitted the petition's allegation of the invalidity of the trust. The co-personal representatives filed their answer under the probate proceeding cause number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b624 After filing the trust contest petition, the attorney for JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill, as co-personal representatives of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh, sent letters to the trust beneficiaries notifying them of the petition. The March 16, 2017 letters warned the beneficiaries that they would need to return their respective distributions received in 2015 if a court ruled the trust invalid. Nevertheless, Wendell Reugh's three children proposed to reimburse the trust on behalf of each distributee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b625 We now arrive at a motion that gives rise to this appeal. On November 22, 2017, the Community Foundation filed a motion, in the probate proceeding, to remove JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill as co-personal representatives of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh and as co-trustees of the Reugh revocable living trust due to a breach of fiduciary duties. In support of the motion, the Community Foundation's counsel filed a declaration that attached forty-six exhibits, including the co-personal representatives' answer agreeing to the Reugh children's petition to declare the trust invalid, the federal and state estate tax returns, Thomas Culbertson's January 8, 2016 letter to the co-personal representatives, the accounting firm's January 26, 2016 letter, and the children's counsel's letter of January 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b626 The trial court entertained the removal motion on December 8, 2017. In response to the motion, Wendell Reugh's three children argued that the Community Foundation failed to follow the proper procedure for removal. The children contended that the Community Foundation must file a petition, not a motion. According to the children, a motion is set for a motion docket, whereas a petition initiates an action and requires a show cause process. The children asked that the motion be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b627 The trial court commented that it did not wish to dismiss the motion, would treat the motion as a petition, would order the co-personal representatives to show cause as to why they should not be removed, and would schedule a hearing date for a sufficient time for JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill to respond. Counsel for the children replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   So what I'm hearing is, if I can paraphrase it in my procedural processes, what we're here on is essentially the prima facia [sic] show cause process that would enable the Court then to set it for hearing. To that extent, because we're here, I would like the opportunity to argue to the Court that there hasn't been a prima facia [sic] showing to even set it for a hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b628 The trial court acknowledged that counsel could argue the lack of showing for a hearing and added: \"I'm taking that as a decline [to order the co-personal representatives to show cause], which I understand because all the parties are present and it seems like both parties have evolved positions on this issue.\" RP at 7. The court entertained argument on the merits of the removal motion. During the argument, the co-personal representatives never contended that the court lacked authority to remove them because of their nonintervention powers or because the Community Foundation did not qualify under RCW 11.68.070 as a party able to remove a personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b629 At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court does find that there has been a cause for concern that rises to the potential of breaching fiduciary duty. There's been inconsistent dealings with the treatment of the Trust. The Court finds that there has been a prima facia [sic] showing. And, again, it's a prima facia [sic] showing, it's not the Court concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that a breach of fiduciary duty occurred because there was a lot of complicated matters. There has been a prima facia [sic] showing in the declaration and supporting materials regarding a breach of fiduciary duty and for that reason, the Court will select the remedy to remove Mr. Gill and Ms. Kovalsky. The Court is granting your [Community Foundation's counsel's] motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   RP at 37-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b630 After the trial court's ruling, counsel for the children remarked that a prima facie\n   showing for removal of the personal representatives only served to set a later evidentiary hearing as to removal. Counsel contended that the children only agreed that day to proceed with a hearing to ascertain a prima facie showing. The trial court responded that he had offered the children an opportunity for a later hearing but they had declined. The court observed that due process had been afforded the children. The trial court ruled that a hearing on affidavits sufficed for a removal petition. In other words, the court need not entertain live testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b631 At the conclusion of the December 8 hearing, the trial court directed the parties to confer and agree on an independent fiduciary to succeed as personal representative and trustee, and, if the parties could not agree, each party should submit a name to the court. On December 20, 2017, the children recorded with this appeals court a notice of appeal of the trial court's order, without the entry of a formal written order, removing JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill as co-personal representatives and co-trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b632 The trial court conducted a presentment of order hearing on December 22, 2017. The children refused to recommend a successor personal representative or trustee because they asserted their notice of appeal precluded the trial court from further action. The children never contended that the trial court needed to follow Wendell Reugh's will's directions for the appointment of a successor personal representative. An unmoved trial court proceeded with the presentment hearing and signed an order removing JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill as personal representatives of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh and trustees of the Reugh trust. The order appointed Northwest Trustee as the successor personal representative and trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b633 The trial court entered the following findings of fact with the order of removal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   1. Petitioners [the children] argued that INWCF failed to comply with RCW 11.68.070 in seeking the removal of the co-personal representatives and co-trustees. The co-personal representatives and co-trustees did not raise any such argument on their own behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   2. The Court finds that INWCF substantially complied with RCW 11.68.070 in filing the Motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   3. To the extent INWCF deviated from any procedure referenced in the statute, the co-personal representatives, co-trustees, and Petitioners were not prejudiced. The purpose of the requirement that a party seeking the removal of a personal representative file a \"petition ... supported by affidavit\" making a \"prima facie showing of cause for removal\" is to prompt the court to rule on whether there are grounds to reassume jurisdiction over a nonintervention probate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"265892\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/116/353/#p362\">\n    116 Wn.

The Co-PRs and Co-Trustees now contend that the $1.5 million payments were made pursuant to the \"Estate\" and not the Trust. However, if the Co-PRs and Co-Trustees are correct that the Trust is invalid, the payments of $1.5 million to Ms. Kovalsky and her siblings from the \"Estate\" would be expressly prohibited by the language of the will which specifies that the decedent \"make[s] no provisions ... for any of [his] children who survive [him].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   16.

Wendell Reugh and co-trustees of the Reugh revocable living trust. Wendell Reugh's children join the co-personal representatives in forwarding each contention asserted in this appeal to reverse the removals. The appeal raises both procedural and substantive questions regarding removal of personal representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 1: Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the removal motion when the co-personal representatives held nonintervention powers?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 1: Yes.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b635 Among other contentions, the co-personal representatives contend that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to remove them because K. Wendell Reugh's will and the probate court granted them nonintervention powers and because the Community Foundation failed to follow the procedural statutes granting the court authority to remove personal representatives. We later address the personal representatives' underlying contentions that the trial court lacked authority, rather than subject matter jurisdiction, to address the removal request because the Community Foundation lacked standing to remove personal representatives, because the Community Foundation filed a motion rather than a petition, and because the probate court never signed a show cause order of sufficient cause for removal. We also later address whether the co-personal representatives waived any arguments by failing to assert the argument before the probate court. We first address the implications on jurisdiction due to nonintervention powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b636 The co-personal representatives' arguments compel us to first decide if the trial court held, and, in turn, this reviewing court possesses, subject matter jurisdiction over the Community Foundation's removal motion.

We would not even address whether the co-personal representatives waived any arguments in the trial court when responding to the removal motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b637 A court must have subject matter jurisdiction in order to decide a case.\n   <em>\n    Eugster v.

Note that superior courts hold subject matter jurisdiction over all probate matters. The Washington Constitution thereby alone compels us to hold the trial court possessed jurisdiction to remove the co-personal representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b640 In addition to the Washington Constitution granting superior courts extensive jurisdiction over probate disputes, numerous statutes also partially cover the power of the superior court to remove a personal representative. We first quote Washington statutes relevant to nonintervention powers. RCW 11.68.011 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (1) A personal representative may petition the court for nonintervention powers, whether the decedent died testate or intestate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (2) Unless the decedent has specified in the decedent's will, if any, that the court not grant nonintervention powers to the personal representative, the court shall grant nonintervention powers to a personal representative who petitions for the powers if the court determines that the decedent's estate is solvent ... and that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   (a) The petitioning personal representative was named in the decedent's probated will as the personal representative;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   K. Wendell Reugh's will directed the probate court to grant his personal representatives nonintervention powers. The solvency of Reugh's estate is an understatement. RCW 11.68.090 delineates the nature of nonintervention powers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (1) Any personal representative acting under nonintervention powers may ... have the same powers, and be subject to the same limitations of liability, that a trustee has under chapters 11.98, 11.100, and 11.102 RCW with regard to the assets of the estate, both real and personal, all without an order of court and without notice, approval, or confirmation, and in all other respects administer and settle the estate of the decedent without intervention of court. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title or by order of court, a personal representative acting under nonintervention powers ... is not obligated to comply with the duties imposed on personal representatives by that chapter [chapter 11.76 RCW]. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   (2) .... However, notwithstanding the rest of this subsection, a personal representative may not be relieved of the duty to act in good faith and with honest judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The notion of a nonintervention will is one that allows the executor to deal with the estate's property without the need for court supervision.\n   <em>\n    In re Estates of Aaberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1845742\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/25/336/\">\n    25 Wash.

Language in many decisions supports this contention. Based on the nonintervention powers statute and principles of estate administration, Washington courts have often written that the superior court loses jurisdiction, probably meaning subject matter jurisdiction, when it grants the personal representative nonintervention powers. In a long line of cases, Washington courts have stated that, on entry of an order of solvency and the furnishing of any required bond, the court loses jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Coates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1017811\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/55/250/#p256\">\n    55 Wash.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20P.2d%20875\">\n    347 P.2d 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1959) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Peabody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853704\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/169/65/#p70\">\n    169 Wash. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20P.2d%20431\">\n    13 P.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1932) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Megrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"805357\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/142/324/#p326\">\n    142 Wash. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 326-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=253%20P.%20455\">\n    253 P. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927) ;\n   <em>\n    Schubach v.

At least, the co-personal representatives fail to identify in the record where they challenged the Community Foundation's qualification to seek removal. The co-personal representatives instead argue that qualifying under RCW 11.68.070 as a petitioner to seek removal entails standing, that lack of standing may be asserted for the first time on appeal, that standing is jurisdictional, and that lack of jurisdiction cannot be waived by failure to assert the defense before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b658 The Community Foundation impliedly concedes that qualifying as one identified by RCW 11.68.070 equates to standing. We question the assumption of the parties that the Community Foundation's fulfillment of the requirement of being an \"heir, devisee, [or] legatee\" under RCW 11.68.070 concerns standing. Standing is more of having an interest in the outcome of the issue and the Community Foundation has an interest regardless of whether it is listed as a person under the statute that may petition for removal of a personal representative. The co-personal representatives seek to impact the Community Foundation's interest as a beneficiary under a trust. To have standing, a party need only be in a law's zone of interest and must suffer some harm.\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Being a statutory designee to litigate and having standing may be distinct concepts. We do not address this question and proceed on the assumption that RCW 11.68.070 presents standing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b659 Whether JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill waived the opportunity to challenge the Community Foundation's suitability to seek removal of the co-personal representatives presents the most difficult question for this appeal. Unfortunately, Washington courts inconsistently rule whether a party waives a challenge to standing if not asserted before the trial court. Because of recent modernizing of the concept of subject matter jurisdiction, we wonder whether standing should implicate subject matter jurisdiction as long as the court in question has power to entertain the type of case before it. To answer the waiver question, we explore the underpinnings of subject matter jurisdiction, and we ruminate on the reasons behind requiring a party to forward a contention before the superior court before raising it in the Court of Appeals. Based on this exploration and musing, we hold that Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill waived the contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b660 Washington courts decide inconsistently whether a party waives a challenge to the opponent's standing when failing to assert the defense in the superior court.

A former employee sued her employer under the Washington Law Against Discrimination, chapter 49.60 RCW, when the employer terminated her after she injured her knee. On appeal, the employer raised for the first time that it employed less than eight employees, the statutory threshold for liability. The employer argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the employee had failed to show fulfillment of the statutory qualifications for a subject employer. This court declined to entertain the threshold argument. The court held that a statutory definition did not impose a jurisdictional requirement. We consider the language of RCW 11.68.070 with regard to an \"heir, devisee, or legatee\" to constitute a similar threshold issue that does not equate to a jurisdictional requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b670 The policies behind demanding that a litigant assert an argument in the trial court before raising the contention on appeal apply with force in JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky's and Steve Gill's appeal.

Nevertheless, the dispute in\n   <em>\n    Rathbone\n   </em>\n   involved the construction of a nonintervention will, not removal of a personal representative. More importantly, the\n   <em>\n    Rathbone\n   </em>\n   appellant did not raise a new argument on appeal and the Supreme Court did not address jurisdiction of the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b673 In\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

In turn, the court held that a defendant may raise the plaintiff's failure to establish his membership in the class under RCW 49.44.040 for the first time on appeal. The court based its ruling on the principle that a party may raise failure to establish facts on which relief can be granted for the first time in the appellate court under RAP 2.5(a). We decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Gross v.

The Community Foundation failed to comply with the process outlined in the statute. The Community Foundation filed a motion, not a petition. The Community Foundation never garnered a citation from the court after showing a prima\n   facie case of removal. We previously ruled that this failure did not rid the superior court of subject matter jurisdiction. We now ask whether the failure to follow the statutory procedure requires reversal and remand to begin the removal process anew.

In response, the superior court commented that it did not wish to dismiss the motion, but would order the co-personal representatives to show cause as to why they should not be removed, and would schedule a hearing date for sufficient time for JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill to respond. By then, the Community Foundation's counsel had filed a declaration that attached forty-six exhibits that presented a prima facie showing of a conflict of interest, including the January 8, 2016 letter from estate attorney Tom Culbertson informing them of a fiduciary duty to treat the Community Foundation fairly rather than advancing their own interests and the January 27, 2017 letter from JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky's attorney threatening to impose substantial fees on the Community Foundation.

Instead, counsel for the children erroneously stated that the court was offering a show cause hearing that very day. The superior court responded that it took counsel's response to be a declination of the offer to enter a show cause order and schedule a hearing for a later date. Neither the children nor the co-personal representatives then remarked that they did not wish to proceed with the hearing on the merits or that they wished for the superior court to enter a show cause and conduct a later hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b677 The children and the co-personal representatives either waived any objection to proceeding with a hearing on the merits or invited any error by refusing to accept an offer to postpone the hearing.

The decedent's personal representative claimed all of the estate as his property under community property laws. Another heir claimed some of the decedent's property to be separate property. Because of the contest, the court removed the personal representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b684 The record establishes that JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill violated one or more duties as fiduciaries to the estate of K. Wendell Reugh and the estate's heirs. The two held a duty to comply in good faith with the terms of the will, which directed placement of property into a trust, but they have instead sought to invalidate the trust. The co-personal representatives acted contrary to the interests of the Community Foundation and in violation of the duty of full disclosure, when they offered to distribute $2.2 million to the Community Foundation in satisfaction of the Community Foundation's share of the estate without informing the Community Foundation of the possible entitlement to $16 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b685 JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky claims that she makes no competing claim against the Community Foundation and that she only asks the superior court to resolve a dispute about the validity of the trust. This contention fails to note that, as one of the children of Wendell Reugh, she petitioned the court for invalidation of the trust. In a January 27, 2017 letter she wrote that her father actually intended that his children receive the assets directly, an assertion establishing that Reugh-Kovalsky wants the $16 million for herself and two siblings, not some other charity. In the same letter, the children threatened to impose substantial attorney fees on the Community Foundation if it did not settle for a small sum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \u00b686 The co-personal representatives direct our attention to Article IV, Section D of K. Wendell Reugh's will. The two claim that the section grants them the prerogative to disclaim the Community Foundation's interest in any trust. They misread the section, however, and thereby confirm the need for their removal. The section allows Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill to disclaim any interest that Wendell Reugh might gain in some third party's assets. The section does not authorize the personal representatives to violate the terms of the will, including the establishment of a trust. If the co-personal representatives held authority to disclaim any party's interest in K. Wendell Reugh's assets, one might ask why the personal representatives distributed $1.5 million to JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky under the terms of the trust instead of disclaiming Reugh-Kovalsky's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b687 The co-personal representatives also assert the technical argument that Article VI, Section G of the trust agreement does not read that the Community Foundation is a beneficiary of the trust, but rather directs the Community Foundation to establish an endowed donor advised fund. Such language still directs that the Community Foundation benefit from the trust. The argument further demonstrates the many devices arrayed by the co-personal representatives to defeat an adversary, to whom they owe a fiduciary duty. The more they argue, the more the co-personal representatives show their antagonism to the Community Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b688 JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill violated their duty of impartiality and loyalty by distributing almost $4.5 million among several beneficiaries, including co-personal representative JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky, in the amount specified in the trust agreement. These distributions conflict with their position that the trust is not valid and that they have never acted as co-trustees of the Reugh trust. At the same time, Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill denied the Community Foundation a distribution. Those actions contradicted their representations to the Internal Revenue Service and the Washington State Department of Revenue in the respective estate tax returns, which reported a charitable bequest of $16,675,286 to the Community Foundation, thereby exposing the estate to tax penalties and interest charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b689 The children and the co-personal representatives belittle Wendell Reugh's naming of Inland Northwest Community Foundation in the trust agreement by their referring to the Foundation as a default charitable organization. The children argue that the principal purpose of the trust was to qualify Wendell Reugh's estate for a charitable deduction under estate tax law. They argue that, under the trust agreement, Reugh principally wanted to establish his own charitable trust or donor advised fund in order to qualify for the deduction, but, for some unknown reason, Reugh never established the trust or fund. The co-personal representatives suggest that Wendell Reugh did not understand the terms of the trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \u00b690 The children and co-personal representatives hint that, because the Community Foundation was not Wendell Reugh's first choice and because Reugh's overwhelming motive was to save taxes, this court should shun any concern about the co-personal representatives' adversarial treatment of the Community Foundation. The fact remains, however, that Wendell Reugh named the Community Foundation as a trust beneficiary regardless of whether the children would hold a role in designating contributions disbursed by the Foundation. The co-personal representatives cite no law excusing their violation of fiduciary duties because of the status of the Community Foundation in a lower caste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \u00b691 We note that JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky's and Steve Gill's violation of duties extend more to their roles as co-trustees of the Reugh trust than co-personal representatives of the estate of K. Wendell Reugh. Nevertheless, neither argues that this distinction precludes their removal as co-personal representatives. We note that Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill claim they never activated the trust, such that they have only acted on behalf of the estate. If so, they indirectly harm the interest of the Community Foundation in administering the estate by failing to follow the will's direction to place assets in the Reugh trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b692 Throughout this appeal, JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky has referred to the Inland Northwest Community Foundation, one of\n   Spokane's leading eleemosynary organizations, as a \"financial predator\" asphyxiated with greed. The children and the co-personal representatives characterize the Community Foundation's conduct as \"defrauding\" the children and waging a \"campaign to seize\" the estate's assets. Rather than advancing their cause, the appellants' extreme brickbats bolster the need for removal. The hostility and insults against one named in her father's trust prove that Reugh-Kovalsky cannot impartially administer the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \u00b693 Steve Gill lacks the direct conflict of interest that his co-personal representative JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky holds. But Gill has taken no action to thwart the breaches of fiduciary duties by Reugh-Kovalsky. He has never exercised judgment independent of his co-personal representative, but rather echoed the positions taken by Reugh-Kovalsky, including answering the petition of invalidity of the trust by concurring in the invalidity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 7: Whether sufficient grounds existed to remove JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill as co-trustees of the Reugh trust?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 7: Yes.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b694 JoLynn Reugh-Kovalsky and Steve Gill also assign error on appeal to their removal as co-trustees of the Reugh revocable living trust. Nevertheless, the two present no independent argument beyond argument presented in opposition to their removal as co-personal representatives of the estate of K. William Reugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b695 We observe that a trustee of a trust holds the same fiduciary duties held by a personal representative of a decedent's estate. In fact, the law molds the duties of a personal representative based on the obligations of a trustee.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Ehlers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"421099\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/80/751/#p761\">\n    80 Wash.

The same facts that compel removal of Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill as co-personal representatives prescribe their removal as co-trustees of the trust. Particularly, the two's response to the children's petition to declare invalidity of a trust, in which they agree to the trust's invalidity, dictates removal. Seeking a court ruling regarding the validity of a trust may be acceptable for a trustee, but not actively agreeing to the invalidity of the trust. In addition, Reugh-Kovalsky and Gill contend no active trust exists, such that they are not even acting as trustees in contradiction to their fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 8: Whether the superior court erred when appointing Northwest Trust Services as the new personal representative rather than following Wendell Reugh's will's directions for appointing a substitute personal representative?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 8: We decline to address this question because the children failed to argue to the superior court of the need to follow the will's instructions.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b696 The children of K.

Nevertheless, when the superior court directed the parties to cooperate for the appointment of a new representative, the children refused to cooperate. They failed then to identify for the superior court the will's provision that creates a process for selecting a replacement.
