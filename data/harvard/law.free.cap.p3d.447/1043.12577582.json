In the vehicle with Carla were Karen Yazzie, Kyra King (King), and Kyrsten Henry. Carla, Karen Yazzie, and King were all injured in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The three filed a lawsuit against both the driver of the other vehicle, Eric Keltesch (Keltesch), and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) on June 22, 2016. State Farm insured the vehicle that was being driven by Carla at the time of the 2014 accident, and the relevant policy included underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage with a policy limit of $50,000. Keltesch was underinsured for the damages and injuries which resulted from the accident. Karen Yazzie's UIM claim was ultimately dismissed because she was not covered by the policy and Carla's UIM claim was settled before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 King and State Farm did not agree on the value of her claim and so it proceeded to trial in April 2018. State Farm had offered to settle King's claim for $20,000. The jury returned its verdict on April 18, 2018, which found that King had suffered damages in the amount of $410,000. On May 7, 2018, King filed a Motion for Attorney Fees and Litigation Expenses, seeking both attorney fees and a total of $12,767.33 in litigation expenses and costs. On May 11, 2018, King filed an Affidavit for Attorney Fees and Litigation Expenses in Support of Motion, which revised her request for litigation expenses and costs to $12,758.35. State Farm filed its response brief on May 21, 2018, agreeing that King was entitled to her attorney fees, but arguing that King was not entitled to claim her costs because they were not timely filed and exceeded those allowable by statute. On May 22, 2018, the District Court entered its Judgment against State Farm in the amount of $50,000-the policy limit-along with \"interest and taxable costs.\" The District Court's Judgment further stated that the \"issue of Plaintiff's attorneys' fees and non-taxable costs shall be determined later.\" On June 4, 2018, King filed both a Renewed Motion for Attorney Fees and Litigation Expenses and a Reply Brief in Support of Litigation Expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The District Court held a hearing on King's Motion for Attorney Fees and Litigation Expenses on July 24, 2018. At the hearing, counsel for King again revised her requested litigation expenses and costs-this time seeking a total of $11,800.08. On July 27, 2018, the District Court issued its Order on Attorney Fees and Litigation Expenses. The District Court awarded King $20,000 in attorney fees, pursuant to King's 40% contingency fee arrangement with her attorney, and denied all of King's claimed litigation expenses and costs because they were not filed within five days of the jury's verdict as\n   required by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   King appeals, arguing that the timing requirement of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, only applies to those taxable costs found in \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, and she should have been granted her request for nontaxable costs in the form of litigation expenses not covered by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 We review a district court's order concerning costs for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Total Indus.

By their very nature, insurance contracts such as King's with State Farm are not bargained on equal footing between the parties, but are contracts of adhesion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). After State Farm offered King only $20,000-well below the policy limit of $50,000-King was forced to take the matter to trial, where a jury determined that she had suffered $410,000 in damages in the accident, to recover the benefits to which she was entitled from the insurance contract with State Farm. It is undisputed that King's case falls under the insurance exception to the American Rule, and all parties agree that she is entitled to her $20,000 award of attorney fees. As previously addressed, it is also undisputed that King did not file a memorandum of costs within five days of the jury's verdict to recover her taxable costs pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-201 and -501, MCA. Where the\n   parties differ, however, is regarding King's entitlement to her litigation expenses which do not fall under \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, or her \"nontaxable costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b614 In\n   <em>\n    Mlekush I\n   </em>\n   , Mlekush was injured in an accident with an underinsured motorist. Mlekush had underinsured motorist coverage with a $200,000 policy limit through Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers). After several months of exchanging medical information with and requesting payments from Farmers, Mlekush eventually filed suit in the district court, seeking payment of the sums due to her under her UIM policy with Farmers. A year and a half later, after the parties had exchanged several settlement offers, Mlekush received a jury verdict in the amount of $450,000. The district court entered judgment against Farmers and in favor of Mlekush for the UIM policy limit of $200,000. Five days after the verdict, Mlekush filed a memorandum of costs pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-201 and -501, MCA. Three weeks after the\n   verdict, Mlekush filed a motion for \"attorney fees and nontaxable costs.\" The district court denied Mlekush's motion for attorney fees and nontaxable costs, finding that Mlekush did not meet the insurance exception.\n   <em>\n    Mlekush I\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3-7.

After the case was remanded to the district court in\n   <em>\n    Mlekush I\n   </em>\n   , the district court again determined that Mlekush was not entitled to her attorney fees and nontaxable costs pursuant to the insurance exception to the American Rule.\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. We again reversed the district court, holding that the insurance exception to the American Rule applies when an \"insured is compelled to pursue litigation and a jury returns a verdict in excess of the insurer's last offer to settle an underinsured motorist claim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23.

We ultimately remanded again to the district court with instructions to \"consider a reasonable amount of fees,\n   <strong>\n    costs\n   </strong>\n   , and interest to which Mlekush is entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b616 In both\n   <em>\n    Mlekush I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   , this Court considered the district court's denial of Mlekush's motion for attorney fees and nontaxable costs. Each time, we reversed the district court's denial of that motion. Finally, we remanded to the district court to award Mlekush her attorney fees, costs, and interest under the insurance exception to the American Rule.\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25. We implicitly extended the insurance exception to the American Rule to allow for the recovery of nontaxable costs in the\n   <em>\n    Mlekush I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mlekush II\n   </em>\n   decisions. We now extend it explicitly. Restated, we hold that the insurance exception to the American Rule allows for an insured to recover both taxable and nontaxable costs from an insurer when the insured is forced to assume to burden of legal action to obtain the full benefit of\n   his or her policy. The insurance exception is a \"rule of court\" that removes such cases from the exclusive operation of \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA.\n   <em>\n    Total Indus. Plant Servs.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 64. To recover taxable costs, the insured must submit a memorandum of costs within the time required by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA. To recover nontaxable costs pursuant to the insurance exception, the insured must submit a request for those nontaxable costs contemporaneously with, or before, a request for attorney's fees. We hold that a request for nontaxable costs under the insurance exception to the American Rule must be made by this time to facilitate the \"uniform, timely notification of what costs are claimed and enable[ ] the opposing party to enter an objection.\"\n   <em>\n    Total Indus. Plant Servs.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 68.\n   \u00b617 In the present case, the District Court correctly awarded King her attorney fees pursuant to the insurance exception to the American Rule and correctly denied King's request for taxable costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, as untimely. Because King should have been allowed to request her nontaxable costs even after filing her motion past the five-day limit imposed by \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA, however, the District Court erred when it denied King's request for her nontaxable litigation expenses incurred due to State Farm's behavior. The matter must be remanded to the District Court to determine the amount of nontaxable costs to be awarded to King.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b618 The District Court correctly held that King was not entitled to her taxable costs as provided by \u00a7 25-10-201, MCA, because they were not timely filed.
