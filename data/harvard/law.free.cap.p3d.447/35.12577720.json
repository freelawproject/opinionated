In the present case, the only explanation the trial court provided for not ordering husband to purchase a life insurance policy was that wife did not provide the court with the cost of the policy or \"any information except a number\" and the parties' \"significant debt.\" However, we are not aware of, and the court did not supply any, statutory authority to deny life insurance on those bases. Furthermore, we do not understand how the parties' debt (which the court divided between them) justifies not securing a spousal support obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 107.810 (\"It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage persons obligated to support other persons as the result of a dissolution * * * to obtain or to cooperate in the obtaining of life insurance adequate to provide for the continued support of those persons in the event of the obligor's death.\"). We therefore remand to the trial court to reconsider and articulate its findings regarding the adequate amount of life insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Reversed and remanded for reconsideration of spousal support and life insurance awards; otherwise affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The uncontested facts indicate that wife stayed home to raise their children by the parties' mutual agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    There were several letter opinions and supplemental judgments entered in this case.

The obligated spouse has the option of obtaining a nonreducing term life insurance policy or any other type of policy in lieu of using existing policies.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
