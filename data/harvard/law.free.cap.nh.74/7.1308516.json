Kingsley to Charles C. Kingsley in April, 1904. Brigham is the guardian of Austin, and the defendant of Charles. Transferred from the October term, 1905, of the superior court by <em>Peaslee, </em>J., upon the defendant\u2019s exception to a decree ordering him to discharge the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-14\">At the time the mortgage was executed neither of the parties thereto was under guardianship. Austin was then capable of making a contract, while Charles was not. Austin was largely indebted to various persons and had in his possession property of Charles amounting to about $4,000, but neither understood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the mortgage was given as security for Austin\u2019s liability on that account. Charles had no purpose when he executed the affidavit on the mortgage, and Austin\u2019s sole purpose was to delay and defraud his creditors. Austin is insolvent, and the property covered by the mortgage is needed to pay his debts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-5\"><em>Mosea W. Brigham </em>and <em>Cain </em>Benton, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>Joseph Madden </em>and <em>Charles M. </em>Mersey, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-7\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">If Austin was indebted to Charles when the mortgage was made, the court has found the mortgage was not made to secure Charles against loss on that account. Consequently the latter\u2019s guardian cannot hold the property for that 'purpose; for when the mortgagee has a claim against the mortgagor that is not included in the mortgage indebtedness, he cannot apply the mortgaged property in satisfaction of it without the mortgagor\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Notwithstanding Austin is estopped to deny the validity of this mortgage, his creditors are not, and Austin\u2019s guardian represents them in so far as the property is needed to pay his debts <em>(Cook </em>v. Lee, 72 N. H. 569, 571); and since the property is needed for that purpose, the order must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
