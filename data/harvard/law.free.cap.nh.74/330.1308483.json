In March, 1904, the partnership was dissolved, the plaintiff assuming the firm\u2019s indebtedness. The defendant Tilton was a creditor to the amount of $858.69, and held notes of the firm for the indebtedness. March 15, 1904, the plaintiff mailed Tilton a check for $300 and a new note for the balance of the old debt. In an accompanying letter he wrote that he had bought out his former partner, that he hoped Tilton would take a new note in part payment as old ones became due, and that he was to be backed by George E. Seavey, whose financial standing could be looked up. By May 14, 1904, the plaintiff had fully paid the old debt. Thereafter he continued to trade with Tilton, making payments from time to time, until his failure in November, 1904. In February, 1905, he was petitioned into bankruptcy, being then indebted to Tilton, who proved his claim in bankruptcy. At a hearing before the referee in bankruptcy, the plaintiff testified that Seavey had not agreed to back him financially.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">March 10, 1905, Tilton swore out a complaint against the plaintiff, charging him with obtaining goods under false pretences, upon which a warrant was issued returnable to the police court of Portsmouth. The charge in the complaint was that the plaintiff had procured credit of Tilton by falsely representing that Seavey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>a man of financial responsibility, was to back the plaintiff hi the business in which he was about to engage. March 17, 1905, the defendant Cram, a deputy sheriff, arrested the plaintiff upon the warrant at Windham and took him to Portsmouth, arriving there after the adjournment of the regular session of the police court for that day. The plaintiff and Cram went to the office of Til-ton\u2019s attorney, who was the justice by whom the warrant was issued, and an arrangement was made with the justice of the police court for a special hearing during the afternoon. While in Portsmouth, the plaintiff protested his innocence, claimed that the warrant was unjust, and was apparently anxious to obtain counsel. After making fruitless efforts in this direction, it was suggested that one Pulver, who had acted as counsel for Tilton in the bankruptcy proceeding, could act as counsel for the plaintiff. A conference was held, and Tilton\u2019s counsel explained to the plaintiff the meaning of the word \u201cbacker,\u201d as used in his letter. Being advised that the only way to escape jail was to secure Tilton for his debt, the plaintiff agreed to a conveyance of his homestead right and personal exemptions, and partly executed such a conveyance while at Portsmouth in the custody of Cram. At the plaintiff\u2019s request, Cram afterward accompanied him to Manchester, where his wife joined in the conveyance; and this being done, the officer released the plaintiff from arrest, at the request of himself and Tilton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">The defendants excepted to the following portion of the charge to the jury: \u201c So far as the defendant Cram was concerned, it was his duty under the law to take the plaintiff under the warrant, and take him before the court, and make due return of the process and lie acted unlawfully in not presenting him before the court, and in permitting him to enter into this contract whereby he allowed this complaint to be suppressed, and he was liable for such damages resulting to the plaintiff\u2019 in consequence of that suppression. The defendant Tilton, having lawfully sworn out the warrant and placed it in the hands of the deputy sheriff, had no-right to enter into a contract whereby the warrant might be suppressed ; and after participating in the contract and taking part in that wrongful act, he is liable for any wrong which Clark suffered as a result of this process which was used against Clark. The defendants are liable because the evidence, without any question, fails to show a justification of the suppression of the criminal process, and they are liable for such damages as result from the abuse. In other words, they are liable in exactly the same way as if the defendants had proceeded without a warrant.\u201d The jury were also instructed that they should find a verdict for the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>tiff, and that the only question for their consideration was one of \u25a0damages.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-5\"><em>G.

Enc. Law, 2d ed., 724); and according to the rule of the common law, an officer could not avail himself of civil or criminal process to justify an arrest, unless he returned the writ or produced the prisoner with the warrant before the court to which the process was returnable <em>(Barrett </em>v. <em>White, </em>3 N. H. 210, 229; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Pattee, </em>4 N. H. 530; <em>Poor </em>v. <em>Taggart, </em>37 N. H. 544; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>42 N. H. 25; <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.

Sher. &amp; Const. 283, 284; 19 Cyc. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Pattee, supra, </em>it was said that an action of trespass could not be maintained against an officer who had made an arrest upon civil process, for his failure to return the writ to court,, if he delivered the writ to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and a settlement was made by the parties before the return day. This view of the law must have proceeded upon the theory that, the suit having been settled by agreement of the parties, the-process could be used to justify the arrest, on the ground that the settlement was conclusive or <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an agreement that the person arrested would not interpose the omission to the officer\u2019s use of the process as a justification. <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>118 Mass. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In the service of criminal process, while it is the duty of an \u2022officer, having made an arrest, to take the prisoner as soon as circumstances will reasonably permit before the court to which the warrant is returnable for hearing, still this duty is not so impera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tive that its performance, at least as between the officer and the prisoner, may not be omitted; and if omitted at the prisoner\u2019s-request, of such a nature that the prisoner may not be estopped <em>to </em>interpose the omission to the officer\u2019s use of the warrant to justify such acts under it as were regular and legal. ' That this is the law in many jurisdictions may be seen from an examination of the eases above cited; and no reason appears why this should not be so, if the prisoner\u2019s request not to be returned before the court is-made of his own free will and is not procured unfairly or through coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Again, it is the law of this jurisdiction, that if an arrest is made for a just cause, upon a warrant which is regular and legal upon its face and issued from a court of competent jurisdiction, and the imprisonment consequent thereon is made use of to extort money from the prisoner, or to compel him against his will to pay a debt,, such conduct makes the imprisonment a duress, which will render every act done under it voidable and make those directing or participating in the improper use of tlie process liable as trespassers <em>ah initio.

In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Spooner, supra, Parker, </em>C. J., expressed the view of the court in this language: \u201cIt must be distinctly understood that it is wholly illegal to use the criminal process of the state to extort money, or even compel the payment of debts. It was not provided for any such purpose. If a creditor is desirous of collecting a demand lawfully due'to him, the laws have provided remedies deemed by the' legislature suitable and competent for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In the present case the court instructed the jury, in substance, .that the only question for them to consider was one of damages; that the defendant Tilton had no right to enter into a - contract with the plaintiff whereby he obtained a conveyance of the plaintiff\u2019s homestead right and personal exemptions in settlement of his account against him ; and that the defendant Cram acted unlawfully in not presenting the plaintiff before the court and in permitting him to enter into the contract with Tilton. These instructions cannot be sustained, for, as we have seen, the jury should have been told that, to entitle the plaintiff to recover in'this action against Cram, they must be satisfied either (1) that the plaintiff did not freely and of his own volition request the officer not to-return him before the court, and is not estopped to take advantage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>of the officer\u2019s omission to do so, or (2) that the officer made use of the plaintiff\u2019s imprisonment to compel him against his will to transfer his property to Tilton in payment of the debt; and as respects the defendant Tilton, they should have been told that they must be satisfied that he, either directly or through Cram, made use of the plaintiff\u2019s imprisonment to compel him against his will to transfer his property in payment of the debt. The \u2022charge of the court would also give one the impression that the jury were instructed to assess such damages as resulted to the plaintiff in consequence of the suppression of the criminal prosecution. If this is its meaning, it is clearly wrong. The damages to be assessed are such as will compensate the plaintiff for the injury he has sustained because of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">It is not deemed advisable at this time to consider the questions raised by the exceptions to evidence. At another trial the same evidence may not be offered, and if offered, the issue may not be the same. The exception to the charge is sustained, and the \u2022order is,</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
