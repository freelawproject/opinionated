Transferred from the September term, 1906, of the superior court by <em>Pike, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-11\">Before 1895, the owner of a tract of land in Manchester plotted it and recorded the plan, which showed the lots into which it had been divided and a proposed street called Brooklyn avenue. Prior to November 11, 1895, he sold all the lots but one, bounding them by that avenue, and on that day sold the last lot together with the location of the avenue to the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor in title. After the plaintiff bought the property, the mayor and aldermen laid out Brooklyn avenue as a highway and awarded him one cent as damages. He appealed, and the commissioners gave him the same damages. When this report was filed, he asked to have his damages assessed by a jury. \u201c Upon the foregoing facts, if the plaintiff cannot maintain his action his appeal is to bo dismissed; otherwise to stand in order for trial.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-12\"><em>Henry N.

P. S., <em>c. </em>68, <em>s. </em>10; Laws 1897, <em>c. </em>13. But if the question is the measure of his damages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the answer is that he can recover no more than the commissioners-awarded him, if the agreed case contains all the evidence bearing: on that question, for this ease cannot be distinguished from <em>Walker </em>v. Manchester, 58 N. H. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
