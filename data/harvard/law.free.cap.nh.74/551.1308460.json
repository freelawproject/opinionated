The owner of the premises upon which the labor was performed died insolvent before this suit was brought. The defendants are his heirs, administrator, and widow. The plaintiffs moved for judgment, and the defendants to dismiss; and the questions of law raised by these motions were transferred without a ruling from the December term, 1907, of the superior court by <em>Chamberlin, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-13\"><em>Herbert I.

The statute (P. S. <em>c. </em>141, <em>ss. </em>10, 16) provides in substance that persons who furnish work as the plaintiffs did shall have a lien on the property for ninety days after the work is completed. There is nothing in the statute to suggest that the lien shall be lost if the owner dies within the ninety days; consequently it must be held that the owner\u2019s death did not destroy the plaintiffs\u2019 lien. The same construction has been given similar statutes in other jurisdictions. 27 Cye. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>2. Real estate vests in the heirs on the death of the owner; consequently they were the proper defendants when this proceeding was begun. As the land is needed to pay debts, it was proper, after the appointment of the administrator, to cite him in to defend ; but on the agreed facts, neither he nor the heirs can make any defence to this action which the owner could not make if living. There must be, therefore, a verdict for the plaintiffs according to the agreement of the parties; for in so far as the widow is concerned, she stands just as she would if the lien had been foreclosed in her husband\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Gase discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-5\">\u25a0All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
