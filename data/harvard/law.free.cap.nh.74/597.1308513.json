There was no evidence that the defendants\u2019 knowledge of the danger from which the injuries resulted was, or could have been, superior to that of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. <em>Dube </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>69 N.

Whether rules should have been adopted by the defendants, which if enforced would have prevented the leaving of the pair of wheels near the southwesterly corner of the vat into which the deceased fell, is immaterial, because there was no evidence tending to show that the presence of the wheels caused or contributed to his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-14\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
