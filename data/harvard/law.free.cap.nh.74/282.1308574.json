Hollis appeared and filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied without exception. The plaintiffs then filed an amendment to their petition, stating that they desired, through their attorneys, to inspect all records, accounts, and papers belonging to the Breeders\u2019 Club, for the purpose of obtaining, among other things, the following information: (1) The names of all grantees and associate grantees, the residence of each, when elected, how long each was connected with the corporation, and what votes or acts each participated in with reference to incurring any debts or obligations against the corporation. (2) The name and residence of each director, when elected, and how long he remained in office. (3) A list of the stockholders and their respective residences, and when certificates of stock were issued to each. (4) The amount of debts, liabilities, and contracts of the Breeders\u2019 Club, and when each debt, liability, or contract was incurred. (5) A list of all the officers of the Breeders\u2019 Club, and when each one was elected, and how long he remained in office.

To this order he excepted, and demurred to the amended petition, stating the following grounds: (1) That the discovery or relief sought may subject said defendant to pains and penalties, or to some forfeiture, or something in the nature of forfeiture. (2) That said bill does not allege any suit pending, or to be brought, in which the discovery sought would be material. (3) That said bill does not describe with sufficient accuracy the records, accounts, and papers, or the parts of the same, which it desires to inspect. (4) That said bill does not show by clear averment the materiality of the records, accounts, and papers sought to be disclosed. (5) That said bill is not incidental to any relief which said court has the right to grant. .

(7) That said plaintiff does not show that it is fairly entitled to the evidence sought in order to enable it properly to prepare and try its ease. (8) That said plaintiff has a full, adequate, and complete remedy at law by special statute. (9) That said bill does not state a case coming within the principles of equity jurisprudence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-4\">The demurrer' was overruled, and the defendant Hollis was ordered to submit for inspection of the petitioners\u2019 attorney all the records, accounts, or papers relating to the overdue and unpaid demand of the petitioners which are in his hands and possession as clerk of said corporation, or which belonged to the records and files of the corporation.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><em>Mandamus </em>is the appropriate remedy by which to enforce the right of corporate stockholders and members to an inspection of the books and records of the corporation, and of creditors of the corporation in cases where such right is given by statute. 10 Cyc. 961, s. 20b; High Ex. Rem., <em>ss. </em>308, 312; 2 Spell. Ex. Rel., <em>s. </em>1610; <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>3 E. &amp; B. 784. The proceeding is therefore to be considered as an application for such writ, and not as a bill of discovery. This is especially clear in this state, since the original of the statute under consideration was adopted in 1830 (Laws 1830, <em>c. </em>13, s. 1), when, whatever may be the fact as to the existence of equitable principles as a part of the common law of the state, there was no court with general chancery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>powers, and the accepted construction of the law was that the court had no chancery power except what was specifically conferred by statute. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Fibre Co., </em>71 N. H. 332, 333; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>27 N. H. 503, 512: <em>Dover </em>v. <em>Portsmouth Bridge, </em>17 N. H. 200, 212. It is not probable, as the law was then understood, that in 1830 the legislature, in granting a right of inspection of the votes and proceedings of corporations to creditors whose demands were unpaid, contemplated a proceeding in equity for discovery, general authority for which was not specifically conferred upon the court until twelve years later. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Fibre Co., supra; </em>Laws 1828, Nov. Sess., <em>c. </em>95, <em>s. </em>9 (Act of January 2, 1829); Laws 1832, <em>c. </em>89, s. 9; R. S., c. 171, <em>s. </em>6. As the proceeding is not a bill for discovery, or a petition in the nature of such a bill, it is immaterial whether the allegations of the petition are sufficient to sustain such a proceeding. The authorities cited by the defendant to sustain his contentions in this respect, and' those construing statutes authorizing proceedings of this nature, are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">This conclusion, however, does not meet all the objections-raised by the defendant. Other grounds remain to be considered. Among them, the one first stated is that the relief sought may subject the defendant to pains and penalties, or some forfeiture, or something in the nature of a forfeiture. It is a sufficient answer to this contention that it is not supported by the facts in the case. By section 14, chapter 148, Public Statutes, the clerk or other officer or agent of a corporation is made liable to a penalty for the neglect, or refusal to furnish, after demand, and payment or tender of his fees, a certified copy of any record, account, or paper which the party demanding is entitled to inspect. This is a penal statute and must be strictly construed. The penalty attaches to the neglect or refusal for the specified time to give the certified copy, and not to the refusal to permit inspection \u2014 the only matter now alleged against the clerk. As the defendant is not on the facts alleged liable to any penalty, compelling him to perform his statutory duty \u2014 the relief asked \u2014 will not subject him to one. Whether, if he had made himself liable lo the penalty, that fact would excuse him from obeying the law permitting inspection, is not considered. As there is no penalty prescribed against any officer of a corporation who refuses to permit an inspection of the records accounts, and papers of a corporation, the statute itself fails to provide a remedy, and the defendant\u2019s argument under his eighth ground \u2014 that the plaintiffs should first exhaust the remedy provide! by the statute \u2014 is without support.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The emaining reasons urged in support of the demurrer \u2014 that the papers which the plaintiffs desire to inspect are not described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>with sufficient accuracy, that their materiality is not shown by \u2022clear averment, and that the plaintiffs are not entitled to a general inspection of the corporation papers \u2014 are in substance an objection that the facts upon which the plaintiffs rest their right to the writ are not definitely or sufficiently alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">\u201c When a statute is relied upon as a declaration of a duty to do a thing, it should clearly appear by its' terms or necessary implication that the performance of the act devolved upon the defendant, for the benefit of the petitioner; . . . and all the facts upon which rests the relator\u2019s claim to have the duty performed must be alleged in issuable form.\u201d 2 Spell. Ex. Rel., s. 1370. The statute upon which the plaintiffs rest their right is as follows: \u201cAll records, accounts, and papers of a corporation shall be open to the inspection of every member and stockholder of the corporar tion: and such portions thereof as have any relation to an overdue and unpaid demand of a creditor of the corporation, or to the collection of any such demand, shall be open to the inspection of the creditor and of his attorney.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>148, s. 12. As the \u00a1statute requires certain papers to be open to inspection, it follows by ^necessary implication that the duty devolves upon the person in charge of such papers to permit the exercise of the right of inspection by those to whom it is given. The defendant is alleged to be clerk of the corporation, and as such officer is the official custodian of certain of the records and papers of the corporation. P. S., <em>c. </em>148, <em>ss. </em>10, 11. The petition alleges certain records and papers to be in his possession and the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u2022overdue and unpaid demand to which it is alleged the said records \u00a1and papers have relation. The only allegation that appears to be open to the objection of insufficiency is the one alleging that the records and papers named have relation to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Whether the papers have any relation to the plaintiffs\u2019 demand or its collection would seem to be an inference to be drawn from the facts in the case. Whether a particular inference can be \u2022drawn is a question of law; and there seems to be force in the defendant\u2019s contention that the facts from which such inference is \u2022claimed to be drawn should be alleged, thereby affording the opportunity for a joinder of issue on the questions of fact and law involved. The plaintiffs, by amendment to their petition, set forth various items of information which they desire to obtain. It also appears from the defendant\u2019s pleading that the corporation is insolvent. From this fact and the nature of the information asked for by the plaintiffs, it may be inferred that the relation between the records and papers the plaintiffs desire to inspect and their unpaid demand and its collection is the assistance the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that may be disclosed thereby may render in the collection of their demand, by the enforcement of the individual liability of the officers and stockholders of the corporation. P. S., <em>cc. </em>150, 151; <em>Carter, Rice </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Hano Co., </em>73 N. H. 588. It is not to be inferred as matter of law that the plaintiffs have knowledge of the particular records, accounts, and papers in the defendant\u2019s possession ; and an allegation that they desire to inspect all papers containing specified information to which the statute entitles them, as having some relation upon the ground suggested, or some other which may be alleged, to their demand or its collection, would seem to be as definite a description as could be obtained in advance. Upon the interpretation of the amendment above suggested, the record discloses all the facts which in this respect the defendant claims should be shown by the allegations of the petition. The objection therefore upon the whole record is merely formal, and can be easily obviated by inserting in the petition by amendment the fact of the insolvency of the corporation and the desire of the plaintiffs to inspect, in addition to the papers named in the petition, all records, accounts, and papers containing the information specified in the amendment. As the amendment will obviate the objection, it is not necessary to further consider its necessity. <em>Fellows </em>v. Judge, 72 N. H. 466, 467; <em>Peaslee </em>v. <em>Dudley, 6</em>3 N. H. 220. The objection to indefiniteness in the order can be cured in the same way, by limiting the inspection to the records, accounts, and papers containing the information specified in the amended petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The great weight of the American authorities as to the stockholders\u2019 right of inspection is to the effect that when the right is statutory it is not necessary for the petition to aver or show the purposes or objects of the inspection. <em>Cincinnati etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Hoffmeister, </em>62 Ohio St. 189, 198,\u201478 Am. St. Rep. 707; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>165 Ill. 192, 206,\u201456 Am. St. Rep. 240; <em>Ellsworth </em>v. <em>Dorwart, </em>95 Ia. 108,\u201458 Am. St. Rep. 427; <em>Johnson </em>v. Langdon, 135 Cal. 624, 626,\u201487 Am. St. Rep. 156. The cases proceed upon the principle that where a party has a legal right to do a thing, the motive that may move him to act is not a proper subject even for judicial investigation. <em>Friel </em>v. <em>Plumer, </em>69 N. H. 488, 489; <em>Horan </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>72 N. H. 93, 98; 10 Cyc. 956, <em>s. </em>4. In the present case, no reason appears why the plaintiffs should be required to allege more than the statute defines as the basis of their right. Whether such an application was for\u2019 a proper purpose would ordinarily be determined in the trial of the question whether the subjects of the inspection desired boro any relation to the creditor\u2019s unpaid demand or its collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Without deciding whether the motives or purposes of a creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>in seeking to enforce the right given by statute might not be such as to defeat his application for <em>mandamus, </em>the present case is disposed of by the conclusion that the allegation of all the facts made essential by the statute is upon demurrer a sufficient statement of the ground upon which the right is demanded. The admissibility of the records, papers, and accounts as evidence in some proceeding brought by the creditor against the corporation, or some other, is not made a test of his right to inspect them. It cannot be said as matter of law that such papers have not some relation to the creditor\u2019s demand or to its collection, though the documents themselves may not be admissible as evidence in a proceeding to enforce the creditor\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>Oase discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
