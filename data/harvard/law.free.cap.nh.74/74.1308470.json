By the decree of May 6, it was determined that George E. Kent\u2019s estate was-chargeable upon the settlement of his guardianship account with the notes in question <em>in specie, </em>and not for their value represented in money. Thereupon the plaintiff held the notes as specific property belonging to the wards. From this decree no appeal was prosecuted. The jurisdiction of the probate court in that matter is unquestioned. The decree bound the wards as well as the plaintiff. It was a final adjudication between parties who, it must be presumed, were properly before the court, upon a matter within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Goodell, </em>63 N. H. 458. Unappealed from, it is so far conclusive that \u201c evidence of facts inconsistent with it is incompetent.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Goodell, supra. </em>Hence the first decree was of binding force upon the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent petition for leave to transfer the securities to the defendant. The attempt to show in this proceeding that the wards\u2019 money was improperly or illegally invested in the notes is an attack upon the former subsisting judgment between the same parties in interest. The refusal of the probate court to allow the plaintiff to turn over the notes to the defendant was ini effect a reversal of the former decree <em>pro tanto, </em>and cannot be sustained. Upon receiving the notes, the defendant will take such action with reference to them as the interests of his wards may seem to require. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Meserve, </em>73 N.
