H. 491. Although the fact that their adopted child takes more and he less than if she were their own child may have .some tendency to prove that he ought to have such an estate, it has no tendency to prove that the legislature intended to give it to him, for he takes the same share of his wife\u2019s estate that he would if they had not adopted Carrie.
