He moved to Berlin some time in tbe early part of 1904, and bis taxes were abated in Lancaster for that year. In September, 1905, he returned to Lancaster. He died in 1906. Upon tbe foregoing agreed facts, it was ruled that the paupers, who are Louden\u2019s widow and minor children, had no settlement in Lancaster and were a charge upon the county.

The paupers derived their settlement, if any, from Fred Louden, the husband and father. P. S., <em>c. </em>83, <em>s. </em>1, <em>el. </em>I, II. His settlement, if any, was gained under the ninth clause of section 1, chapter 83, Public Statutes. To gain a settlement in this mode, residence in the town for seven years, taxation of the poll for seven successive years, and payment of all taxes legally assessed during the term are required. Residence, taxation of the poll for the specified term, and payment are all essential. Failure to comply with the statute in either particular will prevent a settlement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Warren </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>45 N. H. 564; <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Newport, </em>42 N. H. 338; <em>Berlin </em>v. <em>Gorham, </em>34 N. H. 266; <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>30 N.

New Boston, </em>3 N. H. 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As the settlement must have been wholly gained within ten years preceding the application for support, evidence of any facts prior to the same date ten years before \u2014 April 2, 1897 \u2014 is immaterial. The case stands precisely as if the person whose settlement is claimed to have been acquired came into the town for the first time on April 2, 1897. <em>Andover </em>v. <em>County, </em>37 N. H. 437, 440<em>; Andover </em>v. <em>County, </em>46 N. H. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Whether Louden gave up his residence in Lancaster so early in 1904 that he did not reside there seven years after April 1, 1897, is not clear from the statement that he \u201c moved to Berlin some time in the early part of 1904.\u201d If he abandoned his residence in Lancaster prior to April 1, 1904, neither residence nor legal taxation of his poll for seven years in succession is shown. If he did not leave until after April 1, his failure to pay the tax of 1904 is sufficient to prevent his gaining a settlement \u25a0within the prescribed time. His payment of the tax of 1897 is immaterial, since that tax was imposed on April 1, more than ten years before the application for aid. Taxation on that day is no more material than his residence in \u2022 Lancaster on the same day, on which ground only could the tax have been assessed against him. P. S., <em>c. </em>57, <em>s. </em>1. In the absence of any suggestion of error by brief or argument in behalf of the county, no ground is perceived upon which to question the ruling of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\n<em>Exception ovemled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
