Defence, justification on the ground of self-defence against an attack by the plaintiff. Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. Transferred from the May term, 190T, of the superior court by <em>Peaslee, </em>J. The plaintiff excepted to a refusal to charge the jury as follows: To sustain a plea of self-defence, the defendant must show either that he retreated to avoid the encounter, or that retreat was impossible or was attended with great danger.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-9\"><em>Osgood </em>&lt;f- <em>Osgood, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-10\"><em>George A.

Com. 184, 185; 2 Bish. Cr. Law, <em>s. </em>548, <em>et seq.) </em>need not be considered; but that the plaintiff was not entitled to the charge in the present action is elementary law. It was one of the defendant\u2019s \u201c natural, essential, and inherent \u201d rights to do whatever apparently was reasonably necessary to be done, to repel the plaintiff\u2019s attack. <em>Dole </em>v. <em>Erskine, </em>35 N.
