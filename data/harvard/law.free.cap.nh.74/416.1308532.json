The court is, therefore, asked to construe the provisions of a document purporting to dispose of the property of the deceased, while proceedings are pending which may show that its execution was invalid, and that the plaintiff has no title to the estate as executrix and no trust duties to perforin. It does not appear that the advice sought will be of use to the plaintiff in the discharge of official duties. In such a case the court will decline to comply with the request for instructions. As held in <em>Carr </em>v. <em>St. Paul\u2019s </em>Parish, 71 N. H. 231, the jurisdiction of the court to advise in the administration of a trust is not ordinarily exercised unless the advice is necessary for the protection of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
