In pursuance of legislative authority and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>vote of the inhabitants, the district purchased land in Canaan, constructed a reservoir thereon, and established a system of waterworks which at the time of the assessment in question was used for municipal purposes and fox supplying private persons with water under contracts which yielded an income; and the tax sought to be recovered was assessed upon the defendants\u2019 property in Canaan so used. The defendants do not question the regularity of the assessment, or claim that the tax is not proportional.

The contention of the defendants is that their charter authorized the purchase of the property for water-works purposes \u2022and exempted it from taxation (Laws 1903, <em>c. </em>221); but this contention cannot bo set up in defence of the action. The assessment is in the nature of a judgment and cannot be attacked collaterally. If the property assessed was not taxable, or the tax was excessive, the defendants\u2019 remedy was by an application to the selectmen of Canaan for an abatement, and, in case they declined to grant it, to seasonably petition the court for a like purpose. By so doing a hearing could be had and any error in the assessment corrected. <em>Farmington </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>67 N. H. 441, 442; <em>Pittsfield </em>v. <em>Exeter, </em>69 N. H. 336, 338. But as more than nine months have elapsed since the defendants were notified of the tax (P. S., <em>c. </em>59, s. 11), it is now too late to petition for an abatement; and in compliance with the order made in the superior court, there must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
