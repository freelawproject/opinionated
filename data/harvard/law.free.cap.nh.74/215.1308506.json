In 1905, the plaintiff was appointed trustee by the probate court, to hold certain property and estate described in the will. Besides certain provisions in favor of the husband of the testatrix during life, the will contained the following: \u201c II. I give and bequeath, upon the death of [my] husband, the use of my farm in Vassal-borough, . . . during the term of her natural life, to my daughter, Emily F. Colman, of Vassalborough, Maine. III. I give and bequeath, upon the death of my husband, the use of my house and lot where I reside and which is the family homestead, during the term of her natural life, to Any daughter, Lottie B. Ring, of Manchester aforesaid. . . . V. I give and bequeath to my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>daughters aforesaid, and to the survivor of them, the income from all the rest of my real estate and personal property in equal shares during the terms of their natural lives. VI. I give, bequeath, and devise to the children now living, or who may be hereafter born to my daughter, Lottie B. Ring, all the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate of every kind.\u201d The husband of the testatrix died in 1899. The estate consists of the farm in Vassal-borough and the family homestead in Manchester mentioned in the second and third clauses of the will, and of two lots of land with buildings upon them in Manchester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The plaintiff, as trustee, has taken possession of the real estate last mentioned, collected the rents, paid the expenses of maintenance, and divided the net income between Emily F. Colman and Lottie B. Ring. He is in doubt concerning his duties and liabilities in the premises, and prays for advice and direction upon the following questions: (1) Are the provisions of the will sufficient to create a trust in any property of the testratrix ? (2) If so, in what portion ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-7\"><em>Oyrus R. Little, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-8\">Chase, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_5\">The testatrix, by the second and third clauses of the will, gave to one of her daughters during life \u201c the use \u201d of the Vassalborougk farm, and to the other daughter during life \u201cthe use\u201d of the family homestead. Obviously, \u201cthe use\u201d intended was to be direct, \u2014 of the property itself, without the intervention of a trustee or other agency. Each daughter took a life estate in the real estate of which she was to have the use, and the plaintiff, as trustee, has no duty to perform in respect to such real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">By the fifth clause of the will, the testratrix gave to her daughters and the survivor of them, during life, \u201c the income from all the rest\u201d of her real and personal estate. \u201cThe rest\u201d consists of two lots of land in Manchester having buildings upon them. The income from these lots is the gain or profit which comes in or arises from the use of them, either directly by the owner in person, or indirectly by tenants. The use of the term \u201c income \u201d in the connection in which it appears in this clause would be proper if the intention was that the property should be held in trust by a third - person, and the gain or profit arising from its use was to be paid over to the legatees. But if such were the intention, it would seem as if the idea would be fully expressed and a trustee would be nominated to hold the property. \u201cIncome \u201d is also used when the intention is that the legatee or grantee of it shall have the possession and control of the property from which it arises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>without the intervention of a trustee. In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>73 N. H. 254, the provision in the will considered was, \u201c I do also give to my said wife the income of the remainder of my estate during her natural life \u201d ; and it was held that the provision did not create a trust in respect to the property from which the income would arise, but gave the wife a life estate in the property. One reason for the holding was the absence of any mention in the will of a trust estate or a trustee. See, also, <em>McClure </em>v. Melendy, 44 N. H. 469; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>46 N. H. 230, 234; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Baptist Union, </em>73 N. H. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">This case very closely resembles <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Hill. </em>The will contains nothing, aside from the employment of the word \u201c income \u201d instead of \u201cuse,\u201d having a tendency to prove an intention to create a trust. This change from the term used in the preceding clauses may have arisen from the understanding of the testatrix that the legatees would not be likely to use the property in* person, as they would that mentioned in the preceding clauses. No circumstances are disclosed in the case having a tendency to show why the testatrix should prefer a trust to a life tenancy. A life ten\u00e1ney would as effectively secure to the daughters the income of the property as would a trust. If they could not manage it themselves, they could employ an agent to manage it for them. The remainderman would also be as fully protected in the one way as in the other. On the whole, it does not seem probable the testatrix intended that the property mentioned in the fifth clause of the will should be held in trust; and the plaintiff is so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
