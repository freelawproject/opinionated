H. 145, and the present defendant was the former plaintiff. After the decision in that action, the judgment in favor of Sleeper against John R. Gilcreast was sued and a new judgment was recovered, from which an execution issued and was levied February 20,. 1905, upon all the right in equity of John R. to redeem the undivided half of the tract of land mentioned in the former case that was conveyed by John R. to bis wife (the present plaintiff), April 13, 1897. The defendant was the purchaser of this right at the sheriff\u2019s sale. June 21, 1898, tlio plaintiff, in her own right, and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Ber husband mortgaged the entire tract to John H.

In this action the plaintiff offered to prove that there was a good and valuable consideration for this conveyance. The evidence was excluded, subject'to her exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AjD\">At the time of the levy, the plaintiff and her husband were living upon the tract of land.

H. 145. It is apparent from the facts reported in that case and in this, and from the former opinion of this court, that the bill in that action was dismissed because of Bartlett\u2019s failure to show that he had a valid title to the property upon which the alleged cloud existed. The judgment, therefore, was not an adjudication that the conveyance of April 13, 1897, from John B. Gilcreast to his wife, was a gift to her and was fraudulent and void as against his creditors. Neither of the parties was estopped \"by it from litigating the nature and validity of this conveyance in a subsequent action. The testimony offered by the plaintiff in the present action, tending to prove that the conveyance was not a gift but was induced by a good and valuable consideration, was competent and should have been received, notwithstanding the former judgment. The defendant\u2019s position that the finding in the former action should be allowed to stand, under the authority of <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>49 N. H. 553, and kindred cases, cannot be upheld for the reason that this is a new and independent action. The practice relied upon does not apply under such circumstances. The plaintiff\u2019s exception to the exclusion of her proffered testimony is sustained, as is also her exception to the dismissal of the bill, which is rmderstood to have been ordered on the erroneous theory that the former judgment estopped the plaintiff from making the defence she set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The plaintiff further excepted to the denial of her motion for a decree in her favor, on the ground that the levy by which Bartlett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>asserts title was void because made upon John R. Gilcreast\u2019s right in equity to redeem from the Parmerton mortgage, instead of upon his half of the tract, unincumbered, The tract of land formerly belonged to the plaintiff and her husband (John R. Gilcreast) in common. John R. conveyed his interest in it through a third person to the plaintiff. Subsequently, but before the levy, the plaintiff, in her right, and John R., as her husband, mortgaged the entire tract to Parmerton. It is not found, and there is no suggestion, that Parmerton had any knowledge of the alleged fraudulent character of the plaintiff\u2019s title, or that he was put upon inquiry in regard to it. So far as appears, he was an innocent purchaser for value. There is no presumption of law to the contrary. Being an innocent purchaser, his mortgage was valid, although given to him by one whose title was fraudulent and void as against creditors. <em>Comey </em>v. Pickering, 63 N. H. 126 ; <em>Ashland Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>63 N. H. 435; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>70 N. H. 594. If John R.\u2019s conveyance to his wife was fraudulent and void .as to creditors, the only interest in the property which the creditors could reach, after the mortgage, was the right in equity to redeem an undivided half of the tract from the mortgage. Upon the theory that his conveyance was void, he and the plaintiff at the time of the levy were owners in common of the entire tract, subject to the mortgage; or, in other words, he had a right in equity to redeem one undivided half of the tract from the mortgage; and this right inight be levied upon by his creditors. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Fabyan, </em>34 N. H. 218, 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The plaintiff further says the levy was void because no homestead was set out to her. Although made in disregard of the homestead right, the levy would not be void. If she did not waive the right by neglecting to demand it, it contiiraes and may be asserted now, if she has continued to occupy the tract as a homestead. <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>54 N. H. 475; <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>68 N. H. 406. The plaintiff\u2019s last mentioned exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained in part and overruled in part: decree dismissing the bill set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b61-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
