The condition of the mortgage is that it shall be void if Shnte pays the taxes on the property and the sum of $15 per month to Morrison during life, and keeps the buildings in repair and insured for Morrison\u2019s benefit. Shute having failed to make the required payments, Morrison took peaceable possession for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage, but died before the foreclosure was complete. Shute demanded of the administrator an account of the amount due on the mortgage, and brought this action upon a refusal to furnish it. The question of Shute\u2019s right to redeem was transferred by Wallace, C. J., from the April term, 1907, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b632-8\"><em>Fdwin B.
