Trial by the court.

By her will she gave to Fred A. Sweatt and Mary E. Fairbanks a certain sum of money, \u201c in trust for the support and maintenance of said Fred\u2019s mother, Emily Sweatt, the principal as well as the interest to be used; if necessary, for her comfortable support; but if, at the time of her \u2022decease, there is an unexpended balance of this legacy in the hands or possession of said trustees, the same is then to be paid or to go to said Fred\u2019s daughter, Marian E. Sweatt, and her heirs.\u201d Emily Sweatt died December 8, 1902. Her estate was in fact insolvent. The debts proven against it to the amount of $526.76 were contracted for her necessary support and maintenance after the death of Maria Buck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-13\">Upon the request of the trustees named in the will, the defendant in J une and November sent them small sums of money; and in July a daughter of Mrs. Sweatt wrote one of the trustees for some money with which to pay outstanding bills. This request was forwarded to the defendant. The trust fund amounted to about $1,800, and the defendant has accounted for the same to the parties named in the will to receive it after the death of Emily. The trustees furnished no official bond. Upon these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>facts the court ruled that the bill be dismissed, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-5\"><em>Guy C.

It appears that they received from the defendant several sums of money before the death of Emily Sweatt, presumably for her benefit under the trust. There is no intimation that they in fact declined the trusteeship created in the will. And as the ruling of the court dismissing the bill is consonant with a finding upon this evidence that they assumed the duties of trustees and were acting as such, it cannot be inferred as a matter of law or of fact that the defendant occupied that fiduciary relation to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>Under these circumstances, it is apparent that Emily Sweatt during her lifetime could not have called upon the defendant to execute the trust, or compelled him to account to her as her trustee. If he did not pay over to the trustees the fund bequeathed in trust, they \u2014 not she \u2014 could compel him to account upon a proper proceeding. As her administrator has no greater rights in this respect than she had, the plaintiff\u2019s bill was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u2019The fact that the testamentary trustees did not furnish an official bond to the judge of probate is not important. Their omission to do so immediately upon the decease of the testatrix did not impose upon the executor the duties of administering the trust. Nor did it operate as a declination of the trust by the parties named in the will as trustees, so as to give plausibility to the argument that the executor thereupon became a trustee in their stead ; for to have that effect, it should appear that they neglected or refused \u201cto give bond when required.\u201d P. S., <em>c. </em>198, <em>s. 4. </em>There is no finding that they were required or requested to furnish a bond. In fact, there was no occason for a bond until the fund, or a part of it, was turned over to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Whether the defendant is accountable to the trustees, and if so, for how much, and whether the trustees have fully performed the duties imposed upon them by the terms of the will, are manifestly questions which it is not advisable to consider at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\n<em>Exception overruled,.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
