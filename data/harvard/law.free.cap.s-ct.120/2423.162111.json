The rights were not absolute, but were conditioned on the companies\u2019 obtaining a set of further governmental permissions. The companies claim that the Government repudiated the contracts when it denied them certain elements of the permission-seeking opportunities that the contracts had promised. We agree that the Government broke its promise; it repudiated the contracts; and it must give the companies their money back.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b851-21\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b851-22\">A description at the outset of the few basic contract law principles applicable to this case will help the reader understand the significance of the complex factual circumstances that follow. \u201cWhen the United States enters into contract relations, its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.\u201d <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 895, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Restatement of Contracts reflects many of the principles of contract law that are applicable to this case. As set forth in the Restatement of Contracts, the relevant principles specify that, when one party to a contract repudiates that contract, the other party \u201cis entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on\u201d the repudiating party \u201cby way of part performance or reliance.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 373 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement). The Restatement explains that \u201crepudiation\u201d is a \u201cstatement by the obligor to the obligee indicating that the obligor will commit a breach that would of itself give the obligee a claim for damages for total breach.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 250. And \u201ctotal breach\u201d is a breach that \u201cso substantially impairs the value of the contract to the injured party at the time of the breach that it is just in the circumstances to allow him to recover damages based on all his remaining rights to performance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-23\">As applied to this case, these principles amount to the following: If the Government said it would break, or did break, an important contractual promise, thereby \u201csubstantially impairing] the value of the contracts]\u201d to the companies, <em>ibid., </em>then (unless the companies waived their rights to restitution) the Government must give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2430\">*2430</page-number>the companies their money back. And it must do so whether the contracts would, or would not, ultimately have proved financially beneficial to the companies. The Restatement illustrates this point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-4\">\u201cA contracts to sell a tract of land to B for $100,000. After B has made a part payment of $20,000, A wrongfully refuses to transfer title. B can recover the $20,000 in restitution. The result is the same even if the market price of the land is only $70,000, so that performance would have been disadvantageous to B.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 373, Comment <em>a, </em>Illustration 1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">In 1981, in return for up-front \u201cbonus\u201d payments to the United States of about $158 million (plus annual rental payments), the companies received 10-year renewable lease contracts with the United States. In these contracts, the United States promised the companies, among other things, that they could explore for oil off the North Carolina coast and develop any oil that they found (subject to further royalty payments) provided that the companies received exploration and development permissions in accordance with various statutes and regulations to which the lease contracts were made \u201csubject.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, pp. 174a-185a.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The statutes and regulations, the terms of which in effect were incorporated into the contracts, made clear that obtaining the necessary permissions might not be an easy matter. In particular, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), 67 Stat. 462, as amended, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 <em>et seq. </em>(1994 ed. and Supp. III), and the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 <em>et seq., </em>specify that leaseholding companies wishing to explore and drill must successfully complete the following four procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">First, a company must prepare and obtain Department of the Interior approval for a Plan of Exploration. 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c). Interior must approve a submitted Exploration Plan unless it finds, after \u201cconsidering] available relevant environmental information,\u201d \u00a7 1346(d), that the proposed exploration</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZJ\">\u201cwould probably cause serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral ..., to the national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment.\u201d \u00a7 1334(a)(2)(A)\u00ae.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Where approval is warranted, Interior must act quickly \u2014 within \u201cthirty days\u201d of the company\u2019s submission of a proposed Plan. \u00a7 1340(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Second, the company must obtain an exploratory well drilling permit. To do so, it must certify (under CZMA) that its Exploration Plan is consistent with the coastal zone management program of each affected State. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1456(c)(3). If a State objects, the certification fails, unless the Secretary of Commerce overrides the State\u2019s objection. If Commerce rules against the State, then Interior may grant the permit. \u00a7 1456(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Third, where waste discharge into ocean waters is at issue, the company must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit from the Environmental Protection Agency. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a), 1342(a). It can obtain this permit only if affected States agree that its Exploration Plan is consistent with the state coastal zone management programs or (as just explained) the Secretary of Commerce overrides the state objections. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1456.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">Fourth, if exploration is successful, the company must prepare, and obtain Interi- or approval for, a Development and Production Plan \u2014 a Plan that describes the proposed drilling and related environmental safeguards. 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1351. Again, Interior\u2019s approval is conditioned upon certification that the Plan is consistent with state coastal zone management plans \u2014 a certification to which States can object, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2431\">*2431</page-number>subject to Commerce Department override. \u00a7 1351(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The events at issue here concern the first two steps of the process just described \u2014 Interior\u2019s consideration of a submitted Exploration Plan and the companies\u2019 submission of the CZMA \u201cconsistency certification\u201d necessary to obtain an exploratory well drilling permit. The relevant circumstances are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">1. In 1981, the companies and the Government entered into the lease contracts. The companies paid the Government $158 million in up-front cash \u201cbonus\u201d payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">2. In 1989, the companies, Interior, and North Carolina entered into a memorandum of understanding. In that memorandum, the companies promised that they would submit an initial draft Exploration Plan to North Carolina before they submitted their final Exploration Plan to Interior. Interior promised that it would prepare an environmental report on the initial draft. It also agreed to suspend the companies\u2019 annual lease payments (about $250,000 per year) while the companies prepared the initial draft and while any state objections to the companies\u2019 CZMA consistency certifications were being worked out, with the life of each lease being extended accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">3. In September 1989, the companies submitted their initial draft Exploration Plan to North Carolina. Ten months later, Interior issued the promised (\u201cinformal\u201d pre-submission) environmental report, after a review which all parties concede was \u201cextensive and intensive.\u201d App. 179 (deposition of David Courtland O\u2019Neal, former Assistant Secretary of the Interior) (agreeing that the review was \u201cthe most extensive and intensive\u201d ever \u201cafforded an exploration well in the outer continental shelf (OCS) program\u201d). Interior concluded that the proposed exploration would not \u201csignificantly affecft]\u201d the marine environment or \u201cthe quality of the human environment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 138-140 (U.S. Dept. of Interior Minerals Management Service, Environmental Assessment of Exploration Plan for Manteo Area Block 467 (Sept.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">4. On August 20, 1990, the companies submitted both their final Exploration Plan and their CZMA \u201cconsistency certification\u201d to Interior.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">5. Just two days earlier, on August 18, 1990, a new law, the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA), \u00a7 6003, 104 Stat. 555, had come into effect. That law prohibited the Secretary of the Interior from approving any Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plan or to award any drilling permit until (a) a new OBPA-created Environmental Sciences Review Panel had reported to the Secretary, (b) the Secretary had certified to Congress that he had sufficient information to make these OCS-LA-required approval decisions, and (c) Congress had been in session an additional 45 days, but (d) in no event could he issue an approval or permit for the next 13 months (until October 1991). \u00a7 6003(c)(3). OBPA also required the Secretary, in his certification, to explain and justify in detail any differences between his own certified conclusions and the new Panel\u2019s recommendations. \u00a7 6003(c)(3)(A)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">6. About five weeks later, and in light of the new statute, Interior wrote a letter to the Governor of North Carolina with a copy to petitioner Mobil. It said that the final submitted Exploration Plan \u201cis deemed to be approvable in all respects.\u201d It added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-14\">\u201c[W]e are required to approve an Exploration Plan unless it is inconsistent with applicable law or because it would result in serious harm to the environment. Because we have found that Mobil\u2019s Plan fully complies with the law and will have only negligible effect on the environment, we are not authorized to disapprove the Plan or require its modification.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, at 194a (letter from Regional Director Bruce Weetman to the Honorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2432\">*2432</page-number>James G. Martin, Governor of North Carolina, dated Sept. 28,1996).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">But, it noted, the new law, the \u201cOuter Banks Protection Act (OBPA) of 1990 ... prohibits the approval of any Exploration Plan at this time.\u201d It concluded, \u201cbecause we are currently prohibited from approving it, the Plan will remain on file until the requirements of the OBPA are met.\u201d In the meantime a \u201csuspension has been granted to all leases offshore the State of North Carolina.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also App. 129-131 (letter from Lawrence H. Ake, Minerals Management Service, to William C. Whittemore, Mobil Exploration &amp; Producing U.S. Inc., dated Sept. 21, 1990 (notice of suspension of leases, citing 30 CFR \u00a7 250.10(b)(7) (1990) as the basis for the suspensions)).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">About 18 months later, the Secretary of the Interior, after receiving the new Panel\u2019s report, certified to Congress that he had enough information to consider the companies\u2019 Exploration Plan. He added, however, that he would not consider the Plan until he received certain further studies that the new Panel had recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">7. In November 1990, North Carolina objected to the companies\u2019 CZMA consistency certification on the ground that Mobil had not provided sufficient information about possible environmental impact. A month later, the companies asked the Secretary of Commerce to override North Carolina\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">8. In 1994, the Secretary of Commerce rejected the companies\u2019 override request, relying in large part on the fact that the new Panel had found a lack of adequate information in respect to certain environmental issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">9. In 1996, Congress repealed OBPA. \u00a7 109,110 Stat. 1321-177.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">In October 1992, after all but the two last-mentioned events had taken place, petitioners joined a breach-of-contract lawsuit brought in the Court of Federal Claims. On motions for summary judgment, the court found that the United States had broken its contractual promise to follow OCSLA\u2019s provisions, in particular the provision requiring Interior to approve an Exploration Plan that satisfied OCS-LA\u2019s requirements within 30 days of its submission to Interior. The United States thereby repudiated the contracts. And that repudiation entitled the companies to restitution of the up-front cash \u201cbonus\u201d payments it had made. <em>Conoco Inc. v. United States, </em>35 Fed.Cl. 309 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed, one judge dissenting. The panel held that the Government\u2019s refusal to consider the companies\u2019 final Exploration Plan was not the \u201coperative cause\u201d of any failure to carry out the contracts\u2019 terms because the State\u2019s objection to the companies\u2019 CZMA \u201cconsistency statement\u201d would have prevented the companies from exploring regardless. 177 F.3d 1331 (C.A.Fed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">We granted certiorari to review the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">The record makes clear (1) that OCSLA required Interior to approve \u201cwithin thirty days\u201d a submitted Exploration Plan that satisfies OCSLA\u2019s requirements, (2) that Interior told Mobil the companies\u2019 submitted Plan met those requirements, (3) that Interior told Mobil it would not approve the companies\u2019 submitted Plan for at least 13 months, and likely longer, and (4) that Interior did not approve (or disapprove) the Plan, ever. The Government does not deny that the contracts, made \u201cpursuant to\u201d and \u201csubject to\u201d OCSLA, incorporated OCSLA provisions as promises. The Government further concedes, as it must, that relevant contract law entitles a contracting party to restitution if the other party \u201csubstantially\u201d breached a contract or communicated its intent to do so. See Restatement \u00a7 373(1); 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2433\">*2433</page-number>tracts \u00a7 1312, p. 109 (3d ed.1968) (hereinafter Williston); 5 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1104, p. 560 (1964); see also <em>Ankeny v. Clark, </em>148 U.S. 345, 353, 13 S.Ct. 617, 37 L.Ed. 475 (1893). Yet the Government denies that it must refund the companies\u2019 money.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">This is because, in the Government\u2019s view, it did not breach the contracts or communicate its intent to do so; any breach was not \u201csubstantial\u201d; and the companies waived their rights to restitution regardless. We shall consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The Government\u2019s \u201cno breach\u201d arguments depend upon the contract provisions that \u201csubject\u201d the contracts to various statutes and regulations. Those provisions state that the contracts are \u201csubject to\u201d (1) OCSLA, (2) \u201cSections 302 and 303 of the Department of Energy Organization Act,\u201d (3) \u201call regulations issued pursuant to such statutes and in existence upon the effective date of\u2019 the contracts, (4) \u201call regulations issued pursuant to such statutes in the future which provide for the prevention of waste and the conservation\u201d of Outer Continental Shelf resources, and (5) \u201call other applicable statutes and regulations.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, at 175a. The Government says that these provisions incorporate into the contracts, not only the OCSLA provisions we have mentioned, but also certain other statutory provisions and regulations that, in the Government\u2019s view, granted Interior the legal authority to refuse to approve the submitted Exploration Plan, while suspending the leases instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">First, the Government refers to 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a)(1)(A), an OCSLA provision that authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations providing for \u201cthe suspension ... of any operation or activity <em>... at the request of a lessee, </em>in the national interest, to facilitate proper development of a lease.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This provision, as the emphasized terms show, requires \u201cthe request of a lessee,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the companies. The Government does not explain how this requirement was satisfied here. Hence, the Government cannot rely upon the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Second, the Government refers to 30 CFR \u00a7 250.110(b)(4) (1999), formerly codified at 30 CFR \u00a7 250.10(b)(4) (1997), a regulation stating that \u201c[t]he Regional Supervisor may ... direct ... a suspension of any operation or activity ... [when the] suspension is necessary for the implementation of the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act or to conduct an environmental analysis.\u201d The Government says that this regulation permitted the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the companies\u2019 leases because that suspension was \u201cnecessary ... to conduct an environmental analysis,\u201d namely, the analysis demanded by the new statute, OBPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">The \u201cenvironmental analysis\u201d referred to, however, is an analysis the need for which was created by OBPA, a later enacted statute. The lease contracts say that they are subject to then-existing regulations and to certain future regulations, those issued pursuant to OCSLA and \u00a7\u00a7 302 and 303 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. This explicit reference to future regulations makes it clear that the catchall provision that references \u201call other applicable ... regulations,\u201d supra, at 2433, must include only statutes and regulations already existing at the time of the contract, see 35 Fed.CL, at 322-323, a conclusion not questioned here by the Government. Hence, these provisions mean that the contracts are not subject to future regulations promulgated under other statutes, such as new statutes like OBPA. Without some such contractual provision limiting the Government\u2019s power to impose new and different requirements, the companies would have spent $158 million to buy next to nothing. In any event, the Court of Claims so interpreted the lease; the Federal Circuit did not disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2434\">*2434</page-number>with that interpretation; nor does the Government here dispute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Instead, the Government points out that the regulation in question \u2014 the regulation authorizing a governmental suspension in order to conduct \u201can environmental analysis\u201d \u2014 was not itself a <em>future </em>regulation. Rather, a similar regulation existed at the time the parties signed the contracts, 30 CFR \u00a7 250.12(a)(iv) (1981), and, in any event, it was promulgated under OCSLA, a statute exempted from the contracts\u2019 temporal restriction. But that fact, while true, is not sufficient to produce the incorporation of future statutory requirements, which is what the Government needs to prevail. If the pre-existing regulation\u2019s words, \u201can environmental analysis,\u201d were to apply to analyses mandated by <em>future </em>statutes, then they would make the companies subject to the same unknown future requirements that the contracts\u2019 specific temporal restrictions were intended to avoid. Consequently, whatever the regulation\u2019s words might mean in other contexts, we believe the contracts before us must be interpreted as excluding the words \u201cenvironmental analysis\u201d <em>insofar as </em>those words would incorporate the requirements of future statutes and future regulations excluded by the contracts\u2019 provisions. Hence, they would not incorporate into the contracts requirements imposed by a new statute such as OBPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Third, the Government refers to OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(a)(1), which, after granting Interior rulemaking authority, says that Interior\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">\u201cregulations ... shall include ... provisions ... for the suspension ... of any operation ... pursuant to any lease ... <em>if there is a threat of serious, </em>irreparable, or immediate <em>harm </em>or damage to life ..., to property, to any mineral deposits ..., or to the marine, coastal, or <em>human </em>environment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The Government points to the OBPA Conference Report, which says that any OBPA-eaused delay is \u201crelated to ... environmental protection\u201d and to the need \u201cfor the collection and analysis of crucial oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic data,\u201d to \u201cprevent a public harm.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-653, p. 163 (1990), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1990, pp. 722, 842; see also Brief for United States 32. At oral argument, the Government noted that the OBPA mentions \u201ctourism\u201d in North Carolina as a \u201cmajor industry ... which is subject to potentially significant disruption by offshore oil or gas development.\u201d \u00a7 6003(b)(3). From this, the Government infers that the pre-existing OCS-LA provision authorized the suspension in light of a \u201cthreat of ... serious harm\u201d to a \u201chuman environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The fatal flaw in this argument, however, arises out of the Interior Department\u2019s own statement \u2014 a statement made when citing OBPA to explain its approval delay. Interior then said that the Exploration Plan \u201cfully complies\u201d with current legal requirements. And the OCSLA statutory provision quoted above was the most pertinent of those current requirements. <em>Supra, </em>at 2430. The Government did not deny the accuracy of Interior\u2019s statement, either in its brief filed here or its brief filed in the Court of Appeals. Insofar as the Government means to suggest that the new statute, OBPA, <em>changed, </em>the relevant OCS-LA standard (or that OBPA language and history somehow constitute findings Interi- or must incorporate by reference), it must mean that OBPA in effect created a <em>new </em>requirement. For the reasons set out <em>supra, </em>at 2433, however, any such new requirement would not be incorporated into the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Finally, we note that Interior itself, when imposing the lengthy approval delay, did not rely upon any of the regulations to which the Government now refers. Rather, it relied upon, and cited, a different regulation, 30 CFR \u00a7 250.110(b)(7) (1999), which gives Interior the power to suspend leases when \u201cnecessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting production or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2435\">*2435</page-number>any other operation or activity.\u201d The Government concedes that no judicial decree was involved in this case and does not rely upon this regulation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We conclude, for these reasons, that the Government violated the contracts. Indeed, as Interior pointed out in its letter to North Carolina, the new statute, OBPA, <em>required </em>Interior to impose the contract-violating delay. See App. 129 (\u201cThe [OBPA] contains provisions that specifically prohibit the Minerals Management Service from approving any Exploration Plan, approving any Application for Permit to Drill, or permitting any drilling offshore the State of North Carolina until at least October 1, 1991\u201d). It therefore made clear to Interior and to the companies that the United States had to violate the contracts\u2019 terms and would continue to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Moreover, OBPA changed pre-existing contract-incorporated requirements in several ways. It delayed approval, not only of an Exploration Plan but also of Development and Production Plans; and it delayed the issuance of drilling permits as well. It created a new type of Interior Department environmental review that had not previously existed, conducted by the newly created Environmental Sciences Review Panel; and, by insisting that the Secretary explain in detail any differences between the Secretary\u2019s findings and those of the Panel, it created a kind of presumption in favor of the new Panel\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The dissent argues that only the statements contained in the letter from Interior to the companies may constitute a repudiation because \u201cthe enactment of legislation is not typically conceived of as a \u2018statement\u2019 of anything to any one party in particular,\u201d and a repudiation requires a \u201cstatement by the obligor to the obligee indicating that the obligor will commit a breach.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 2441, n. 4 (quoting Restatement \u00a7 250). But if legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President is not a \u201cstatement by the obligor,\u201d it is difficult to imagine what would constitute such a statement. In this case, it was the United States who was the \u201cobligor\u201d to the contract. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, at 174a (lease, identifying \u201cthe United States of America\u201d as the \u201cLessor\u201d). Although the dissent points out that legislation is \u201caddressed to the public at large,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 2441, n. 4, that \u201cpublic\u201d includes those to whom the United States had contractual obligations. If the dissent means to invoke a special exception such as the \u201csovereign acts\u201d doctrine, which treats certain laws as if they simply created conditions of impossibility, see <em>Winstar, </em>518 U.S., at 891-899, 116 S.Ct. 2432 (principal opinion of SOUTER, J.), 923-924, 116 S.Ct. 2432 (SCALIA, J., <em>concurring </em>in judgment), it cannot do so here. The Court of Federal Claims rejected the application of that doctrine to this case, see 35 Fed.Cl., at 334-336, and the Government has not contested that determination here. Hence, under these circumstances, the fact that Interior\u2019s repudiation rested upon the enactment of a new statute makes no significant difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">We do not say that the changes made by the statute were unjustified. We say only that they were changes of a kind that the contracts did not foresee. They were changes in those approval procedures and standards that the contracts had incorporated through cross-reference. The Government has not convinced us that Interi- or\u2019s actions were authorized by any other contractually cross-referenced provision. Hence, in communicating to the companies its intent to follow OBPA, the United States was communicating its intent to violate the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">The Government next argues that any violation of the contracts\u2019 terms was not significant; hence there was no \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d breach that could have amounted to a \u201crepudiation.\u201d In particular, it says that OCSLA\u2019s 30-day approval period \u201cdoes not function as the \u2018essence\u2019 of these agreements.\u201d Brief for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2436\">*2436</page-number>United States 37. The Court of Claims concluded, however, that timely and fair consideration of a submitted Exploration Plan was a \u201cnecessary reciprocal obligation,\u201d indeed, that any \u201ccontrary interpretation would render the bargain illusory.\u201d 35 Fed.Cl., at 327. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We recognize that the lease contracts gave the companies more than rights to obtain approvals. They also gave the companies rights to explore for, and to develop, oil. But the need to obtain Government approvals so qualified the likely future enjoyment of the exploration and development rights that the contract, in practice, amounted primarily to an <em>opportunity </em>to try to obtain exploration and development rights in accordance with the procedures and under the standards specified in the cross-referenced statutes and regulations. Under these circumstances, if the companies did not at least buy a promise that the Government would not deviate significantly from those procedures and standards, then what did they buy? Cf. <em>id., </em>at 324 (the companies bought exclusive rights to explore and develop oil <em>\u201cif they met </em>\u201d OCSLA requirements (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The Government\u2019s modification of the contract-incorporated processes was not technical or insubstantial. It did not announce an (OBPA-required) approval delay of a few days or weeks, but of 13 months minimum, and likely much longer. The delay turned out to be at least four years. And lengthy delays matter, particularly where several successive agency approvals are at stake. Whether an applicant approaches Commerce with an Interior Department approval already in hand can make a difference (as can failure to have obtained that earlier approval). Moreover, as we have pointed out, OBPA changed the contract-referenced procedures in several other ways as well. <em>Supra, </em>at 2434-2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The upshot is that, under the contracts, the incorporated procedures and standards amounted to a gateway to the companies\u2019 enjoyment of all other rights. To significantly narrow that gateway violated material conditions in the contracts. The breach was \u201csubstantial!],\u201d depriving the companies of the benefit of their bargain. Restatement \u00a7 243. And the Government\u2019s communication of its intent to commit that breach amounted to a repudiation of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The Government argues that the companies waived their rights to restitution. It does not deny that the United States repudiated the contracts <em>if </em>(as we have found) OBPA\u2019s changes amounted to a substantial breach.. The Government does not claim that the United States retracted its repudiation. Cf. <em>id., </em>\u00a7 256 (retraction will nullify the effects of repudiation if done before the other party either changes position in reliance on the retraction or communicates that it considers the repudiation to be final). It cannot claim that the companies waived their rights simply by urging performance. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 257 (the injured party \u201cdoes not change the effect of a repudiation by urging the repudiator to perform in spite of his repudiation\u201d); see also 11 Williston \u00a7 1334, at 177-178. Nor has the Government convinced us that the companies\u2019 continued actions under the contracts amount to anything more than this urging of performance. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 8.22, p. 544 (2d ed.1998) (citing <em>United Cal. Bank v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>140 Ariz. 238, 282-283, 681 P.2d 390, 433-434 (App. 1983) (urging performance and making \u201cefforts of its own to fulfill the conditions\u201d of the contract come to the same thing)); cf. 11 Williston \u00a7 1337, at 186-187. Consequently the Government\u2019s waiver claim must come down to a claim that the companies <em>received </em>at least partial performance. Indeed, acceptance of performance under a once-repudiated contract can constitute a waiver of the right to restitution that repudiation would other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2437\">*2437</page-number>wise create. Restatement \u00a7 373, Comment a; cf. Restatement of Restitution \u00a7 68, Comment <em>b </em>(1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The United States points to three events that, in its view, amount to continued performance of the contracts. But it does not persuade us. First, the oil companies submitted their Exploration Plan to Interior two days <em>after </em>OBPA became law. <em>Supra, </em>at 2431. The performance question, however, is not just about what the oh companies did or requested, but also about what they actually received from the Government. And, in respect to the Exploration Plan, the companies received nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Second, the companies subsequently asked the Secretary of Commerce to overturn North Carolina\u2019s objection to the companies\u2019 CZMA consistency certification. And, although the Secretary\u2019s eventual response was negative, the companies did at least receive that reply. <em>Supra, </em>at 2431-2432. The Secretary did <em>not </em>base his reply, however, upon application of the contracts\u2019 standards, but instead relied in large part on the findings of the new, OBPA-created, Environmental Sciences Review Panel. See App. 224, 227, n. 35, 232-233, 239, 244 (citing the Panel\u2019s report). Consequently, we cannot say that the companies received from Commerce the kind of consideration for which their contracts called.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Third, the oil companies received suspensions of them leases (suspending annual rents and extending lease terms) pending the OBPA-mandated approval delays. <em>Supra, </em>at 2431. However, a separate contract \u2014 the 1989 memorandum of understanding \u2014 entitled the companies to receive these suspensions. See App. to Brief for United States 2a (letter from Toni D. Hennike, Counsel, Mobil Exploration <em>&amp; </em>Producing U.S. Inc., to Ralph Melancon, Regional Supervisor, U.S. Dept, of Interior Minerals Management Service, dated Feb. 21, 1995 (quoting the memorandum as a basis for the requested suspensions)). And the Government has provided no convincing reason why we should consider the suspensions to amount to significant performance of the lease contracts in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">We conclude that the companies did not receive significant postrepudiation performance. We consequently find that they did not waive their right to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Finally, the Government argues that repudiation could not have hurt the companies. Since the companies could not have met the CZMA consistency requirements, they could not have explored (or ultimately drilled) for oil in any event. Hence, OBPA caused them no damage. As the Government puts it, the companies have already received \u201csuch damages as were actually caused by the [Exploration Plan approval] delay,\u201d namely, none. Brief for United States 43-44; see also 177 F.3d, at 1340. This argument, however, misses the basic legal point. The oil companies do not seek damages for breach of contract. They seek restitution of their initial payments. Because the Government repudiated the lease contracts, the law entitles the companies to that restitution whether the contracts would, or would not, ultimately have produced a financial gain or led them to obtain a definite right to explore. See <em>supra, </em>at 2429-2430. If a lottery operator fails to deliver a purchased ticket, the purchaser can get his money back \u2014 whether or not he eventually would have won the lottery. And if one party to a contract, whether oil company or ordinary citizen, advances the other party money, principles of restitution normally require the latter, upon repudiation, to refund that money. Restatement \u00a7 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Contract law expresses no view about the wisdom of OBPA. We have examined only that statute\u2019s consistency with the promises that the earlier contracts contained. We find that the oil companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2438\">*2438</page-number>gave the United States $158 million in return for a contractual promise to follow the terms of pre-existing statutes and regulations. The new statute prevented the Government from keeping that promise. The breach \u201csubstantially impair[ed] the value of the contracts],\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 243. And therefore the Government must give the companies their money back.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed. We remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b860-6\">Justice STEVENS,</author>\n<p id=\"AL-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Since the 1953 passage of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 <em>et seq., </em>the United States Government has conducted more than a hundred lease sales of the type at stake today, and bidders have paid the United States more than $55 billion for the opportunity to develop the mineral resources made available under those leases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The United States, as lessor, and petitioners, as lessees, clearly had a mutual interest in the successful exploration, development, and production of oil in the Manteo Unit pursuant to the leases executed in 1981. If production were achieved, the United States would benefit both from the substantial royalties it would receive and from the significant addition to the Nation\u2019s energy supply. Self-interest, as well as its duties under the leases, thus led the Government to expend substantial resources over the course of 19 years in the hope of seeing this project realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">From the outset, however, it was apparent that the Outer Banks project might not succeed for a variety of reasons. Among those was the risk that the State of North Carolina would exercise its right to object to the completion of the project. That was a risk that the parties knowingly assumed. They did not, however, assume the risk that Congress would enact additional legislation that would delay the completion of what would obviously be a lengthy project in any event. I therefore agree with the Court that the Government did breach its contract with petitioners in failing to approve, within 30 days of its receipt, the plan of exploration petitioners submitted. As the Court describes, <em>ante, </em>at 2430, the leases incorporate the provisions of the OCSLA into their terms, and the OCSLA, correspondingly, sets down this 30-day requirement in plain language. 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">I do not, however, believe that the appropriate remedy for the Government\u2019s breach is for petitioners to recover their full initial investment. When the entire relationship between the parties is considered, with particular reference to the impact of North Carolina\u2019s foreseeable exercise of its right to object to the project, it is clear that the remedy ordered by the Court is excessive. I would hold that petitioners are entitled at best to damages resulting from the delay caused by the Government\u2019s failure to approve the plan within the requisite time.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">To understand the nature of the breach, and the appropriate remedy for it, it is necessary to supplement the Court\u2019s chronological account. From the time petitioners began discussing their interest in drilling an exploratory well 45 miles off the coast from Cape Hatteras in the fall of 1988, until (and even after) the enactment of the Outer Banks Protection Act (OBPA), \u00a7 6003, on August 18, 1990, their exploration proposal was fraught with problems. It was clear to petitioners as early as October 6, 1988 (and almost certainly before), that the State of North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2439\">*2439</page-number>Carolina, whose approval petitioners knew they had to have under their lease terms in order to obtain the requisite permits from the Department of the Interior (DOI), was not going to go along readily. App. 61-63 (letter from North Carolina Governor James G. Martin to Ralph Ainger, Acting Regional Manager, Minerals Management Service (MMS) (a division of the DOI)). As the Court explains, <em>ante, </em>at 2430, without the State\u2019s approval pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 <em>et seq., </em>incorporated into the OCSLA by multiple references, no DOI licensing, permitting, or lessee exploration of any kind could ensue, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">That is why petitioners pursued multiparty negotiations with the Federal Government and the State to help facilitate the eventual approval of their proposal. As part of these negotiations, petitioners entered into a memorandum of understanding with North Carolina and the Federal Government, and, according to the terms of that agreement, submitted a draft plan of exploration (POE) to DOI and to the State. App. 79-85. The Government also agreed to prepare draft and final environmental impact reports on petitioners\u2019 draft POE and to participate in public meetings and hearings regarding the draft POE and the Government\u2019s findings about its environmental impact. Id, at 81-82. Among other things, this agreement resulted in the Government\u2019s preparation in 1990 of a three-volume, 2,000-page special environmental report on the proposed project, released on June 1 of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Although the State thereafter continued to express its dissatisfaction with the prospect of exploration and development, voicing its displeasure with the Government\u2019s draft environmental findings, <em>id, </em>at 86-95, and rejecting petitioners\u2019 application for a separate required permit, <em>id, </em>at 96-97,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioners nonetheless submitted a final POE to DOI on August 20, 1990, pursuant to the lease contract terms. This final plan, it must be noted, was submitted by petitioners two days <em>after </em>the enactment of the OBPA \u2014 the event petitioners claim amounted to (either) an anticipatory repudiation of the lease contracts, or a total breach, Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-244, p. 19 (\u201c[I]n enacting the OBPA, the Government anticipatorily repudiated its obligations under the leases ... \u201d); Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-253, p. 21 (\u201cThe enactment of the OBPA placed the United States in total breach of the petitioners\u2019 leases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Following petitioners\u2019 submission of the final POE, DOI then had a duty, under the terms of the OCSLA as incorporated into the lease contract, to approve that plan \u201cwithin thirty days of its submission.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c)(1). In other words, DOI had until September 19, 1990, to consider the submitted plan and, provided that the plan was complete and otherwise satisfied the OCSLA criteria, to issue its statement of approval. (Issuing its \u201capproval,\u201d of course, is different from granting petitioners any \u201clicense or permit for any activity described in detail in an exploration plan and affecting any land use or water use\u201d in a State\u2019s coastal zone, \u00a7 1340(c)(2); actual permission to proceed had to wait for the State\u2019s CZMA certification.) Despite this hard deadline, September 19 came and went without DOI\u2019s issuance of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">DOI\u2019s explanation came two days later, on September 21, 1990, in a letter to Mobil Oil from the MMS\u2019s Acting Regional Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2440\">*2440</page-number>pervisor for Field Operations, Lawrence Ake. Without commenting on DOI\u2019s substantive assessment of the POE, the Ake letter stated that the OBPA \u201cspecifically prohibits]\u201d the MMS from approving any POE \u201cuntil at least October 1, 1991.\u201d App. 129. \u201cConsequently,\u201d Mr. Ake explained, the MMS was suspending operation on the Manteo Unit leases \u201cin accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 250.10(b)(7),\u201d <em>ibid., </em>a regulation issued pursuant to the OCSLA and, of course, incorporated thereby into the parties\u2019 lease agreement. One week after that, on September 28, 1990, the MMS\u2019s Regional Director, Bruce Weetman, sent a letter to Governor Martin of North Carolina, elaborating on MMS\u2019s actions upon receipt of the August 20 POE. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 99-253, pp. 193a-195a. According to Weetman, the POE \u201cwas deemed complete on August 30, and transmitted to other Federal Agencies and the State of North Carolina on that date. Timely comments were received from the State of North Carolina and the U.S. Coast Guard. An analysis of the potential environmental effects associated with the Plan was conducted, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared, and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 193a. Based on these steps taken by the MMS, it concluded that the POE was \u201capprovable\u201d but that the MMS was \u201ccurrently prohibited from approving it.\u201d Thus, the letter concluded, the POE would \u201cremain on file\u201d pending the resolution of the OBPA requirements, and the lease suspensions would continue in force in the interim. <em>Id., </em>at 194a.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In my judgment, the Government\u2019s failure to meet the required 30-day deadline on September 19, 1990, despite the fact that the POE was in a form that merited approval, was a breach of its contractual obligation to the contrary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After this, its statement in the September 21 Ake letter that the OBPA prohibited approval until at least October 1991 must also be seen as a signal of its intent to remain in breach of the 30-day deadline requirement for the coming year. The question with which the Court is faced, however, is not whether the United States was in breach, but whether, in light of the Government\u2019s actions, petitioners are entitled to restitution rather than damages, the usual remedy for a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">As the Court explains, <em>ante, </em>at 2429-2430, an injured party may seek restitution as an alternative remedy only \u201con a breach by non-performance that gives rise to a claim for damages for total breach or on a repudiation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 373 (1979). Whether one describes the suspect action as \u201crepudiation\u201d (which itself is defined in terms of total breach, see <em>ante, </em>at 2429-2430) or simply \u201ctotal breach,\u201d the injured party may obtain restitution only if the action \u201cso substantially impairs the value of the contract to the injured party ... that it is just in the circumstances to allow him to recover damages based on all his remaining rights to performance.\u201d Restatement (Second) \u00a7 243. Although the language varies to some small degree, every major statement of contract law includes the same admonition. See, <em>e.g., </em>5 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1104, pp. 558, 562 (1964) (\u201cRestitution is an available remedy only when the breach is of vital importance .... In the case of a breach by non-performance, ... [t]he injured party, however, can not maintain an action for restitution of what he has given the defendant unless the defendant\u2019s nonperformance is so material that it is held to go to the \u2018essence\u2019; it must be such a breach as would discharge the injured par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2441\">*2441</page-number>ty from any further contractual duty on his own part\u201d). In short, there is only repudiation if there is an action that would amount to a total breach, and there is only such a breach if the suspect action destroys the essential object of the contract. It is thus necessary to assess the significance or \u201cmateriality\u201d of the Government\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Beyond this, it is important to underscore as well that restitution is appropriate only when it is \u201cjust in the circumstances.\u201d Restatement (Second) \u00a7 243. This requires us to look not only to the circumstances of the breach itself, but to the equities of the situation as a whole. Finally, even if a defendant\u2019s actions do not satisfy the foregoing requirements, an injured party presumably still has available the standard contract remedy for breach\u2014 the <em>damages </em>petitioners suffered as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Given these requirements, I am not persuaded that the actions by the Government amounted either to a repudiation of the contracts altogether, or to a total breach by way of its neglect of an \u201cessential\u201d contractual provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">I would, at the outset, reject the suggestion that there was a repudiation here, anticipatory or otherwise, for two reasons. First, and most basic, the Government continued to perform under the contractual terms as best it could even after the OBPA\u2019s passage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, the breach-by-delay forecast in the Ake letter was not \u201cof sufficient gravity that, if the breach actually occurred, it would of itself give the obligee a claim for damages for total breach.\u201d Restatement (Second) \u00a7 250, and Comment <em>d; </em>see also 11 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1312 (3d ed.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">While acknowledging the OBPA\u2019s temporary moratorium on plan approvals, the Ake letter to petitioner Mobil states that the Government is imposing a lease <em>suspension </em>\u2014 rather than a cancellation or recision \u2014 and even references an existing, OCSLA regulatory obligation pursuant to which it is attempting to act. The Weetman letter explains in detail the actions the MMS took in carefully considering petitioners\u2019 POE submission; it evaluated the plan for its compliance with the OCS-LA\u2019s provisions, transmitted it to other agencies and the State for their consideration, took the comments of those entities into account, conducted the requisite analyses, and prepared the requisite findings\u2014 all subsequent to the OBPA\u2019s enactment. It cannot be doubted that the Government intended to continue performing the contract to the extent it thought legally permissible post-OBPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Indeed, petitioners\u2019 own conduct is inconsistent with the contention that the Government had, as of August 18, 1990, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2442\">*2442</page-number>indeed as of September 19, 1990, fully repudiated its obligations under the parties\u2019 contracts. As I have mentioned, it was <em>after </em>the enactment of the OBPA that petitioners submitted their final plan to the DOI \u2014 -just as if they understood there still to be an existing set of contractual conditions to be fulfilled and expected to fulfill them. Petitioners, moreover, accepted the Government\u2019s proffered lease suspensions, and indeed, themselves subsequently requested that the suspensions remain in effect \u201cfrom June 8, 1992 forward\u201d under 30 CFR \u00a7 250.10(b)(6) (1990), an OCSLA regulation providing for continued lease suspension at the lessee\u2019s request \u201cto allow for inordinate delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">After the State of North Carolina filed its formal CZMA objections on November 19,1990 (indicating that the State believed a contract still existed), petitioners promptly sought in December 1990 \u2014 again under statutory terms incorporated into the contracts \u2014 to have the Secretary of Commerce override the objections, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c)(1), to make it possible for the exploration permits to issue. In a response explainable solely on the basis that the Government still believed itself to be performing contractually obligatory terms, the Secretary of Commerce undertook to evaluate petitioners\u2019 request that the Secretary override the State\u2019s CZMA objections. This administrative review process has, I do not doubt, required a substantial expenditure of the time and resources of the Departments of Commerce and Interior, along with the 12 other administrative agencies whose comments the Secretary of Commerce solicited in evaluating the request to override and in issuing, on September 2, 1994, a lengthy \u201cDecision and Findings\u201d in which he declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">And petitioners were not finished with the leases yet. After petitioners received this adverse judgment from Commerce, they sought the additional lease suspensions described, see App. to Brief for United States la (letter from Toni Hennike, Counsel, Mobil Oil, to Ralph Melancon, Regional Supervisor, MMS, Feb. 21, 1995), insisting that \u201cthe time period to seek judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decisions had not expired when the MMS terminated the [pre-existing] suspensions,\u201d and that \u201c[s]inee the Secretary\u2019s decision is being challenged, it is not a final decision and will not be until it is upheld by a final nonappealable judgment issued from a court with competent jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 2a. Indeed, petitioners have pending in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia at this very moment their appeal from the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 override request of North Carolina\u2019s CZMA objections. <em>Mobil Oil Exploration &amp; Producing Southeast, Inc. v. Daley, </em>No. 95-93 SSH (filed Mar. 8, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Absent, then, any repudiation, we are left with the possibility that the nature of the Government\u2019s breach was so \u201cessential\u201d or \u201ctotal\u201d in the scope of the parties\u2019 contractual relationship as to justify the remedy of restitution. As above, I would reject the suggestion that the OBPA somehow acted <em>ex proprio vigore </em>to render a total breach of the parties\u2019 contracts. See <em>ante, </em>at 2436 (\u201cOBPA changed the contract-referenced procedures in several other ways as well\u201d); Brief for Petitioner in No. 99-253, p. 21. The OBPA was not passed as an amendment to statutes that the leases by their terms incorporated, nor did the OBPA state that its terms were to be considered incorporated into then existing leases; it was, rather, an action exter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2443\">*2443</page-number>nal to the contract, capable of affecting the parties\u2019 actions but not of itself changing the contract terms. The OBPA did, of course, impose a legal duty upon the Secretary of the Interior to take actions (and to refrain from taking actions) inconsistent with the Government\u2019s existing legal obligations to the lessees. Had the Secretary chosen, despite the OBPA, to issue the required approval, he presumably could have been haled into court and compelled to rescind the approval in compliance with the OBPA requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But that this possibility remained after the passage of the OBPA reinforces the conclusion that it was not until the Secretary actually took action inconsistent with his contractual obligations that the Government came into breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In rejecting the Government\u2019s argument that the breach was insufficiently material, the Court\u2019s reliance on the danger of rendering the parties\u2019 bargain illusory, see <em>ante, </em>at 2435-2486, is simply misplaced. I do not contest that the Government was contractually obliged to give petitioners\u2019 POE prompt consideration and to approve the POE if, after that consideration, it satisfied existing OCSLA demands; nor would I suggest that petitioners did not receive as part of their bargain a promise that the Government would comply with the procedural mechanisms established at the time of contracting. But that is all quite beside the point; the question is not whether this approval requirement was part of the bargain but whether it was so \u201cessential\u201d to the bargain in the scope of this continuing contract as to constitute a total breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Whether the breach was sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d or material to justify restitution depends on what impact, if any, the breach had at the time the breach occurred on the successful completion of the project. See E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 8.16 (3d ed. 1999) (\u201cThe time for determining materiality is the time of the breach and not the time that the contract was made____Most significant is the extent to which the breach will deprive the injured party of the benefit that it justifiably expected\u201d). In this action the answer must be close to none. Sixty days after the Government entered into breach\u2014 from September 19, 1990, to November 19, 1990 \u2014 the State of North Carolina filed its formal objection to CZMA certification with the United States. App. 141-148. As the OCSLA makes clear, \u201cThe Secretary <em>shall not grant any license or permit for any activity described </em>in detail in an exploration plan and affecting any land use or water use in the coastal zone of a State with a coastal zone management program ... unless the State concurs or is conclusively presumed to concur with the consistency certification accompanying such plan ..., or the Secretary of Commerce makes the finding [overriding the State\u2019s objection].\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340(c)(2) (emphasis added); see also \u00a7 1351(d). While this objection remained in effect, the project could not go forward unless the objection was set aside by the Secretary of Commerce. Thus, the Government\u2019s breach effectively delayed matters during the period between September 19, 1990, and November 19, 1990. Thereafter, implementation was contractually precluded by North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">This fact does not, of course, reheve the Government of liability for breach. It does, however, make it inappropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2444\">*2444</page-number>conclude that the Government\u2019s pre-November 19 actions in breach were sufficiently \u201cmaterial\u201d to the successful completion of the parties\u2019 project to justify giving petitioners all of their money back. At the time of the Government\u2019s breach, petitioners had no reasonable expectation under the lease contract terms that the venture would come to fruition in the near future. Petitioners had known since 1988 that the State of North Carolina had substantial concerns about petitioners\u2019 proposed exploration; North Carolina had already officially objected to petitioners\u2019 NPDES submission \u2014 a required step itself dependent on the State\u2019s CZMA approval. App. 106-111. At the same time, the Federal Government\u2019s own substantial investments of time and resources, as well as its extensive good-faith efforts both before and after the OBPA was passed to preserve the arrangement, gave petitioners the reasonable expectation that the Government would continue trying to make the contract work. And indeed, both parties continued to behave consistently with that expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">While apparently recognizing that the substantiality of the Government\u2019s breach is a relevant question, see <em>ante, </em>at 2429-2430, the Court spends almost no time at all concluding that the breach was substantial enough to award petitioners a $156 million refund, <em>ante, </em>at 2435-2436. In a single brief paragraph of explanation, the Court first posits that the Government \u201cdid not announce an ... approval delay of a few days or weeks, but of 13 months minimum and likely much longer.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court here is presumably referring to the Ake letter to Mobil written a few days after the expiration of the 30-day deadline. But the Government\u2019s \u201cstatement\u201d to this effect could matter only in the context of evaluating an intended <em>repudiation; </em>because, as I have explained, that \u201cannouncement\u201d cannot be seen as a repudiation of the contract, I do not see how the statement itself exacerbates the effect of the Government\u2019s breach. What matters in evaluating a breach, of course, is not what the Government said, but what the Government did. And what the Government did was, as I have explained, continue to perform in every other way possible \u2014 evaluating the August 20 POE; suspending the leases, including suspensions in response to petitioners\u2019 express requests (suspensions that continue in effect to this day); and responding over years to petitioners\u2019 appeal from the State\u2019s CZMA objection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The Court also asserts, without support, that \u201c[wjhether an applicant approaches Commerce with an Interior Department approval already in hand can make a diff\u00e9rence (as can failure to have obtained that earlier approval).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the Court thereby implies that the Secretary of Commerce\u2019s handling of petitioners\u2019 CZMA override request was somehow tied to the DOI\u2019s failure to issue the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2445\">*2445</page-number>approval, there is record evidence that petitioners\u2019 CZMA appeals were not \u201csuspended, impeded, or otherwise delayed by the enactment or implementation of the ... OBPA____\u201d App. 187 (declaration of Margo E. Jackson, <em>Conoco Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 92-331-C (Fed.Cl., Apr. 6, 1994) (Commerce Department supervisor in charge of handling Mobil\u2019s appeals)). Whether or not the Secretary\u2019s decision was influenced by OBPA-required findings is, of course, a question of fact that, despite the Court\u2019s assertion, <em>ante, </em>at 2437, none of the lower courts in this action decided. Regardless, there is certainly no <em>contractual </em>basis for the proposition that DOI\u2019s approval is a condition precedent or in any respect material to overcoming a state-filed CZMA objection. That objection, petitioners most certainly knew, was coming whether or not DOI approved the submitted POE.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">In the end, the Court\u2019s central reason for finding the breach \u201cnot technical or insubstantial\u201d is that \u201clengthy delays matter.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 2435-2436. I certainly agree with that statement as a general principle. But in this action, that principle does not justify petitioners\u2019 request for restitution. On its face, petitioners\u2019 contention that time was \u201cof the essence\u201d in this bargain is difficult to accept; petitioners themselves waited seven years into the renewable 10-year lease term before even floating the Outer Banks proposal, and waited another two years after the OBPA was passed before filing this lawsuit. After then accepting a full 10 years of the Government\u2019s above-and-beyond-the-call performance, time is now suddenly of the essence? As with any venture of this magnitude, this undertaking was rife with possibilities for \u201clengthy delays,\u201d indeed \u201cinordinate delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals,\u201d 30 CFR \u00a7 250.10(b)(6) (1990). The OBPA was not, to be sure, a cause for delay that petitioners may have anticipated in signing onto the lease. But the State\u2019s CZMA and NPDES objections, and the subsequent \u201cinordinate delays\u201d for appeals, certainly were. The Secretary\u2019s approval was indeed \u201ca gateway to the companies\u2019 enjoyment of all other rights,\u201d but the critical word here is \u201ca\u201d; approval was only one gateway of many that the petitioners knew they had to get through in order to reap the benefit of the OCSLA leases, and even that gate was not closed completely, but only \u201cnarrow[ed],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 2436. Any long-term venture of this complexity and significance is bound to be a gamble. The fact that North Carolina was holding all the aces should not give petitioners the right now to play with an entirely new deck of cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">The risk that North Carolina would frustrate performance of the leases executed in 1981 was foreseeable from the date the leases were signed. It seems clear to me that the State\u2019s objections, rather than the enactment of OBPA, is the primary explanation for petitioners\u2019 decision to take steps to avoid suffering the consequences of the bargain they made. As a result of the Court\u2019s action today, petitioners will enjoy a windfall reprieve that Congress foolishly provided them in its decision to pass legislation that, while validly responding to a political constituency that opposed the development of the Outer Banks, caused the Government to breach its own contract. Viewed in the context of the entire transaction, petitioners may well be entitled to a modest damages recovery for the <em>two months </em>of delay attributable to the Government\u2019s breach. But restitution is not a default remedy; it is available only when a court deems it, in all of the circumstances, just. A breach that itself caused at most a delay of two months in a protracted enterprise of this magnitude does not justify the $156 million draconian remedy that the Court delivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">. <em>Conoco, Inc. v.

It is incorrect, in my view, to assert that the Government failed to give the proposal \"timely and fair consideration,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 2436, because, as the Weetman letter establishes, the Government did engage in such an evaluation process even after the enactment of the OBPA.

My rejection of the repudiation theory, of course, encompasses a rejection of the notion that the very enactment of the OBPA itself constituted an anticipatory repudiation of the parties\u2019 contract.

Repudiation, as the Court explains, is in the first instance a \" 'statement by the obligor to the obligee indicating that the obligor will commit a breach.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 2429 (quoting Restatement (Second) \u00a7 250).

To the extent this legislation was directed to anyone in particular, it was to the Secretary of the Interior, directing him to take or not take certain actions, not to particular lessees. Finally, while it surely imposed upon the Secretary obligations inconsistent with the Secretary\u2019s existing duties under the leases, the OBPA itself contemplated that the parties to the lease contracts would continue, after a delay, to operate under the OCSLA-based contractual scheme. The Secretary was, within the confines of the newly enacted requirements, to continue to take steps to \u201ccarry out his responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act with respect to authorizing the activities described in subsection (c)(1) [ <em>(i.e., </em>approve exploration, development and production plans for lessees, or grant an application for permit to drill; permit drilling)].\u201d \u00a7 6003(d) 104 Stat. 557.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b864-5\">.

The result of such a proceeding may well have been the issuance of a judicial decree enjoining the Secretary\u2019s actions.

The Court\u2019s cursory efforts to discount this evidence of continued performance fall far short. In light of the Weetman letter's detailed description of the Government\u2019s efforts to evaluate the POE as submitted, the Court\u2019s assertion that \"in respect to the exploration plan, the companies received nothing,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 2437, cannot be correct. The Court itself insists on making an indispensable part of the parties\u2019 contract mutual promises to follow certain procedures, <em>ante, </em>at 2435-2436; if that is the case, we must credit the Government's efforts to follow those procedures as performance of that promise, and that performance was \"received\u201d by petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The Court also suggests that the Government was obligated to extend the lease suspensions to petitioners under the terms of the parties\u2019 separately adopted memorandum of understanding; the Government should therefore, by the Court\u2019s logic, receive no credit under the lease contracts for continuing to perform. <em>Ante, </em>at 2437. Whether or not the Government was separately obligated to extend the suspensions it did (and of course the memorandum agreement only exists because of and as part of the parties' efforts to fulfill the lease contract terms), both the Government in extending the initial suspensions, and petitioners, in requesting additional suspensions, expressly relied upon regulations incorporated into the OCSLA lease contracts, see <em>supra, </em>at 2431-2432. The Court must strelch to avoid crediting the Government's performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
