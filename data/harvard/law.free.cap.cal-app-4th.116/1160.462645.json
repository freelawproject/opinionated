A jury found him guilty of possessing an incendiary device in violation of Penal Code section 453, subdivision (a) (unspecified further section references are to that code), and the court found true a bifurcated allegation of a prison-term prior for driving under the influence (DUI) (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b); Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)). Sentenced to a midterm of two years for the offense plus one for the prior, Morse appeals. We find no error and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">The trial testimony came entirely from the arresting officer, Stuart Tan of the Vacaville Police Department, and Morse. Tan responded at 12:30 p.m. on November 29, 2002, to a radio dispatch for a Dundee Court address in Vacaville and, seeing a man (Morse) drive off as he got there, had a fellow officer, Larsen, stop the car, a 1988 Toyota Cressida. Tan went to the stop site, a short distance away, and did a search of the car. In the trunk, along with a tool belt and various tools, he found what he believed was an incendiary device\u2014a Frappuccino bottle about two-thirds full of a goldish liquid that looked like gasoline. A piece of cloth stuck partly out through the top and the rest went down into the liquid. The device was wrapped in a knotted plastic bag, and the bag was inside a plastic bucket. Turning toward Morse, who was resting against Larson\u2019s car, Tan held up the item and asked, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Morse told him it was \u201cfor fixing his car.\u201d When Tan gave him a puzzled look, Morse explained that he had been working on his car because it wasn\u2019t running right, was becoming frustrated with fixing it, and was going to use the device \u201cto bum up his car.\u201d He said he had made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>device himself and that it contained gasoline. After being placed under arrest for having the device, Morse spoke twice more about it, once there and once at the police station, staying with \u201cthe same story,\u201d that he was frustrated with his car: \u201cHe\u2019d been working on it for some time. Couldn\u2019t get it to run right. So he made this device to bum up his car.\u201d Tan was not sure whether Morse was joking, Morse having smiled a couple times during the conversation, and so \u201casked him several times if he was serious\u201d about what he meant to do with the device. Tan asked at least three times, including once at the station when confirming that this was Morse\u2019s official statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Morse\u2019s testimony, implicitly rejected by the jury, was that he made the device only \u201cto prime the carburetor of a car, to fix it, start it,\u201d that he was not serious about burning anything up with it, and that he said that because it \u201cresembled\u201d an incendiary device and Tan \u201cwas going to think what he wanted to anyways.\u201d Morse claimed \u201chands-on experience\u201d but no formal training in mechanics. Conceding on cross-examination that he didn\u2019t know whether his 1988 Toyota had a carburetor or, instead, had fuel injection, he maintained that the gasoline was to fix <em>another car of </em>his, a van he had been working on earlier that same week. He could not say whether the van was a 90\u2019s, 80\u2019s or 70\u2019s model, but he thought it was a Dodge and had a carburetor (although he could not say what kind). After equivocating on whether he knew gas was highly volatile and could be ignited by a lit cigarette, he admitted being there when a friend, Robert Pulido, dropped a lighter while siphoning gas for Morse\u2019s vehicle and ignited a Hertz tmck.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Tan testified in rebuttal that Morse had never said anything to him about working on a van or using the device for anything beyond burning up his Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">I. <em>Intent to Torch One\u2019s Own \u201cProperty\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Morse claims lack of substantial evidence, not for lack of evidence that he intended to set his car on fire, but because, he urges, one cannot be convicted under section 453 for having an incendiary device with an intent to torch <em>one\u2019s own </em>\u201cproperty.\u201d Conceding that section 453 places no such limitation on the word \u201cproperty,\u201d he argues that we should imply one from the arson statute, section 451, which does.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Morse also likens section 453 to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>\u201cattempt\u201d statute that \u201cseeks to prevent and penalize arson at its inchoate or preparatory stage of possessing the material needed to create the fire\u201d; then, citing federal law construing a violent-felony provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)) to require that a prior attempt conviction involve a risk of violent confrontation <em>(U.S. v. Weekley </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 24 F.3d 1125), he urges that there is no such risk when one intends to torch his own property. He also points out that mere possession of an incendiary device is not enough to violate section 453, that one must also have a willful and malicious intent (see fn. 1, <em>ante). </em>Finally, he argues that to read the attempt-like section 453 \u201cso as to be broader in scope than section 451 would produce a legal anomaly\u201d and \u201cdemean the importance of . . . section 4, which requires that code provisions \u2018be construed according to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect [their] objects and to promote justice.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThus,\u201d he argues, \u201ca particular kind of intention must be proven, i.e.[, an] intention to destroy <em>another\u2019s </em>property.\u201d We are not convinced by his arguments and find uncited California case law on arson to be largely dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The general arson statute does not require, as Morse supposes, an \u201cintention to destroy . . . property,\u201d whether another\u2019s or one\u2019s own; it requires only a general intent. \u201cThe statute does not require an additional specific intent to bum a \u2018structure, forest land, or property,\u2019 but rather requires only an intent to do the act that causes the harm. This interpretation is manifest from the fact that the statute is implicated if a person \u2018causes to be burned . . . any structure, forest land, or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Atkins </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 76, 86 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 738, 18 P.3d 660] <em>(Atkins).) </em>While the code did once require a specific \u201cintent to destroy,\u201d this was dropped with a recodification in 1929 <em>(id. </em>at pp. 86-87), \u201cleaving \u2018wilfully and maliciously\u2019 as the only mental element\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 87). \u201cArson\u2019s malice requirement ensures that the act is \u2018done with a design to do an intentional wrongful act . . . without any legal justification, excuse or claim of right.\u2019 [Citation.] Its willful and malice requirement ensures that the setting of the fire must be a deliberate and intentional act, as distinguished from an accidental or unintentional ignition or act of setting a fire: \u2018 \u201cin short, a fire of incendiary origin.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 88.) Thus, if no intent to destroy property is needed for arson generally, Morse cannot argue that it is anomalous not to imply one as to the <em>property of another </em>under section 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>Limiting arson to burning the property or dwelling of another was a common law tradition initially codified in California <em>(In re Bramble </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 43, 48-49 [187 P.2d 411]), like the requirement of a willful and malicious act <em>(In re Stonewall F. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1054, 1061, fn. 7 [256 Cal.Rptr. 578]), but abandoned by the Legislature after 1929. One could be convicted, for example, of burning a dwelling, \u201c \u2018whether the property of himself or of another\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>George </em>(1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 568, 570-571 [109 P.2d 404] [rejecting equal protection and due process challenges], quoting former \u00a7 447a). For 50 years, from 1929 through 1979, all versions of arson as defined in former sections 447a and 448a used that language\u2014\u201cwhether the property of himself or of another\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, p. 46; Stats. 1959, ch. 1462, \u00a7 1, pp. 3756-3757; Stats. 1966, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 58, \u00a7 1, p. 442; Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7\u00a7 198-199, pp. 5118-5119; Stats. 1977, ch. 690, \u00a72, p. 2220; Stats. 1978, ch. 579, \u00a7\u00a7 19-20, pp. 1984-1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Meanwhile, current section 453\u2019s predecessor, former section 452, subdivision (a), was first enacted in 1966 legislation that, like the current version, contained no property-of-others limitation. It stated: \u201cEvery person who possesses any flammable, explosive or combustible material or substance, or any device in an arrangement or preparation, with intent to willfully and maliciously use such material, substance or device to set fire to or bum <em>any buildings or property mentioned in this chapter, </em>is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1966, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 58, \u00a7 3, pp. 442-443, italics added.) Property mentioned in the arson statutes of the time contained no such limitation, of course, and applied to a defendant burning \u201cthe property of himself or of another . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Today\u2019s limitation of arson to the property of others was added in 1979 legislation that repealed former sections 447a and 448a, recast their provisions as new sections 451 (arson) and 452 (unlawfully causing fire through reckless acts), and renumbered former section 452 as current section 453, the one at issue here. (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 1-17, pp. 337-341.) Each successor arson statute, in language identical aside from exceptions, exempts burning or causing to be burned one\u2019s own personal property (\u00a7\u00a7451, subd. (d) [except with intent to defraud or injury to another\u2019s property], 452, subd. (d) [except with injury to another\u2019s person or property]), as added in the 1979 legislation (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10, pp. 337-339). Notably, the legislation renumbered former section 452 as new section 453 but <em>did not </em>insert such a limitation into it. Further, the legislation replaced the former provision\u2019s reference to \u201cany buildings or property mentioned in this chapter\u201d (Stats. 1966, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 58, \u00a7 3, p. 442), with \u201cany structure, forest land or property\u201d (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7 12, p. 339) and added chapter-wide definitions of the three terms\u2014stmcture, forest land and property <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>p. 338, adding \u00a7 450). Those definitions remain unchanged today and contain no restriction to the property of others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Our task is to give section 453 the meaning expressed, for \u201c[i]f the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history\u201d <em>(People v. Knowles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 175, 182-183 [217 P.2d 1]). Morse\u2019s argument has no support under those precepts. Section 453 imposes no express limitation on \u201cproperty\u201d to the property of others, and the chapter definition, which, as here, controls in the absence of a contrary provision in the section (\u00a7 450), provides no such limitation either (id., subds. (a)-(c)). Plus, we have the added circumstance that the Legislature, in the 1979 legislation, after 50 years of abrogating the limitation, reintroduced it into sections 451 and 452 but <em>did not </em>introduce it into newly renumbered section 453, part of the same reorganized chapter on arson-type offenses. \u201c ' \u201c[W]hen different language is used in the same connection in different parts of a statute it is presumed the [Legislature intended a different meaning and effect.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Moore </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 898, 903 [224 Cal.Rptr. 204], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Ector </em>(1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 619, 625 [42 Cal.Rptr. 388].) Finally, \u201cit should not \u2018be presumed that the Legislature in the enactment of statutes intends to overthrow long-established principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Theodor v. Superior Court </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 77, 92 [104 Cal.Rptr. 226, 501 P.2d 234].) For 50 years, the law had imposed no property-of-others limitation on arson crimes generally, and none had been placed in the predecessor incendiary-device statute, first enacted in 1966, 36 years into that time period. No express inclusion of such a limitation appears in the 1979 statute, and none arises by necessary implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">We reject Morse\u2019s reliance on prior attempt convictions under federal law. The effort is strained to begin with, there being no similarity to the question here, and Morse\u2019s root premise that section 453 offenses are like attempted arsons fails at the outset. Arson attempts are dealt with expressly in section 455, a section Morse does not even mention. It is also clear from the language of section 453 that the Legislature\u2019s concern was not with punishing arson attempts but with deterring the dangerous act of possessing an incendiary device, a danger magnified in this case by having it in the trunk of a car that might be involved in an accident and imperil other persons and property in the vicinity. Nor does the requirement of an intent to willfully and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>maliciously use the device (see fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>render the offense an attempt. The mental state requirement was evidently meant to insulate certain acts of innocent possession and to recognize that one who has an intent to use an incendiary device as an incendiary device is, obviously, more inclined to do so and therefore a greater danger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Section 453 does not require an intent to affect the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">II. -IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Haerle, Acting P.

The argument, however, would come too late. The requirement of malicious action existed throughout the 50 years during which the arson statutes expressly covered a defendant\u2019s burning of property, \u201cwhether the property of himself or of another.\u201d While the section 450 definitions did not exist during that time, a definition of \u201cmaliciously\u201d was provided in section 7, subdivision 4, that was identical except for the current section\u2019s addition of the word \u201cdefraud.\u201d To imply a requirement of malice toward the property of others obviously would have been irreconcilable with the statutes\u2019 express language during that time (see generally <em>People v. Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1071 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 856 P.2d 1134] [literal meaning is not given where doing so results in absurd consequences not intended by Legislature]), and this helps to explain the Supreme Court\u2019s recent observation that arson\u2019s malice requirement only ensures that the act is done with a design to do an intentional wrongful act, without legal justification, excuse or claim of right. <em>(Atkins, supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 88.) That construction is also consistent with the definition\u2019s alternative phrasing, \u201cor an intent to do a wrongful act. . . .\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 7, subd. 4, 450, subd.
