Code, \u00a7 12940), violation of civil rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983), and declaratory relief. Appellant argues that he is entitled to maintain his causes of action even without a direct employment relationship with respondent. We conclude that the State is not subject to liability to appellant, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Appellant alleged in his first amended complaint that he is \u201can African-American male\u201d who has been employed as a firefighter by the City of Berkeley (hereafter the City or Berkeley) since February of 1978. During his years as a firefighter, appellant has been afflicted with a chronic, hereditary \u201cdermatological disorder\u201d called psuedofolliculitis barbae, which occurs \u201cexclusively in African-American males,\u201d and causes facial hairs to \u201ccurl back into the facial skin.\u201d Treatment of psuedofolliculitis barbae requires \u201ccessation of shaving,\u201d among other therapy, to avoid the pain and disfigurement otherwise caused by the condition. Thus, upon the recommendation of the attending physician selected by Berkeley, appellant wore \u201ca short beard during the performance of his employment\u201d duties to alleviate the symptoms of his psuedofolliculitis barbae condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Appellant and other firefighters are often required to wear a respirator . known as a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) while fighting fires. According to the complaint, neither appellant nor any other of his fellow employees in the Berkeley Fire Department experienced any incident \u201cof a SCBA leaking due to a firefighter\u2019s visible facial hair.\u201d And \u201con numerous occasions\u201d when he was fit tested with an SCBA, appellant invariably met or exceeded the performance standards for respirator leak tests. Between 1984 and 1999, Berkeley permitted appellant and other firefighters to wear facial hair \u201cwithout incident or adverse consequence while actively engaged in fire suppression\u201d duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In October of 1999, Berkeley \u201cimplemented a new Respiratory Protection Policy\u201d that prohibited any person \u201cwho had visible facial hair\u201d from taking an SCBA mask fit test. The effect of the policy was to preclude any employee with facial hair from working \u201cin fire suppression.\u201d The new Berkeley Respiratory Protection Policy was allegedly necessitated by \u201cFED-OSHA\u201d and \u201cCAL-OSHA\u201d regulations enacted in 1997 which \u201cspecifically prohibit the use or testing of SCBA respirators by employees with visible facial hair.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The complaint asserts that Berkeley has \u201crequested a variance\u201d from the state regulations on grounds of racial and gender discrimination, but \u201cCAL-OSHA has failed and refused to grant a variance\u201d despite authority to do so. As a result of the CAL-OSHA regulations and the failure to obtain a variance, Berkeley has removed appellant \u201cfrom his position as a firefighter in fire suppression\u201d and terminated him from his employment position.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Appellant has alleged that the CAL-OSHA regulations implemented by Berkeley have a \u201cdiscriminatory racial impact\u201d upon \u201cAfrican-American males throughout the entire State of California,\u201d without any \u201cbusiness necessity for said regulation and said enforcement.\u201d He further asserts that respondent \u201cknowingly promulgated and enforced\u201d the CAL-OSHA regulations which \u201care discriminatory on the basis of race, color, ancestry, medical condition and physical condition,\u201d and have an \u201cadverse impact\u201d upon African-American males who suffer from psuedofolliculitis barbae, in violation of the provisions of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900, et seq.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint adds that the State refused to grant appellant \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d from his \u201cphysical disability\u201d by denying Berkeley\u2019s request for a \u201ctemporary or permanent variance\u201d from the discriminatory CAL-OSHA regulations. Also included in the complaint are causes of action for denial of civil rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 et seq.), and declaratory relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The trial court sustained the State\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend on grounds that the State was neither an employer of appellant nor an aider and abettor in any discriminatory employment practices. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Appellant\u2019s causes of action against the State challenge the enactment and enforcement of CAL-OSHA regulations that preclude the use or testing of SCBA respirators by employees with visible facial hair. He complains that application of the regulations to him and other African-American employees afflicted with the psuedofolliculitis barbae condition violates the FEHA as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>discriminatory employment practice. Appellant acknowledges that the City rather than the State is his \u201cdirect employer.\u201d He argues that based upon his allegations that the State has \u201cthoroughly dictated the City\u2019s employment, policies\u201d through the adoption of mandatory employment regulations and the refusal to grant an exemption to his direct employer, liability for the discriminatory effect of the CAL-OSHA regulations may be imposed upon the State as an indirect or joint employer under section 12940, subdivisions (a) and (d) even without a \u201cdirect employment relationship.\u201d He also maintains that the State \u201cis liable under the FEHA not only as an indirect employer, but also under section 12940, subdivision (i),\u201d as an \u201caider and abettor of the discrimination.\u201d Finally, appellant submits that he has stated a claim for declaratory relief despite the lack of a direct employment relationship with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">I. <em>Respondent\u2019s Claim of Mootness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Respondent contends that appellant\u2019s action has been rendered moot by the \u201cexperimental variance\u201d granted to the City by the State\u2019s Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to Labor Code sections 6451 and 6452, which exempts operation of the challenged CAL-OSHA regulations until at least six months after August of 2003. Respondent argues that with the variance in place appellant is not foreclosed from wearing SCBA respirators or performing his employment duties as a firefighter for the City. Therefore, respondent claims \u201cthis action is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201c \u2018As a general rule, \u201can appeal presenting only abstract or academic questions is subject to dismissal as moot.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(In re Jody R. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1615, 1621 [267 Cal.Rptr. 746].)\u201d <em>(In re Joshua C. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1547 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].) \u201cIt is this court\u2019s duty \u2018 \u201cto decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it. . . .\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chantiles v. Lake Forest II Master Homeowners Assn. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 914, 921 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; see also <em>Hebert v. Los Angeles Raiders, Ltd. </em>(1991) 23 Cal.App.4th 414, 421 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 540].) \u201c \u2018When no effective relief can be granted, an appeal is moot and will be dismissed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(MHC Operating Limited Partnership v. City of San Jose </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 204, 214 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 564].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt necessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court, if it should decide the case in favor of plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief whatever, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chantiles v. Lake Forest II Master Homeowners Assn., supra, </em>at p. 921; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>DeLong </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 482, 486 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 293]; <em>In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1193 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We do not consider the present appeal moot due to the issuance of an experimental variance that has provisionally granted the City an exemption from the regulatory prohibition against employees with facial hair wearing SCBA respirators. Appellant may still obtain effectual relief from this court with a favorable ruling in this action. If we declare the CAL-OSHA regulations invalid as discriminatory, appellant will not need to rely upon additional, speculative variances that may or may not be granted to the City in the future. Furthermore, even if an action is moot, pursuant to established exceptions an appellate court may nevertheless exercise discretion to address the merits of an appeal if there may be a recurrence of the controversy between the parties or the case presents an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur. (See <em>White v. Davis </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 537 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 648, 68 P.3d 74]; <em>Cucamongans United for Reasonable Expansion </em>v. <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 473, 479-A80 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 202]; <em>In re Robert A. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 174, 182 [5 Cal Rptr. 2d 438].) The record before us does not indicate that the variance is other than temporary. Thus the constitutional issues of public interest presented by the case may recur between these parties or others, and we decline to find that appellant has raised only moot points. (See <em>Edelstein v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 164, 171-172 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 727, 56 P.3d 1029]; <em>Thompson v. Department of Corrections </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 117, 122 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 46, 18 P.3d 1198]; <em>In re William M. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 16, 23 [89 Cal.Rptr. 33, 473 P.2d 737]; <em>Guardians of Elk Creek Old Growth v. Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Protection </em>(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1433-1434 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 259].) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">II. <em>The Liability of the State as an Indirect or Joint Employer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We turn to the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrer. \u201c \u2018On appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u201cif any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.] However, it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bagatti </em>v. <em>Department of Rehabilitation </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 344, 352 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 443].) \u201cThe task of the reviewing court, therefore, \u2018is to determine whether the pleaded facts state a cause of action on any available legal theory.\u2019 [Citation.] Where, as here, a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment; if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.\u201d <em>(Richelle L. </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 257, 266 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 601]; see also <em>Kadish v. Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.App.).) The burden is on appellant \u201c \u2018to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion and to show in what manner the pleadings can be amended and how such amendments will change the legal effect of their pleadings. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(McGettigan </em>v. <em>Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1011, 1023-1024 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 516].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We proceed with our examination of the liability of the State to appellant from the fundamental premise articulated in section 815 \u201cthat \u2018[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute: [][] (a) A public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\u2019 The statute amounts to a legislative declaration that governmental immunity from suit is the rule and liability the exception. \u2018 \u201cThus, in the absence of some constitutional requirement, public entities may be hable <em>only </em>if a statute declares them to be liable.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Trinkle </em>v. <em>California State Lottery </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1202 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 496].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The crucial inquiry in the present case is whether the State may be liable to appellant under the statutory provisions of the FEHA for allegedly discriminatory adoption and enforcement of employment regulations that govern use of respirators by employees with facial hair. \u201cFEHA establishes a civil right to be free from job discrimination based on certain classifications including race and sex.\u201d <em>(Phillips v. St. Mary Regional Medical Center </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 218, 227 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 770], fn. omitted.) \u201cUnder the FEHA and its predecessor statutes, freedom from employment discrimination on the grounds of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, and sex is a civil right. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12921.) Discrimination on the specified grounds is against public policy (\u00a7 12920) and an unlawful employment practice (\u00a7 12940).\u201d <em>(Fiol </em>v. <em>Doellstedt </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1323-1324 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 308], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u201c \u2018Because the FEHA is remedial legislation, which declares \u201c[t]he opportunity to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination\u201d to be a civil right (\u00a7 12921), and expresses a legislative policy that it is necessary to protect and safeguard that right (\u00a7 12920), the court must construe the FEHA broadly, not . . . restrictively. Section 12993, subdivision (a) directs: \u201cThe provisions of this part shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof.\u201d If there is ambiguity that is not resolved by the legislative history of the FEHA or other extrinsic sources, we are required to construe the FEHA so as to facilitate the exercise of jurisdiction by the [Fair Employment and Housing Commission].

(\u00a7 12940, subd. (a).)\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Reno v. Baird </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640, 644 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333].) The FEHA predicates potential \u201cliability on the status of the defendant as an \u2018employer.\u2019 (\u00a7 12926.)\u201d <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>Methodist Hospital of So. California, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th 1108, 1116.) The fundamental foundation for liability is the \u201cexistence of an <em>employment </em>relationship between the one who discriminates against another and that other who finds himself the victim of that discrimination.\u201d <em>(Hill v. New York City Bd. of Educ. </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1992) 808 F.Supp. 141, 146.) FEHA requires \u201csome connection with an employment relationship,\u201d although the connection \u201cneed not necessarily be direct.\u201d <em>(Lutcher v. Musicians Union Local 47 </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 633 F.2d 880, 883.) \u201cIf there is no proscribed \u2018employment practice,\u2019 the FEHA does not apply.\u201d <em>(Carrisales </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1132, 1135 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 988 P.2d 1083].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Also, for purposes of imposition of liability for unlawful employment practices, \u201c[t]he FEHA provides limited definitions of the terms \u2018employee\u2019 and \u2018employer.\u2019 (\u00a7 12926, subds. (c) &amp; (d).)\u201d <em>(Shephard v. Loyola Marymount </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Univ. </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 837, 842 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 829].) The FEHA defines an employer \u201cas follows: \u2018 \u201cEmployer\u201d includes any person regularly employing five or more persons, or any person acting as an agent of an employer, directly or indirectly, the <em>state </em>or any political civil subdivision of the state, and cities, except as follows: [f] \u201cEmployer\u201d does not include a religious association or corporation not organized for private profit.\u2019 (\u00a7 12926, subd. (d).) The first paragraph of section 12926, subdivision (d) does provide some definition of an employer. But the second paragraph of section 12926, subdivision (d) provides a description of what is not an employer. Beyond these limited definitions, the FEHA does not define an employer, employee, or what constitutes employment. In order to recover under the discrimination in employment provisions of the FEHA, the aggrieved plaintiff must be an employee.\u201d <em>(Shephard v. Loyola Marymount Univ., supra, </em>at p. 842, italics added; original italics omitted; see also <em>Reno v. Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 644-645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Appellant is an employee, but not of the State, either directly or indirectly. Although the statutes provide only a nominal definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d and the cases have defined the term with \u201cmagnificent circularity,\u201d pursuant to the allegations of appellant\u2019s first amended complaint the State does not fall within the scope of the definition under any recognized test or standards. (See <em>Broussard v. L.H. Bossier, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 789 F.2d 1158, 1160; <em>Hill v. New York City Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>808 F.Supp. 141, 146.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The various designated tests adopted by the courts to determine the existence of an employer/employee relationship have articulated many of the same or similar governing standards, and have \u201c \u2018little discernible difference\u2019 \u201d between them. <em>(Lambertsen </em>v. <em>Utah Dept. of Corrections </em>(10th Cir. 1996) 79 F.3d 1024, 1028; see also <em>Folkerson v.

The common and prevailing principle espoused in all of the tests directs us to consider the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d that reflect upon the nature of the work relationship of the parties, with emphasis upon the extent to which the defendant controls the plaintiff\u2019s performance of employment duties. <em>(Lambertsen v.

In all cases, an \u201cemployer must be an individual or entity who extends a certain degree of control over the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Lee v. Mobile County Com\u2019n, supra, </em>at p. 1545.) The focus of our evaluation of the right to control the plaintiff\u2019s work performance is upon \u201cnot only the result but also the means by which the result was accomplished.\u201d <em>(Ali v. L.A. Focus Publication, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th 1477, 1485.) And particularly, the inquiry considers the level of control an organization asserts over an individual\u2019s access to employment opportunities. <em>(Graves v. Lowery, supra, </em>117 F.3d 723, 728; <em>Sibley Memorial Hospital v. Wilson, supra, </em>488 F.2d 1338, 1342.) Further, \u201cthe control an organization asserts must be \u2018significant,\u2019 [citation], and there must be a \u2018sufficient indicia of an interrelationship ... to justify the belief on the part of an aggrieved employee that the [alleged co-employer] is jointly responsible for the acts of the immediate employer.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Choe-Rively v.

(See <em>Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners of Cal. </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 777 F.2d 462, 464.) The absence of any direct or indirect remuneration from the defendant to the plaintiff, while not controlling, is at least strong evidence that an employment relationship did not exist. (See <em>York v. Ass\u2019n of the Bar </em>(2d Cir. 2002) 286 F.3d 122, 125-126; <em>Pietras v. Board of Fire Comrs of Farmingville </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 180 F.3d 468, 473; <em>O\u2019Connor v.

City of Elba, Ala. </em>(M.D.Ala. 1994) 874 F.Supp. 361, 364.) Appellant and his fellow firefighters were not trained by the State for the highly skilled fire suppression work required to be performed by them for the City. Appellant was directly employed for over 20 years solely by the City, with no direct interference or participation by the State in the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The State also had no apparent authority or discretion to discipline, promote, transfer, or terminate appellant. Nothing in the allegations or record indicates that appellant was covered by personnel policies that specifically govern State employees. Thus, the State did not set appellant\u2019s work schedule, determine the specific nature of the daily work he performed, or supervise the execution of his employment duties. Nor has appellant asserted that the State had the means or final authority to control discriminatory practices or policies within the City\u2019s Fire Department. <em>(Lee v. Mobile County Com\u2019n, supra, </em>954 F.Supp. 1540, 1545-1546.) According to the allegations of the complaint, the City made the final decision to implement a new respiratory protection policy that prohibited employees with visible facial hair from wearing respirators or taking \u201ca mask fit test.\u201d The ultimate control over the means and manner of appellant\u2019s employment was exercised separately and exclusively by the City\u2019s Fire Department, not the State. (See <em>Lambertsen v. Utah Dept. of Corrections, supra, </em>79 F.3d 1024, 1028-1029; <em>Laird v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 727, 738-739 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 454].) We find none of the indicia of an employment relationship with the State in the allegations of the first amended complaint. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Mobile County Com\u2019n, supra, </em>at pp. 1545-1546.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The only alleged connection between the State and appellant\u2019s employment position is the State\u2019s enactment of safety regulations that govern his workplace. But the State\u2019s CAL-OSHA regulations affect all employers throughout California uniformly, not just appellant\u2019s direct employer. To find that the State is appellant\u2019s employer within the meaning of FEHA merely by virtue of enactment of regulations that affect the conditions of employment would effectively make the State the potential employer of any person employed by any business that must comply with state law. Nothing in the provisions or rationale of the FEHA suggests such an all-encompassing definition of employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The additional allegations that the State enforced the CAL-OSHA regulations with the threat of citations or fines, and declined to grant the City an exemption, fail to properly assert the essential element of an employment relationship. We do not assess the right to control on the basis of enactment and enforcement of legislation. A finding of the right to control employment requires a much more comprehensive and immediate level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201cday-to-day\u201d authority over employment decisions. (See <em>Laird v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 727, 738.) The \u201cright to control\u201d the employment relationship which is essential to subject the defendant to liability is evaluated by focusing on \u201can examination of defendant\u2019s role with respect to the right to hire, fire, transfer, promote, discipline, set the terms, conditions and privileges of employment, train and pay the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Lee v. Mobile County Com\u2019n, supra, </em>954 F.Supp. 1540, 1545, affd. 103 F.3d 148; see also <em>E.E.O.C. v. Fawn Vendors, Inc., supra, </em>965 F.Supp. 909, 911.) As we read the pleading, the State played no role in appellant\u2019s job training, direction, supervision, compensation, or evaluation. (See <em>Williams v. Caruso, supra, </em>966 F.Supp. 287, 295-296.) The necessity of compliance by an employee\u2019s direct employer with State regulations is not enough to create the requisite employment relationship with the State. (See <em>Deal v. State Farm County Mut. Ins. Co. of Texas, supra, </em>5 F.3d 117, 119; <em>Mares v. Marsh </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 777 F.2d 1066, 1069.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In support of his argument that the State is his indirect employer, appellant relies upon the decisions in two cases: <em>Assoc, of Mexican-American v. State of California (AMA) </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 231 F.3d 572, and <em>Sibley Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Wilson (Sibley), supra, </em>488 F.2d 1338. \u201cThese cases stand for the proposition that an entity may be liable under Title VII even if it is not a direct employer of the plaintiff, if it \u2018interferes with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer.\u2019 [Citations.] In order for such liability to exist, however, the entity must have \u2018actual \u201c[c]ontrol over access to the job market.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2002) 234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In <em>AMA, </em>the plaintiffs were a class of Mexican-American, Asian-American, and African-American teachers who challenged California\u2019s use of a skills test\u2014which was a prerequisite to employment in the state\u2019s public schools\u2014 under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.) (title VII), on the ground that the test had a disparate impact on minorities. <em>(AMA, supra, </em>231 F.3d 572, 577.) The Ninth Circuit found that title VII applied to the State of California, even though it was not the direct employer of the local school district, due to the extreme level of control it exerted over the school district. The State\u2019s exercise of not merely its \u201cpolice power\u201d grounded in the need to protect the public, but also its \u201cproprietary power\u201d to interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 relationship with their prospective direct employers\u2014the school districts\u2014subjected it to liability under title VII <em>(AMA </em>at p. 584; see also <em>Gulino v. Board of Educ., City of New York, supra, 236 </em>F.Supp.2d 314, 331-333.) The court emphasized: \u201cOur conclusion is dictated by the peculiar degree of control that the State of California exercises over local school districts. In California, public schools are \u2018a matter of statewide rather than local or municipal concern; their establishment, regulation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>operation are covered by the [state] constitution and the state Legislature is given comprehensive powers in relation thereto.\u2019 [Citation.] The California legislature \u2018has plenary authority over the education of California\u2019s youth.\u2019 [Citation.] It is \u2018well settled that the California Constitution makes public education uniquely a fundamental concern of the state\u2019 and that \u2018the degree of supervision . . . retained by the State over the common school system is high indeed.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] The state\u2019s involvement is not limited to general legislative oversight but, rather, affects the day-to-day operations of local public schools. \u2018Unlike most states, California school districts have budgets that are controlled and funded by the state government rather than the local districts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at p. 581; see also <em>York </em>v. <em>Ala. State Bd. of Educ. </em>(M.D.Ala. 1983) 581 F.Supp. 779; <em>Allen v. Alabama State Bd. of Educ. </em>(M.D.Ala. 2000) 190 F.R.D. 602; <em>United States v. State of North Carolina </em>(E.D.N.C. 1975) 400 F.Supp. 343; <em>Morgan v. Hennigan </em>(D.Mass. 1974) 379 F.Supp. 410; <em>Georgia Ass\u2019n of Educators, Inc. v. Nix </em>(N.D.Ga. 1976) 407 F.Supp. 1102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In <em>Sibley, </em>the defendant hospital operated a nursing office that processed the requests of patients for the services of a private duty nurse. <em>(Sibley, supra, </em>488 F.2d 1338, 1339.) The nursing office contacted various outside referral sources to send a private nurse to the hospital to work with the patient. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The referred private nurses were employees of the patient, not the hospital. The plaintiff, a male private nurse, sued the hospital under title VII for its refusal to refer him for employment with female patients. Although the patients, not the hospitals, directly employed the nurses, the court imputed title VII liability to the hospitals. The court found that the hospitals had the authority to \u201cforeclose, on invidious grounds, access by any individual to employment opportunities otherwise available to him.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1341.) The court also noted that the hospitals \u201ccontrol the premises upon which those services were to be rendered, including [plaintiff\u2019s] access to the patient for purposes of the initiation of such employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1342.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Neither <em>AMA </em>nor <em>Sibley </em>support appellant\u2019s allegations that the State is liable to him as an indirect employer under the FEHA. \u201cBoth cases made it clear that liability for interfering with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities requires actual control over access to the job market. Both cases also involved almost absolute control on the part of the state and the hospital, respectively, over the plaintiffs\u2019 access to employment.\u201d <em>(Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1109-1110.) Further, all of the \u201ccases employing <em>Sibley\u2019s </em>rationale\u2014and indeed <em>Sibley </em>itself\u2014have done so in instances where the indirect employer was the entity performing the discriminatory act. In <em>Sibley, </em>it was the hospital which refused to allow the male nurse to see the patient; in <em>Gomez, </em>it was the hospital that refused to hire the company with Hispanic doctors; and in <em>Association of Mexican-American Educators, </em>it was the state that required applicants to take a test with disparate impacts on minorities.\u201d <em>(Anderson v. Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 336 F.3d 924, 931.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Here, in contrast, appellant has not alleged that the State directly interfered with employment opportunities or access to the job market in the City\u2019s Fire Department. The State adopted and enforced safety regulations, but did not actively engage in the hiring or rejection of prospective employees, as did the hospitals in <em>Sibley </em>and <em>Gomez. </em>Nor did the State exercise the kind of \u201cpeculiar\u201d plenary authority and supervision over the daily operations and funding of the Fire Department as it did over local school districts in <em>AMA. </em>The allegations of appellant\u2019s complaint indicate that the State acted in its more traditional and limited regulatory role by exerting \u201cgeneral legislative oversight\u201d of workplace safety. <em>(AMA, supra, </em>231 F.3d 572, 581.) The Cal-OSHA regulations represent exercise of only the police power of the State, not any proprietary power over the daily operations of the business of appellant\u2019s direct employer. (See <em>Fields v. Hallsville Independent School Dist., supra, </em>906 F.2d 1017; see also, <em>George v. New Jersey Bd. of Veterinary Med. Exam. </em>(3d Cir. 1986) 794 F.2d 113; <em>Haddock v. Board of Dental Examiners of Cal., supra, 777 </em>F.2d 462; <em>Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Examiners </em>(4th Cir. 1979) 598 F.2d 1345; <em>Tyler v. Vickery </em>(5th Cir. 1975) 517 F.2d 1089; <em>United States v. New York State Dept. of Motor Vehicles </em>(E.D.N.Y. 2000) 82 F.Supp.2d 42, 49-52.) And while the State demanded compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulations, as it does with any legislation, implementation was directly undertaken by the City, which ultimately determined the means and manner of discipline and the nature of other enforcement mechanisms within the Fire Department. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>336 F.3d 924, 931.) The decisive control of appellant\u2019s employment was exercised by the City rather than the State. <em>(Lambertsen v. Utah Dept. of Corrections, supra, </em>79 F.3d 1024, 1028-1029.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Finally, we perceive no contravention of the policies of the FEHA if the State is not considered appellant\u2019s employer. Appellant may still effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>challenge the application of the State\u2019s CAL-OSHA regulations to him in his action for discriminatory employment practices and declaratory relief against his direct employer. Thus, the need to extend liability to the State to further the objective of the FEHA to prevent employment discrimination does not exist. <em>(Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1110-1111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Nothing in the first amended complaint alleges that the State exerted the actual control over access to the job market or employment opportunities required to be subject to liability under the FEHA. (See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>336 F.3d 924, 931; <em>Wynn v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc., supra, </em>234 F.Supp.2d 1067, 1109-1110.) We therefore conclude that the State is not an employer of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">III. <em>The Liability of the State as an Aider and Abettor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Appellant also argues that the State may be liable to him, if not as an \u201cemployer,\u201d as an \u201caider and abettor\u201d under section 12940, subdivision (i), which provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for <em>\u201cany person </em>to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden\u201d by the FEHA, or \u201cto attempt to do so.\u201d (Italics added; see also <em>Reno v. Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 655.) Appellant\u2019s position is that the State aided and abetted a discriminatory employment practice by the City which eventually resulted in his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">\u201cThe FEHA does not provide a definition of \u2018aiding and abetting.\u2019 It is appropriate, therefore, to consider the common law definition of aiding and abetting. \u2018Liability may ... be imposed on one who aids and abets the commission of an intentional tort if the person (a) knows the other\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other to so act or (b) gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and the person\u2019s own conduct, separately considered, constitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\u2019 [Citations.] Mere knowledge that a tort is being committed and the failure to prevent it does not constitute aiding and abetting. (Cf. CALJIC No. 3.01.) \u2018As a general rule, one owes no duty to control the conduct of another . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fiol v. Doellstedt, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1325-1326, fn. omitted.) The \u201caid and abet\u201d language of section 12940, subdivision (i) \u201c \u2018makes it unlawful, for example, for third parties such as customers or suppliers to induce or coerce prohibited discrimination or harassment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reno v. Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Liability for aiding and abetting a discriminatory employment practice under the FEHA is also imposed by section 12940, subdivision (i) only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>upon a \u201cperson.\u201d <em>(Matthews v. Superior Court, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th 598, 603-604.) The term \u201cperson\u201d is in turn defined in section 12925, subdivision (d) to include \u201cone or more individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, limited liability companies, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, and receivers or other fiduciaries.\u201d Moreover, the discrimination provisions of the FEHA \u201capply only to employers.\u201d <em>(Reno v. Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 660.) \u201c[IJndividuals who do not themselves qualify as employers may not be sued under the FEHA for alleged discriminatory acts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 663.) \u201cIn <em>Reno v. Baird </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 640 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333], our Supreme Court determined that the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, section 12900 et seq. (FEHA), imposed liability for unlawful discrimination only on the employer, and not on individuals acting for the employer. The court pointed out that FEHA draws a distinction between harassment and discrimination. Section 12940, subdivision (j)(l), prohibits \u2018an employer ... or any other person\u2019 from harassing an employee. Subdivision (a), however, prohibits only \u2018an employer\u2019 from engaging in improper discrimination. <em>(Reno, </em>at pp. 644-645.) The court determined that individual managers were not liable under FEHA in spite of language defining an \u2018employer\u2019 to include \u2018any person acting as an agent of an employer.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(LeVine v. Weis </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 201, 212-213 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 562]; see also <em>Walrath </em>v. <em>Sprinkel </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1241 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 806].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We conclude that liability cannot be imposed upon the State under the aiding and abetting provisions of the FEHA for several reasons. We have already found that the State was not appellant\u2019s employer and thus cannot be liable to him for unlawful discrimination; nor is the State a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in section 12940, subdivision (i). The State, although explicitly designated as a potential \u201cemployer\u201d in section 12926, subdivision (d), is not listed as a \u201cperson\u201d in section 12925, subdivision (d). We think the most reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme is that if the Legislature had intended to include public agencies in the definition of parties who may be liable as \u201cpersons\u201d under section 12925, subdivision (d), it would have expressly done so. (See <em>Lewis C. Nelson &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clovis Unified School Dist. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 64, 73 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 715]; <em>State of California ex rel. Dept. of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 421, 427 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 88].) We find support for our position in <em>Trinkle v. California State Lottery, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th 1198 where the court was required to construe the definition of \u201cpersons\u201d within the provisions of the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) (UCL). Business and Professions Code section 17201 defines \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of the unfair competition law\u2014in a manner similar to section 12925, subdivision (d)\u2014to \u201cmean and include natural persons, corporations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>firms, partnerships, joint stock companies, associations and other organizations of persons.\u201d The court in <em>Trinkle </em>concluded that the State \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 within the meaning of the [UCL].\u201d <em>(Trinkle </em>v. <em>California State Lottery, supra, </em>at p. 1203.) It declared: \u201cWords of a statute must be given their ordinary meaning and receive a commonsense construction. [Citation.] The state is neither a natural person, partnership, corporation, association, nor other \u2018organization]] of persons.\u2019 It is a sovereign entity representing the people. Only through an unreasonable, strained construction can the state be deemed to fall within any of the statute\u2019s definitional categories.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Governmental entities such as the State \u201care not included in this definition of person.\u201d <em>(Janis </em>v. <em>California State Lottery Com. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 824, 831 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 549].)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Further, appellant\u2019s first amended complaint does not contain any allegations that the State aided and abetted the City in effectuating discriminatory employment practices. Under the FEHA, \u201c \u2018Aiding and abetting occurs when one helps another commit a prohibited act. [Citation.] The concept of aiding and abetting involves two separate persons, one helping the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Reno v. Baird, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 655-656, quoting from <em>Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 77 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].) Nothing in appellant\u2019s pleading asserts that the State and the City acted jointly to implement the new respiratory protection policy. The first amended complaint alleges that the State enacted and demanded enforcement of the CAL-OSHA regulations, and as a result the City thereafter implemented a new policy that prohibited employees with visible facial hair from testing or using SCBA respirators. In fact, according to the pleading the City opposed the CAL-OSHA regulations. Appellant\u2019s action alleges a discriminatory practice that was caused by two separate entities acting independently, not assisting one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Appellant\u2019s first amended complaint fails to properly allege that the State is his employer or may be liable to him as an aider and abettor under the FEHA. We also conclude that there is no reasonable possibility the pleading defect can be cured by amendment, and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. (See <em>Kern v. City of Rochester </em>(2d Cir. 1996) 93 F.3d 38, 47.) The sixth cause of action for declaratory relief fails for lack of any actual, justiciable controversy between the parties.

Augustus </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1997) 956 F.Supp. 387, 389.) At least four tests have been widely recognized and given names by the courts: the traditional common law test of \u201cagency;\u201d the \u201cinterference test,\u201d which examines the authority of the defendant to affirmatively interfere with or adversely affect the plaintiff\u2019s access to employment opportunities; the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test; and the \u201chybrid test,\u201d which combines elements of the other tests. (See <em>Lambertsen </em>v. <em>Utah Dept, of Corrections, supra, </em>79 F.3d 1024, 1027-1028; <em>Sibley Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(D.C.Cir. 1973) 488 F.2d 1338, 1342 [160 U.S. App. D.C. 14]; <em>Gulino v.

We will not adhere to one particular test, but rather as other courts have done we will examine the totality of the working relationship of the parties. <em>(Lambertsen v.

Hosp. of San Jose </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 698 F.2d 1019, a case on which the <em>AMA </em>decision relied, the plaintiff, a Hispanic physician, was permitted to assert a title VII claim against the defendant hospital for interfering with his employment opportunities, although the defendant was not his direct employer. Under a proposal submitted to the hospital by plaintiff\u2019s corporate employer, AES, plaintiff was to serve as the director of the hospital emergency room as an employee of AES. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1020.) The defendant rejected the proposal for allegedly discriminatory reasons. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1021.) Again, the complete control exercised by the defendant over the plaintiff\u2019s opportunity to be employed by AES as director of defendant\u2019s emergency room was the basis for the finding that the hospital was an employer for purposes of title VII liability. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1022.) The court also acted to avoid the perverse result that would occur if an employer in the hospital\u2019s position were allowed \u201c \u2018to exploit circumstances peculiarly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer, while it could not do so\u2019 \u201d with its own employees. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1021, fn. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> Appellant\u2019s fifth cause of action for deprivation of his civil rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983) is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
