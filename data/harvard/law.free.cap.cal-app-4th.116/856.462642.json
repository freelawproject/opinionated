The juvenile court denied reunification services and set a permanent planning hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">Alicia seeks writ review. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code \u00a7 366.26, subd. (l); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 39.IB.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She claims the court erred by not placing Christopher with Susan S., his maternal grandmother, and by finding the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (the ICWA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.) did not apply. We issued an order to show cause, HHSA responded, and the parties waived oral argument. We review the petition on the merits and deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">In July 2003 Alicia gave birth to Christopher, her sixth child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She admitted methamphetamine use the week before and the day before delivery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Alicia tested positive for methamphetamine, and Christopher tested positive for ethanol (alcohol).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">On July 22 HHSA filed a petition on Christopher\u2019s behalf, alleging Alicia\u2019s substance abuse rendered her unable to provide regular care for him and put him at substantial risk of harm. (\u00a7 300, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Alicia told a social worker that she had Indian ancestry through her mother, who was registered with a tribe in Butte, Montana. Alicia did not have any other information about the tribe or affiliation. At the detention hearing, the court ordered HHSA to notify the Blackfeet and Cherokee tribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Alicia also told a social worker that she wanted Christopher placed with Susan, who also requested the placement. On August 7 HHSA initiated an evaluation of Susan for possible placement of Christopher with her. Susan was listed twice as a suspect on the state Child Abuse Index, which prompted HHSA to undertake a detailed review of its child protective services records regarding Susan. Susan had eight referrals involving her own children, one of which was substantiated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Susan also had seven referrals involving her care of her grandchildren (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>one of which was substantiated for general neglect. In that incident, Susan\u2019s four-year-old granddaughter was in the bathtub, found a razor and attempted to shave her legs; the granddaughter cut herself and was treated at the hospital. The social worker reported that Susan did not meet the placement requirements because she had a previous substantiated case with child protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">On September .17 Alicia appeared with counsel at the jurisdiction hearing, which Susan also attended. The court found the Indian tribes had been given appropriate notice of the proceedings and that the ICWA did not apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Alicia asked for a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">On October 6 Susan telephoned the social worker and left a voice mail message, stating she was going to end her efforts to have Christopher placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>with her. A transcript of the message read in part: \u201cThis is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do, I really wanted this baby but I think you were right, the best thing for him would be to go with the family that adopted the twins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The contested jurisdictional/dispositional hearing took place on November 25. After the court made a true finding on Christopher\u2019s petition, the court took judicial notice of the findings and orders in the dependency case files of his siblings. Social worker Carmen Gibson testified that Susan was not an appropriate placement because of her child protective services history with her own children and the substantiated referral regarding the shaving incident. Gibson considered Susan\u2019s voice mail message on October 6 in forming her opinion. Gibson did not receive any other communications from Susan about Christopher\u2019s placement after October 6. Gibson already had decided to recommend against placing Christopher with Susan before she received the October 6 message.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In her testimony, Susan acknowledged her October 6 voice mail message, but said she now wanted Christopher to be placed with her. Susan said that sometime after October 6 she left the social worker a message requesting that Christopher be placed with her. Susan testified she left the October 6 voice mail message because an HHSA supervisor had told her that if she continued with her efforts to have Christopher placed with her, HHSA would remove her other three grandchildren from her home. Susan explained she had received a telephone call from a female supervisor about two days before October 6, but she did not know the supervisor\u2019s name.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Susan felt threatened by the supervisor\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Susan also testified about the shaving incident involving her granddaughter, explaining that she had just moved that day and that her granddaughter found a razor on the bathroom windowsill. Susan had not seen the razor on the windowsill. When she discovered that her granddaughter had injured herself, Susan immediately telephoned the social worker and took her granddaughter to the emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Susan spent $900 purchasing items for a nursery for Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In rebuttal, social worker Gibson testified she never threatened Susan about anything in this case and specifically, that she never telephoned Susan, her mother or Alicia threatening to remove the guardianship children. Gibson had no knowledge that her supervisor, Michael Weinrick, or any other HHSA supervisor, had contacted Susan about Christopher\u2019s placement. To have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Christopher placed with Susan would have required the approval of a section chief because of Susan\u2019s substantiated referral. Gibson did not request such a waiver because a request would indicate that she favored placing Christopher with Susan and believed it would be a good placement. Gibson did not believe this would be a good placement for Christopher.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The court declared Christopher a dependent, removed him from parental custody, placed him in licensed out-of-home care, ordered that no reunification services be provided to Alicia pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10), and set a section 366.26 hearing. In choosing not to place Christopher with Susan, the court noted it was disturbing that Susan had not visited Christopher for more than two months, and it was in Christopher\u2019s best interests to remain in his current placement, a \u201csafe place\u201d where he had been for four months. The court also did not believe that Susan had received a threatening telephone call from an HHSA supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">I. <em>Placement of Christopher</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Alicia contends the court erred by not placing Christopher with Susan. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">When a child is removed from his or her parents\u2019 custody under section 361, the juvenile court places the care, custody, control, and conduct of the child under the social worker\u2019s supervision. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (e).) The social worker may place the child in several locations, including the approved home of a relative. (\u00a7 361.2, subd. (e)(1)\u2014(8).) Relatives who request placement of a dependent child are given preferential consideration. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a).) In determining whether to place the child with the requesting relative, the court and social worker consider the factors enumerated in section 361.3, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The linchpin of a section 361.3 analysis is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>whether placement with a relative is in the best interests of the minor. <em>(In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 321 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706].)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We review a juvenile court\u2019s custody placement orders under the abuse of discretion standard of review; the court is given wide discretion and its determination will not be disturbed absent a manifest showing of abuse. <em>(In re Luke L. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 670, 680 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 53]; <em>In re Sarah S. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 274, 286 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 503]; <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1067 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].) \u201cBroad deference must be shown to the trial judge. The reviewing court should interfere only \u2018 \u201cif we find that under all the evidence, viewed most favorably in support of the trial court\u2019s action, no judge could reasonably have made the order that he did.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Robert L., supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 1067.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">As Christopher\u2019s grandmother, Susan was eligible for preferential consideration as a relative placement under section 361.3. However, preferential consideration under section 361.3 \u201cdoes not create an evidentiary presumption in favor of a relative, but merely places the relative at the head of the fine when the court is determining which placement is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>(In re Sarah S., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 286.) In other words, when a child is taken from his parents\u2019 care and requires placement outside the home, section 361.3 assures an interested relative that his or her application for placement will be considered before a stranger\u2019s request. <em>(In re Sarah S., </em>at p. 285; see also \u00a7 361.3, subd. (c), which states: \u201cFor purposes of this section ...[!].. .\u2018[preferential consideration\u2019 means that the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The issue for the juvenile court in this case was whether, considering the suitability of Susan\u2019s home and the best interests of Christopher, placement with Susan was appropriate. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a); <em>In re Stephanie M., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 321.) The record shows that HHSA evaluated Susan in a timely manner and provided the results of its investigation to the court. In reaching its decision, the court properly stated its reasons for denying placement of Christopher with Susan. (\u00a7 366.3, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">From our review of the record, we conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s decision denying placement of Christopher with Susan was well within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>discretion. In evaluating Susan, HHSA discovered she had a history with child protective services, including a substantiated referral of neglect with another grandchild in her care. When determining whether placement with a relative is appropriate, the social worker and the court must consider whether the relative has a history of child abuse or neglect. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(5).) Moreover, the court was concerned with Susan\u2019s failure to visit Christopher for two months. In the meantime, Christopher was doing well in a \u201csafe place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The court also considered Susan\u2019s voice mail message stating she no longer wanted to be considered and her later decision to again seek placement. The court did not believe Susan\u2019s explanation that she had received a threatening call from an HHSA supervisor. Our job is not to reweigh the evidence. The juvenile court, sitting as trier of fact, heard the witnesses testifying and was in a better position than we are to adjudge their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Balancing the benefits of maintaining extended family relationships against the best interests of the child is a critical element in the placement decision. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(1)\u2014(8).) With the evidence discussed above before the court, it is not surprising the juvenile court concluded Susan\u2019s home was not suitable for Christopher. We realize the importance of according relatives a \u201cfair chance\u201d to obtain custody. <em>(Cesar V. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1033 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 243].) At the same time, however, the fundamental duty of the juvenile court is to \u201cassure the best interest of the child . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Stephanie M., supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 321.) We conclude that the court properly rejected placement of Christopher with Susan. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">II. <em>Notices Under the Indian Child Welfare Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Alicia contends the court committed prejudicial error by finding the ICWA did not apply because HHSA had not submitted enough information to show the Indian tribes were properly noticed. We conclude the proper procedures were not followed, but that there was no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">In 1978 Congress enacted the ICWA \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster care or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture.\u201d (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902.)</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">\u201cThe ICWA confers on tribes the right to intervene at any point in state court dependency proceedings. . . . \u2018Of course, the tribe\u2019s right to assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>jurisdiction over the proceeding or to intervene in it is meaningless if the tribe has no notice that the action is pending.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dwayne P. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 247, 253 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 639], citations omitted.) The ICWA sets forth specific notice requirements in title 25 United States Code section 1912(a), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">\u201cIn any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary [of the Interior] in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The BIA acts as the agent for the Secretary of the Interior. <em>(Dwayne P., supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Indian tribe determines whether the child is an Indian child. <em>(In re Desiree F. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 460, 470 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 688].) \u201cA tribe\u2019s determination that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe is conclusive.\u201d (Rule 1439(g)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The notice sent to the BIA and/or Indian tribes must contain enough information to be meaningful. <em>(In re Karla C. </em>(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 166, 175 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 205].) To enable a court to review whether sufficient information was supplied, HHSA must file with the court the ICWA notice, return receipts, and responses received from the BIA and tribes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 175, 178-179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Alicia is correct that HHSA did not file with the juvenile court the notices it sent to the four tribes and the BIA. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>This was error. To resolve whether the tribes and/or the BIA were supplied with all known relevant information, the court must review the actual notices sent by HHSA. <em>(In re Karla C., supra, </em>113 Cal.App.4th at p. 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">However, HHSA, concurrent with the filing of its response to the petition, moved to augment the record on appeal to include, among other things, copies of the state-approved notices it sent to the four tribes and the BIA in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>August 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Rules 12 (a)(1)(A), 12(a)(2), 39.2A (d).) Alicia filed timely opposition to the request to augment, relying principally on <em>In re Zeth S. </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 396, 400 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 683, 73 P.3d 541], which held a reviewing court generally may not \u201creceive and consider postjudgment evidence that was never before the juvenile court, and rely on such evidence outside the record on appeal to reverse\u201d a judgment terminating parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">First, we note that <em>Zeth S. </em>did not bar postjudgment evidence; it indicated an appellate court could consider such evidence in extraordinary circumstances. <em>(In re Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Second, we find Alicia\u2019s reliance on <em>Zeth S. </em>is misplaced. <em>Zeth S. </em>was an appeal of a judgment terminating parental rights, which challenged the juvenile court\u2019s finding that the beneficial relationship exception to adoption (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A)) did not apply. <em>(In re Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 403.) Appellate counsel sought to augment the record on appeal with postjudgment evidence that the parent was currently interacting with the child, and that the relative caretaker had felt pressured by the social services agency to agree to adopt. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 403-404.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court was concerned that the Court of Appeal had taken what was essentially a substantial evidence issue and used new evidence to revisit the \u201cmother-child relationship ... a settled matter which, by statutory directive, could not be reopened for reconsideration by mother . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 411-412.) The statutory scheme for juvenile dependency cases \u201cdoes not authorize a reviewing court to substitute its own judgment as to what is in the child\u2019s best interests for the trial court\u2019s determination in that regard . . . This is particularly true where . . . [the postjudgment] evidence, in likelihood, would have been irrelevant and excludable had it been known and presented to the trial court in the first instance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 410.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Here, Alicia is not appealing the termination of her parental rights; rather this is a rule 39. IB writ proceeding in which she is raising an ICWA notice issue, which can be raised at any time. <em>(Dwayne P. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 260.) Moreover, unlike the postjudgment evidence at issue in <em>In re Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 396, HHSA does not seek to augment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the appellate record with <em>new </em>materials or evidence. The notices at issue were sent to the tribes and the BIA in August 2003, which was <em>before </em>the court ruled that the ICWA did not apply. HHSA\u2019s motion to augment the record contains postjudgment evidence only in the sense that the ICWA notices were filed in the superior court during the pendency of this writ procedure. The ICWA notices themselves were not new. Further, the ICWA notices are relevant and would have been admissible if they had been timely presented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Finally, denying HHSA\u2019s motion to augment would be counterproductive to \u201cthe state\u2019s strong interest in the expeditiousness and finality of juvenile court dependency proceedings.\u201d <em>(In re Zeth S., supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 412.) Accordingly, we grant HHSA\u2019s motion to augment the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The augmented record shows that HHSA timely sent proper notice to the four tribes and the BIA on state-approved forms. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>Alicia has not shown that any relevant known information was excluded on the forms or that the notices were defective. HHSA\u2019s error in not timely filing copies of the notices with the court was therefore harmless. The juvenile court\u2019s finding that the ICWA did not apply was premature, but it was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Benke, Acting P.
