Appellant then became the subject of two subsequent petitions, filed on June 25, 2002, and September 13, 2002, and sustained by the juvenile court. He appeals from the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication and disposition of the June 25, 2002 and September 13, 2002 petitions. With regard to the June 25, 2002 petition, the juvenile court found that appellant had committed the crime of driving without a valid license. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a).) With regard to the September 13, 2002 petition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>the juvenile court found that appellant had committed the crime of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5, subd. (a)), and that appellant\u2019s offense was one covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court elected to aggregate the periods of confinement on appellant\u2019s multiple petitions, including the two previously sustained petitions, and committed appellant to the California Youth Authority for a period of time not to exceed 17 years and 10 months. The court gave appellant predisposition custody credit of 155 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Appellant contends the juvenile court erred in finding appellant\u2019s continuous sexual abuse violation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5 , subd. (a)) to be an offense covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). Appellant further contends the juvenile court did not properly calculate his predisposition custody credit. He claims that he is entitled to 577 days of predisposition credit rather than the 155 days accorded him. Finally, appellant contends that the juvenile court\u2019s disposition minute order concerning the September 13, 2002 petition should be amended to reflect the court\u2019s dismissal of count one (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)) of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We affirm the order continuing the juvenile court\u2019s wardship over appellant and committing appellant to the California Youth Authority. We affirm the juvenile court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s Penal Code section 288.5, subdivision (a) offense was covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). We remand the matter to the juvenile court to recalculate appellant\u2019s predisposition custody credit to include time spent in custody pursuant to all of appellant\u2019s adjudicated petitions, including the previously sustained October 17, 2000 and November 14, 2001 petitions. We also remand the matter to the juvenile court to amend the disposition minute order concerning appellant\u2019s September 13, 2002 petition to reflect the court\u2019s dismissal of count 1 of that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">A petition filed on October 17, 2000, charged appellant with second degree robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), a felony. The juvenile court sustained this petition, declared appellant a ward of the court and committed him to the Camp Community Placement Program for a period not to exceed five years. The court accorded appellant 15 days of predisposition custody credit. A second petition filed on November 14, 2001, charged appellant with second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), a felony. The juvenile court sustained this petition, continued the court\u2019s wardship and committed appellant to the Camp Community Placement Program for a period not to exceed three years. The court accorded appellant predisposition custody credit of 24 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>A third petition filed on June 25, 2002, charged appellant with unlawfully taking a vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)), and driving without a license. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The juvenile court dismissed the unlawful taking of a vehicle count and sustained the petition with regard to the second count, driving without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">On August 5, 2002, a petition was filed charging appellant with committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a).) On September 13, 2002, an amended petition was filed reiterating the count under Penal Code section 288, and adding an additional count of continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">At the adjudication hearing on the September 13, 2002 amended petition, evidence was presented that appellant had sexually assaulted and raped his then seven-year-old niece 15 to 20 times during the time period from 1998 through December 31, 2000. Appellant\u2019 s niece testified that she did not disclose appellant\u2019s assaults to anyone while the assaults were occurring because appellant repeatedly threatened her that he would do it again if she told anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The disposition hearing on the September 13, 2002 petition occurred on November 27, 2003. At that hearing, the juvenile court granted the district attorney\u2019s motion to dismiss the Penal Code section 288 count against appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court sustained the petition with regard to the count under Penal Code section 288.5, subdivision (a) and found that appellant\u2019s crime was an offense enumerated under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). The court committed appellant to the California Youth Authority for a period of time not to exceed 17 years and 10 months. The court then asked defense counsel for the amount of appellant\u2019s predisposition custody credit. The following exchange ensued: [f] \u201cTHE COURT: What predisposition does he have. Q] DEFENSE COUNSEL: Predisposition is 155 days. In total he has 5 hundred 77 days during the time as a ward of the court. [][] THE COURT: That includes the camp commitments, [f] DEFENSE COUNSEL: Correct. H] THE COURT: Let\u2019s give 155. Concurrent time is 155. [f] DEFENSE COUNSEL: That is included in the 570 if that is what you are asking, [f] THE COURT: I\u2019ve already given credit for the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>times. HQ DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay, [f] THE COURT: At different times. HQ DEFENSE COUNSEL: It is 155 on this case. ['][] THE COURT: All right. 155 at this time.\u201d The court then accorded appellant 155 days of predisposition credit. Appellant filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">A. <em>Appellant\u2019s Offense Covered by Welfare and Institutions Code Section 707, Subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">When a juvenile court commits a minor to the California Youth Authority, the court must specify whether the minor\u2019s offense is one covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1494.5, subd. (b); <em>In re Gary B. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 844, 846 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 824] ,)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If a minor has committed an offense covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b), the California Youth Authority maintains jurisdiction over the minor for two years or until the minor reaches the age of 25, whichever occurs later. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1769, subd. (b); <em>In re Gary B., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 846.) If the offense is not covered by Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b), the minor must be discharged after two years or upon turning 21, whichever occurs later. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1769 , subd. (a); <em>In re Gary B., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b) states that subdivision (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shall apply \u201cin any case in which a minor is alleged to be a person described in Section 602 by reason of the violation, when he or she was 16 years of age or older, of one of the following offenses: [][]... HQ (4) Rape with force or violence or threat of great bodily harm. [][]... [|] (6) Lewd or lascivious act as provided in subdivision (b) of Section 288 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(4), (6).)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in designating appellant\u2019s offense under Penal Code section 288.5 to be an offense listed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). He maintains that because continuous sexual abuse of a child under the age of 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5, subd. (a)) is not an offense that is specifically enumerated under Welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b), the juvenile court improperly designated appellant\u2019s offense as a section 707, subdivision (b) offense. Appellant further contends that Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b) designation was improper because he was under the age of 16 during most of the period during which the sexual assaults occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">1. <em>Continuous Sexual Abuse of a Child Covered by Welfare and Institutions Code Section 707, Subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Continuous sexual abuse under Penal Code section 288.5 is committed when a person who has recurring access to a child, over a period of time not less than three months, engages in three or more acts of substantial sexual conduct as defined in Penal Code section 1203.066,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or three or more acts of lewd or lascivious conduct under section 288 with a child under the age of 14. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.5, subd. (a).) Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) proscribes \u201cany lewd or lascivious act, including any of the acts constituting other crimes provided for in Part 1, upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a).) Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b) penalizes the commission of \u201can act described in subdivision (a) by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b)(1).) Thus, Penal Code section 288.5 includes multiple violations of Penal Code section 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The juvenile court was entitled to base its Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 determination on facts presented at the disposition hearing that the court found to be true by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(In re Gary B., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 850.) In doing so, the juvenile court was also entitled to look beyond the pleadings and consider the circumstances of appellant\u2019s offense. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 849-851 [juvenile court entitled to consider minor\u2019s use of firearm in deciding whether offense was covered by \u00a7 707, subd. (b), even though minor\u2019s firearm use was alleged in a previously dismissed count].) We review the juvenile court\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>(People v. Rodriguez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 11-14 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 971 P.2d 618].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Substantial evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 designation. Evidence presented during the adjudication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>the September 13, 2002 petition showed that appellant\u2019s repeated sexual assaults on his niece constituted \u201clewd and lascivious conduct\u201d imposed \u201cby use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury\u201d within the meaning of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (b). The evidence showed that in 1998, appellant covered his niece\u2019s mouth with his hand, pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her; that he continued to assault and rape her 15 to 20 times during the period from 1998 until October 30, 2000; and that he threatened to do it again if his niece told anyone about the assaults. Appellant\u2019s conduct constituted an offense listed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(6).) The fact that appellant committed multiple sexual assaults continuously while he had recurring access to his niece, thereby elevating the severity of his offense from a violation of Penal Code section 288 to one chargeable under Penal Code section 288.5, does not preclude its designation as an offense under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). <em>(In re Gary B., supra, </em>61 Cal.App.4th at p. 851; Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288, 288.5.) A violation of Penal Code section 288.5, subdivision (a) necessarily includes a violation of Penal Code section 288, which is specified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Moreover, the evidence presented also established that appellant\u2019s assaults constituted \u201crape with force or violence or threat of great bodily harm,\u201d an offense that is also enumerated under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(4).) The juvenile court properly designated appellant\u2019s offense as one under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">2. A <em>Single Violation of an Enumerated Offense While the Minor Is 16 Years Old Supports a Designation Under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 707</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Appellant argues that the juvenile court\u2019s designation under section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code was erroneous because appellant was 16 years old for only a portion of the time period during which the sexual abuse occurred. There is no authority to support appellant\u2019s position that his offense cannot be designated as a section 707, subdivision (b) offense simply because a substantial amount of appellant\u2019s abusive conduct occurred before he reached the age of sixteen. The statute does not suggest that more than a single violation of an enumerated offense is required to support a designation under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b). Appellant\u2019s birth date is August 29, 1984. The evidence showed that appellant sexually abused his niece continuously between 1998 and October 30, 2000. At least two months of appellant\u2019s continuous sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>occurred when he was 16 years old. The trial court\u2019s designation of appellant\u2019s offense under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b) was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">B. <em>Predisposition Custody Credit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Appellant contends that the juvenile court erred by miscalculating the credit for his custody prior to the court\u2019s disposition of the June 25, 2002 and September 13, 2002 petitions. He maintains that he is entitled to 577 days of credit rather than the 155 days the juvenile court accorded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Although the juvenile court\u2019s decisions regarding confinement are reviewed for abuse of discretion <em>(In re Michael D. </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1392, 1395 [234 Cal.Rptr. 103]), a minor is entitled to credit against his or her maximum term of confinement for the time spent in custody before the disposition hearing. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2900.5, subd. (a); <em>In re Eric J. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 522, 533-536 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549] <em>(Eric J.).) </em>It is the juvenile court\u2019s duty to calculate the number of days earned, and the court may not delegate that duty. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2900.5, subd. (d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1455, 1469, fn. 9 [251 Cal.Rptr. 904].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">A juvenile\u2019s entitlement to predisposition custody credit is determined by Welfare and Institutions Code section 726. <em>(Eric J., supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 535.) That section provides in part: \u201cIf the court elects to aggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602, the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment\u2019 shall be the aggregate term of imprisonment specified in subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1 of the Penal Code . . . .\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 726, subd. (c).) Penal Code section 1170.1 in turn states: \u201c[W]hen any person is convicted . . . whether in the same proceeding or court or in different proceedings or courts . . . , the aggregate term of imprisonment for all . . . convictions shall be the sum of the principal term, the subordinate term, and any additional term imposed . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The California Supreme Court has concluded that when a juvenile court elects to aggregate a minor\u2019s period of physical confinement on multiple petitions pursuant to these foregoing statutory provisions, the court must also aggregate the predisposition custody credits attributable to those multiple petitions. <em>(Eric J., supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 522.) In <em>Eric </em>J., a minor spent 19 days in juvenile hall pending adjudication of an allegation that he was in contempt of court for violating an earlier order granting probation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 533.) After he was released to his mother\u2019s custody, he was detained for another 27 days pending resolution of a burglary charge. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>court aggregated the periods of confinement for the two offenses but did not give the minor credit for 46 days of predisposition custody. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 536.) The Supreme Court determined that the minor was entitled to credit for both periods of confinement in juvenile hall. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The juvenile court here elected to aggregate the periods of confinement on appellant\u2019s multiple petitions\u2014the June 25, 2002, petition, the September 13, 2002 petition, and the previously sustained October 17, 2000 and November 14, 2001 petitions. It appears, however, that the juvenile court did not accord appellant credit for time spent in custody pursuant to the previously sustained October 17, 2000 and November 14, 2001 petitions. At the November 27, 2003 disposition hearing, the juvenile court stated, \u201cI\u2019ve already given credit for the other times .... At different times,\u201d and indicated that the court was only giving appellant credit \u201cthis time\u201d for 155 days. The record contains no information concerning the amount of time appellant spent in custody pursuant to the previously sustained October 17, 2000 and November 14, 2001 petitions. Appellant contends he is entitled to a total of 577 days of predisposition credit. Respondent concedes that appellant may be entitled to additional predisposition credit but takes no position as to whether or not the credit should be 577 days. Because there is insufficient information in the record to calculate the proper amount of appellant\u2019s predisposition credit, we remand the matter to the juvenile court with instruction to do so, taking into account predisposition credit appellant accrued pursuant to the previously sustained petitions. <em>(In re Antwon R. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 348, 353 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">C. <em>Correction of November 27, 2003 Minute Disposition Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">At the disposition hearing on the September 13, 2002 petition, the juvenile court dismissed the allegations contained in count 1 of the petition, charging appellant with violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a). The juvenile court\u2019s November 27, 2003 disposition minute order does not reflect the court\u2019s dismissal of count 1. Appellant and respondent agree that the minute order should be corrected in a manner consistent with the juvenile court\u2019s ruling. We remand with instruction for the juvenile court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">The order continuing the juvenile court\u2019s wardship over appellant and committing appellant to the California Youth Authority is affirmed. The juvenile court\u2019s designation of appellant\u2019s Penal Code section 288.5, subdivision (a) offense as an offense listed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b) is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the juvenile court with directions to (1) amend its November 27, 2003 disposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>order to reflect the court\u2019s dismissal of count 1 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)) in the September 13, 2002 petition; and (2) calculate the amount of appellant\u2019s predisposition custody credit, including credit to which he is entitled pursuant to the previously sustained October 27, 2000 and November 14, 2001 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Turner, P.
