The trial court determined that the homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Allstate to Jordan did not provide coverage for the loss she had sustained as the result of the alleged \u201ccollapse\u201d of a portion of her Santa Monica home.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">By its terms, the policy expressly provided \u201cadditional coverage\u201d for any loss due to an \u201centire\u201d collapse caused by \u201chidden decay.\u201d The policy also contained an exclusion for any loss caused by \u201cwet or dry rot.\u201d We conclude that, in the factual context of this case, such conflicting policy language created an ambiguity that must, for the reasons discussed, be resolved against Allstate. We therefore will reverse the summary judgment granted by the trial court and remand with directions for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">In August of 2000, Jordan purchased a Deluxe Plus Homeowner\u2019s Policy (No. 037803085) from Allstate that provided coverage for her 70-year-old Santa Monica home. The policy provided \u201call-risk\u201d coverage of up to $194,792 (for the dwelling) and $19,479 (other structures).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">As is common in such policies, it was subject to certain exclusions. Particularly relevant to the issues before us, the policy provided that it did <em>not </em>cover (1) a loss consisting of or caused by \u201c. . . rust or other corrosion, mold, <em>wet or dry </em>rot\u201d (italics added) or (2) a \u201closs to [covered] property consisting of or caused by <em>collapse.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) There was an <em>exception </em>to this \u201ccollapse\u201d exclusion, however, that was set out in a section of the policy headed by the term \u201cadditional coverage.\u201d This section provided that the policy would' nevertheless cover:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-13\">\u201ca) the <em>entire </em>collapse of a covered building structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>\u201cb) the <em>entire </em>collapse of a part of a covered building structure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">\u201cc) direct physical loss to covered property caused by (a) or (b) above.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">This exceptional \u201cadditional coverage\u201d was limited to the collapse of a building structure specified in (a) or (b) that was \u201ca sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by one or more of the following: [f] . . . [][] b) hidden decay of the building structure; [f] [and] . . . f) defective methods or materials used in construction, repair, remodeling or renovation, but only if the collapse occurs in the course of such construction, repair, remodeling or renovation.\u201d The term \u201ccollapse,\u201d however, did <em>not </em>include \u201csettling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On or about December 20, 2000, Jordan was advised that there was evidence of damage to her home that had been caused by a water-conducting fungus known as Meruliporia incrassata (Poria). She received this information in a report prepared by Jose Luis DeLaCruz of DeLaCruz Wood Preservation Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Jordan had contacted DeLaCruz after she discovered, on December 10, 2000, that a window had fallen out of the wall of her living room. She also observed that the floorboards in a comer of the living room were \u201cgiving way.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following receipt of DeLaCruz\u2019s report, Jordan submitted a claim to which Allstate responded with a letter to Jordan, dated December 26, 2000, acknowledging her submission of the claim but reserving all of its rights. Allstate also promptly retained its own experts to conduct an inspection of Jordan\u2019s property. Those experts likewise determined that the damage that had been sustained to Jordan\u2019s home was the result of an infestation of the Poria fungus.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">On or about January 12, 2001, Jordan hired P.W. Stephens, Inc. (P.W. Stephens) to conduct a fungi abatement and remediation on her property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Performance of that work has led to a dispute between Jordan and P.W. Stephens that is not relevant to the issues which we resolve in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">On January 19, 2001, Allstate advised Jordan that it rejected her claim, primarily on the ground that coverage was precluded under the exclusion for any loss consisting of or caused by \u201c. . . rust or other corrosion, mold, wet or dry rot.\u201d Jordan responded that the Poria fungus did not fall within the term \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d and asked that Allstate reconsider its coverage decision. On February 5, 2001, Allstate advised Jordan that \u201cPoria fungus and the resulting damage are considered wet or dry rot\u201d and her loss was therefore excluded under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Thereafter, on August 27, 2001, Jordan filed this action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the conclusion of certain discovery matters, Jordan moved for summary adjudication of her breach of contract claim and Allstate moved for summary judgment on Jordan\u2019s entire complaint. The issue presented to the trial court, under the facts and the relevant language of Allstate\u2019s policy, was whether coverage for the loss claimed by Jordan was excluded. The court denied Jordan\u2019s motion and granted Allstate\u2019s. That ruling was based on two conclusions reached by the trial court: (1) the broad general policy exclusion for losses due to wet or dry rot included the fungal infestation that had caused Jordan\u2019s claimed damages and (2) the coverage for collapse upon which Jordan relied did not extend to the \u201cimminent collapse\u201d of a portion of Jordan\u2019s home that was demonstrated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Jordan has filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">\n<em>CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Jordan asserts essentially two principal arguments. First, she claims that she is entitled to coverage under the \u201ccollapse\u201d provisions of Allstate\u2019s policy irrespective of the cause of such collapse. Put another way, she contends that even if the Poria fungus that invaded her home falls within the exclusion for \u201cwet or dry rot,\u201d she is still entitled to coverage under the separate \u201ccollapse\u201d provision. Second, Jordan argues that Poria fungus does <em>not </em>fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>policy\u2019s exclusion for wet or dry rot. In support of that argument, Jordan relies upon the declaration testimony of her expert (DeLaCruz), claiming that declaration would have raised a triable issue of fact but for the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling sustaining Allstate\u2019s objection to that declaration on the ground of a lack of foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Allstate disputes each of these arguments and contends that well-settled principles of policy construction establish that the \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d exclusion is dispositive of Jordan\u2019s claim without regard to the separate coverage ground based on collapse. Allstate further argues that the trial court properly excluded the testimony of Jordan\u2019s expert and, in any event, the plain meaning, to a layperson, of the exclusionary term \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d necessarily embraces the fungus that caused the damage to Jordan\u2019s home. Next, even if Jordan\u2019s collapse claim were considered, recent Supreme Court authority establishes that Jordan\u2019s evidence of damage demonstrated nothing more than a condition of \u201cimminent collapse\u201d and thus was not sufficient to provide a basis for coverage, given the language of Allstate\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Summary judgment is granted when no triable issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Villa v. McFerren </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 719].)  After examining documents supporting a summary judgment motion in the trial court, this court independently determines their effect as a matter of law. <em>(Hulett </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1057-1058 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 902].) Where the facts are undisputed, the court can resolve the question of law in accordance with general summary judgment principles. <em>(Adams v. Paul </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 592 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 904 P.2d 1205].) \u201cAbsent <em>a factual </em>dispute as to the meaning of policy language, [] the interpretation, construction and application of an insurance contract is strictly an issue of law.\u201d <em>(Century Transit Systems, Inc. v. American Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 121, 125 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 567].) As we explain below, the disposition of this case turns upon our conclusion that an ambiguity was created by conflicting policy language contained in an exclusion on the one hand, and a provision for \u201cadditional coverage\u201d on the other. We therefore begin by reviewing relevant general principles of policy interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>2. <em>Relevant Principles of Insurance Policy Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820 799 P.2d 1253], the Supreme Court explained, \u201cUnder statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1639.) The \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1638.) Thus, if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning. [Citations.] [ft] If there is ambiguity, however, it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1649.) If application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity, ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1654.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 821-822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">In 1992, the Supreme Court amplified on these principles in <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545], In that case, the court noted that \u201c[w]hile insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply. . . . The fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties. ... If contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs. ... On the other hand, \u2018[i]f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain, it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u2019 . . . This rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, <em>\u2018the objectively reasonable expectations of the </em>insured.\u2019 . . . Only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer. ... [ft] In summary, a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. In so doing, the court must interpret the language in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy. . . . This is because <em>\u2018language in a contract </em>must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole, and in the circumstances of that case, and <em>cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u2019 \u201d (Id. </em>at pp. 1264-1265, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The <em>Bank of the West </em>court made it clear that in order to conclude that an ambiguity exists which will be construed against an insurer, it is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>first to determine whether the coverage under the policy, which would result from such a construction, is consistent with the insured\u2019s <em>objectively reasonable expectations. </em>In order to do this, the disputed policy language must be examined <em>in context </em>with regard to its intended function in the policy. <em>(Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265; see also <em>Cooper Companies v. Transcontinental Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1106 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 508].) This requires a consideration of the policy as a whole, the circumstances of the case in which the claim arises and \u201ccommon sense.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1265, 1276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">An insurance policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are <em>reasonable. (Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 867 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263].) Th\u00e9 uncertainty may relate to the extent or existence of coverage, the peril insured against, the amount of liability or the party or parties protected. (See <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Phoenix Const. Co. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 423, 437-438 [296 P.2d 801] and cases cited there.) As indicated, the language in an insurance policy is \u201cinterpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) Thus, the proper question is whether the particular phrase is ambiguous in \u201cthe context of <em>this </em>policy and the circumstances of <em>this </em>case. [Citation.] \u2018The provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co., supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 854, 868.) This question must be answered through the eyes of a reasonable person in the position of the insured. <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Admiral Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 645, 666-667 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d 878].) \u201cWords used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning which a layman would ordinarily attach to them. Courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Policy exclusions are strictly construed. <em>(MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 635, 648 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 73 P.3d 1205].) Exceptions to exclusions on the other hand, are broadly construed in favor of the insured. <em>(Aydin Corp. v. First State Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1183, 1192 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 959 P.2d 1213].) As a result, \u201c \u2018an insurer cannot escape its basic duty to insure by means of an exclusionary clause that is unclear. As we have declared time and again \u201cany exception to the performance of the basic underlying obligation must be so stated as clearly to apprise the insured of its effect.\u201d [Citation.] Thus, \u201cthe burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.\u201d [Citation.] The exclusionary clause \u201cmust be <em>conspicuous, plain and clear.\u201d </em>\u2019 [Citation.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>This rule applies with particular force when the coverage portion of the insurance policy would lead an insured to reasonably expect coverage for the claim purportedly excluded. [Citation.] The burden is on the insured to establish that the claim is within the basic scope of coverage and on the insurer to establish that the claim is specifically excluded. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(MacKinnon </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">3. <em>The Exclusion for \u201cWet or Dry Rot\u201d Applies to Damage Caused by Fungus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Applying the foregoing principles of policy interpretation, we are persuaded that Allstate\u2019s exclusion for \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d includes the Poria fungus that attacked and damaged Jordan\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">We agree with the comment set out in Allstate\u2019s brief that few laypersons would be familiar with the term \u201cPoria,\u201d much less the full name of the fungus to which it refers. But it seems likely that a layperson would describe the decay caused by the fungus as \u201cdry rot.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Certainly, that was the effect of sworn deposition testimony given by DeLaCruz, Jordan\u2019s own expert, in another case, a copy of which was presented to the trial court by Allstate in support of its motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>This common understanding of the term \u201cdry rot\u201d is confirmed by Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1966): \u201cdry rot <em>n. </em>1 : a decay of seasoned timber caused by certain fungi (as the house fungi and some polypores) that consume the cellulose of wood leaving a mere soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder 2 : a rot of plant tissue in which the affected areas are not soft and wet but dry and often firmer than normal or more or less mummified: as a : decay of standing timber involving such rot and caused chiefly by polypores ... 3 : a fungus causing dry rot . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">It is well settled that in order to construe words in an insurance policy in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d a court may resort to a dictionary. <em>(Scott v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 24, 29 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 566]; see also <em>Stamm Theatres, Inc. v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 531, 543 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 300].) In looking to dictionary definitions, however, courts must take care to consider the policy context in which the word or term was used and attempt to put itself in the position of a layperson and understand how he or she might reasonably interpret the particular language. <em>(MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 649.) We believe our conclusion regarding the layperson\u2019s understanding of the term \u201cdry rot\u201d is consistent with that admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Jordan seeks to counter that conclusion by reliance on a declaration from DeLaCruz that she filed in support of her opposition to Allstate\u2019s motion. In that declaration, DeLaCruz identified himself as a state licensed pest control operator with 30 years of experience. He explained that he tried to \u201cavoid using the term \u2018dry rot\u2019 and [does] not use it at all to describe the decay caused by Poria.\u201d Allstate, however, objected to DeLaCruz\u2019s declaration on the ground that it lacked a proper foundation demonstrating that he was qualified to express an opinion as to whether Poria was properly embraced in the term \u201cdry rot.\u201d The trial court sustained that objection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Arguably, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>was error as DeLaCruz\u2019s declaration did provide sufficient facts to establish a foundation for the expression of his opinion. <em>(Mann v. Cracchiolo </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 18, 37-38 [210 Cal.Rptr. 762, 694 P.2d 1134].) As the <em>Mann </em>court explained, \u201c. . . the determinative issue in each case must be whether the witness has sufficient skill or experience in the field so that his testimony would be likely to assist the jury in the search for the truth, and \u2018no hard and fast rule can be laid down which would be applicable in every circumstance.\u2019 [Citation.] Where a witness has disclosed sufficient knowledge, the question of the degree of knowledge goes more to the weight of the evidence than its admissibility. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">DeLaCruz\u2019s declaration was sufficient to demonstrate a \u201cspecial\u201d knowledge of the subject matter of the Poria fungus. The weight and value of his opinion would be a matter for the trier of fact, but it should not have been rejected on the ground asserted by Allstate. (See, generally, <em>Brown v. Colm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 639, 645-647 [114 Cal.Rptr. 128, 522 P.2d 688].) To the extent that this was error, however, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Expert testimony is not generally admissible on the question of the meaning of particular policy language. <em>(National Auto &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-459 [272 Cal.Rptr. 625] [\u201cThe opinion of a linguist or other expert as to the meaning of the policy is irrelevant to the court\u2019s task of interpreting the policy as read and understood by a <em>reasonable lay </em>person\u201d (italics added)]; see also <em>Cooper Companies v. Transcontinental Ins. Co., supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1100 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>508]; <em>Pieper v. Commercial Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 551].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">As we have explained, it is the court\u2019s function to interpret policy language as a matter of law where, as here, there is no dispute as to the words used in the policy. In making such interpretation, the court is required to do so through the eyes of a reasonable lay person, not those of a lawyer, an insurance specialist, an expert in wood science or a pest control operator. <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 666-667; <em>Crane v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 112, 115 [95 Cal.Rptr. 513, 485 P.2d 1129].) DeLaCruz\u2019s declaration (contrary to his earlier deposition testimony) did not provide any assistance to the court with respect to a <em>layperson\u2019s </em>common understanding of the term \u201cdry rot.\u201d Moreover, nothing that DeLaCruz said suggested or tended to show that the term \u201cdry rot\u201d had a particular or technical meaning understood by the parties at the time the policy was issued or that his particular reluctance to use the term was sufficient to demonstrate that it included certain types of fungus and not others. (See, generally, <em>Wolf v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1356-1358 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">It appears clear to us that a layperson\u2019s understanding of the term \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d embraces damage or decay caused by a fungus. Since Poria is admittedly a fungus, we would have no trouble concluding that the Poria fungus that damaged Jordan\u2019s home fell within the policy exclusion for \u201cwet or dry rot.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But that is only true if we read the terms of that exclusion in isolation. When read in the context of the entire policy, however, such clarity disappears. Thus, we do not agree with Allstate\u2019s contention that reliance on the exclusion for \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d is sufficient to resolve Jordan\u2019s claim in Allstate\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">4. <em>There Is an Ambiguity Between the \u201cAdditional Coverage\u201d Exception for Collapse and the Exclusion for \u201cWet or Dry Rot\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The Allstate policy provides, on a limited basis, \u201cadditional coverage\u201d for \u201ccollapse.\u201d As we mentioned at the outset, the Allstate policy is an \u201call-risk\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>policy (i.e., it provides coverage for all risks of loss, <em>except those expressly excluded). </em>There are, however, two exclusions that are relevant to the resolution of this matter. The first is the one relating to \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d that we have already discussed. The second is for a \u201closs to [covered] property consisting of or caused by collapse.\u201d But the exception to that exclusion states that it does <em>not </em>apply if the requirements of the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d for collapse have been met: an <em>entire </em>collapse of all or part of a covered building structure which is a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by (as far as is relevant here): (1) <em>hidden decay </em>of the building structure or (2) defective methods or materials used in construction, repair, remodeling or renovation (provided that the collapse occurs in the course of such construction, repair, remodeling or renovation).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Jordan makes two arguments with respect to her claim for coverage under this exception to the collapse exclusion. First, she contends that the Poria fungus and the damage it caused constituted \u201chidden decay.\u201d Second, she asserts that some part of the collapse resulted from and during the negligent trenching work of P.W. Stephens whom she had retained to remediate her Poria fungus problem. We need discuss only the first of these arguments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The exception to the collapse exclusion is described in a section of the policy designated as \u201cadditional coverage\u201d and applies to a loss caused by an entire collapse that is due to \u201chidden decay.\u201d There is evidence in this case that the damage caused by wet or dry rot was found in wood members in the concealed area of the wall (see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>As our discussion of the dictionary definition of \u201cdry rot\u201d made clear, that term necessarily involves \u201cdecay.\u201d Thus, the use of the term \u201cdry rot\u201d in the exclusion and the use of the term \u201chidden decay,\u201d in the provision for \u201cadditional coverage\u201d lead to a confusing contradiction. Such contradiction creates an ambiguity with respect to coverage involving a claim of collapse. Given our obligation to read the Allstate policy so as to give full effect to <em>all </em>of its terms and conditions (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1641; <em>Holz Rubber Co. Inc. v. American Star Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 45, 56-57 [120 Cal.Rptr. 415, 533 P.2d 1055]), we might reconcile this contradiction in one of two ways. First, we could conclude that a collapse due to \u201chidden decay\u201d would be covered, but not if such decay was caused by \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d; or, second, we could conclude that coverage for a collapse due to \u201chidden decay\u201d was provided, but <em>noncollapse </em>damage caused by \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d was excluded. Each of these constructions of the policy language is reasonable. The first is consistent with Allstate\u2019s contention that the exclusion for \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d precludes coverage irrespective of whether there is a basis for coverage under the exception to the collapse exclusion. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>the other hand, the second interpretation is advanced by Jordan and supports her claim for coverage under the collapse provisions of the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d section of the policy. Thus, when read in the context of the entire policy, particularly the provision granting coverage for a collapse caused by \u201chidden decay,\u201d the effect and application of the exclusion for a loss caused by wet or dry rot is not at all clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">When presented with such a conflict between competing policy provisions, it is our obligation to attempt to resolve the resulting ambiguity by first looking to the <em>objectively reasonable </em>expectations of Jordan, the insured. When the \u201cdry rot\u201d exclusion is read in the context of the entire policy, particularly the exclusion for collapse and the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d exception thereto, an insured could reasonably conclude that while the \u201cdry rot\u201d exclusion will <em>generally </em>preclude coverage for damage caused by a fungus, the exception to the collapse exclusion will counter that and provide coverage for a <em>collapse </em>caused by \u201chidden decay.\u201d Since dry rot is a form of decay <em>(Stamm Theaters, Inc. v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 539-540), coverage would be reasonably expected. Put another way, an insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectation of coverage could arise from a reading of the entire policy in context because the \u201ccollapse\u201d exception for \u201cdecay\u201d will justify coverage for a collapse caused by \u201cdry rot,\u201d even if noncollapse damage caused by dry rot is excluded. That being so, we must resolve the ambiguity by looking to the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured and construing the policy language consistent therewith and against the insurer. <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1264-1265; see also <em>E.M.M.I., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zurich American Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 465, 474-475 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 701, 84 P.3d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The evidence presented with respect to Allstate\u2019s summary judgment motion demonstrated that the \u201cdecay\u201d caused by the Poria fungal infestation and the resulting \u201cdry rot\u201d was \u201chidden\u201d; thus, one of the two causal factors set out in the policy\u2019s collapse exception and relied upon by Jordan has been satisfied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our resolution of this issue of policy construction in Jordan\u2019s favor, however, does not fully answer the question as to the existence of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>5. <em>Whether the \u201cEntire Collapse\u201d Requirement for Coverage Under the Collapse Exception Can Be Satisfied Presents Unresolved Issues of Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The collapse exception expressly provides that there will be additional coverage for an <em>entire </em>collapse of all or a part of a building. Although we have resolved the ambiguity problem created by the \u201cdry rot\u201d/\u201chidden decay\u201d conflict, that only permits us to conclude that the trial court erred in relying on the \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d exclusion to summarily find that there was no coverage under the Allstate policy. Whether Jordan can demonstrate the existence of coverage under the provisions of the collapse exception involves factual questions that remain to be resolved. The trial court did not actually reach these issues and we are not satisfied that the record before us is sufficient to enable us to resolve them as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If the collapse portion of the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d provision is read to require an \u201cactual\u201d collapse, then a state of \u201cimminent\u201d collapse would not support Jordan\u2019s claim. <em>(Rosen </em>v. <em>State Farm General Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1070, 1078 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 361, 70 P.3d 351].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">As we have already discussed, Jordan presented evidence that a window fell out of her house and a portion of a floor \u201cgave way.\u201d On the other hand, her expert, DeLaCruz, referred to a concern about a risk of <em>imminent </em>collapse. Did the condition of Jordan\u2019s home involve an actual collapse or only an imminent one? Neither party properly addressed this question with appropriate evidentiary support. What does it mean for a floor to \u201cgive way\u201d? How should a window falling out be characterized? We can conclude, as we do below, that Allstate\u2019s policy requires an \u201cactual\u201d collapse, but we have no way of determining if that happened here. That will be a job for the trier of fact on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">It seems self-evident that the policy\u2019s use of the term \u201centire\u201d collapse necessarily must refer to an actual, not an imminent collapse. For a building or a portion thereof to sustain an \u201centire collapse\u201d must mean that it has <em>entirely </em>collapsed, that is \u201cwholly,\u201d \u201ccompletely,\u201d or \u201cfully.\u201d (See Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1966).) Put another way, to constitute an \u201centire collapse,\u201d there must be a \u201ctotal collapse.\u201d It would make no sense to apply such a description to a collapse that was merely \u201cimminent.\u201d Whether a potential collapse that is properly described as \u201cimminent\u201d will result in an entire or total collapse or something less, or no collapse at all, is a matter of pure speculation unless and until such collapse <em>actually </em>occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>Jordan relies upon two cases that do not support her position. In <em>Doheny West Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 400 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 260], the relevant policy language provided that the insurer would provide coverage for \u201closs or damage caused by or resulting from <em>risks </em>of direct physical loss involving collapse . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 405, italics added.) This language clearly did not limit coverage to <em>actual </em>collapse but necessarily embraced <em>imminent </em>collapse. The court found the language ambiguous and, applying settled principles, concluded that it created in the insured an objectively reasonable expectation of coverage for both an imminent as well as an actual collapse. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 405.) Put another way, the promise of coverage for a \u201crisk\u201d of loss was broad enough to embrace the <em>threat </em>of loss from an imminent collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The case of <em>Stamm Theatres, Inc. v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., supra, 93 </em>Cal.App.4th 531, presented a similar problem in that it also had policy language providing coverage for <em>\u201crisks </em>of direct physical loss <em>involving </em>collapse.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 535, italics added.) Relying on the analysis of similar policy language set out in <em>Doheny West, </em>the insurer in <em>Stamm </em>conceded that the policy provided coverage for imminent as well as actual collapse. <em>(Stamm, </em>at p. 536.) In its opinion, the <em>Stamm </em>court agreed that this conclusion flowed from the broad scope of such policy language. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">As Allstate emphasizes (and as the trial court pointed out), these cases were not decided in the context of the same policy language that is before us. As we have discussed, the language used in the Allstate policy is far more narrowly drawn. It requires an \u201centire\u201d collapse. In our view, the term \u201centire\u201d collapse is susceptible of only one reasonable interpretation. That is the one the trial court adopted. Coverage under the collapse exception applied only to an <em>actual </em>collapse. (See <em>Rosen v. State Farm General Ins. Co., supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1075-1076.) Whether such a collapse occurred in this case is a factual matter that the trial court must resolve in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The trial court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that there was no coverage under Allstate\u2019s policy for the loss sustained by Jordan. While the \u201cadditional coverage\u201d collapse exception may provide a basis for coverage under Allstate\u2019s policy in spite of the \u201cwet or dry rot\u201d exclusion, unresolved questions of fact remain as to whether Jordan is actually entitled to such coverage. The trial court neither addressed nor resolved those underlying factual questions. We will therefore reverse and remand to give the trial court an opportunity to decide these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The judgment is reversed. This matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein. Jordan shall recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Klein, P.

With respect to the area of the living room floor that had \u201cgiven way,\u201d DeLaCruz warned that \u201c[ejxtreme caution should be exercised during the opening of the floor as this section of the substructure is [sic] <em>imminent </em>danger of collapse.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\"> Allegedly as the result of some defective trenching performed by P.W.

She submitted a supplemental claim for the cost of repair to this wall on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>March 13, 2001.

We set forth the trial court\u2019s ruling verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">\u201cLuis DeLaCruz states as his expert opinion testimony that the cause of the Plaintiff\u2019s property damage was \u2018an attack of Poria .. . not \u201cmold, wet or dry rot\u201d \u2019 He expressly bases his opinion on his professional experience, that he is a licensed pest control operator in California; has over 30 years experience in the pest control industry; has conducted more than 1200 field investigations of Poria-related damage engaged in extensive case review, reading and discussion (without identifying a single case or publication). Mr. DeLaCruz further based his opinion on the following: vague, unauthenticated and inadmissible hearsay references to his experience as a trainer or continuing education provider in the field of Poria; inadmissible hearsay letters of appreciation for his contributions to understanding Poria. H] This general experience and substantially inadmissible information is insufficient to establish Mr. DeLaCruz as an expert on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>the; cause of the damage to Plaintiffs property. There is nothing in Mr. DeLaCruz\u2019s declaration to show special knowledge about Poria or mold or wet or dry rot. He fails to explain the significance, if any, of being a licensed pest control operator. What training, if any, must one have to be licensed? What record must a licensee demonstrate to maintain his license? What sort of specific work has Mr. DeLaCruz performed during his 30 years experience in the pest control industry? What are field investigations? How often has he encountered poria or mold or wet or dry rot? What cases has he reviewed? What has he read? With whom has he had discussions and on what subjects? These, and many more questions must be answered satisfactorily in order for Mr. DeLaCruz to qualify as an expert on the cause of the damage to plaintiff\u2019s property. H] In contrast to the lack of specificity of breadth or depth in Mr. DeLaCruz\u2019s credentials to testify as an expert in this case, the Defendant offers by declaration opposing expert testimony of Barry S. Goodell, PhD. In that declaration Dr. Goodell provides his specific and extensive knowledge, experience and education as the basis for his opinion that the term \u2018dry rot\u2019 properly describes \u2018Poria.\u2019 That basis includes that: he is a professor of wood science and technology/forests products laboratory at the University of Maine; his areas of professional expertise include decay fungi and protection of wood from environmental degradation; he has made 200 publications and presentations in the field of wood deterioration and protection; he reviewed numerous identified professional publications on dry rot and microbiological degradation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b934-8\"> Similarly, statements of Allstate\u2019s claims personnel relied upon by Jordan regarding either the meaning or ambiguity of the term \u201cdry rot\u201d are not relevant.
