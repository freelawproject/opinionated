J.</author>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Appellants, who were conducting a protest at respondent Wal-Mart\u2019s business premises in Ukiah, were arrested for trespass after they refused to leave. They commenced this action for false arrest and violation of constitutional rights against Wal-Mart and the store manager who made the arrests as a private person. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 837.) Respondents moved for summary judgment and the motion was granted by the trial court, which thereupon dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Relying upon <em>Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341], and its progeny, particularly <em>Union of Needletrades, etc. Employees v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 996 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 838] (Needletrades), the court determined that respondent\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions were as a matter of law reasonable on their face and constitutional, and that appellants\u2019 failure to comply with those restrictions constituted a complete defense to appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The facial reasonableness of the restrictions is not, in our view, the dispositive consideration. (Without deciding the issue, we shall for purposes of this appeal assume Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions are facially constitutional.) Because the trial court failed to address the issues directly framed by the pleadings, and the evidence does not establish the absence of triable issues of material fact (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c), we shall reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Respondent Wal-Mart owns and operates the largest retail store in the City of Utoah. The stand-alone structure, which has 104,000 square feet of floor space, is located within a complex that includes other \u201cbig box\u201d outlets, whose parking areas are each commonly used by customers of other stores. The parking lot adjacent to the Wal-Mart store is located on the west side of the structure in front of its main entrance. The parking lot is separated from the store by a driveway, a median, and a wide sidewalk that runs along the side of the building. Wal-Mart sells an extraordinarily wide variety of merchandise and provides internal space for at least three independent businesses: a restaurant, a stereo store and a tax preparation service. Kiddie rides, vending machines and a community bulletin board are located on the sidewalk along the front of the store near the entrance. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>appellants, this area \u201chas become known as the best place in Ukiah to gather signatures to place matters on the state or local ballot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On February 17, 2000, one Richard Johnson was arrested while on Wal-Mart property collecting signatures to qualify a voter initiative, known as Measure G, to decriminalize the personal use of marijuana. Local print and broadcast media reports stated or suggested that Wal-Mart caused Johnson to be arrested because it opposed his efforts to qualify Measure G for the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Four days later, stimulated by these news reports, appellants and approximately 25 others appeared at the Wal-Mart store to protest Johnson\u2019s arrest, which they saw as a misuse of \u201cthe power of arrest to suppress grass roots democracy.\u201d Appellants asked customers and others to sign petitions supporting Measure G and encouraged them to register to vote. Some appellants carried signs bearing messages such as \u201cFree speech,\u201d \u201cWal-Mart or freedom,\u201d and \u201cTime to vote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Appellants\u2019 expressive activities, which we discuss below in greater detail, lasted for about an hour. The police appeared on the scene, observed appellants\u2019 activities and discussed the situation with Wal-Mart store manager Donald Estes, but made no arrests. In the presence of the police, Estes asked appellants to leave and when they refused made citizen\u2019s arrests of each of them. The police then took appellants into custody and transported them to the Ukiah Police Department where they were booked and released. Criminal charges were never filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">On February 16, 2001, appellants filed a complaint in the Mendocino County Superior Court against respondents Wal-Mart and Estes, claiming false arrest and violation of constitutional rights, alleged as an intentional tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondents answered the complaint on March 14, 2001. On August 29, 2002, respondents moved for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">On November 15, 2002, the court granted the motion for summary judgment in its entirety and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The court ruled that Wal-Mart had adopted reasonable rules regulating the exercise of those rights in an effort to ensure that persons wishing to exercise free speech rights did not interfere with normal business operations, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>appellants had presented no evidence that those rules were too broad or unreasonably restricted the ability of persons exercising the right of free speech to reach their intended audiences. Nor, the court found, did appellants show that Wal-Mart could have adequately protected its business operations through less restrictive regulations. The court concluded that Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions \u201cpresent a reasonable balance between the rights of free speech and the rights of private property ownership,\u201d and that there was no triable issue of material fact as to whether those restrictions constituted reasonable regulations to assure that free speech activities did not interfere with Wal-Mart\u2019s normal business operations. The court determined, finally, that appellants\u2019 failure to comply with those regulations \u201cconstitutes a complete defense to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Wal-Mart and Donald Estes violated plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights of free speech on February 21, 2000. That same failure also constitutes a complete defense to the claim for false arrest for trespass.\u201d The order granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint with prejudice was entered on November 15, 2002. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cAppellate review of a summary judgment is limited to the facts shown in the supporting and opposing affidavits and those admitted and uncontested in the pleadings. In deference to the strong public policy favoring a trial on the merits, appellate courts are bound by the same principles governing the trial court\u2019s determination: i.e., the <em>moving party\u2019s </em>(respondent\u2019s) papers are <em>strictly construed </em>and the <em>opposing party\u2019s </em>(appellant\u2019s) papers are <em>liberally construed. </em>All doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion (whether there is any issue of material fact [Code of Civil Procedure] \u00a7 437c) are to be resolved <em>in favor of the party opposing the motion </em>(i.e., a denial of summary judgment).\u201d (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 2003) \u00b6 8:164, pp. 8-98.7 to 8-98.8, citing <em>Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 768 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 617, 23 P.3d 1143]; <em>Stratton </em>v. <em>First Nat. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1071 [258 Cal.Rptr. 721]; <em>Heredia </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1345, 1353-1354 [279 Cal.Rptr. 511].)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Summary judgments are reviewed de novo. <em>(Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Loma Linda </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 67-68 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 5 P.3d 874].) \u201cBecause trial judges <em>no longer exercise discretion </em>in considering a summary judgment motion, application of the abuse of discretion standard is inappropriate. Under current law, summary judgment motions raise <em>only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>questions of law </em>regarding the construction and effect of the moving and opposing papers; and questions of law are subject to the <em>independent </em>standard of review.\u201d (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, supra, \u00b6 8:166, p. 8-98.9, citing <em>Saldana v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1515 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385]; <em>Donchin v. Guerrero </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1837 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 192].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We apply the same three-step analysis required of the trial court. \u201c \u2018 \u201cFirst, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond ....[]\u25a1 Secondly, we determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing has established facts which negate the opponent\u2019s claim and justify a judgment in movant\u2019s favor. . . . [f] When a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 544, 548 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The issues framed by the pleadings are straightforward. Appellants\u2019 cause of action for false arrest is predicated on the allegations that they and others \u201cgathered peacefully to picket defendant WAL-MART\u2019s store in Ukiah,\u201d that \u201c[t]he picketing did not obstruct vehicular traffic nor prevent customers from entering or exiting the premises,\u201d that respondents threatened to place them under citizen\u2019s arrest if they refused to leave Wal-Mart\u2019s premises, that compliance with the demand to leave would have required them \u201cto surrender their state constitutional rights to picket,\u201d which they were unwilling to do, and that placing appellants under citizen\u2019s arrest, which resulted in their being taken into custody by the Ukiah City Police, \u201cconstituted false arrests\u201d proximately causing injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">False arrest is not a different tort but merely one way of committing the tort of false imprisonment. <em>(Asgari v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 744, 752, fn. 3 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 842, 937 P.2d 273]); <em>Arpin </em>v. <em>Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 261 F.3d 912, 919.) The tort of false imprisonment \u201cis premised upon a violation of the personal liberty of another accomplished without lawful authority . . . .\u201d <em>(Asgari, </em>at p. 753.) A peace officer who accepts custody of a person following a citizen\u2019s arrest is not required to correctly determine whether the arrest was justified (see <em>Kinney v. County of Contra Costa </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 761, 768 [87 Cal.Rptr. 638] <em>(Kinney)),</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and cannot be held liable for the arrest if it was improper. (Pen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Code, \u00a7 847). Therefore, while a person falsely arrested by a citizen ordinarily has no remedy against the peace officer who took him or her into custody as a result of the arrest, he or she has a tort remedy against the offending citizen. (Kinney; at p. 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Appellants maintain that Estes\u2019s arrests of them were false not only because they did not commit the criminal trespass for which he arrested them (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602.1, subd. (a)), but also, and independently, because respondents do not allege in their answer to the complaint that the trespass was committed or attempted in Estes\u2019s presence, as required by the statute authorizing arrest by a private person (Pen. Code, \u00a7 837, subd. 1), and confirmed by the case law (see, e.g., <em>People v. Sjosten </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 539, 543-544 [68 Cal.Rptr. 832]), and the evidence respondents submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment establishes that the offense (if there was one) was <em>not </em>committed or attempted in Estes\u2019s presence. Therefore, appellants maintain, Estes lacked legal authority to personally place them under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The cause of action for violation of constitutional rights, which incorporates the allegations of the cause of action for false arrest, alleges that appellants\u2019 activities were protected by article I, sections 2 and 3 of the California Constitution, and appellate opinions interpreting those provisions, \u201cwhich hold that public fora exist on the private property of large retail establishments which have supplanted the traditional town squares and/or downtown shopping areas which were the traditional sites for free speech activities,\u201d and that respondents\u2019 arrests of appellants violated rights guaranteed by the aforesaid constitutional provisions. As to this cause of action, respondents maintained that Wal-Mart\u2019s' premises are not a public forum and that appellants therefore have no constitutional right to protest on their property, and that appellants could not succeed even if the premises are a public forum due to their failure to comply with Wal-Mart\u2019s reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Both causes of action focus upon the impropriety of the arrests and the reason they were made, which was allegedly to suppress appellants\u2019 right of free speech. The complaint does not claim that Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions are unreasonable or even refer to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The evidence submitted by respondents in support of the motion for summary judgment consisted exclusively of limited portions of the deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>testimony of each of the eight appellants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant Hamburg\u2019s responses to form interrogatories, and the declaration of respondent Estes. Estes\u2019s declaration was accompanied by a copy of the incident report of the Ukiah Police, copies of three complaints Wal-Mart received from customers regarding appellants\u2019 activities, and a copy of Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201cRules and Regulations for Petitioning and Soliciting from Wal-Mart California Property.\u201d The evidence appellants submitted in opposition to the motion consisted primarily of the declaration of appellant David Drell, one of the coordinators of the protest. Neither party objected to the admissibility of any of the evidence submitted by the other and we find all the evidence admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The proffered portions of appellants\u2019 depositions describe appellants\u2019 past political activities, the general nature of their expressive activities at WalMart on the day in question, and the substance of the information they communicated and the number of people they spoke with. Appellants acknowledged that their activities did not take place in the area designated by Wal-Mart for expressive activities and that they had not procured insurance coverage for the activity. All appellants except David Drell, who was a coordinator of the protest, admitted they made no effort to identify themselves in advance to Wal-Mart management. Drell stated that after arriving at the scene he entered the store to find the manager in order to identify himself, describe the nature of the planned expressive activity and provide a copy of the petition and voter registration form protestors would be using. The Wal-Mart \u201cgreeter\u201d Drell approached refused to direct him to the manager and \u201csaid something disparaging about the content of the petition,\u201d so Drell left the store and the protest commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Appellants\u2019 confined most of their activities to a landscaped median approximately 25 feet from the front entrance to the store and the sidewalk along the front of the store. They did not use the four-by-six-foot area designated by Wal-Mart for expressive activities because that space was being used by two individuals soliciting donations to a children\u2019s program.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Estes\u2019s short declaration states that the Ukiah Wal-Mart store does not have \u201ctheatres, plazas, walkways or courtyards, where patrons are invited or encouraged to congregate and spend time together\u201d; that the store \u201cis in the business of selling merchandise, not to create a public square or similar place for people to gather\u201d; that at the time of the incident Wal-Mart \u201chad a petitioning policy, which individuals must adhere to in order to be granted access to the Ukiah Wal-Mart store property for purposes of speech activity\u201d; that at that time \u201cWal-Mart designated an area 4x6 feet in size for particular expressive speech activity,\u201d though the store \u201ccould adjust this area upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>review of the particular activity engaged in, and the number of participants\u201d; that at the time of the incident, \u201cit was not good business practice for [the store] to encourage customers to congregate at the front of the store because there is merchandise at this location and sales cannot be made\u201d; that the Ukiah Wal-Mart store \u201chad previous problems with persons who enter property for the purpose of protesting and petitioning for various political causes\u201d; and that, at the time of the incident in question, the store \u201chad received numerous complaints from customers and employees concerning aggressive and harassing conduct by [appellants] and others in their group.\u201d Estes states that he \u201chad conversations both with Ukiah police officers, [appellants] and other participants, in order to resolve the situation prior to any arrests.\u201d Finally, he states that \u201c[a]fter my discussions with Ukiah police officers, I believed in good faith that [appellants] plaintiffs were in violation of the law.\u201d Accordingly, he asked appellants to leave and, when they refused, placed them under citizen\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">Wal-Mart\u2019s rules and regulations impose six requirements. First, petitioning and soliciting is only permitted \u201cin designated areas specified by WalMart.\u201d \u201cWal-Mart reserves the right to change the designated area in good faith as Wal-Mart deems necessary for the commercial operation of its store.\u201d It is undisputed that the designated area at the Ukiah store is a four-by-six foot rectangle located 17 feet south of the main entrance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Second, \u201cWal-Mart limits an Applicant to three consecutive days for petitioning and soliciting and requires advance notice of five business days of such activity.\u201d Petitioning and soliciting is not allowed during \u201cpeak traffic days,\u201d such as \u201cthe period from the weekend before Thanksgiving to and including January 2 of the following year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Third, \u201c[n]o sign, poster, placard, display, handbill or written material shall interfere with the commercial purpose of the Wal-Mart store or contain [or] depict \u2018fighting words,\u2019 obscenities, pornography, grossly or gruesome displays, highly inflammatory slogans likely to provoke disturbance or racial, or ethnic slurs.\u201d Written materials \u201cmust be submitted to Wal-Mart management prior to its use and if this prior submission is not done, then such material will not be allowed to be used at the store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">Fourth, the \u201cApplicant must disclose in advance the identities of the participants in the planned expressive activity,\u201d acknowledge that they have read Wal-Mart\u2019s rules and regulations and agree to abide by them, and disclose whether any of those who plan to conduct expressive activity ever injured persons or property while engaged in similar expressive activity elsewhere during the last 12 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Fifth, \u201c[i]f the nature or timing of the activity creates a foreseeable risk of injury [or] damage to persons or property, and that risk, in the discretion of management, warrants special insurance protection, Applicant must purchase and carry the necessary insurance coverage as determined by Wal-Mart management.\u201d However, failure to carry the necessary coverage' will not be cause for denying the applicant \u201cunless foreseeable risk warrants the need for special insurance,\u201d though \u201cthe Applicant must provide information about any existing general liability insurance policy covering the Applicant while engaged in the planned expressive activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">Lastly, the Wal-Mart rules prohibit an applicant from \u201cus[ing] any effort to impede, obstruct or interfere with any customer of the store. Further, no Applicant shall urge or encourage in any manner, customers not to purchase the goods or services offered by the store.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The police incident report states that two Ukiah police officers were dispatched to the scene. When they arrived, the officers \u201csaw about 15 subjects, some of whom were collecting signatures for a petition to legalize marijuana and others who were holding signs to protest Walmart\u2019s suppression of their right to free speech.\u201d The officers entered the store, met with Estes and gave him copies of Penal Code sections 602 and 602.1. An officer explained that section 602 was not applicable because the store was open to the general public (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 602, subd. (n)), and also explained \u201cthe criteria for a violation of [section] 602.1, [subdivision] (a),\u201d which applies to business establishments open to the public. Estes replied \u201cthat the petitioners were obstructing and intimidating customers by blocking their paths and using aggressive behavior to obtain signatures,\u201d which would violate section 602.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In support of this claim, Estes provided the officers three written customer complaints. One of the officers passed this information on by phone to the chief of police. The officers then returned outside, identified appellant Bruce Bering as one of the leaders of the protest, and were told by Bering that the protestors refused to comply with Wal-Mart\u2019s rules. At that point the chief of police arrived on the scene. After he tried but failed to reach a \u201cmutually agreeable resolution,\u201d Estes \u201cchecked with his legal department\u201d and was \u201cadvised to arrest the petitioners if they refused to leave the premises.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>police told Estes \u201che would need to tell each of the petitioners to leave the property and if they refused, to make a private person\u2019s arrest on each, before the police would accept custody of them.\u201d Estes then asked the protestors to leave and all but appellants did so. Estes then \u201cverbally placfed] each [appellant] under private person\u2019s arrest.\u201d The police accepted custody of appellants and transported them to the Ukiah Police Department, where they were booked, cited for trespass and released. No criminal charges were ever filed by the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The three customer complaints are very brief. The first states that after seeing the protestors, \u201cI almost did not go in. As I was walking up to the Walmart door, I was confronted by a protestor asking me to sign to legalize pot. They were very persistent. It desterbed [\u00bf7c] me. I did not appreciate it at all.\u201d The second complaining customer simply states, \u201cI was approached, by some people outside Walmart with petitions, and was not happy [with] the way they approach people.\u201d The third customer said she was \u201cappalled that these people are demonstrating in front of the store. The legalization of marijuana has nothing to do with our right to shop. The man who was arrested here last week was equally inappropriate\u2014I feel their being positioned in front of the store is a violation of my civil rights.\u201d This complainant closed with the observation that \u201cI have always found the store to be very family friendly and I like doing business here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Before determining whether the evidence contained in the moving papers entitles respondents to judgment as a matter of law, we think it appropriate to describe the manner in which the trial court addressed this central question.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The trial court stated that resolution of respondents\u2019 motion requires the following two-step analysis: \u201cIf the court determines that the Wal-Mart owners have \u2018fully opened the property to the public,\u2019 it must then determine whether the Wal-Mart \u2018time, place and manner\u2019 regulations are reasonable under the circumstances. The court will first review the reasonableness of the regulations. If the court determines that the \u2018time, place and manner\u2019 regulations are reasonable, there is no need to determine whether the WalMart owners \u2018fully opened the property to the public.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In other words, in the mind of the trial judge, the crucial legal issue was the reasonableness on their face of Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The court found Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d rules to be reasonable not on the basis of any evidence marshaled by respondents in support of their motion (nor did respondents offer any evidence as to that issue, other than the rules themselves), but solely on the grounds that (1) Wal-Mart\u2019s rules were the same as or similar to those found reasonable in <em>Needletrades, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 996, and (2) appellants\u2019 failure to offer evidence or persuasive argument that Wal-Mart\u2019s rules were unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The reasonableness of Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions and respondents\u2019 refusal to be bound by them do not, however, establish that appellants committed the crime for which they were placed under citizen\u2019s arrest, which is defined in section 602.1, subdivision (a) of the Penal Code. As noted <em>(ante, </em>at p. 507, fn. 4), that statute makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally interfere with a lawful business establishment open to the public, \u201cby obstructing or intimidating those attempting to carry on business\u201d at the establishment and refusing to leave the premises after being requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">A person who refuses to consider her- or himself bound by \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions, or who violates one or more particular restriction, does not necessarily commit the criminal offense defined by Penal Code section 602.1, subdivision (a). As we have seen, Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d rules include one restriction (prohibiting efforts to \u201cimpede, obstruct or interfere with any customer of the store\u201d) that is conterminous with the prohibition of that statute, as well as other restrictions, such as the requirement of insurance coverage, that are not. A protestor who refuses to comply with reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions can, in appropriate circumstances, be enjoined by the landowner from carrying out expressive activities, or even ejected from the premises (see <em>In re Cox </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 205, 217 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992]); but the refusal to comply does not constitute misdemeanor trespass <em>unless </em>it consists of intentional interference with the landowner\u2019s business through the obstruction or intimidation of its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Thus, respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment requires them to factually establish that appellants committed the conduct proscribed by the statute because that might negate appellants\u2019 claims of false arrest and violation of constitutional rights. Moreover, since the arrests that are central to both claims were made by Estes, a private person, respondents must also show that the offense was \u201ccommitted or attempted in his presence.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 837, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\"><em>Needletrades, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th 996, which the trial court relied upon for the proposition that the facial reasonableness of the time, place and</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>manner restrictions was dispositive, involved a situation very different from that presented here. In <em>Needletrades, </em>the plaintiff union did not carry out any expressive activities on the defendants\u2019 premises, but instead sought a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing the challenged rules, which it claimed were \u201c \u2018unconstitutional conditions on the right to engage in free speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1001.) The central issue framed by the pleadings in <em>Needletrades, </em>therefore, was the reasonableness of the landowner\u2019s rules.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, however, the allegations of the pleadings to which the motion for summary judgment must respond is not the constitutionality of Wal-Mart\u2019s rules but the propriety and purpose of the arrests. The constitutionality of the rules does not govern the lawfulness of the arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">With respect to the alleged false arrest, the factual questions are whether appellants intentionally interfered with Wal-Mart\u2019s business \u201cby obstructing or intimidating those attempting to carry on business\u201d with Wal-Mart (Pen. Code, \u00a7 602.1, subd. (a).) and did so in the presence of the private person who arrested them. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 837, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The only evidence respondents provided relating to these questions was the declaration of Estes, the store manager, and the three written customer complaints he gave the police, earlier described. Estes does not declare that he observed appellants, or any of them, obstructing or intimidating any Wal-Mart customer, but merely that, at the time of the incident, the store had received \u201cnumerous\u201d complaints from customers and employees \u201cconcerning aggressive and harassing conduct by [appellants] and others in their group.\u201d The customers whose complaints have been made a part of the record indicated only that they were offended by appellants\u2019 conduct. One complainant stated that she was \u201cnot happy [with] the way [the protestors] approach people,\u201d but no customer indicated that he or she had been obstructed from carrying on business with Wal-Mart or intimidated, or even that appellants <em>attempted </em>to prevent them from shopping at Wal-Mart.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>In <em>In re Wallace </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 289 [90 Cal.Rptr. 176, 475 P.2d 208], petitioners for habeas corpus had been arrested for allegedly obstructing a county fair by handing out leaflets protesting the effects on farm workers of automation of agriculture. After trial, the petitioners were found guilty of trespass in violation of Penal Code section 602, subdivision (j), making punishable the entry of lands with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or injuring any lawful business of the landowner. The Supreme Court granted writ relief for the failure of the evidence to establish that the petitioners\u2019 leafleting activity constituted \u201cobstruction\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The evidence in <em>Wallace </em>showed that the petitioners stood in a pathway \u201c \u2018stopping patrons and soliciting them,\u2019 \u201d but that patrons who wished to inspect the exhibit at which petitioners were conducting their activity could do so \u201c \u2018by avoiding the area where [petitioners] were standing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 294.) The court found the evidence insufficient, pointing out that \u201cany visitor to a fair or other public exhibition necessarily occupies a certain area of ground or floor space wherever he stands, and persons wishing to proceed past him are manifestly required to \u2018avoid\u2019 that area under pain of tort liability. . . . [Petitioners were not in fact arrested because of any physical \u2018obstruction\u2019 they may have caused, but simply because they insisted on their lawful right to distribute leaflets and to display signs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 295.) This appears also to have been the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Moreover, respondents\u2019 meager evidence of obstruction is contradicted by appellants\u2019 evidence that they did not in any way interfere with Wal-Mart\u2019s business by obstructing or intimidating prospective customers. David Drell, one of the coordinators of appellants\u2019 protest, stated in a declaration that he and other protestors all conducted themselves \u201cpeacefully,\u201d and that none \u201cinterfered with customer access to Wal-Mart\u2019s premises.\u201d The police observed the protest immediately upon their arrival at the scene and again after meeting inside the store with Estes. So far as the record shows, the police were present during the only time at which Estes personally observed the protest. The police incident report states that when officers first arrived at the scene they \u201csaw about 15 subjects, some of whom were collecting signatures for a petition to legalize marijuana and others who were holding signs to protest Walmart\u2019s suppression of their right to free speech.\u201d But nowhere in the police report is there any suggestion that the officers on the scene believed appellants or other protestors were intentionally interfering with Wal-Mart\u2019s business by obstructing or intimidating its customers or otherwise engaging in any criminal act, which apparently was the reason the police declined to make any arrests. The fact that the police took appellants into custody does not indicate they believed appellants actually committed criminal trespass because, as earlier noted, peace officers who take custody of a person arrested by a private person are not required to correctly adjudge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>whether the citizen who made the arrest was justified in doing so. (See <em>Kinney, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d at p. 768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Drell\u2019s declaration, and the inferences that may be drawn from the incident report and the refusal of the police to themselves arrest appellants, conflict with the scant evidence of obstruction and intimidation that respondents have provided. In short, the facts relative to the material issue of whether appellants committed the criminal act for which they were arrested are disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Furthermore, it is not even necessary to determine whether appellants committed the trespass for which they were arrested if the offenses (assuming they took place) were not \u201ccommitted or attempted\u201d in the presence of the private person who arrested them. \u201cThe authority of a private citizen to make an arrest is more limited than that of a peace officer. A peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant whenever he has probable cause to believe that the person has committed a misdemeanor in his presence. [Citation.] A private citizen, however, may arrest another for a misdemeanor <em>only when the offense has actually been committed or attempted in his presence. </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 837, subd. I.)\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Cervantez v. J.C. Penney Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 579, 587 [156 Cal.Rptr. 198, 595 P.2d 975], italics added.) The mere fact that the private person has reasonable cause to believe a misdemeanor offense has been committed or attempted in his presence is not enough. <em>(People v. Martin </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 91, 94 [36 Cal.Rptr. 924]; <em>Collins v. Owens </em>(1947) 77 Cal.App.2d 713, 718 [176 P.2d 372].) As this division has stated, \u201cpresence\u201d is not mere physical proximity but is determined by whether the offense is \u201capparent to the senses\u201d of the person who makes the arrest. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sjosten, supra, </em>262 Cal.App.2d at pp. 543-544.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Estes\u2019s declaration does not assert or even imply that the acts for which he arrested appellants were committed in his presence. Estes\u2019s claim that he acted in the \u201cgood faith [belief] that plaintiffs were in violation of the law\u201d is based on his discussions with Ukiah police officers and, inferentially, customer complaints. In effect, Estes claims no more than that he acted with probable cause. However, as we have seen, a citizen\u2019s arrest for the commission of a misdemeanor cannot be made on that basis. Furthermore, the refusal of the police to themselves arrest appellants renders it unreasonable to assume they told Estes that he could properly do so. Finally, a declarant\u2019s self-serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>statement that he acted in good faith carries little weight. (See, e.g., <em>Widener v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 415, 435 [142 Cal.Rptr. 304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Insofar as it relates to appellants\u2019 cause of action for violations of constitutional rights, respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment was based on two theories: first, that Wal-Mart\u2019s property was not a public forum and that appellants therefore had no constitutional right to protest to begin with; and, second, that even if Wal-Mart\u2019s property was a public forum, appellants\u2019 claim failed as a matter of law because Wal-Mart has reasonable \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions, and appellants\u2019 refusal to comply with those restrictions provides respondents a complete defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As to the first theory, the trial court ruled that \u201c[wjhether obligated to or not, Wal-Mart has made its private property available to members of the public for the expression of their constitutional rights of free speech, including petitioning and protesting.\u201d Respondents have not appealed that ruling and, as it is supported by the evidence and the law, we shall not disturb it. (See <em>Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center, </em>supra, 23 Cal.3d 899; <em>In re Lane </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 872 [79 Cal.Rptr. 729, 457 P.2d 561].) The second theory, which <em>was </em>adopted by the trial court, is also unavailing, as we have already explained. Respondents did not merely attempt to enjoin appellants from petitioning and protesting on their property because of their unwillingness to comply with the \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions, but subjected them to arrest for the commission of a crime. It is true that the ground upon which the arrests were apparently made\u2014appellants\u2019 intentional interference with WalMart\u2019s business by obstructing and intimidating its customers\u2014is proscribed both by one of Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions and by the Penal Code, but there is clearly a factual dispute as to whether appellants actually engaged in the proscribed conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Appellants have alleged their cause of action for violation of constitutional rights as an intentional tort, which places at issue the purpose for which Estes placed appellants under citizen\u2019s arrest. Ultimately, appellants will have the burden of establishing that respondents arrested them falsely and for the purpose of suppressing the exercise of their constitutional rights of free speech. However, in connection with the motion for summary judgment it is now <em>respondents\u2019 </em>burden to establish, <em>on the basis of undisputed evidence, </em>that the arrests were made for the lawful purpose of enforcing Penal Code section 602.1, subdivision (a), and not for the purpose of suppressing protected speech.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Respondents have not sustained that burden. Appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>failure to comply with Wal-Mart\u2019s \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d restrictions provides respondents a complete defense to this action only if the failure to comply consists of the obstructive conduct prohibited by section 602.1, subdivision (a), which is vigorously disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the superior court is reversed. Appellants are awarded their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Haerle, J., and Lambden, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On March 3, 2004, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> The complaint included a third cause of action for unfair business practices in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17000 et seq. Inexplicably, however, the trial court\u2019s ruling addresses only the other two causes of action and is entirely silent on the unfair business practices claim. Because the orders granting summary judgment and dismissing the complaint pertain to all causes of action, our reversal of the judgment restores all claims set forth in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> At the time <em>Kinney, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d 761, was decided, Penal Code section 142 imposed criminal liability on peace officers who willfully refused to receive, inter alia, persons placed under citizen\u2019s arrest. The statute was amended in 1983 so as to make it inapplicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>arrests made by private persons. The amendment of the statute does not, however, suggest that an officer who receives a person arrested by a private person must first determine the propriety of the arrest.

With respect to the only mall at which the plaintiff had applied for and actually been denied a permit, the store with which the plaintiff had a labor dispute was located on the seventh floor, where it wished to conduct its protest, but the areas designated by the rales for expressive activities were on the sixth and eighth floors. The defendants offered evidence that the lire department prohibited the designation of an area directly in front of the store of interest to the plaintiff union, and that the different locations the union objected to \u201cwere selected to comply with fire regulations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1003.) Similarly, the insurance requirement of the rales at issue in <em>Needletrades </em>was deemed reasonable, in part, on the basis of a declaration of the assistant general manager of the mall at which the plaintiff sought and was denied a permit that not only explained the justification of the discretionary insurance requirement but stated that the declarant had <em>\u201cnever requested special insurance from any petitioner\" (id. </em>at p. 1006), and he would not request it from the plaintiff union. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> The reason private persons are held to a higher standard than peace officers is that a citizen \u201c \u2018has no public responsibility; there is less necessity for such arrests, and more occasion to deter private citizens from taking the law into their own hands.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>Golden Nugget Casino/Hotel, Inc. </em>(D.N.J. 1983) 576 F.Supp. 262, 267, quoting Prosser, Law of Torts (1971) \u00a7 17, p. 100.)
