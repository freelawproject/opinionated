Code, \u00a7 459).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the evidence in the record does not support the finding that the crime was gang related, and strike the gang registration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">\n<em>Case No. MCR 411232</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Defendant was arrested on December 1, 2002, after he was discovered by a Santa Rosa police officer in a car with a 14-year-old girl. He subsequently admitted that he \u201chad sex\u201d with the girl, and knew \u201cshe was only 14.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>arresting officer discovered that defendant \u201cwas on CYA parole\u201d and was a \u201ccertified Sure\u00f1o gang member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">On December 17, 2002, defendant entered a negotiated no contest plea to a charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor (\u00a7 261.5, subd. (c)). In accordance with the plea bargain, on January 22, 2003, he was placed on probation for 36 months, upon the condition, among others, that he not associate with known gang members, or wear gang attire or colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>Case No. SCR 32763</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">At 11:42 p.m. on January 12, 2003, a Santa Rosa police officer responded to a report of auto burglaries in the parking lot of the Circuit City store. The victims of the auto burglaries, M. Goldstein and R. Bettencourt, reported that windows of their vehicles had been broken, and provided the officer with a list of the items stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Just over an hour before the auto burglaries were reported, appellant was independently detained by another Santa Rosa police officer for \u201cdriving erratically and speeding on Santa Rosa Avenue.\u201d Defendant admitted that he \u201cwas on CYA parole,\u201d and granted the officer permission to search his vehicle. Property that \u201cmatched\u201d the items reported stolen in the auto burglaries at Circuit City was observed by the officer, but the crimes had not yet been reported, so defendant and his passenger Oscar Corral-Leon were permitted to leave. When the officer subsequently found Goldstein\u2019s wallet in her patrol vehicle where Corral-Leon had been seated, she promptly detained defendant and Corral-Leon again. Corral-Leon was arrested, but defendant was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">During subsequent questioning, Corral-Leon admitted that he and defendant had \u201cburglarized the two vehicles at Circuit City.\u201d Two days later, defendant was detained and arrested. A search of defendant\u2019s vehicle uncovered items reported stolen from Bettencourt, along with marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Defendant was charged with auto burglary, receiving stolen property, and possession of marijuana. On February 24, 2003, he entered a negotiated no contest plea to one count of auto burglary (\u00a7 459), in exchange for dismissal of the remaining charges, recognition that the plea did not operate to violate his probation in case No. MCR 411232,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an agreement for a maximum sentence of two years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>\n<em>The Probation Violation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Before the sentencing hearing in case No. SCR 32763, defendant\u2019s probation was revoked following a hearing in case No. MCR 411232 for associating with a gang member, based upon an incident on April 23, 2003, during which he was detained while driving his car in the company of Lorenzo Medina, a known member of the Sonoma County Sure\u00f1o criminal street gang. Medina was on parole, with gang terms and conditions. When the detention occurred, Medina was also wearing a blue football jersey inscribed with the number 13, which he threw into the back seat of the vehicle. According to expert testimony, the color blue and the number 13 are associated with the Sure\u00f1o gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>The Sentencing Hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At a combined sentencing hearing for both cases on July 24, 2003, the trial imposed a two-year term for auto burglary in case No. SCR 32763, and a consecutive eight-month term for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor in case No. MCR 411232. Over defense objection, the court also ordered \u201cgang registration\u201d pursuant to section 186.30, subdivision (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The sole contention made by defendant in this appeal is that the trial court erred by imposing a gang registration requirement under section 186.30. Defendant concedes that he has had \u201cprior gang involvement,\u201d but argues that section 186.30 authorizes a gang registration order only for \u201cthe nature of the crime for which he is being sentenced,\u201d not any past gang associations. The Attorney General agrees that a gang registration order must be based upon \u201ca current <em>conviction </em>for a \u2018crime\u2019 that is found to be \u2018gang related,\u2019 \u201d not a probation violation for association with gang members. Nevertheless, the Attorney General maintains that defendant\u2019s \u201clengthy criminal history,\u201d including his probation violation, provides evidentiary support for the finding that \u201ccommission of the auto burglary was related to his membership in a gang\u201d as required to authorize a gang registration order under section 186.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Section 186.30 provides that \u201cany person convicted in a criminal court or who has had a petition sustained in a juvenile court\u201d of either participating in a criminal street gang in violation of section 186.22, subdivision (a), or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\u201ccrime that the court finds is gang related,\u201d or where a gang enhancement pursuant to section 186.22 subdivision (b) has been found to be true, shall \u201cregister\u201d with the local law enforcement agency as a criminal street gang member.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1240, 1242 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 219].) If any of three specified conditions are found to exist, a gang registration order is mandatory. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>In re Eduardo C., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th 937, 943; <em>People v. Monroe </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1205, 1209 [215 Cal.Rptr. 51].)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The trial court relied upon the provision in subdivision (b)(3) of section 186.30, that the \u201ccrime\u201d was \u201cgang related,\u201d to impose the registration requirement on defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 186.30, subdivision (b)(3), does not offer any guidance to define those crimes that are \u201cgang related.\u201d The Attorney General submits that not just the crime, but the defendant\u2019s \u201chistory of gang membership\u201d and his \u201ccriminal record\u201d may be considered to determine that a crime was gang related within the meaning of subdivision (b)(3) of section 186.30. Defendant claims that only the circumstances or \u201cnature of the crime for which he is being sentenced\u201d may prove that an offense is gang related under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>In interpreting section 186.30, passed in March of 2000 as part of the voter initiative, Proposition 21, \u201c \u2018we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. (See <em>Horwich v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927] <em>(Horwich).) </em>Thus, [1] \u201cwe turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(People v. Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912] <em>(Birkett).) </em>[2] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent]. <em>(Horwich, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 276, [280].) [3] When the language is ambiguous, \u201cwe refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u201d <em>(Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 243.)\u2019 <em>(People v. Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].)\u201d <em>(Robert L. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 894, 900-901.) Our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the electorate so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(Day v. City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196]; <em>Torres v. Automobile Club of So. California </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th <em>771, 777 </em>[63 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 937 P.2d 290].)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Looking at the language of section 186.30, we find in the statute a clear expression of the voters\u2019 \u201cintent that the registration requirement \u2018apply to any person convicted in a criminal court\u2019 of certain <em>offenses.\u201d (People v. Bailey </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 238, 243 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 729], italics added.) The statutory language focuses exclusively upon the \u201ccrime\u201d committed, not the defendant\u2019s personal history or associations. Only a conviction of the identified offense of participation in a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)), the finding of an enhancement for the commission of a crime for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), or commission of another \u201cgang related\u201d crime, trigger the mandatory registration requirement of section 186.30. Nothing in the language of the statute extends the registration provisions to defendants who have not committed one of the enumerated offenses. As with other registration requirements\u2014for example, for narcotics and sex offenders\u2014 section 186.30 specifies \u201cthose <em>particular offenses </em>for which it deemed registration appropriate.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brun </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 951, 954 [260 Cal.Rptr. 850], italics added.)  And because registration is an onerous burden that may result in a separate misdemeanor offense for noncompliance, a registration requirement may not be imposed upon persons not specifically described in the statute. (See <em>People v. Franklin </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 249, 253 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 975 P.2d 30]; <em>In re Bernardino S. </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 613, 623 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 746]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brun, supra, </em>at p. 954.)  This court can -neither disregard the language of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>which differentiates between particular offenses and confines the obligation to register to only designated violations, nor expand the scope of the statute to impose registration for convictions of crimes not listed or under conditions not specified. (See <em>In re Luisa </em>Z. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 978, 984 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 231]; <em>In re Bernardino S., supra, </em>at pp. 623-624; <em>People v. Brun, supra, </em>at p. 954; <em>People v. Tye </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 796, 802-803 [206 Cal.Rptr. 813].) \u201cIn the case of a voters\u2019 initiative statute ... we may not properly interpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate: the voters should get what they enacted, not more and not less.\u201d <em>(Hodges v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 109, 114 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 884, 980 P.2d 433].) \u201c \u2018We must take the language ... as it was passed into law, and must, . . . without doing violence to the language and spirit of the law, interpret it so as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robert L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 894, 909, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 14 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829], fn. omitted.) \u201cIf there is no ambiguity, then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d <em>(Day </em>v. <em>City of Fontana, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th 268, 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">In accordance with the unambiguous language of the statute, we conclude that a <em>crime </em>may not be found gang related within the meaning of section 186.30 based solely upon the defendant\u2019s criminal history and gang affiliations. The crime itself must have some connection with the activities of a gang, which we conclude means a \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d as defined elsewhere in Proposition 21, section 186.22, subdivisions (e) and (f).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also conclude that a crime is \u201cgang related\u201d in this context when it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>\u201ccommitted, in the words\u201d of subdivision (b)(1) of section 186.22, \u201c \u2018for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with\u2019 a street gang.\u201d <em>(People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 622 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713], citation omitted; see also <em>In re Eduardo C., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th 937, 943.) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We do not conclude that a defendant\u2019s personal affiliations and criminal record are without consequence in finding a \u201cgang related\u201d crime within the meaning of section 186.30. To the contrary, a defendant\u2019s history of participation in gang activities or criminal offenses may prove that a crime not otherwise or intrinsically gang related nevertheless falls within the meaning of section 186.30. Thus, a crime committed by a defendant in association with other gang members or demonstrated to promote gang objectives may be gang related. However, the record must provide some evidentiary support, other than merely the defendant\u2019s record of prior offenses and past gang activities or personal affiliations, for a finding that the <em>crime </em>was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Here, nothing in the record connected defendant\u2019s conviction to gang activity. First, defendant\u2019s commission of a probation violation through his association with a known gang member, while certainly gang related, was not a <em>crime </em>at all, and hence cannot serve as the basis for the registration order, as the Attorney General has acknowledged. Auto burglary is a crime, but not one necessarily gang related, and the circumstances of the offense as described in the record before us fail to connect the offense with defendant\u2019s gang activities. While the probation report indicates that the auto burglary was committed by defendant and a companion, the accomplice is not identified as a gang member. Nor does the probation report give us any indication that this particular auto burglary, even if committed by someone identified as a \u201ccertified Sure\u00f1o gang member,\u201d was directed by, associated with, or benefited his criminal street gang.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither the investigating officer nor the probation officer even suggested that the auto burglary was other than a crime intended to benefit defendant personally. We agree with defendant that there is no evidentiary basis in the record to impose upon him the burden of gang offender registration pursuant to section 186.30. (See <em>In re Eduardo C., supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th 937, 943; <em>People v. Tye, supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 796, 803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The gang offender registration requirement is stricken from the judgment, and the trial court is directed to amend its records accordingly.

(See <em>Robert L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894, 900 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951]; <em>In re Eduardo C. </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 937, 940 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 924].) Upon a court\u2019s finding that a person was involved in a gang-related crime (\u00a7 186.30, subd. (b)), the court is required to notify the person of his or her duty to register (\u00a7 186.31) \u201cwith the chief of police of the city in which he or she resides, or the sheriff of the county if he or she resides in an unincorporated area, within 10 days of release from custody or within 10 days of his or her arrival in any city, county, or city and county to reside there, whichever occurs first.\u201d (\u00a7 186.30, subd. (a); cf. \u00a7 186.32, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Registration requirements are spelled out in section 186.32. The registration requirements last for five years. (\u00a7 186.32, subd. (c).) A registrant must keep law enforcement apprised of any change of address. (\u00a7 186.32, subd. (b).) It is a misdemeanor to knowingly violate the registration requirements. (\u00a7 186.33, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b607-14\"> Defendant was neither convicted for participating in a criminal street gang, nor was a gang enhancement found true in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> We recognize that section 186.30, subdivision (b)(3) uses the word \u201cgang\u201d when other parts of the initiative that enacted section 186.30 specifically employ the phrase \u201ccriminal street gang.\u201d For example, Proposition 21 added subdivision (d) to section 186.22, which prohibits commission of \u201ca public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor, which is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with, any <em>criminal street gang </em>with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d But we do not believe the voters intended to distinguish between \u201cgang\u201d and \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d in the provisions of the initiative. Findings articulated in the initiative demonstrate that the voters were concerned with the threat posed by criminal street gangs. Section 2 stated in subdivision (b): <em>\u201cCriminal street gangs and gang-related violence </em>pose a significant threat to public safety and the health of many of our communities. <em>Criminal street gangs </em>have become more violent, bolder, and better organized in recent years.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (b), p. 119, italics added.) And subdivision (k) similarly mentioned: \u201cDramatic changes are needed in the way we treat juvenile criminals, <em>criminal street gangs, </em>... if we are to avoid the predicted, unprecedented surge in juvenile and gang violence . . . .\u201d (See also <em>Robert L. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 894, 905-906.) We think that the term \u201cgang\u201d in section 186.30 is synonymous with the term \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d as defined in section 186.22, subdivision (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> Though this discussion by the California Supreme Court was not specifically concerned with section 186.30, subdivision (b)(3), but rather with the allied section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1), we again adopt it as a definition of \u201cgang related.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> As this appeal comes to us following a plea, we of course do not have any expert testimony in the record that explains the relationship of the crime to a criminal street gang.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
