Laudenslayer </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 504, 507 [118 Cal.Rptr. 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In this case, plaintiff was bitten by a dog owned by defendant landlord\u2019s tenants. The landlord moved for summary judgment, contending, among other things, that he owed plaintiff no duty of care due to his lack of actual prior knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious nature. The trial court granted the motion and entered summary judgment for the landlord. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">On April 30, 2001, plaintiff Brian Yuzon, a minor, was bitten by a dog, a pit bull or pit bull mix named Kemo. (While the complaint identified Kemo as a Rottweiller, plaintiff\u2019s separate statement identified Kemo as a pit bull or a pit bull mix.) Kemo was owned by defendants Tracy Blackburn and Fin Blackburn, who are not parties to this appeal. The incident occurred at the Blackburns\u2019 Long Beach residence, which they were renting from their landlord, defendant Gerald Coffins.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Plaintiff, by and through his guardian ad litem, filed this action against the Blackburns and Coffins on October 3, 2001. With regard to Collins, the complaint alleged he had negligently owned, maintained, managed and operated the premises, and had willfully failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Collins\u2019s Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">On August 8, 2002, Coffins moved for summary judgment, contending, among other things, that he owed no duty of care to plaintiff because he \u201chad no actual knowledge of the dangerous propensities of the subject dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Collins contended that although the Blackburns\u2019 1993 rental agreement had authorized them to have a Springer spaniel on the property, he was unaware of Kemo\u2019s presence on the property. The Blackburns\u2019 Springer spaniel died in February 1994. According to Fin Blackburn\u2019s testimony, Collins did not know about the Springer spaniel\u2019s death. In April 1994, the Blackburns acquired a Dalmatian. The Blackburns acquired Kemo in 1999, about a year and a half before this incident. Fin Blackburn testified that when the Blackburns acquired Kemo, they did not tell Collins they had acquired Kemo.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Collins testified that while he knew the lease had authorized a Springer spaniel on the property, he was not aware of any dogs on the property. Collins testified that he never saw or heard a dog barking on the premises. Collins testified that when he learned of this incident, he was not surprised to learn about the dogs\u2019 presence because \u201c[t]he rental agreement permitted a dog in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Fin Blackburn testified that he did not believe Collins had ever seen their dogs. Fin testified that if Collins were \u201cin the front yard walking by,\u201d he would not have a chance to see the dogs. According to Fin, \u201cthe only time he [Collins] probably would have seen the dog is if it would have stuck its head out through the curtain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">According to the deposition of Tracy Blackburn, however, Collins \u201cshould have\u201d seen their dogs whenever he visited the property, \u201cbecause, you know, you open the door, and they kind of push you and bark and stuff. Usually, I would go outside the door just to keep from having to keep fighting them at the door. They would just get all excited and jump up on the screen and stuff.\u201d Tracy Blackburn testified that about one or two years before the incident, Collins told the Blackburns \u201cthe insurance guy was coming, to let him in the backyard to look around, because the dogs, we\u2019d have to pin <em>[sic] </em>the dogs up so the guy could come in the backyard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In addition to contending he was unaware of Kemo\u2019s presence, Collins also contended he did not know of Kemo\u2019s dangerous propensities. Collins contended he could not have known about Kemo\u2019s vicious nature because \u201cthere is no evidence that the subject dog had ever displayed any vicious propensities prior to this incident.\u201d As proof that Kemo had never displayed any vicious propensities before this incident, Collins relied upon the following deposition testimony by Tracy Blackburn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201cQ Prior to the dog-biting incident involving Brian Yuzon, had any of your dogs ever bitten anyone, to your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>\u201cQ Did you ever have any complaint about either of your dogs, the Dalmatian or Kemo acting aggressively?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">\u201cA No. Well, he\u2019d run out\u2014if the door got open, he\u2019d run out and that would scare people. So yes, the people across the street, because their dog was on a leash, and it worried them. They said, \u2018Please, make sure he doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201cQ Was that ever reported to Mr. Collins or his wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201cA Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cQ Any other problems with your dogs being aggressive or reported to Mr. Collins or to his wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cA No. I didn\u2019t see that as aggressive, because I didn\u2019t feel my dog was going to hurt them, he just wanted to go play.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s Opposition to Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In opposition to the summary judgment motion, plaintiff contended that Collins had misconstrued Tracy Blackburn\u2019s above-quoted testimony. Contrary to Collins\u2019 claim that Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony showed that Kemo did not demonstrate vicious propensities, plaintiff claimed the same testimony showed exactly the opposite\u2014that Kemo had demonstrated vicious propensities. Plaintiff contended the fact that Kemo ran out and scared people showed that Kemo had a vicious nature. In addition, plaintiff claimed Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities were further established by Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony that Kemo was \u201cterritorial to where I wouldn\u2019t send somebody over to my house to feed my dog when I was gone, I would have kennel[]ed him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">As further evidence of Kemo\u2019s vicious nature, plaintiff referred to his own deposition testimony that \u201cKemo, the subject dog, was usually mean to visitors Kemo did not know.\u201d Plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">\u201cQ Okay. How about of Kimo [szc], did you have any fears about Kimo [sic] before the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cQ Okay. And how come?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">\u201cA Because he\u2019s, like, usually mean to, like, visitors he doesn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">\u201cQ He barks at them or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">\u201cA Yeah, barks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Plaintiff contended that Collins\u2019s prior knowledge of Kemo\u2019s aggressive propensities could- reasonably be inferred from Collins\u2019s request that the Blackburns \u201cpin the dogs up\u2019\u2019 before an insurance inspection. Plaintiff stated below, \u201cHere, it is clear that Mr. Collins had prior knowledge of the dog\u2019s dangerous nature. Why else would he need to warn the Blackburns first so they can \u2018pin the dogs up\u2019 before the insurance inspector came?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Citing <em>Donchin </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1832 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 192] <em>(Donchin), </em>plaintiff also contended that Collins\u2019s actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s dangerous nature could be inferred from Collins\u2019s allegedly false exculpatory denial that he knew there were dogs on the property. To show that Collins\u2019s denial was false, plaintiff relied upon Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony that Collins \u201cshould have\u201d seen the dogs pushing and barking at the door whenever Collins visited the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under <em>Donchin, </em>plaintiff contended, Collins\u2019s false denial that he knew the dogs were present constituted evidence of his prior guilty knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s Request for Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">In his opposition to the summary judgment motion, plaintiff requested a continuance of the summary judgment hearing. Plaintiff contended that his animal behavior expert, Richard H. Polsky, Ph.D., needed more time to review discovery materials and prepare his declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">\n<em>Collins\u2019s Reply in Support of Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">In reply, Collins sought to distinguish <em>Donchin, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th 1832, on the ground \u201cthat when Mr. Collins stated he had no knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the dogs at the Blackbums[\u2019], he was specifically referring to the subject dog.\u201d Collins disputed that he had made a false exculpatory denial from which his guilty knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities could be inferred. Collins emphasized that while the lease permitted the Blackburns to have a Springer spaniel on the property, he \u201cstill did not know that the Blackbum[s] had acquired the subject dog. The subject dog\u2019s owner, Fin Blackburn, states as much as in his deposition: [f] \u2018Q. When you got the [subject dog], did you tell Collins[] that you had gotten a dog? [][] A. No. (Deposition of Fin Blackburn, Page 25, Lines 13-15). [f] Furthermore, when asked if Mr. Collins knew if the Blackburns had dogs or not, Mr. Blackburn replied, T believe he probably assumed we had the springer spaniel. He didn\u2019t know the dog died, so he would have to assume we still had it.\u2019 (Deposition of Fin Blackburn, Page 21, Lines 23-25; page 22, lines 1-2). Mr. Blackburn also opined, T don\u2019t believe Gerry [Collins] has ever seen the dogs.\u2019 (Deposition of Fin Blackburn, Page 19, Line 17). [f] Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment emphasizes the fact that Mr. Collins did not know of the existence of the <em>subject dog. </em>This is not to say that Mr. Collins was not aware of the existence of dogs on the property. Mr. Collins believed that the springer spaniel dog was likely the dog on the property. He stated as much in his deposition testimony: [][] \u2018Q. At any time before Fin told you that there was a dog bite accident at 1502 Stevely, were you aware that there was a dog or dogs at 1502 Stevely that\u2019s not a springer spaniel dog? [][] A. No. [][]... [1] Q. Did you ever hear a dog barking from inside 1502 Stevely? [][] A. No, not that I remember.\u2019 (Deposition of Gerald Collins, Page 31, Lines 20-24; Page 32, Lines 5-7). [|] Thus it becomes clear that when Mr. Collins stated he had no knowledge of the dogs at the Blackbums[\u2019], he was specifically referring to the subject dog.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Summary Judgment Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">At the summary judgment hearing, the trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s request for continuance, stating the expert\u2019s declaration would not shed light on whether Collins had prior actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s presence and vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Regarding Collins\u2019s contention that he did not have actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s presence and vicious propensities, the trial court concluded that Collins had successfully shifted the burden of producing evi dence to plaintiff. The trial court stated in part: \u201cBut they have shown that Mr. Collins, by his own testimony, did not know of this dog and did not know this dog might bite. So doesn\u2019t that shift the burden over to you to prove otherwise? And if so, then that hasn\u2019t been proven by your clients.\u201d The court also remarked: \u201cPm asking is there any proof that Mr. Collins knew of this dog or this dog\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>propensities? Yes, he knew there were dogs. It was in the rental agreement. But did he know of this dog and this dog\u2019s propensities\u2014or at least as you alleged\u2014propensities?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In announcing its ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cThe court is going to grant summary judgment because the court does believe that a reasonable trier of fact would find, more likely than not, that plaintiff cannot meet the burden with regard to notice to Mr. Collins who is the owner of the property not the owner of the animals.\u201d The court\u2019s subsequent written ruling stated in part: \u201cHaving considered all of the evidence set forth in the papers submitted by the parties, and after oral argument, the Court determined that there is no triable issue as to any material fact, and that for the reasons set forth in the Motion for Summary Judgment, moving party had no liability in this matter. Specifically, the Court found that moving party did not have actual knowledge of the dangerous propensities of the dog that bit plaintiff, and therefore had no duty to prevent the harm alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In his motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment mling (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1008, subd. (a)), plaintiff submitted Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration. Plaintiff stated that Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration constituted new evidence showing that Collins knew or must have known about Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Dr. Polsky declared in part: \u201c. . . I have also concluded that Gerald Collins, through his visits to the Blackburn residence during the time Kemo resided there, as noted in the depositions of Fin Blackburn (specifically, see page 17, lines 23-25)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and Tracy Blackburn (specifically, see page 9, lines 11-18; <em>also </em>page 11, lines 17-22; also page 12, lines 2-9)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] must have known about the presence of Kemo on his property and this dog\u2019s propensities for territorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>aggressive behavior.\u201d Dr. Polsky stated that \u201c[a]dult male pit bulls, like Kemo, are often unpredictable in nature and frequently possess an inherent propensity for aggressive responding towards unfamiliar people who come near their territory.\u201d According to Dr. Polsky, \u201cthe owners appeared aware of the potential for aggression in not only Kemo but the other dog as well, by regularly confining them whenever visitors, such as children, arrived at the property.\u201d Dr. Polsky said that Kemo\u2019s barking at \u201cstrangers entering or approaching his territory\u201d was \u201creflective of a dog who could be dangerous towards unfamiliar people entering the dog\u2019s territory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Dr. Polsky inferred from the severity of plaintiff\u2019s injuries that Kemo must have previously demonstrated vicious propensities that visitors such as Collins must have noticed. Dr. Polsky stated that \u201c[t]he attack by Kemo on Brian Yuzon was so persistent and vicious in nature that it is inconceivable that this was a first-time display of territorial aggression by this dog. Only a dog who has had considerable experience at displaying aggressive behavior in the past could have attacked in such a vicious manner\u2014that is, repeated, uninhibited biting to the arm of Brian Yuzon resulting in severe injury. See pictures of injuries to Brian Yuzon\u2019s arm. Further, as noted above, considering that Kemo was an adult when the incident happened (suggesting that his habit for territorial aggression had become established and reinforced), adds credence to the belief that Kemo was a dog who possessed vicious behavioral propensities prior to the attack on Brian Yuzon. I believe these propensities would have undoubtedly been apparent to any stranger visiting the Blackburn residence, such as the landlord Gerald Collins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Dr. Polsky concluded that because Collins had visited the \u201cproperty at least on some occasions during the time Kemo resided there, he must have known of Kemo\u2019s presence and of his aggressive nature due to this dog\u2019s strong territorial proclivities. Kemo\u2019s aggressive territorial reactions towards other unfamiliar people such as Gerald Collins had to have contained elements of or have been consistent with the nature of the attack on Brian Yuzon. Thus, despite the denial of Gerald Collins and the Blackburns about Kemo\u2019s aggressive nature, for the reasons stated above, I find it inconceivable they were unaware of his aggressive nature and the potential danger he presented to people who approached or entered the property. I do not believe that Kemo\u2019s attack on Brian Yuzon was an aberrant action in a male pit bull dog with a supposedly non-aggressive temperament. It could not have been an isolated incident. I believe the incident was foreseeable to both Gerald Collins and his tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>In opposition to the motion for reconsideration, Collins objected that Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration did not constitute new evidence under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. Collins pointed out that Dr. Polsky had formulated his opinions based upon the same deposition testimony that the court had examined in determining the summary judgment motion. Collins objected to Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration, contending it was \u201cbased entirely on speculation and conjecture . . . .\u201d Contrary to Dr. Polsky\u2019s allegedly speculative contention that Kemo was confined when visitors were present because of his violent nature, Collins pointed out that Kemo may have been confined because dogs \u201care loud, they smell, they have fleas, they get in the way, or even that the Blackburns\u2019 guests might be cat lovers.\u201d Collins also noted that there was no evidence of a prior attack by any of the Blackburns\u2019 dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration. The court found that Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration failed to constitute new evidence warranting reconsideration, and even if the declaration constituted new evidence, it failed to provide a basis to change the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Plaintiff appealed from the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate only where no material issue of fact exists or where the record establishes as a matter of law that a cause of action asserted against a party cannot prevail. After examining the facts before the trial judge on a summary judgment motion, an appellate court independently determines their effect as a matter of law. <em>(Nicholson v. Lucas </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1664 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">According to section 437c, subdivision (p)(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cA defendant or cross-defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action. Once the defendant or cross-defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff or cross-complainant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. The plaintiff or cross-complainant may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment without making specific findings and identifying the evidence which supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>its ruling. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (g) [upon granting summary judgment, the court shall, by written or oral order, specify the reasons for its determination and refer to the evidence that supports its determination that no triable issues exist].) Plaintiff relies upon <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1069 [212 Cal.Rptr. 140], in which the appellate court issued a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate the denial of summary judgment, reconsider the motion, and enter an order complying with the statutory requirements by referring to the evidence showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">This case, however, is in an entirely different procedural posture. This is not a situation where the record is silent as to why the trial court denied a summary judgment motion. Here, the record shows that the trial court granted Collins\u2019s summary judgment motion after noting that Collins had established, \u201cby his own testimony, [that he] did not know of this dog and did not know this dog might bite. So doesn\u2019t that shift the burden over to you to prove otherwise? And if so, then that hasn\u2019t been proven by your clients.\u201d The court also remarked: \u201cI\u2019m asking is there any proof that Mr. Collins knew of this dog or this dog\u2019s propensities? Yes, he knew there were dogs. It was in the rental agreement. But did he know of this dog and this dog\u2019s propensities\u2014or at least as you alleged\u2014propensities?\u201d We believe the trial court sufficiently identified the evidence it was relying upon to comply with the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Plaintiff contends the trial court impermissibly weighed conflicting evidence in granting the summary judgment motion. In support of this contention, plaintiff refers to the trial court\u2019s statement: \u201cThe court is going to grant summary judgment because the court does believe that a rea sonabletrier of fact would find, more likely than not, that plaintiff cannot meet the burden with regard to notice to Mr. Collins who is the owner of the property not the owner of the animals.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">It is not entirely clear whether the trial court impermissibly weighed the evidence and granted summary judgment for Collins because it found that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>trier of fact would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d conclude that Collins did not have actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities. In any event, the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d language may have come from language found in <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856-857 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493]. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As pointed out by Division Five in <em>Kids\u2019 Universe v. In2Labs </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 870 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 158], certain passages in <em>Aguilar </em>\u201ccan be read to infer that, at the summary judgment stage, if there are equally conflicting inferences to be drawn from the evidence, the moving defendant is entitled to the benefit of that conflict and the motion must be granted. If so, this language would conflict with that recited elsewhere in <em>Aguilar </em>where the Supreme Court held that if there is a conflict in the inferences such that a triable issue exists, the summary judgment motion must be denied. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 </em>Cal.4th at p. 856.)\u201d <em>(Kids\u2019 Universe v. In2Labs, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Division Five concluded that <em>Aguilar </em>did not create a new summary judgment standard which requires the denial of the motion in all cases where there are equally conflicting inferences to be drawn from the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At least one appellate court, however, apparently has assumed that Aguilar's discussion of competing inferences would apply to a fraudulent conveyance cause of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We need not decide whether <em>Aguilar </em>rewrote the summary judgment standard for all cases. As discussed below, we have independently examined the record and determined that even under the \u201cold\u201d standard, Collins is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we need not consider whether the trial court applied an incorrect standard, because we review the trial court\u2019s ruling independently. Given that \u201c \u2018a summary judgment motion raises only ques tions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, we independently review them on appeal, applying the same three-step analysis required of the trial court.\u2019 <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. v. Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203] . . . .)

United Grocers, Ltd. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 429, 442 [186 Cal.Rptr. 357] . . . .)\u201d <em>(Kim </em>v. <em>Sumitomo Bank </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 974, 978-979 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 834].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">As stated in <em>Uccello </em>v. <em>Laudenslayer, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 504, \u201ca duty of care may not be imposed on a landlord without proof that he knew of the dog and its dangerous propensities. Because the harboring of pets is such an important part of our way of life and because the exclusive possession of rented premises normally is vested in the tenant, we believe that <em>actual </em>knowledge and not mere constructive knowledge is required. For this reason we hold that a landlord is under no duty to inspect the premises for the purpose of discovering the existence of a tenant\u2019s dangerous animal; only when the landlord has actual knowledge of the animal, coupled with the right to have it removed from the premises, does a duty of care arise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 514, fn. omitted.) The court in <em>Uccello </em>further stated; \u201cWe point out, however, that a defendant\u2019s actual knowledge may be shown, not only by direct evidence, but also by circumstantial evidence. Hence, his denial of such knowledge will not, per se, prevent liability. [Citations.] However, actual knowledge can be inferred from the circumstances only if, in the light of the evidence, such inference is not based on speculation or conjecture. Only where the circumstances are such that the defendant \u2018must have known\u2019 and not \u2018should have known\u2019 will an inference of actual knowledge be permitted. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 514, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Plaintiff states that \u201c[i]f [Collins] did not know that the subject dog even existed, then he could not have known that the subject dog was dangerous. In addition, if the subject dog was not dangerous, then [Collins] could not have known that the dog was dangerous. In either case, [Collins] will be entitled to a grant of summary judgment, [f] However, if both of the contentions are proven to be in dispute or that there was no prima facie showing of nonexistence of a triable issue, then the grant of summary judgment must be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">According to Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony, (1) Collins should have seen the dogs pushing, barking, and jumping on the screen door, and (2) Collins must have known of the dogs\u2019 presence because he had asked that they be confined during the insurance inspection. Given that the Blackburns had only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>one dog until they acquired Kemo, plaintiff contends it is reasonable to infer from Collins\u2019s request that the \u201cdogs\u201d be confined that \u201cCollins knew of the existence of <em>more than </em>one dog at the Blackburn\u2019s residence, which would include Kemo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We agree that Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony would support a reasonable infer ence that Collins was aware that dogs were present on the property. As Collins pointed out below, however, while he was aware that the lease permitted dogs on the property, he was not specifically aware of Kemo\u2019s presence on the property. Moreover, Collins could not have known of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities given the lack of any prior incidents involving Kemo or the other dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The canine behavior that Collins observed, according to Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony, was limited to pushing, barking, and jumping at the screen door. As one court put it, \u201csuch activities are quite common for a dog. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Nava v. McMillan </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 262, 265-266 [176 Cal.Rptr. 473].) \u201c[E]ven if the dogs had been barking or jumping against the fence behind which they were kept, those are harmless activities ordinarily associated with, and expected from, dogs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 267.) Pushing, barking, and jumping at the screen door would not have given Collins actual notice of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">There is no evidence that the other canine behaviors described by Tracy Blackburn\u2014that Kemo ran out and scared the neighbors whose dog was on a leash\u2014were either observed by Collins or reported to him before this incident. Tracy Blackburn testified that she did not view these behaviors as signs of aggression, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t feel my dog was going to hurt them, he just wanted to play.\u201d She also testified that no reports were ever made to Collins of any problems with the dogs being aggressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Even if we were to assume that Collins knew that Kemo ran through open doors and scared the neighbors, his actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities may not be inferred unless the circumstances were such that he must have known, and not just should have known, of the dog\u2019s vicious nature. <em>(Uccello </em>v. <em>Laudenslayer, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 514.) The sorts of behaviors described in the record were normal dog behaviors and were not so alarming that Collins must have known (had he been aware of the behaviors) of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">We distinguish <em>Donchin, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th 1832, in which the tenant\u2019s dogs displayed vicious propensities that would have been apparent to anyone, including the landlord, who regularly visited the property. In <em>Donchin, </em>a neighbor attested that \u201cthe dogs frequently ran loose around the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>neighborhood, lunging towards both people and other dogs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1836.) In addition, a UPS employee described the behavior of the dogs as so \u201cthreatening . . . toward him\u201d that he would \u201ctoss the packages over the fence into the yard because he feared the two rottweilers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The UPS employee stated that \u201che saw the rottweilers once a week, and every time he entered their area they would \u2018growl and show their teeth, ram the wood fence, attempt to jump the fence and appeared extremely ferocious.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In this case, on the other hand, there is no evidence that Kemo ever lunged at people or other dogs before this incident, or that he ever growled, bared his teeth, rammed a fence (or other barrier), or appeared extremely (or even slightly) ferocious. There is also no evidence that Kemo was kept in the front yard, where he could be seen exhibiting threatening behavior toward outsiders such as was observed by the UPS employee in <em>Donchin, </em>who was so afraid that he tossed the packages over the fence. On the contrary, in this case the record supports the inference that Kemo was kept inside the house, away from view of those walking by the home. According to Fin Blackburn, if Collins were \u201cin the front yard walking by,\u201d he would not have had a chance to see the dogs. Fin stated that \u201cthe only time he [Collins] probably would have seen the dog is if it would have stuck its head out through the curtain.\u201d Similarly, Tracy Blackburn testified that she would go outside on the porch to talk to Collins \u201cjust to keep from having to keep fighting [the dogs] at the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In <em>Donchin, </em>the landlord regularly visited the property. (34 Cal.App.4th at p. 1836.) Accordingly, it was reasonable to infer in <em>Donchin </em>that the landlord must have seen the dogs behaving aggressively, in the same manner as was described by the UPS employee and neighbor. In this case, on the other hand, Collins visited the property infrequently and Kemo was not kept outside where his vicious propensities could be observed. We therefore distinguish <em>Donchin, </em>where the landlord\u2019s false exculpatory denials of any knowledge of the vicious dogs\u2019 existence and of having given permission for the dogs to be present on the property, were deemed to constitute evidence of his consciousness of liability. <em>(Donchin, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1840-1844.) Moreover, in this case, Collins never denied having given permission for the dogs to be present. A fair reading of Collins\u2019s testimony shows that he knew there were dogs on the property, but not that Kemo, or any other particular dog, was on the property. While portions of Collins\u2019s deposition may be taken as a denial of any knowledge that dogs were present, he did not make the same sort of denial as the landlord in <em>Donchin. </em>Unlike the landlord in <em>Donchin, </em>Collins also testified that he did not know what specific dogs were present but that he knew the lease permitted dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Given the absence of any evidence of prior vicious propensities in this case, Collins\u2019 request to have the dogs confined while the insurance-inspector looked in the backyard does not support a reasonable inference that Collins had actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities. In the absence of any evidence that Collins knew or must have known Kemo was dangerous, it would be purely speculative to infer that his request to confine the dogs was based on Ms knowledge that Kemo was dangerous. \u201cAn issue of fact can only be created by a conflict of evidence. It is not created by \u2018speculation, conjecture, imagination or guess work.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, an issue of fact is not raised by \u2018cryptic, broadly phrased, and conclusory assertions\u2019 [citation], or mere possibilities [citation].\u201d <em>(Sinai Memorial Chapel v. Dudler </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 190, 196-197 [282 Cal.Rptr. 263].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence in this case fails to support an inference that Collins had actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">. IV</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Plaintiff contends that because Collins failed to meet Ms burden of producing evidence to show that Kemo had not previously displayed vicious propensities, the burden of producing evidence never shifted to plaintiff. According to plaintiff, Tracy Blackburn\u2019s testimony failed to support Collins\u2019s contention that Kemo had not previously displayed vicious propensities. Tracy\u2019s testimony, plaintiff contends, was \u201cat best ambiguous\u201d because after initially denying that she received complaints about the dogs\u2019 aggressive behavior, she then qualified her answer: \u201cNo. Well, he\u2019d run out\u2014if the door got open, he\u2019d run out and that would scare people. So yes, the people across the street, because their dog was on a leash, and it worried them. They said, \u2018Please, make sure he doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The fact that Kemo ran out the door and scared the neighbors whose dog was on a leash does not, as a matter of law, support an inference that Kemo was a dangerous dog. If that were the case, then all dogs would be deemed dangerous, as a matter of law, and no reasonable landlord would ever permit dogs on rental property for fear of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We conclude Collins\u2019s evidence that Kemo had not previously displayed vicious propensities was sufficient to shift to plaintiff the burden of producing admissible evidence to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Plaintiff contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for continuance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h) provides: \u201cIf it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, then be presented, the court shall deny the motion, or order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or may make any other order as may be just. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c \u2018Generally, power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the court, and there is no right to a continuance as a matter of law. [Citation.] However, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c mandates a continuance of a summary judgment hearing upon a good faith showing by affidavit that a continuance is needed to obtain facts essential to justify opposition to the motion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Aguimatang v. California State Lottery </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 769, 803-804 [286 Cal.Rptr. 57].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In this case, plaintiff sought a continuance to obtain Dr. Polsky\u2019s expert declaration regarding Collins\u2019s actual knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities. While the subject matter (Collins\u2019s knowledge of Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities) was essential to plaintiff\u2019s opposition to the summary judgment motion, the trial court was ultimately proven correct in concluding Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration has no material relevance regarding that issue. As we explain below, Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration, when reviewed by the trial court with regard to the motion for reconsideration, failed to create a triable issue of material fact. Accordingly, there was no error in denying the motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that (1) Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration failed to constitute new evidence warranting reconsideration, and (2) even if the declaration constituted new evidence, it failed to provide a basis to change the court\u2019s ruling. Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in making both determinations. Given that the court actually considered the declaration, we need not resolve the first issue. In order to establish prejudicial error, plaintiff must show that the declaration was sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance upon <em>Donchin, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th 1832, is misplaced. Plaintiff contends that because Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration was relied upon in <em>Donchin </em>to create a triable issue of material fact regarding the landlord\u2019s actual knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious nature, Dr. Polsky\u2019s declara tion was also sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration was not the main evidence relied upon in <em>Donchin. Donchin </em>was essentially a false exculpatory denial case where, due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>unique circumstances of that case, the landlord\u2019s false exculpatory statement was evidence of his consciousness of guilt. <em>(Donchin, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1840-1844.) The appellate court specifically stated that the inference of guilty knowledge derived from the landlord\u2019s false exculpatory statement was the \u201cmore persuasive\u201d evidence in the case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1840.) Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration, like the neighbor\u2019s and UPS employee\u2019s declarations, merely \u201cbolstered\u201d the inference of guilty knowledge derived from the false exculpatory statement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1843.) In addition, the Rottweilers\u2019 vicious propensities in <em>Donchin, </em>unlike in this case, were on regular display for all to see in the front yard of the home. Here, on the other hand, there is no evidence that Kemo was kept in front of the house or that he displayed the same or similar sorts of aggressive behaviors that were present in the <em>Donchin </em>case. While it may have been reasonable for Dr. Polsky to infer in <em>Donchin </em>that the landlord must have seen the Rottweilers\u2019 vicious propensities when he regularly visited the property, due to the very different facts of this case, it was entirely speculative for Dr. Polsky to infer that Collins must have seen Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities when he visited the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Dr. Polsky\u2019s statement that adult male pit bulls \u201care often unpredictable in nature and frequently possess an inherent propensity for aggressive responding towards unfamiliar people who come near their territory\u201d has no possible relevance given the absence of any evidence that Collins knew or must have known that Kemo was an adult male pit bull. The question is not whether Collins should have known or should have determined that Kemo was an aggressive adult male pit bull, but whether Collins must have known or had actual knowledge of that fact. <em>(Uccello v. Laudenslayer, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.3d at p. 507.) Moreover, just as it is improper to take judicial notice that all German shepherds are dangerous <em>(Lundy v. California Realty </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 813, 822 [216 Cal.Rptr. 575]), it would be improper to take judicial notice that all adult male pit bulls are dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Dr. Polsky\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he attack by Kemo on Brian Yuzon was so persistent and vicious in nature that it is inconceivable that this was a first-time display of territorial aggression by this dog\u201d is of no assistance to plaintiff because it failed to shed any light on what Collins knew or must have known about Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Given that Dr. Polsky\u2019s declaration failed to create a triable issue, of material fact regarding what Collins knew or must have known about Kemo\u2019s vicious propensities, plaintiff was not entitled to reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">We affirm the summary judgment for defendant Collins, who is awarded his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Spencer, P.

You know, I never thought they would bite a person. The gardeners, we live along the riverbed and there\u2019s gardeners along the back wall. And the one dog would bark at them, and Kemo was territorial to where I wouldn\u2019t send somebody over to my house to feed my dog when I was gone, I would have kennel[]ed him. Because when nobody was there, I just couldn\u2019t be sure, because he was territorial about his property, bark and stuff. But I never thought he\u2019d bite a kid or a person as long as we were there. But if he was alone, I didn\u2019t know how he would act.

We lose track of time, but he\u2019s done some painting across the street and different things. Sometimes we would just talk, because he came over, we pay the rent, then I would go out, because of the dogs, and go out on the front porch and talk to him and stuff.

In so doing, it does not decide on any finding of its own, but simply decides what finding such a trier of fact could make for itself. (Cf. <em>Kidron </em>v. <em>Movie Acquisition Corp. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1571, 1580-1581 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 752] [motion for nonsuit]; <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 126, 128 [36 Cal.Rptr. 430] [same].)\u201d <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Supreme Court further explained: \u201cThus, if the court determines that any evidence or inference presented or drawn by the plaintiff indeed shows or implies unlawful conspiracy <em>more likely than </em>permissible competition, it must then deny the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, even in the face of contradictory evidence or inference presented or drawn by the defendants, because a reasonable trier of fact could find for the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the unlawful-conspiracy issue is triable\u2014that is, it must be submitted to a trier of fact for determination in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendants, and may not be taken from the trier of fact and resolved by the court itself in the defendants\u2019 favor and against the plaintiff, <em>m </em>But if the court determines that all of the evidence presented by the plaintiff, and all of the inferences drawn therefrom, show and imply unlawful conspiracy <em>only as likely as </em>permissible competition <em>or even less likely, </em>it must then grant defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, even apart from any evidence presented by the defendants or any inferences drawn therefrom, because a reasonable trier of fact could not find for the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the unlawful-conspiracy issue is not triable\u2014that is, it may not be submitted to a trier of fact for determination in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendants, but must be taken from the trier of fact and resolved by the court itself in the defendants\u2019 favor and against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Aguilar v.

[Citations.] The language in <em>Aguilar </em>cited in the immediately preceding paragraph concerning illegal conspiracy versus legal competition does not retreat from this black letter statement of California law that equally conflicting evidence typically requires the denial of a summary judgment motion. As can be noted, the Supreme Court was discussing a limited rule concerning evidence in \u2018equipoise\u2019 on the issue of permissible competition versus an unlawful conspiracy in the antitrust context. <em>(Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 857, fn. 27.) Under both state and federal antitrust law, ambiguous evidence or inferences showing conduct that is equally consistent with permissible competition as it is with illegal conspiracy is insufficient to meet a plaintiff\u2019s burden on summary judgment or at trial; such evidence would not allow a trier of fact to find an unlawful conspiracy more likely than not. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 846-847, 851-852.)\u201d <em>(Kids\u2019 Universe </em>v. <em>In2Labs, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 881.) Division Five concluded that <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>discussion of equally competing inferences was limited to the context of antitrust conspiracy cases: \u201cThe cited language concerning antitrust conspiracy evidence in equipoise does not hold that if inferences are in conflict in other contexts, summary judgment is now appropriate given the 1992 and 1993 amendments to section 437c.
