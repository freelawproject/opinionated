California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Garcia has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. Counsel\u2019s separate motion for leave to withdraw because of his possible appointment as a United States Magistrate Judge is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
