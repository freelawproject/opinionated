No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">On appeal, Collier challenges the district court\u2019s admission of certain evidence. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 946 (11th Cir.2006). We will reverse an evidentiary ruling only if it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; that is, \u201cwhere an error had no substantial influence on the outcome, and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict, reversal is not warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d 1489, 1493 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Collier first challenges the testimony of a police officer that, shortly after Collier was arrested, a woman approached the officer and told the officer that she was the person who called 911. Collier contends that this statement was inadmissible hearsay and created the prejudicial inference that the police had arrested the correct man because the caller did not say otherwise. The statement also allowed the government to elicit testimony that the caller seemed nervous, which supported its contention that Collier was a dangerous and threatening person.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">Here, sufficient evidence \u2014 unaffected by the caller\u2019s statement \u2014 -existed to sustain Collier\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This evidence included that (1) someone called 911 to report that a black boy wearing a white shirt with red and white pants and a black headband had a gun in his pocket and might shoot someone in a convenience store; (2) police officers approaching the store observed a black man wearing a white shirt and red and white shorts among a crowd of people; (3) the man, later identified as Collier, broke away from the crowd and started running when he saw the police; (4) officers followed Collier until he hid behind a concrete pillar; (5) after the officers issued many verbal commands, Collier came out with his hands up; (6) an officer discovered a firearm \u2014 that contained one bullet in the chamber \u2014 where Collier was arrested; and (7) Collier later told the officers that the only reason he did not kill one of the officers was because he had only one bullet; and he knew that if he shot one of the officers, then the other officer would kill him. So, on these facts, even accepting Collier\u2019s contentions about inadmissible evidence as true, we cannot say that the admission of the hearsay statement and accompanying inference constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Collier also argues that the district court should not have allowed testimony about a separate alleged threat \u2014 that Collier told the officers he would remember them and kill them with an AK47 he had in his house \u2014 that Collier made to the arresting officers after he was taken to the county jail. Collier contends that this threat bore no relevance to the firearm possession with which he was charged and that admission of the threat was unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">Here, on cross-examination of one of the arresting officers, Collier inquired about the contents of the police reports, including whether the reports contained the threat (about the gun containing only one bullet) that Collier made to officers when he was arrested or that Collier had fled on foot. At one point, Collier\u2019s counsel asserted \u201c[tjhere is no indication of any threats in the report?\u201d Then, on redirect examination, the government asked about what threats the reports did contain; and the officer then testified about Collier\u2019s threat to kill them with an AK47.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-16\">We see no error in the district court\u2019s admission of this evidence upon that court\u2019s conclusion that Collier opened the door to the evidence. While extrinsic evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to prove a defendant\u2019s character to show conduct in conformity therewith, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Evid. 404(b), \u201cinadmissible extrinsic evidence is admissible on redirect [examination] as rebuttal evidence, when defense counsel has opened the door to such evidence during cross-examination,\u201d <em>see United States v. West, </em>898 F.2d 1493, 1500 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">And defense counsel opened the door here. On appeal, Collier contends that his line of questioning was about only the \u201cone bullet\u201d statement and, thus, permissible impeachment because this statement was not in the police reports. But Collier\u2019s counsel questioned the officer about many omissions and inaccuracies in the police reports, including asserting that the report contained no indication of \u201cany threats.\u201d Thus, Collier opened the door for the officer to testify on redirect examination about the threats the reports did contain. The district court abused no discretion in admitting the testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-13\">. If the officer\u2019s testimony about the 911 caller\u2019s out-of-court statement was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that is, that she was the person who called 911), then the statement was seemingly inadmissible hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b901-20\">. We also note that the inference that the officers arrested the correct man is not appar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>ent from the statement about the 911 call. The caller did not identify Collier as the suspect, but simply identified herself as the person who called 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AnG6\">. We also note that sufficient evidence existed, as noted above, to sustain Collier's conviction independent of the admitted threat. <em>See Hawkins, </em>905 F.2d at 1493.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
