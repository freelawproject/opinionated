Hickling appeals her 30-month sentence imposed for wire fraud. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-27\">Hickling was charged with two counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, and one count of aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, in connection with a mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>fraud scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single count of wire fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The probation officer calculated the sentencing range as follows: Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l), the base offense level was 7. There was a 6-level increase based on the amount of loss, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D), and a 2-level increase because the offense involved sophisticated means, \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). According to the record, Hickling used multiple false documents to carry out the scheme and moved to another city to avoid detection. With a 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the total offense level was 13. The probation officer determined Hickling\u2019s criminal history category to be III and noted that Hickling had pleaded guilty to state charges in connection with the mortgage fraud scheme and had been sentenced to three years\u2019 confinement. The probation officer\u2019s calculations yielded a guideline range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. The probation officer also noted that an upward departure may be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Hickling objected to the enhancement for sophisticated means and to any suggestion that her conduct warranted an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">At sentencing, Hickling requested the court adjust her sentence based on time served for the state court conviction that arose from the same scheme. The court overruled Hickling\u2019s sentencing objections and denied her request to adjust her sentence. The court then stated that, after considering the parties\u2019 arguments, the presentence investigation report, and the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), it would depart upward in the criminal history category, to category IV, which raised the guideline range to 24 to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Hickling to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, explaining that the egregious circumstances of the scheme warranted the departure and that the departure was one contemplated by the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">On appeal, Hickling argues that the district court erred by (1) departing upward from the sentencing guideline range and (2) denying her request to adjust her sentence for time that she served under a state court sentence for conduct related to the instant offense. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">I. Upward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">Hickling argues that the district court erred by departing upward because the court based the departure on conduct already contemplated by the guideline range. Hickling further argues that her case is not \u201coutside the heartland of that already considered by the Sentencing Commission in developing the Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of any part of the guidelines ... but we review the extent of a departure only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2006). We have previously vacated a defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded for re-sentencing where the district court\u2019s lack of findings, either explicit or implicit, precluded meaningful appellate review. <em>United States v. Reid, </em>139 F.3d 1367, 1368 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">\u201cA sentencing court may depart from the applicable criminal history category if the court determines from reliable information that the defendant\u2019s criminal history is not adequately represented and that it is likely that the defendant will commit future crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Huang, </em>977 F.2d 540, 543 (11th Cir.1992). Before the court may depart in this manner, it must state on the record how the defendant\u2019s criminal history compared with others classified in the criminal history category the district court intends to apply. <em>Id. </em>at 543-44. The failure to provide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>explanation requires remand for resen-tencing. <em>Id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Here, both parties address the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.19) as the basis for the court\u2019s upward departure. A review of the record confirms, however, that the district court actually increased Hickling\u2019s criminal history category from III to IV (rather than her offense level under \u00a7 2B1.1) when it departed upward. But when the court increased Hickling\u2019s criminal history category, it did not make any findings as to whether her criminal history was not adequately represented or if it was likely that she would commit future crimes. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s lack of findings preclude meaningful appellate review, and we vacate and remand for re-sentencing in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">II. Adjustment for time served under state sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Hickling argues that the district court erred by refusing to adjust her present federal sentence to reflect the time she had already served under a state court sentence for related conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">We review the imposition of a consecutive sentence for an abuse-of-discretion. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346 (11th Cir.2009). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b), the district court may impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence, provided that the court has considered the factors set forth under \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b); <em>see also Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1346-47. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations and alterations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Under \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l), a court shall adjust a federal sentence for a term of imprisonment already served if: (1) \u201ca term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)\u201d; (2) the other offense \u201cwas the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments)\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in fashioning Hickling\u2019s present sentence consecutive to her undischarged state sentence. Contrary to Hickling\u2019s assertions, the district court had the discretion to impose a sentence either consecutively or concurrently to an undischarged state sentence. Based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, however, the court reasonably determined that the sentence should run consecutively to Hickling\u2019s undischarged state sentence. Hickling has not met her burden, in light of the record and the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to show that the court abused its discretion in fashioning her present sentence consecutive to her undischarged state sentence. Accordingly, we affirm this aspect of the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part, and vacated and remanded in part, for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-8\">. These factors include: (1) the applicable Guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (6) protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (7) the kinds of sentences available. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
