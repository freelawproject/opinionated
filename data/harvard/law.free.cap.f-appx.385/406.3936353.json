McGrew, Louisiana state prisoner #413135, proceeding pro se, moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in an appeal of the district court\u2019s interlocutory orders denying his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. McGrew\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AGH\">This court lacks jurisdiction over the denial of McGrew\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order. <em>See Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999). McGrew has identified no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting a reversal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>See White v. Carlucci, </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">McGrew has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The dismissal of this appeal counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). McGrew is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aqq\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
