Ledet, Jr., pleaded guilty to and was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He appeals the denial of his motion to suppress the firearm, which fell from his pants while being patted down after a Terry<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>-type stop. He argues that the arresting officer\u2019s detention implicated the Fourth Amendment and therefore his actions had to be justified at their inception by a reasonable suspicion that Ledet was engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, this court reviews questions of law de novo and accepts the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>166 F.3d 728, 731 (5th Cir.1999) (en banc). The legality of police investigatory stops is tested in two parts. <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). First, the court \u201cex-amin\u00e9is] whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception,\u201d and then the court \u201cinquire[s] whether the officer\u2019s subsequent actions were reasonably related in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>scope to the circumstances that justified the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>\u201c[p]olice officers may briefly detain individuals on the street, even though there is no probable cause to arrest them, if they have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>United States v. Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d 838, 840 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). \u201cThe Fourth Amendment requires only some minimum level of objective justification for the officers\u2019 actions \u2014 but more than a hunch\u2014 measured in light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u201cReasonable suspicion must be supported by particular and articulable facts, which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant an intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The district court\u2019s determination of whether the facts provided reasonable suspicion is a conclusion of law reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir.2010). In evaluating the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s actions, \u201c \u2018due weight\u2019 must be given to the facts and inferences viewed \u2018in light of [the officer\u2019s] experience.\u2019\u201d <em>Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d at 841 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Further, the facts must be judged against an objective standard, such that the court asks \u201cwould the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate?\u201d <em>United States v. Rideau, </em>969 F.2d 1572, 1574 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868) (internal quotation marks omitted). Factors germane to a reasonable suspicion analysis include: whether the area where the stop occurred was a high crime area or one \u201cof expected criminal activity,\u201d <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); whether the individual engaged in \u201cunprovoked flight upon noticing the police,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and whether the individual looked nervous or made furtive gestures or suspicious movements. <em>United States v. Watson, </em>953 F.2d 895, 897 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The initial action in the instant case was Officer Richards\u2019s approaching Ledet\u2019s vehicle, shining a light inside of it, and asking Ledet to roll down his window. Contrary to Ledet\u2019s assertions, Officer Richards\u2019s testimony established that the area where Ledet was parked was known to be a high crime area, particularly with regard to burglary of vehicles. Further, the manner in which Ledet\u2019s car was parked was suspicious. The license plate was not visible, the car was parked in a dimly lit area, and, although the parking lights were on, no one could be seen in the car. These particular and articulable facts, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted Officer Richards\u2019s \u201cintrusion,\u201d i.e. the shining of the spotlight into the car and asking Ledet to roll down the window. <em>See Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The court\u2019s inquiry asks whether Officer Richards\u2019s subsequent actions \u2014 ordering Ledet out of the car and patting him down \u2014 were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 506. \u201c[T]he policeman making a reasonable investigatory stop should not be denied the opportunity to protect himself from attack by a hostile suspect.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). \u201cWhen an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,\u201d he may conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 24, 88 S.Ct. 1868. \u201cAn officer need not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>certain that an individual is armed; the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man could believe, based on \u2018specific and articu-lable facts,\u2019 that his safety or that of others is in danger.\u201d <em>Michelletti, </em>13 F.3d at 840-41.</p>\n<p id=\"AX4X\">Officer Richards testified that once he could see inside the car, it appeared to him that Ledet was concealing something. Therefore, Officer Richards\u2019s order that Ledet exit the car and his subsequent pat down were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop. The district court did not err when it denied Ledet\u2019s motion to suppress the firearm that dropped from his pants during that pat down.</p>\n<p id=\"An-\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
