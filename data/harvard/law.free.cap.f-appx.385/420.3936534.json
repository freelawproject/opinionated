He challenges the district court\u2019s finding of the amount of marijuana attributable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Montoya-Rubio attempted to enter the United States from Mexico in a vehicle containing 13.32 kilograms of marijuana hidden in a compartment under the backseat. After authorities discovered this marijuana, Montoya-Rubio admitted that he agreed, in exchange for $1,000, to transport the marijuana across the border and to deliver it to a residence in Socorro, Texas. He further admitted that, on two occasions during the preceding three weeks, he had successfully used the same vehicle to transport an unknown quantity of marijuana from Mexico to the same residence in Socorro and was paid $1,000 on each occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">The district court found that Montoya-Rubio\u2019s initial two deliveries each involved a quantity of marijuana that was equivalent to the 13.32 kilograms he attempted to import on February 18, 2009. Accordingly, it found that he was responsible for 39.96 kilograms of marijuana, a quantity that resulted in the assessment of a base offense level of 18. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (e)(ll) (Nov.2008). Montoya-Rubio contends that the district court erred in estimating the amount of marijuana involved in his two prior deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">In determining a defendant\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, a district court may consider as part of the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct any quantities of drugs that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Wall, </em>180 F.3d 641, 644 (5th Cir.1999); see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2); \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 12. The district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant for purposes of \u00a7 2D1.1 is a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">A district court may estimate the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant; its finding need not be limited to the actual quantities of drugs seized. <em>United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 876 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246. A district court may extrapolate drug estimates \u201cfrom any information that has a sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probably accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 267 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The finding of the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant is made under the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Montoya-Rubio admitted that he used the same vehicle on three occasions during a three-week period to transport marijuana, the arranged payment for each occasion was $1,000, and he was to deliver the marijuana to the same residence on each occasion. The fact that each of Montoya-Rubio\u2019s trips involved the same fee for transporting marijuana to the same destination using the same hidden compartment of a vehicle suggests that he performed the same service in each trip. In light of the similar circumstances of the three instances, the district court did not clearly err in estimating that Montoya-Rubio\u2019s initial two deliveries each involved a quantity of marijuana that was equivalent to the quantity seized in his third trip. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246; <em>Medina, </em>161 F.3d at 876-77; <em>United States v. Sapien, </em>265 Fed.Appx. 312, 313 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
