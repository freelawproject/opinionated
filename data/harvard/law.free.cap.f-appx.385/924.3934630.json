The Government asserts Belachew has waived any challenge to the denial of asylum because she does not challenge the BIA\u2019s affir-mance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. After review, we deny Belachew\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-25\">Belachew asserts the IJ denied her right to counsel by waiting until the asylum hearing to grant her counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. She contends she was forced to represent herself <em>pro se, </em>was not given an adequate opportunity to present her case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>was subjected to abusive questioning by the Government and the IJ, did not give an opening or closing statement, and lacked an advocate to effectively present her case. She asserts the IJ erred by not giving her a continuance in order to find counsel to represent her once her original counsel withdrew because she \u201chad a good cause for a continuance.\u201d She lastly argues \u201cher case was prejudiced to the extent that it likely changed the outcome of her case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">\u201cWe review constitutional challenges <em>de novo.\u201d Lonyem v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). The Fifth Amendment entitles petitioners in removal proceedings to due process of law. <em>Frech v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe right to counsel in the immigration context is an integral part of the procedural due process to which the alien is entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cTo prevail on a procedural due process challenge, the petitioner must show that [she] was substantially prejudiced by the violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish a due process violation from the denial of the right to counsel at a deportation proceeding, an alien must establish that the \u201cpresence of counsel might have affected the outcome.\u201d <em>Cobourne v. I.N.S., </em>779 F.2d 1564, 1566 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also Ibrahim v. I.N.S., </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Belachew has failed to demonstrate her due process rights were violated because she has not demonstrated the absence of counsel affected the outcome of her case. Although Belachew argues she was not given the opportunity to present her case because she was <em>pro se, </em>she does not state what evidence she would have presented or how her testimony would have been different had she been represented by counsel. Rather, she generally contends \u201cher case was prejudiced to the extent that it likely changed the outcome of her case,\u201d without explaining how proceeding with counsel would have changed the outcome of her case. Because Belachew has not established the presence of counsel might have affected the outcome of her case, she has not established her due process rights were violated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Belachew next contends the IJ erred by finding she had not suffered past persecution, there was not a nexus between her alleged persecution and her political opinion, and she did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, and we review the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">The BIA did not address the IJ\u2019s findings that Belachew did not demonstrate that she suffered past persecution, that there was not a nexus between her alleged persecution and her political opinion, and that she did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution, but rather, dismissed Belachew\u2019s application based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>ing. Thus, we will not consider Bela-chew\u2019s contentions. As the Government correctly asserts, Belachew does not offer any argument regarding the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding and has waived any challenge to the credibility finding. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Accordingly, we deny Belachew\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-17\">. The BIA further dismissed Belachew\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Belachew does not challenge the BIA's dismissal of her withholding of removal and CAT relief claims on appeal, however, and she has abandoned those claims. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting when an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue that issue is abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. To the extent Belachew argues the IJ erred in not granting her a continuance, we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1362 (11th Cir.2006). ''[A]n immigration judge\u2019s decision denying [a] motion for continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused [her] actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of [her] case.\u201d <em>Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). Belachew's argument fails because she did not request a continuance before the IJ. Because Belachew did not request a continuance, she did not show good cause for the IJ to grant her a continuance. Accordingly, the IJ did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
