He appeals from that sentence and argues that the district court erred by applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) for brandishing a dangerous weapon. He contends that there was no evidence that he personally brandished a weapon and that the adjustment cannot be applied through relevant conduct because the district court failed to make a separate finding as to the scope of his agreement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">By adopting the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the district court made implicit findings based on the PSR\u2019s factual findings. <em>See United States v. Carreon, </em>11 F.3d 1225, 1231 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, the district court did not err by applying \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5)(B) to Medina\u2019s sentence on the basis of relevant conduct. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>520 F.3d 414, 422 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
