In his brief, he argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of Vincent Johnson regarding Douglas\u2019s prior cocaine sales because the testimony constituted evidence of prior bad acts inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), rather than evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>tending to establish his involvement in the charged conspiracy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">\u201cThe district court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb the court\u2019s judgment absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. McLean, </em>138 F.3d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1998). Rule 404(b) makes evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d inadmissible \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Such \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is not inadmissible, however, when it establishes \u201c(1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2)[is] necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3)[is] inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>McLean, </em>138 F.3d at 1403. \u201cEvidence, not part of the crime charged but pertaining to the chain of events explaining the context ... of the crime, is properly admitted if linked in time and circumstances with the charged crime, or forms an integral and natural part of an account of the crime, or is necessary to complete the story of the crime for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1403-04 (holding evidence of the operation of, and defendant\u2019s involvement in, a drug organization was properly admitted because it explained why the defendant was targeted in the investigation, explained his relationship with and established the credibility of a confidential informant, and explained the alleged goal of the conspiracy, and thus, was inextricably intertwined with the evidence of the charged offense of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine); <em>United States v. Ramsdale, </em>61 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.1995) (holding evidence of possession of the drug the defendant was charged with conspiring to manufacture, during the time period alleged in the indictment, and under circumstances suggesting drug trafficking, was not extrinsic evidence under Rule 404(b) since it was inextricably intertwined with evidence of the charged offense, and was necessary to complete the story of the defendant\u2019s role in the charged offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Some of the overt acts established by Johnson\u2019s testimony overlapped with the period of Douglas\u2019s involvement in the charged conspiracy; to that extent, the testimony depicting those acts was properly before the jury. <em>See Campa, </em>529 F.3d at 1002. To the extent some of the acts occurred outside the period of Douglas\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, the testimony depicting them was admissible since it was necessary to establish Douglas\u2019s role in the charged conspiracy, his relationship with Johnson, Johnson\u2019s credibility, and because it was closely linked in time and circumstances to the charged conspiracy. <em>See McLean, </em>138 F.3d at 1403-04; <em>Ramsdale, </em>61 F.3d at 830. Douglas\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the challenged testimony accordingly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
