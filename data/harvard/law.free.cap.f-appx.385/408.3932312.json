For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Emmanuel Stallworth, a painter, injured his shoulder at work on July 18, 2005. Subsequently, Stallworth filed a claim for disability compensation pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50. Before the District Director, Stall-worth\u2019s attorney largely focused his argument on the assertion that Stallworth\u2019s average weekly wage (\u201cAWW\u201d) was $682.12. The ALJ, however, determined that Stallworth\u2019s AWW is now $581.76. Prior to this determination, Respondent Northrop Grumman had voluntarily been paying Stallworth an AWW of $588.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">After the ALJ issued his Decision and Order, Stallworth\u2019s attorney submitted a fee petition to the District Director seeking an attorney\u2019s fee of $4,871.25, representing 21.25 hours of legal services at $225.00 per hour, plus $90.00 of expenses. After considering the Respondent\u2019s objections, the District Director reduced the hourly rate to $200, disallowed one of the itemized entries, and reduced the award by one-half to reflect the fact that \u201cvery little [was] gained by claimant and/or that there was limited success on the disputed issues.\u201d The District Director noted that Stallworth\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument and presentation before the District Director focused mostly on the issue of AWW, an issue that Stallworth eventually lost since the ALJ awarded him an AWW lower than that he was already receiving from his employer. Consequently, applying this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>991 F.2d 163 (5th Cir.1993), the District Director determined that Stallworth\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee award should be reduced to reflect the \u201climited success\u201d Stallworth\u2019s attorney had on the main issue he raised and litigated. Notably, the District Director reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">In the instant case, counsel for claimant admits that AWW was one of 2 issues in dispute before this office and the 0[ffice of the A]LJ. It was the only issue in the first conference held on May 8, 2007 and was a part of the discussion about what claimant\u2019s entitlement to loss of wage-earning capacity benefits should be in the second informal conference held on August 28, 2007. Clearly, the claim for increasing the AWW was lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9K\">Accordingly, the district director reduced Stallworth\u2019s counsel\u2019s fee award to $2,480.63.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Stallworth appealed the District Director\u2019s reduction of the attorney fee to the Board. In evaluating Stallworth\u2019s contention that the District Director had erred in reducing the fee, the Board observed that \u201c[t]he district director noted claimant\u2019s success in obtaining an ongoing award of permanent partial disability, but found he was unsuccessful of the issue of increasing his average weekly wage; in fact, it was decreased.\u201d The Board agreed with the District Director\u2019s determination that AWW was the \u201cmajor issu[e] in dispute\u201d since \u201caverage weekly wage was the only issue discussed at the first informal conference and that it also was discussed at the second informal conference concerning claimant\u2019s entitlement to ongoing benefits.\u201d Accordingly, because Stallworth lost on the issue of AWW, the Board reasoned it should affirm the District Director\u2019s reduction of the attorney fee-award by half.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Stallworth has timely filed his appeal of the Board\u2019s final order to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"AlY\">\u201cOur review of Board decisions is limited.\u201d <em>Ingalls, </em>991 F.2d at 165. \u2018We inquire only whether the Board correctly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s order was supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and is in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Furthermore, \u201can ALJ\u2019s reduction .of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs will be affirmed on appeal unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Hill v. Director, OWCP, </em>195 F.3d 790, 794 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">On appeal, Stallworth argues that the Board committed error in affirming the District Director\u2019s fee reduction since 1) the District Director\u2019s decision to reduce the fee award as a result of Stallworth\u2019s \u201closing on an issue\u201d contravenes the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); and 2) the District Director\u2019s decision to use a \u201cfractional multiplier to reduce a fee award\u201d was an act considered to be \u201carbitrary, capricious and/or abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Our review of the record and applicable law, however, leads us to conclude that the District Director\u2019s order reducing the attorney\u2019s fee is supported by the substantial evidence in the record and is in accordance with the law. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board did not err in affirming the District Director\u2019s fee reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">I. The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in <em>Hensley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Stallworth\u2019s contentions that the District Director\u2019s order contravened the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley </em>are without merit. In <em>Hensley, </em>the Supreme Court held that where \u201ca plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933. The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]his will be true even where the plaintiffs claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the adjudicator \u201cmay simply reduce the award to account for the [attorney\u2019s] limited success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">In the present case, the substantial evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Stallworth\u2019s attorney only achieved partial or very limited success. In his order, the District Director noted that AWW \u201cwas the only issue in the first conference held on May 8, 2007 and was a part of the discussion about what claimant\u2019s entitlement to loss of wage-earning capacity benefits should be in the second informal conference held on August 28, 2007.\u201d Consequently, the District Director determined that because the ALJ awarded Stallworth a lower AWW than what Respondent Northrop Grumman was already paying Stallworth, Stallworth\u2019s attorney failed to succeed on the major issue presented to the District Director. Accordingly, he reduced the fee by one-half to account for the attorney\u2019s limited success.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">As a result, we cannot conclude that the District Director\u2019s decision contradicts the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">II. Arbitrary, Capricious, and/or Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">In his second issue on appeal, Stallworth argues that the District Director\u2019s decision to simply reduce the fee award by one-half \u2014 instead of meticulously calculating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the exact number of hours Stallworth\u2019s attorney spent on the \u201csuccessful\u201d versus the \u201cnon-successful\u201d issue \u2014 constitutes a decision that is arbitrary, capricious, and/or an abuse of discretion. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In regards to how the District Director must go about calculating the exact amount of a fee reduction, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Consequently, \u201c[t]he [adjudicator] may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In the present case, the District Director reasoned that although Stallworth\u2019s attorney argued two issues, he lost on the main issue he litigated before the District Director. As such, a reduction of the fee award by one-half is fully supported by the substantial evidence in the record and cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious. To conclude otherwise would undermine the <em>Hensley </em>Court\u2019s edict that \u201c[t]here is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, we conclude that the final order of the Board affirming the District Director\u2019s fee reduction is supported by the substantial evidence in the record and is in accordance with the law. The decision of the Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-9\">. The Fifth Circuit has determined that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hensley </em>is applicable to a District Director's consideration of fee awards requested pursuant to the LHWCA. <em>See Avondale Indus., Inc. v. Davis, </em>348 F.3d 487, 490 (5th Cir.2003) (\"Because \u00a7 28(b) requires a showing of success by the claimant for the award of attorney's fees, an ALJ must apply the factors set forth in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart </em>in determining whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees is warranted.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
