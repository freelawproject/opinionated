He appeals various sentencing guideline applications. In particular, Bostic argues that the district court\u2019s loss-amount determination of approximately $140,500 was erroneous because the court improperly attributed to him relevant conduct relating to the eight dismissed substantive counts of bank fraud. The offense conduct involved Bostic\u2019s use of intermediaries to recruit individuals to deposit fraudulent checks and his direction of individuals to withdraw money against these checks and provide him a larger portion of the proceeds. On appeal, Bostic also challenges his role in the offense, and the court\u2019s failure to grant him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">We review a district court\u2019s amount-of-loss determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Machado, </em>333 F.3d 1225, 1227 (11th Cir.2003). Proper calculation of the Guidelines, and in particular a defendant\u2019s offense level, requires consideration of \u201call relevant conduct,\u201d not merely charged conduct. <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). When a defendant challenges relevant conduct, such as the calculation of loss amount in a fraud case, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence and \u201csupporting its loss calculation with reliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Liss, </em>265 F.3d 1220, 1230 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>The district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, undisputed statements in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004). Furthermore, the Guidelines provide that, in determining any sentene-ing-related factual dispute, \u201cthe court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>see also United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1254 n. 68 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that, post-<em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court may still rely on \u201creliable hearsay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We will not disturb the district judge\u2019s credibility finding unless a witness\u2019s testimony is unbelievable on its face. <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that testimony is incredible as a matter of law when it is \u201cunbelievable on its face\u201d and relates to \u201cfacts that the witness physically could not have possibly observed or events that could not have occurred under the laws of nature\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he fact that a witness has consistently lied in the past, engaged in various criminal activities, and thought that his testimony would benefit him does not make his testimony incredible.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, alterations and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) (cross-referencing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(d)). According to the commentary, offenses constitute a common scheme or plan for purposes of relevant conduct if they are \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3, cmt. n. 9(A). Additionally, whether or not charged as a conspiracy, relevant conduct includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). A defendant is accountable under this provision for the conduct of others that was both \u201c(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and (ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l), the sentencing court should apply offense level enhancements where a crime resulted in increasing amounts of loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(1). A 10-level enhancement should be applied where the amount of loss is more than $120,000, but not more than $200,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(F), (G). The amount of loss is the greater of the intended or actual loss. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). \u201cActual loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3(A)(i). \u201cReasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm\u201d is \u201charm that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3(A)(iv). \u201cIntended loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,\u201d and includes \u201cintended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 3(A)(ii). The district court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>188 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Here, we conclude from the record that the district court\u2019s amount-of-loss determination was not clearly erroneous. Based on the evidence presented at sentencing, which Bostic has not demonstrated to be unbelievable on its face or unreliable, the offense conduct to which Bostic pled guilty was similar and related to the dismissed counts of the indictment. Based on the similarities between the evidence underlying the dismissed counts and facts underlying the offense conduct, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that $140,500 was the approximate total intended loss. Consequently, the court correctly enhanced Bostic\u2019s offense level according to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level based on his role as an organizer or leader. <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1197 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a four-level enhancement may be applied if \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). An enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1 \u201crequires the exercise of some authority in the organization, the exertion of some degree of control, <em>influence, </em>or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993) (emphasis added) (citing <em>United States v. Brown, </em>944 F.2d 1377, 1385 (7th Cir.1991)). In determining whether a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement applies, the district court should consider: \u201c(1) the exercise of decision-making authority, (2) the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d <em>Gupta, </em>463 F.3d at 1198 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 4). On appeal, we give deference to the district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement. <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Here, Bostic does not dispute that the offense conduct involved five or more individuals, and the evidence supports the court\u2019s finding in this respect. The evidence also supports the court\u2019s finding that Bostic was the leader or organizer in the offense because the evidence demonstrates that he initiated the conspiracy, suggested that intermediaries recruit others, worked to ensure that participants complied with his instructions, and the evidence also shows that he received a larger portion of the profits compared to the other individuals. As a result, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005). Under clear error review, we give great deference to the district court, and its determination should not be overturned unless it is without foundation. <em>See United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The guidelines provide for a two-level reduction when the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Bostic bears the burden of showing entitlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>a reduction, and he \u201cmust present more than just a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d at 1323. Although a guilty plea is significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, \u201cthis evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>115 F.3d 1531, 1537 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1 and 3 (stating that a guilty plea is evidence of acceptance of guilt only when that plea is combined with truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of the conviction and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant was accountable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3). Appropriate considerations in determining whether a defendant qualifies for the reduction include truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of conviction, the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s conduct in accepting responsibility, and assistance to authorities in recovering the fruits of the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1. Adjustment is not warranted where the defendant falsely denies relevant conduct. <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Here, we conclude from the record that the district court did not clearly err by denying Bostic a reduction for acceptance, because, although he entered a guilty plea and admitted some relevant conduct, he did not clearly demonstrate acceptance for accountable conduct. On the contrary, Bostic acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility by largely denying other relevant conduct and attempting to diminish his role in the offense. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found that Bostic\u2019s other conduct outweighed evidence of his guilty plea, and thus, he was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, we affirm Bostic\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
