Llovera Linares, a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants in his civil rights action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Sierra Club, Inc. v. Leavitt, </em>488 F.3d 904, 911 (11th Cir.2007). And we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">Linares made allegations about the medical care he received after he was processed into the Broward County prison system. When he entered the main jail, he had injuries stemming from his arrest, including gunshot wounds to the abdomen and a broken finger. Linares alleged that, even though he complained many times about the pain in his finger, he never received a splint and received only pain medication. Because of the failure to treat properly the fracture, Linares alleged that his finger now was deformed. He also alleged that he did not receive regular dressings for his wounds, as ordered by doctors. And, Linares alleged that, because of the unsanitary conditions of the prisons, he contracted methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (\u201cMRSA\u201d). Li-nares raised claims of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs against medical staff members at Armour Correctional Health Services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the \u201cMedical De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>fendants\u201d) and claims of unconstitutional conditions of confinement against many administrators and officials within the Bro-ward County Sheriffs Office (\u201cBCSO Defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and granted Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The court concluded that the Medical Defendants were not deliberately indifferent to Linares\u2019s medical needs because he received adequate ongoing evaluation, diagnoses, and treatment. And about the BCSO Defendants, the court concluded that Linares showed no causal connection between Defendants and Li-nares\u2019s contraction of MRSA. On appeal, Linares argues that the evidence showed that he had serious medical conditions that the Medical Defendants ignored; and he repeats his allegations against each medical defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">To show a constitutional violation based on medical treatment, a plaintiff must first show an objectively serious medical need: a need that has been \u201cdiagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or ... is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention,\u201d and that, \u201cif left unattended, pos[es] a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). And then a plaintiff must show that the prison official acted with deliberate indifference to those needs, which requires (1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm, (2) disregard of that risk, (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 1245; <em>see also Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000) (plaintiff must demonstrate that defendants\u2019 response to a medical need was more than \u201cmerely accidental inadequacy, negligence in diagnosis or treatment, or even medical malpractice actionable under state law\u201d) (citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">We agree with the district court that the Medical Defendants did not act deliberately indifferent in treating Linares. Evidence indicated that the Medical Defendants collectively evaluated and treated Linares for his gunshot wounds and broken finger. Although there is evidence that Linares\u2019s wounds were not cleaned and dressed every day (as ordered by one of the defendant doctors), the dressing log indicated that, even without daily dressing, his wounds were healing and were not draining. And evidence showed that his gunshot wound never was infected with MRSA. So, because the wound was healing and uninfected, the failure to dress it daily did not show disregard for a serious medical need.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">About Linares\u2019s finger, the evidence did not demonstrate a serious medical need for a splint. The Medical Defendants regularly evaluated and treated the finger; and a doctor determined \u2014 after an examination and review of the x-ray \u2014 that the finger was not displaced or dislocated and did not require a splint. Linares did not complain of pain or other problems associated with the finger in the days after entering the jail; so, the doctor did not believe that additional treatment was necessary. That a physician\u2019s assistant later ordered a splint or that Linares felt that he should have been given a splint earlier demonstrates only a difference of opinion about the proper treatment. <em>See Adams v. Poag, </em>61 F.3d 1537, 1545 (11th Cir.1995) (whether defendants\u2019 \u201cshould have employed additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment \u2018is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment\u2019 and therefore not an appropriate basis for grounding\u201d constitutional liability); <em>Hamm v. DeKalb Co., 774 </em>F.2d 1567, 1575 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>1985) (concluding that, where an inmate regularly was examined and treated and the dispute centered on the adequacy of the treatment, no constitutional violation exists).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">On his conditions of confinement claim, Linares argues that the BCSO Defendants had actual knowledge of MRSA outbreaks in the prisons; and, because they took no action to correct this problem, they showed indifference to prisoner safety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prison officials may be liable for denying humane conditions of confinement only if officials know the inmate faces a substantial risk of serious harm and disregard that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1982-83, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). A plaintiff also must show that the constitutional violation caused his injuries. <em>Marsh v. Butler County, Ala., </em>268 F.3d 1014, 1028 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We agree with the district court that Linares failed to show a causal connection between the BCSO Defendants and his contraction of MRSA. About Lieutenant Schlagel of the North Broward Bureau, Linares contracted MRSA before his transfer there; so, Schlagel caused no harm to Linares based on an alleged unsanitary condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And no evidence showed that the other BCSO Defendants had direct contact with Linares. To the extent the BCSO Defendants were aware of MRSA problems in the jails, evidence showed that they contracted with Armour to provide infection control programs and had established protocols to control and mitigate the spread of MRSA. <em>See Farmer, </em>114 S.Ct. at 1982-83 (if the prison official responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm was not averted, he may be found free of liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">The district court made no error in granting summary judgment to the Medical and BCSO Defendants on Linares\u2019s federal claims of deliberate indifference and unconstitutional conditions of confinement. As such, we conclude that the court abused no discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Linares\u2019s remaining state law negligence claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-13\">. Broward County contracted with Armour to provide medical services to prisoners in its prisons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">. We reject the BCSO Defendants\u2019 argument that Linares prematurely filed his brief. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 12-1, 31-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">. To the extent Linares argues that Schlagel was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs because he had a duty to ensure that Linares received better medical care at a hospital, we reject the argument. Nothing suggests that Schlagel, a shift commander, had authority to transfer Linares to a hospital or knew that his action or inaction put Linares at a substantial risk of harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ARyy\">.We reject Linares\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant his many motions for appointment of counsel. The facts and issues in Linares\u2019s case were not so complex or novel that he required counsel. <em>See Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.1992) (the court should appoint counsel only in exceptional circumstances \u201csuch as where the facts and legal issues are so novel or complex as to require the assistance of a trained practitioner\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
