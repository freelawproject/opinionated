Edwards alleged that prison officials acted improperly in confiscating two items of mail on February 9, 2007. That is this date on which he became aware of the facts that would give rise to the complaint. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Moore v. McDonald, </em>30 F.3d 616, 621 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"ARu\">As was found by the district court, Edwards is entitled to 87 days of tolling from February 25, 2007, to May 23, 2007, during which his grievance proceedings were pending. <em>See Jackson v. Johnson, </em>950 F.2d 263, 265 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Holmes v. Texas A&amp;M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 685 (5th Cir.1998). Because he did not file his complaint within two-years plus the 87-day tolled period of February 9, 2007, the complaint was untimely filed. <em>See Stanley v. Foster, </em>464 F.3d 565, 568 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the complaint was time-barred. <em>See Moore, </em>30 F.3d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"A6S\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
