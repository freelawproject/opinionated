Ross argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-22\">Ross pleaded guilty to the distribution charge without the benefit of a plea agreement. The presentence investigation report described Ross\u2019s criminal history that included, over a 12-year period, convictions for multiple drug charges, domestic batteries, illegal possession of a firearm, fleeing and eluding police, resisting arrest, and driving with a suspended license. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history of VI, the report listed a sentencing range between 77 and 96 months of imprisonment. Ross did not object to the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-23\">At the sentencing hearing, Ross expressed a desire to \u201crehabilitate [himself] while incarcerated by getting into vocational and educational skill courses, attending the drug rehabilitation program and going to the halfway house where [he could] prepar[e] himself for society.\u201d Ross requested \u201ca sentence no longer than necessary for [him] to rehabilitate [himjself.\u201d Ross asked the district court to sentence him between 36 and 48 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-24\">The district court sentenced Ross to 77 months of imprisonment. The district court stated that it took \u201cinto account [Ross\u2019s] very significant criminal history,\u201d \u201cthe very brief period of time that passed between [Ross\u2019s] three-year sentence\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>drug and firearms convictions \u201cand his next arrest,\u201d and the time required for Ross to complete intensive drug treatment. The district court explained that it \u201cconsidered five years probably may well have been sufficient,\u201d but decided \u201cthat a [downward] variance was not appropriate ... and that ... sentence was insufficient\u201d to allow Ross \u201csufficient time in custody to complete \u2014 to get into and complete the 500-hour drug treatment program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Ross at the low end of the guideline range. Ross argues that the district court based its sentence on the time required to complete a drug treatment program, but the district court stated that it selected a sentence of 77 months \u201cfor general deterrence, to convince other people who know [Ross] not to do this,\u201d to deter Ross from future similar conduct, to provide a just punishment, and to enable Ross \u201cto complete ... [his] educational and vocational goals.\u201d The district court correctly based its sentence in part on Ross\u2019s rehabilitation because \u201cin determining the particular sentence to be imposed,\u201d a court is required to consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Ross\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Ross\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
