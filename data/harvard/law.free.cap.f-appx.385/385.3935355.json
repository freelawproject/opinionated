He acknowledged he did not have immigration documents and admitted to the agents under oath that he was a citizen of Mexico, he had previously been deported from the United States, and he had reentered the United States the previous day without receiving permission from the United States Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">After hearing this evidence at trial, a jury convicted Ortega-Martinez of being found unlawfully present in the United States and he was sentenced to a forty-eight month prison term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ortega-Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tinez appeals his conviction arguing the introduction into evidence, without objection, of a certif\u00edcate of nonexistence of record (CNR), which certified the government had no records showing Ortega-Martinez received permission to return to the United States, violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. At trial, the federal agent who testified to the contents of the CNR did not personally prepare the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The parties agree review is for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although we have held that admitting into evidence a CNR without the testimony of the person who prepared it violates the Confrontation Clause, Ortega-Martinez still must show the admission of the CNR infringed his substantial rights, that the violation created a reasonable probability the jury reached a different conclusion than it would have absent introduction of the CNR.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This Ortega-Martinez cannot do, given the government\u2019s overwhelming evidence, including Ortega-Martinez\u2019s sworn admissions to the disputed elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
