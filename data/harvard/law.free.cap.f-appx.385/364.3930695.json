He concedes in his reply brief that the Government is correct that his APA argument is unavailing because the permanent regulations governing retroac-tivity apply to his case. Ross has abandoned the APA issue and we do not consider it. <em>See Morin v. Caire, </em>77 F.3d 116, 120 n. 6 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Ross asserts that the Government failed to show that he knowingly failed to register as a sex offender or update his registration because it failed to show that he had knowledge of the requirements of SORNA. Ross\u2019s argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Heth, </em>596 F.3d 255, 258 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 262 n. 6 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">He contends that SORNA is beyond Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. He argues that SORNA violates the Due Process Clause because no notice of the statute\u2019s registration requirements is required for a violation of the statute and because he was prosecuted before any state implemented SORNA. He concedes that his contentions are foreclosed, but he raises them to preserve them for further review. Ross\u2019s Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause contentions are foreclosed. <em>See Heth, </em>596 F.3d at 259-60; <em>Whaley, </em>577 F.3d at 258-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
