Heaton, </em>352 Fed.Appx. 904 (5th Cir.2009). The law of the case doctrine precludes review of these arguments in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 806 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, Ade-leke has not shown that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without appointing an attorney to assist him and without giving him an opportunity to develop more evidence. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., </em>197 F.3d 694, 719 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">Prisoners\u2019 claims of retaliation are regarded with skepticism and are carefully scrutinized by the courts. <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cA prison official may not retaliate against or harass an inmate for complaining through proper channels about a guard\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Morris v. Powell, </em>449 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cTo prevail on a claim of retaliation, a prisoner must establish (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">Adeleke asserts that he demonstrated that Fleckenstein wrote false disciplinary cases to justify his action of grabbing Adeleke by the shoulder on October 12, 2007, and that the action of the writing the disciplinary cases resulted in Adeleke being transferred to a more dangerous side of the prison and being on lockdown with a gang member who fought in the recreation yard. These arguments do not allege any retaliation based on past or threatened filing of prison grievances by Adeleke, and they do not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that it could not be inferred from the chronology of events that Fleckenstein took any action in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>retaliation for Adeleke\u2019s filing of, or threatening to file, grievances or to report Fleckenstein or any other prison personnel. Adeleke fails to address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing this claim or identify any error in the district court\u2019s conclusions. Accordingly, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Adeleke has abandoned this element of the retaliation claim, we need not address the other elements or the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
