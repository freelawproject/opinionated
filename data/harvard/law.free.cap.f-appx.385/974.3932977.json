Vega now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred by denying him a minor-role reduction of his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">A district comet\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Section 3B 1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines states: \u201cBased on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows ... If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment \u2014 here the defendant \u2014 always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. When determining a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, a district court must measure the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable at sentencing, and it may also consider the defendant\u2019s role as compared to that of other participants in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 940, 944. Where the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which he was a minor participant but for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941. For drug offenses, the amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 943. In the extreme case, the amount of drugs itself may be dispositive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Vega was involved in a criminal conspiracy to traffic over 1,800 kilograms of cocaine. This alone undermines his argument that he is entitled to a minor-role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941. More importantly, Vega participated in this offense by serving as the primary contact person for Lamberti Ledesma, the chief organizer of the conspiracy; receiving and depositing funds in furtherance of the conspiracy; obtaining the radios used by the <em>D\u2019Mary </em>while transporting the cocaine; taking and relaying messages in furtherance of the drug importation; and providing radio frequencies used by the go-fast boats transporting the cocaine. The fact that he may have been less culpable than some other co-conspirators does not entitle Vega to a minor-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 944. In sum, the district court did not clearly err when it declined to grant Vega\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Our reasonableness review is deferential, and the party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006), citing <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). The analysis includes \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-11\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786, <em>citing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">We may vacate a sentence if we are left \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted). We will \u201cordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>We ordinarily expect sentences such as Vega\u2019s \u2014 which was the lowest sentence within advisory guideline range \u2014 to be reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Beyond arguing that the district court should have afforded additional weight to certain personal circumstances, Vega provides no evidence that his sentence within the Guidelines sentencing range is outside the range of reasonable sentences from which the court could have selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
