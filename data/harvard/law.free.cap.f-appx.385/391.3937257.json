Birdow argues that the district court erred by (1) applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) because his prior conviction for assault on a public servant did not constitute a violent felony<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) cross-referencing to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 because he did not possess the firearm in connection with the commission of an aggravated sexual assault. The Government counters that Birdow\u2019s claims are barred by the waiver provision contained in his plea agreement providing, inter alia, that Birdow waives his right to appeal his sentence unless it exceeds the statutory maximum or results from his having received ineffective assistance of counsel (he makes no claim of the latter).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-25\">Birdow characterizes both of his arguments on appeal as one challenging his sentence as one that exceeds the statutory maximum. <em>E.cj., </em>Blue Brief at 6. However, both of Birdow\u2019s issues on appeal contest the district court\u2019s calculation of the sentencing guidelines. The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Court has decided that the guidelines are not mandatory. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-68, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the guidelines are advisory, they do not create a statutory maximum that Birdow can appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In any event, we need not decide whether this appellate briefing bars Birdow\u2019s \u00a7 924(e) claim because it is meritless. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that waivers are not jurisdictional). We review the legal conclusions underlying a district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 924(e) de novo. <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006). A conviction for assault on a public servant pursuant to Tex. Pen.Code \u00a7 22.01(b) constitutes a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 355-56 (5th Cir.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009); <em>United States v. Mohr, </em>554 F.3d 604, 609 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 56, 175 L.Ed.2d 45 (2009) (noting that this court has applied case law under the residual clause of \u00a7 924(e) to analyze the definition of crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2, and vice versa).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Birdow argues that <em>Anderson </em>was wrongly decided, we may not overrule it without en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary Supreme Court decision. <em>See Martinez-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 500, 502 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006). Applying the <em>Anderson </em>definition, we hold that Birdow\u2019s conviction for assault on a public servant contrary to Tex. Pen.Code \u00a7 22.01(b)(1) was a violent felony for purposes of section 924(e). Because Birdow\u2019s statutory maximum sentence was life in prison pursuant to \u00a7 924(e), his argument regarding the cross-reference to \u00a7 2A3.1 is barred by the plea agreement waiver, as his sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>413 F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\">. This was a single prior judgment which convicted Birdow for two separate assaults on a public servant, each committed on a separate occasion from the other. Birdow also had (among other prior convictions) a prior conviction for burglary of a habitation (a violent felony).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">. Birdow also argues in his brief that <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2006), suggests that the rule in <em>Anderson </em>is not a <em>per se </em>rule holding that all convictions under \u00a7 22.01 are crimes of violence. Unlike <em>Fierro-Reyna, </em>but like <em>Anderson, </em>the instant case involves a \u00a7 22.01(b) conviction as a crime of violence pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). <em>Fierro-Reyna </em>involved a question of whether an assault was a crime of violence under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d at 326. The <em>Anderson </em>court specifically addressed the differences between guidelines section 4B1.2 and 2L1.2 in deciding that a \u00a7 22.01(b) conviction would be a crime of violence pursuant to guidelines section 4B1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-23\">. As we also noted in <em>Mohr, </em>\"[t]he definition of violent felony [in \u00a7 924(3) ] is identical to that of 'crime of violence' in the Guidelines context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
