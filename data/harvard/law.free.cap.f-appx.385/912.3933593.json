On appeal, Georges argues that: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because a reasonable jury could not have found that he knowingly possessed a firearm; and (2) his conviction should be vacated because \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not require that a firearm substantially affected interstate commerce, and thus, exceeds Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>565 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1032, 175 L.Ed.2d 632 (2009). When a defendant challenges the constitutionality of a statute for the first time on appeal, we will review the claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, we may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) affects substantial rights; and (4) \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-23\">First, we reject Georges\u2019 claim that there was insufficient evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>his conviction. By its terms, \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it a crime for a convicted felon to possess a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). To prove that a defendant committed an offense under \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm, (2) the defendant was a convicted felon, and (3) the firearm affected or was in interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">In this appeal, Georges\u2019 possession of the firearm is the only element in dispute. Possession, in the context of \u00a7 922(g)(1), requires that the defendant knowingly possess the firearm and may be proven either by showing that the defendant actually possessed the firearm, or by showing that he constructively possessed it. <em>United States v. Pedro, </em>999 F.2d 497, 500 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cTo prove actual possession the evidence must show that the defendant either had physical possession of or personal dominion over the thing allegedly possessed.\u201d <em>United States v. Leonard, </em>138 F.3d 906, 909 (11th Cir.1998). A defendant\u2019s resistance to arrest is admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt. <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">\u201cWe will not overturn a conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence unless no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273 (quotation omitted). \u201c[We] must accept a jury\u2019s inferences and determinations of witness credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Here, the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that Georges knowingly possessed a firearm. A detective testified that he saw the driver throw a metal object that appeared to be a gun with his left arm, and another officer later found a gun where the object was allegedly thrown. Georges\u2019 defense counsel cross-examined the detective on his ability to see the car\u2019s driver throw a gun out of the window, and because the jury\u2019s verdict suggests that it found the detective\u2019s testimony to be credible, we accept the jury\u2019s determination that the detective\u2019s testimony was credible. <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Although there was another individual in the car, whom Georges argues could have been in possession of the firearm, the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence. <em>See Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d at 1267. Based on where the gun was thrown from the car and where Georges and the car\u2019s passenger exited the car, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to find that Georges, and not the car\u2019s passenger, threw the gun. Further, evidence showing that Georges fled from police in a car and by foot could indicate that he only resisted arrest because he realized that he illegally possessed a gun. <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1274.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">In short, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor, the district court did not err in con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>eluding that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Georges actually possessed a firearm, as required for a conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We are likewise unpersuaded by Georges\u2019 claim that his conviction should be vacated because \u00a7 922(g)(1) violates the Commerce Clause. Georges concedes that, in <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387 (11th Cir.1996), we decided that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not a violation of Congress\u2019s authority to regulate interstate commerce, but argues that this opinion was wrongly decided and conflicts with <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The law of this Circuit is \u201cemphatic\u201d that only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision. <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997). We have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) against Commerce Clause challenges. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1273 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1280 (listing cases in which we have upheld the constitutional validity of \u00a7 922(g)). In <em>McAllister, </em>we rejected a constitutional challenge identical to Georges\u2019 argument \u2014 -that based on <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g) exceeds Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. 77 F.3d at 389-90 (\u201cNothing in <em>Lopez </em>suggests that the \u2018minimal nexus\u2019 test should be changed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">We are bound by <em>McAllister </em>because we have not yet overturned <em>McAllister </em>or its progeny while sitting <em>en banc, </em>and no subsequent Supreme Court decision undermines our analysis of the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>See Cargill, </em>120 F.3d at 1386. Therefore, the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in convicting Georges under a constitutional criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">. The cases that Georges cites in support of his position are distinguishable because: (1) unlike in <em>Pedro, </em>999 F.2d at 501-02, there was evidence that Georges actually possessed the gun by throwing it out of the car that he was driving; and (2) unlike in the unpublished and nonbinding decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tolbert, </em>185 Fed.Appx. 913 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished), there was evidence that reasonably showed that Georges, and not the passenger in the car, threw the gun out of the window.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
