He was the passenger in a vehicle operated by Roger Burner. Both were killed by extensive thermal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 3} The estate of Dennis Alan Johnson Jr. was opened on August 12, 1999, in the Tuscarawas Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, under case No. 99 ES 50259. The purpose of opening the estate was to pursue recovery for Dennis Alan\u2019s wrongful death. When the estate was opened, the only beneficiary listed therein was Dennis Lee Johnson (\u201cDennis Lee\u201d), Dennis Alan\u2019s purported son. Doris Johnson, Dennis Alan\u2019s mother, and grandmother of Dennis Lee, was appointed administrator. Doris hired Amer Cunningham Company, L.P.A., appellant herein, as legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 4} Wrongful-death litigation proceeded, and a settlement of $700,000 from decedent\u2019s employer\u2019s uninsured-Amderinsured-motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) carrier was reached in October 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 5} On December 1, 2001, Doris, through Amer Cunningham, filed an application to approve settlement and distribution of wrongful-death and survival claims with the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">{\u00b6 6} On December 5, 2001, appellant filed an application to approve settlement and distribution of wrongful-death and survival claims, requesting distribution of the settlement proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah8\">Doris Johnson (mother): $175,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvB\">Dennis Johnson Sr. (father): $ 75,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am-\">Danielle Johnson (sister): $ 92,319.74</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0P\">Dennis Lee Johnson (purported son): $ 69,278.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-k\">Ashley Johnson (niece): $ 50,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-19\">{\u00b6 7} Amer Cunningham requested a one-third contingency fee of $233,333.34 for attorney fees for services rendered with respect to the wrongful-death and survival claims, plus reimbursement of $5,067.96 for case expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On December 31, 2001, the probate court approved the application and entered an order allocating the wrongful-death proceeds to the decedent\u2019s family-members as set forth above and approving Amer Cunningham\u2019s one-third contingency fee of $233,333.33. It was also noted on that entry that the settlement funds for Dennis Lee and Ashley Johnson were \u201c[t]o be held in private trust for health, education and welfare. Doris Johnson to serve as Trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 9} During the years that followed, it came to light that Doris, the administrator, did not use the money she was allocated for Dennis Lee\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 10} In April 2003, Dennis Lee\u2019s mother, Tammy Schaar, sued Doris, in her capacity as trustee, challenging the allocation of funds. See <em>Schaar v. Johnson, </em>Tuscarawas Common Pleas Court, Probate Division, 2003 DJ 19702.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 11} The administrator, Doris, represents that all of the money she was allocated is gone. Doris hired Amer Cunningham to defend the suit. She paid the legal fees for that representation out of the trust fund set aside for the benefit of Dennis Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 12} On February 27, 2004, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. This motion was denied by magistrate\u2019s opinion on October 25, 2004, which was upheld by the trial court on January 24, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 13} The trial court appointed a guardian ad litem, Kenneth Welch, to represent the interests of Dennis Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 14} A trial was held before the magistrate on April 19, 2005, and June 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 15} Thereafter, on January 13, 2006, the magistrate issued a decision that found that Doris had committed fraud against Schaar in obtaining consent to the distribution. As a result, the magistrate recommended partially vacating the December 31, 2001 judgment entry in the estate case for the purposes of redistributing the wrongful-death proceeds and having Doris removed as the administrator of the estate and as trustee of the Dennis Lee Johnson Trust. The probate court also found that Doris had misappropriated at least $25,477 from the Dennis Lee Johnson Trust by paying Amer Cunningham\u2019s legal fees out of that trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">{\u00b6 16} At the evidentiary hearing, Doris testified that she was advised by her attorney, Tom Houlihan of Amer Cunningham, to use the trust funds to pay for her litigation expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">{\u00b6 17} On August 10, 2006, the magistrate\u2019s decision was upheld by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">{\u00b6 18} On September 26, 2006, the magistrate made a further decision in which he appointed a replacement administrator for the estate, consolidated the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>and declaratory-judgment cases, determined Dennis Lee to be the legitimate child of the decedent, and set a hearing for an allocation of wrongful-death proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 19} On October 11, 2006, this decision was adopted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 20} On October 31, 2006, the reallocation hearing took place, during which the new administrator of the estate, John Maxwell, suggested that Amer Cunningham pay back legal fees it earned on the wrongful-death settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 21} On November 22, 2006, the magistrate entered a decision that reallocated the wrongful-death proceeds among the various beneficiaries and set a further hearing to consider Amer Cunningham\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 22} Amer Cunningham entered an appearance and on December 18, 2006, filed objections to the reconsideration of its fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b623} On February 6, 2007, the matter was heard by the magistrate, who issued an opinion on March 27, 2007, requiring Amer Cunningham to return $53,333.33 of the legal fees that had been previously allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 24} On April 11, 2007, Amer Cunningham filed its objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">{\u00b6 25} On April 17, 2007, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision without consideration of Amer Cunningham\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">{\u00b6 26} On April 20, 2007, Amer Cunningham filed a motion to vacate the April 17, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">{\u00b6 27} On May 17, 2007, Amer Cunningham appealed said decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">{\u00b6 28} On July 25, 2007, appellant filed a motion for remand to allow the trial court to rule upon appellant\u2019s December 18, 2006 objections and appellant\u2019s April 20.2007 motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">{\u00b6 29} By order dated August 9, 2007, this court, upon remand, instructed the trial court to rule upon the objections and the motion to vacate and extended the briefing schedule in the instant appeal to allow for same.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">{\u00b6 30} On August 30, 2007, upon remand, the trial court vacated its April 17, 2007 order and considered and overruled Amer Cunningham\u2019s December 18, 2006 objections and its motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court further overruled Amer Cunningham\u2019s April 11, 2007 objections on September 28, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant now assigns the following errors for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cI. The trial court erred in determining that the attorneys for the administratrix of a wrongful death estate owed a duty to a potential beneficiary of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cII. The trial court erred in determining that the attorneys for the administrator owe a duty to prevent an administrator from \u2018straying from her responsibilities\u2019 to other beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cHI. The trial court erred in reducing Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A.\u2019s fee for obtaining a wrongful death settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIV. The trial court erred in allowing a collateral attack of a judgment through the filing of a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cV. The trial court erred in granting Civ.R. 60 relief when no Civ.R. 60 motion was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cVI. Even if it was appropriate for the trial court to treat the declaratory judgment action as a Civ.R. 60 motion, no appropriate showing of Civ.R. 60 factors was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cVII. The trial court erred in determining that Doris Johnson was not allowed to pay for legal representation from the Dennis Lee Johnson Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">I, II, III</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant\u2019s first three assignments of error address the trial court\u2019s reduction of the amount of approved attorney fees. We shall therefore address these assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">{\u00b6 41} The law firm of Amer Cunningham Co., L.P.A. contends that its legal services are of reasonable value of 33 1/3 percent of the amount recovered, pursuant to the contingency-fee contract, and that the trial court\u2019s decision to reduce its previously approved amount of attorney fees was error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">{\u00b6 42} C.P.Sup.R. 39, which provides for counsel fees in connection with settlement of claims for wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering, claims for personal injuries to persons under guardianship, and settlement of claims for personal injuries to minors under R.C. 2111.18, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cWhen representation is on a contingent fee basis, counsel will be allowed fees on the amount obtained, subject to the approval of Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">{\u00b6 44} C.P.Sup.R. 40, which provides for counsel fees, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c(A) Attorney fees relative to all matters shall be governed by the Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>{\u00b6 47} \u201c(H) The court does not have, nor is there recognized, any minimum or maximum fees which will automatically be approved by the Court. Prior to a fiduciary entering into a contingent fee contract with an attorney for services, an application for authority to enter into the agreement shall be filed with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">{\u00b6 48} The court notes that effective February 1, 2007, the disciplinary rules that were in effect in Ohio have been superseded by the Ohio Rules of Professional conduct. However, DR 2-106 and Rule 1.5(A) of the Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct are analogous and provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c(a) A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee. A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c(4) the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">{\u00b6 55} \u201c(6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">{\u00b6 56} \u201c(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services;</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) (Ohio Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">{\u00b6 58} During the February 6, 2007 hearing, wherein the probate court was reconsidering appellant\u2019s attorney fees and reviewing the fees under DR 2-106, attorney Hardin, one of the attorneys representing the new executor of the estate, stated that they were raising no issues with factors one, two, three, four, five, seven, and eight and further stated that they were stipulating that those factors were satisfied. Hardin further stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-15\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cI agree that these are difficult cases, I agree that this is an excellent outcome, I agree that these cases are often handled on a contingent basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-16\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cWe do however have an issue as to the nature of the attorney/client relationship in the handling of this claim and also in, and in particularly, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>probating of this claim. And we believe that there are substantial issues as to the conflicting nature of the relationship in the handling of this claim and we intend to elicit evidence suggesting that as a result of that, the fee needs to be reduced or otherwise reallocated because we feel that the interests of the beneficiary of my client\u2019s trust were not adequately served or were served at all in connection with this matter. So for that reason, we do object on that factor. But we are willing to stipulate as to the other, other factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 61} The instant case involved a contingent-fee agreement. Contingent-fee arrangements are generally permitted in civil cases. <em>Mueller v. Vandalia </em>(Mar. 31, 1999), 2d Dist. No. 17285, 1999 WL 197971. By choosing a contingent-fee arrangement, as opposed to an hourly-fee arrangement, a client reduces the risk to himself that is involved in litigation. As stated by the 6th District Court in <em>Landis v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 21, 1997), 6th Dist No. E-96-034, 1997 WL 77546:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cContingency fee agreements serve an important function in American life. Such agreements permit persons of ordinary means access to a legal system which can sometimes demand extraordinary expense. <em>Central Trust Co. v. Warburg </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 186, 190 [661 N.E.2d 275]. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is a contract between client and attorney whereby some or all of the risk involved in litigation is shifted to the attorney. The <em>quid pro quo </em>for relieving the client of this risk is that the agreement normally calls for the attorney to receive a percentage of any possible recovery. This would result, generally, in a somewhat greater compensation than the attorney might ordinarily receive. * * * To be sure, the contingency percentage is an arbitrary figure but, like liquidated damages in other contracts, is proper because it is a bargained for result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 63} As in the instant case, the fee is typically a third of the total recovery. <em>Landis, </em>6th Dist. No. E-96-034, 1997 WL 77546, at fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 64} A probate court is not bound by a prior agreement of the parties and may, in fact, when necessary, alter and reduce a contingent-fee agreement. <em>In re Estate of York </em>(1999), 133 Ohio App.3d 234, 243, 727 N.E.2d 607. The payment of reasonable attorney fees lies within the sound discretion of the probate court. <em>In re Estate of Fugate </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 293, 298, 620 N.E.2d 966. An abuse of discretion will be found where the probate court\u2019s decision is not supported by the record or is contrary to law. <em>In re Keller </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 650, 655, 584 N.E.2d 1312. Thus, the decision of the probate court must be based upon evidence of the actual services performed by the attorneys and upon the reasonable value of those services. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>{\u00b6 65} After reviewing the record, we find that the court abused its discretion in disregarding the contingent-fee agreement and reducing the payment of any attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 66} Initially, at the request of the probate court, appellant Amer Cunningham presented the probate court with a copy of the contingent-fee agreement for legal services signed by Doris Johnson and Dennis A. Johnson Sr., for \u201cany and all claims for injuries and damages sustained as a result of an accident that occurred on or about the 1st day of September, 1998.\u201d This document appears to have been executed on August 7, 1999, and agrees to pay the attorneys 33 1/3 percent of all moneys recovered on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 67} By judgment entry dated August 20, 1999, the probate court approved that contingency-fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 68} By entry dated December 31, 2001, the probate court approved the settlement and distribution of wrongful-death and survival claims that specifically included ordered payment of \u201c$233,333.34 for attorney fees rendered with respect to the wrongful death and survival claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 69} In its March 27, 2007 entry on the redetermination of attorney fees, the trial court determined that Amer Cunningham breached their fiduciary duty to Dennis Lee and that Amer Cunningham\u2019s fee should be reduced due to a failure of essential services.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 70} Upon review of the hearing transcript and the trial court\u2019s entry, it appears that the reduction was based on the actions of Doris after such settlement funds were distributed. While this court is sympathetic to the situation of Dennis Lee and the fact that any funds once held by Doris and Dennis Alan are long gone, we cannot find justification for the probate court\u2019s decision to solve that financial problem by ordering Amer Cunningham to return its fee, which had already been approved by the court, based on their failure to predict future occurrences.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">IY, Y, VI</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">{\u00b6 72} We shall address appellant\u2019s fourth, fifth, and six assignment of error, as they all assign error to the trial court\u2019s consideration and granting of Appellee\u2019s Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">{\u00b6 73} Initially, we find that appellant Amer Cunningham does not have standing to challenge the trial court\u2019s decision on the Civ.R. 60(B) motion/complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>{\u00b6 74} \u201cUnless a person is a party in the lower court case, the individual has no standing to appeal. See Whiteside, Ohio Appellate Practice (1996 Edition) 30, Section 1.27.\u201d <em>In re Stanley </em>(Oct. 11, 2000), Summit App. Nos. 20128, 20131, and 20132, 2000 WL 1507917. \u201cOrdinarily, in order to have the right to appeal, one must either have been a party to the case in the trial court or have attempted to intervene as a party. A person not a party to an action has no right of direct appeal from an adjudication.\u201d Painter and Dennis, Ohio Appellate Practice (2007 Ed.) Section 1:27. Thus, a person who is not a party to an action and has not attempted to intervene as a party lacks standing to appeal. <em>In re Addington </em>(July 31, 1995), Scioto App. No. 94CA2271, 1995 WL 461471, citing <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Wilson </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 349, 2 O.O.3d 471, 358 N.E.2d 605; <em>State ex rel. Lipson v. Hunter </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 225, 31 O.O.2d 453, 208 N.E.2d 133. Merely appearing in an action and making a statement does not make one a party who can appeal. <em>Addington, </em>citing <em>In re Estate of Landrum </em>(Jan. 31, 1991), Ross App. No. 1645, 1991 WL 13738. Being allowed to appear in an action and to submit a brief in the trial court likewise does not give a person a right to appeal. <em>Cincinnati v. Kellogg </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 291, 41 O.O. 293, 91 N.E.2d 505; <em>In re McAuley </em>(1979), 63 Ohio App.2d 5, 17 O.O.3d 222, 408 N.E.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">{\u00b6 75} In the instant case, the only interest appellant Amer Cunningham has is its contingent attorney fee. As we have already found that the trial court should not have reduced those fees, we find that any interest appellant may have arguably had is moot based on our previous ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant\u2019s fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 77} In appellant\u2019s seventh and final assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in determining that its attorney fees should not have been paid out of the trust set up for the support of Dennis Lee. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 78} Appellant argues that it was proper for Doris to pay Amer Cunningham\u2019s legal fees incurred in the defense of the declaratory judgment from the Dennis Lee Johnson Trust because she was sued in her capacity as a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">{\u00b6 79} Appellant is correct in its assertion that Ohio law is clear that a trustee may expend trust funds for legal services that benefit the trust. However, in the instant action, that being one of an action for fraud and misappropriation of funds against Doris personally, only Doris stood to benefit from the payment of her legal fees from the trust funds. Payment of those fees produced no benefit to the trust itself; instead, it served only to further deplete the trust assets.
