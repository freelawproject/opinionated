Murray began working for the Accounting Center of Lucas County in August 1991. On or about January 18, 1999, Murray\u2019s boss \u2014 and owner of the business \u2014 Phillip Roberts, presented her with the subject agreement and told her that if she wanted to get paid that day, she would sign it. Murray did as she was told, and she signed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">{\u00b6 3} On its face, the agreement provides that it was made \u201c[b]y and between The Accounting Center of Lucas County, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the FIRM and/or EMPLOYER), and Julie Rae Murray (hereinafter referred to as the EMPLOYEE).\u201d (Boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">{\u00b6 4} Under the heading \u201cNoncompete upon Termination,\u201d the agreement states:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201cAfter termination of employment, the employee shall not for a period of twenty-four (24) months, either directly or indirectly, without the express written consent of EMPLOYER, accept professional business or fees, either directly or indirectly, from any person who is a client of EMPLOYER * * * except as otherwise provided for in this paragraph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 6} Under a separate heading, entitled \u201cOption to Serve Clients,\u201d the agreement states that if Murray were to \u201ccontinue to choose to serve clients of the FIRM,\u201d she would be required to pay to the employer the greater of certain specified amounts of money or 125-150 percent of the billing performed for those clients by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 7} At the end of the agreement, under the heading, \u201cAssignment,\u201d there is a provision stating, \u201cEMPLOYER hereunder may transfer this Agreement and the provisions upon the merger or sale of the FIRM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 8} The entire time that Murray worked for the Accounting Center of Lucas County, she was paid hourly wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 9} In March 2004, Roberts sold his business to appellant, thereby terminating Murray\u2019s employment with the Accounting Center of Lucas County. In connection with that sale, Roberts executed an agreement entitled \u201cAssignment and Assumption Agreement\u201d with appellant\u2019s owner, Timothy Pinkelman. Pursuant to that agreement, the Accounting Center of Lucas County assigned to appellant all of its right, title, and interest in, among other things, Murray\u2019s employment-and-noncompete agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">{\u00b6 10} Following the sale of the business, Murray, without any interruption or changes in her duties, hours, or pay, began working for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">{\u00b6 11} In November 2006, appellant presented Murray with a new proposed agreement, entitled \u201cConfidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement,\u201d and a separate, individualized compensation offer relative to her continued employment \u25a0with appellant. Under the new compensation offer, Murray\u2019s pay was to have been based on commissions, rather than an hourly wage. Because Murray did not want to be paid on commission, she did not accept appellant\u2019s offer, and she did not sign the confidentiality-and-noncompetition agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">{\u00b6 12} As a result of the failure of Murray and appellant to come to a mutual agreement concerning Murray\u2019s continued employment, appellant terminated Murray\u2019s employment on or about January 2, 2007. In a letter dated January 5, 2007, appellant informed Murray that she was obligated under the provisions of the 1999 noncompete agreement and that if she violated those provisions, all available remedies would be pursued in order to protect appellant\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">{\u00b6 13} Murray acknowledges that following the termination of her employment with appellant, she performed, and continues to perform, accounting and tax-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>preparation services for various clients who were clients of appellant at the time that she was employed by appellant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">(\u00b6 14} On January 16, 2007, Murray filed a complaint in this action, seeking declaratory judgment. Appellant responded with an answer and counterclaim. The parties subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and on December 12, 2007, the trial court issued an opinion and judgment entry granting Murray\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying that filed by appellant. It is from this judgment that appellant currently appeals, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 15} I. \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that the non-compete agreement entered into between plaintiff-appellee and her former employer was not enforceable by defendant-appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 16} An appellate court reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment does so de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Civ.R. 56(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">{\u00b6 18} Summary judgment is proper where (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated and (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) when the evidence is viewed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>Ryberg v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(July 12, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-1243, 2001 WL 777121, citing <em>Toldes &amp; Son, Inc. v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 621, 629, 605 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 19} The moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact as to an essential element of one or more of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once this burden has been satisfied, the nonmoving party has the burden, as set forth at Civ.R. 56(E), to offer specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The instant case requires us to determine: (1) whether the 1999 employment-and-noncompete agreement was properly assigned to appellant when it acquired Roberts\u2019s business; and, if so, (2) whether, and to what extent, the 1999 employment-and-noncompete agreement is enforceable against Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">{\u00b6 21} Here, the assignment clause contained within the 1999 employment-andnoncompete agreement expressly provides that the agreement and its provisions are transferable upon the merger or sale of the firm. The agreement (although clearly not the product of any meaningful negotiation) was signed, and apparently assented to, by Murray. In 2004, in conjunction with Roberts\u2019s sale of the firm to appellant, the employment-and-noncompete agreement was properly assigned to appellant by way of the assignment-and-assumption agreement executed by Roberts and Pinkelman.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 22} Arguing that there was no valid assignment, Murray points out that she was not notified of the assignment at the time of the 2004 transfer of the business. In making this argument, Murray fails to cite (and this court\u2019s research fails to reveal) any authority to support her position that notification to her was required for a valid assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">{\u00b6 23} Having found that the 1999 employment-and-noncompete agreement was validly assigned, we must next determine whether, and to what extent, it may be enforced against Murray. In Ohio, reasonable noncompete agreements are enforced, and unreasonable noncompete agreements are enforced to the extent necessary to protect an employer\u2019s legitimate interest. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Stoneham </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 260, 270, 747 N.E.2d 268. \u201cA covenant restraining an employee from competing with his former employer upon termination of employment is reasonable if the restraint is no greater than is required for the protection of the employer, does not impose undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public.\u201d <em>Raimonde v. Van Vlerah </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 24} If a covenant not to compete is unreasonable, courts are empowered to modify the terms to create a reasonable covenant between the parties. <em>Rogers v. Runfola &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 5, 8, 565 N.E.2d 540. In so doing, courts should consider the following factors:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018[T]he absence or presence of limitations as to time and space, * * * whether the employee represents the sole contact with the customer; whether the employee is possessed with confidential information or trade secrets; whether the covenant seeks to eliminate competition which would be unfair to the employer or merely seeks to eliminate ordinary competition; whether the covenant seeks to stifle the inherent skill and experience of the employee; whether the benefit to the employer is disproportional to the detriment to the employee; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>whether the covenant operates as a bar to the employee\u2019s sole means of support; whether the employee\u2019s talent which the employer seeks to suppress was actually developed during the period of employment; and whether the forbidden employment is merely incidental to the main employment.\u2019 * * *.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Raimonde, </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 25, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 26} With these factors in mind, we conclude that the restraints and resultant hardships on Murray do, in fact, exceed that which is reasonable to protect appellant\u2019s legitimate business interests. Temporally, Murray is prohibited from working for customers of appellant for a period of 24 months. For 16 years, Murray has supported herself, in whole or in part, by doing tax-preparation work. She has done so by working for employers, such as appellant, and by working on her own. We find that imposing a two-year time restriction is unreasonable and will create an undue hardship on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 27} Our inquiry does not end here, however. We must next determine whether some restrictions prohibiting Murray from competing are necessary to protect appellant\u2019s business interests. The record reveals that appellant and his predecessor in interest developed a clientele with which Murray had direct contact, on a regular and ongoing basis. Certainly, appellant has a legitimate commercial interest to protect. For this reason, we find appellant\u2019s assignment of error well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b628} Balancing the restraints and projected hardships on Murray with appellant\u2019s interests, and upon the authority of <em>Raimonde, </em>42 Ohio St.2d 21, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544, and App.R. 12(B), we modify the 24-month restriction as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 29} Sixty days from the date of this order, Murray shall be prohibited for a period of one year from servicing appellant\u2019s clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 30} For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b476-11\">Handwork and Osowik, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-14\">. TPAC, Inc. and Accounting Center &amp; Tax Services, Inc. are one and the same entity, TPAC, Inc. having changed its name to Accounting Center &amp; Tax Services sometime after February 27, 2004. Thus, although the complaint in this case names both TPAC, Inc. and Accounting Center &amp; Tax Services, Inc. as defendants, there is, in fact, just one defendant corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\">. Asserting that the identity of her customers is protected and privileged, Murray, upon the advice of her counsel, has refused to identify any of the customers for which she has provided accounting and tax-preparation services since she left appellant\u2019s employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
