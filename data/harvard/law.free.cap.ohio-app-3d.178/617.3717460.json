This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 2} Payne was indicted on October 1, 2007 on one count of menacing by stalking in violation of R.C. 2903.211(A), a fourth-degree felony. The indictment alleged that on September 18, 2007, Payne continually drove his car through the neighborhood of the victim, Alesha Austin, in a manner knowingly intended to cause her mental distress. Payne pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 3} On October 10, 2007, Payne filed an affidavit of indigency, seeking appointed counsel. On October 22, 2007, the trial court appointed defense counsel for Payne. On January 7, 2008, following discovery and a pretrial hearing, the case proceeded to jury trial. Payne was convicted on January 9, 2008, and later sentenced to 18 months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 4} Payne filed a notice of appeal to this court on February 14, 2008. He raises four assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">The jury verdict under which Michael Payne was convicted of menacing by stalking was based on insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">{\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Payne contends that his conviction was based on insufficient evidence as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">{\u00b6 6} When considering a challenge based on the sufficiency of the evidence, this court must determine whether the prosecution has met its burden of production. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (Cook, J., concurring). In determining whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction, a court must view that evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-15\">An appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Payne was convicted under R.C. 2903.211, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">(A)(1) No person by engaging in a pattern of conduct shall knowingly cause another person to believe that the offender will cause physical harm to the other person or cause mental distress to the other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 7} Payne challenges the sufficiency of the evidence leading to his conviction with respect to two elements of the offense: the victim\u2019s mental distress or, alternatively, the victim\u2019s belief that the offender would cause physical harm to the victim; and the existence of a \u201cpattern of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 8} The Ohio Revised Code defines \u201cmental distress\u201d as any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">\u201c(a) Any mental illness or condition that involves some temporary substantial incapacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c(b) Any mental illness or condition that would normally require psychiatric treatment, psychological treatment, or other mental health services, whether or not any person requested or received psychiatric treatment, psychological treatment, or other mental health services.\u201d R.C. 2903.211(D)(2)(a), (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Austin testified that \u201c[she] was afraid to leave\u201d because Payne was driving down her street, explaining that \u201cI didn\u2019t know what he was going to do. * * * I didn\u2019t know why he was riding past my house.\u201d She later testified that she was terrified for approximately six hours. The officer who arrived at the scene following a call placed by Myron Austin, the victim\u2019s father, described her demeanor as \u201cintimidated, nervous, very timid, like something was wrong.\u201d He also noted that \u201c[s]he seemed kind of fearful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">{\u00b6 9} Austin\u2019s inability to leave her house due to her fear of Payne is sufficient to find that she suffered some \u201ctemporary substantial incapacity\u201d due to the mental distress caused by Payne\u2019s conduct. \u201cSubstantial incapacity does not mean that the victim must be hospitalized, or totally unable to care for herself. Incapacity is substantial if it has a significant impact upon the victim\u2019s daily life.\u201d <em>State v. Horsley, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, 2006 WL 648849, at \u00b6 48. It is sufficient that Austin was so fearful as to be unable to leave her home for the approximately six and one-half hours Payne continued to drive past. This incident, albeit brief, made a significant impact on Austin\u2019s daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">{\u00b6 10} Evidence may also be considered in light of the recent history between the victim and the defendant. <em>State v. Secession, </em>9th Dist. No. 23958, 2008-Ohio-2531, 2008 WL 2192808, at \u00b6 9. Austin testified that her relationship with Payne was \u201ca rocky one\u201d and that he was \u201cabusive mentally and physically,\u201d describing the time during which they were dating as \u201cvery, very stressful.\u201d Austin also testified that Payne had been previously convicted of domestic violence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>her, from which she received an injury to her right eye, and that Payne\u2019s past actions had made her afraid of him. She recounted an incident in which Payne followed her while she was riding in a cab, prompting the cab driver to stop a police cruiser. Considering such evidence in the light most favorable to the state, Austin had ample reason to fear that Payne would cause her physical injury. We therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Payne caused mental distress to Austin.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 11} Payne also contends that his actions did not constitute a \u201cpattern of conduct,\u201d claiming that he engaged in only a single act that day \u2014 driving through Alesha Austin\u2019s neighborhood. The statute defines \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d as \u201ctwo or more actions or incidents closely related in time.\u201d R.C. 2903.211(D)(1). However, we consider each of Payne\u2019s acts of driving past Austin\u2019s home a separate \u201caction\u201d or \u201cincident\u201d under the statute. At least two of the state\u2019s witnesses saw Payne drive past Austin\u2019s home multiple times. Barbara Walker testified that \u201c[Payne] passed by here at least twice.\u201d Also, Myron Austin testified that he \u201cpersonally saw him\u201d drive by \u201c[a]t least three or four\u201d times.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 12} To determine whether two or more incidents were \u201cclosely related in time,\u201d the incidents in question should be resolved by the trier of fact \u201c \u2018considering the evidence in the context of all the circumstances of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middletown v. Jones, </em>167 Ohio App.3d 679, 2006-Ohio-3465, 856 N.E.2d 1003, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State v. Honeycutt, </em>2d Dist. No. 19004, 2002-Ohio-3490, 2002 WL 1438648, at \u00b6 26. Walker testified that Payne began driving past Austin\u2019s house around 2:45 p.m., shortly before Austin and her father arrived home. Alesha Austin testified that Payne continued to drive past Austin\u2019s home until around 9:00 p.m., when the police arrived. The relatively short time between each of the incidents, taken in the context of Austin\u2019s prior relationship with Payne and the belief that he may have intended to cause her physical harm, renders them \u201cclosely related in time.\u201d This constitutes a \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d sufficient for the jury to find Payne guilty of violating the statute. Accordingly, Payne\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">The trial court erred by improperly admitting certain evidence of other acts attributed to Michael Payne.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">{\u00b6 13} In his second assignment of error, Payne argues that the trial court improperly admitted testimony from his former girlfriend, Sharon Kaiser, regarding his history of violence during and after their relationship. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">{\u00b6 14} We review the admission of Kaiser\u2019s testimony under an abuse-of-discretion standard. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Trial courts have broad discretion over whether to admit or exclude relevant, admissible evidence as unduly cumulative or prejudicial. Evid.R. 403(B); see also <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, at \u00b6 172, quoting <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Payne\u2019s counsel objected to questions as to why Kaiser\u2019s relationship with Payne was \u201c[hjorrible,\u201d Kaiser\u2019s testimony that Payne entered her home without her permission, and her state of mind \u201cwhen that was going on,\u201d as well as to Kaiser being allowed to read from a 1999 complaint she had filed against Payne. Menacing by stalking, normally a first-degree misdemeanor, is a fourth-degree felony if a jury finds that any of eight circumstances exist. R.C. 2903.211(B)(2). One of the circumstances is where the offender has a history of violent acts toward the victim or \u201cany other person.\u201d R.C. 2903.211(B)(2)(e). Another exists where the offender has a prior menacing-by-stalking conviction. R.C. 2903.211(B)(2)(a). In this case, the state offered Kaiser\u2019s testimony both to show Payne\u2019s history of violence in their relationship, as well as to prove Payne\u2019s prior menacing-by-stalking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 15} Payne concedes that Kaiser\u2019s testimony was admitted for a proper purpose, as an alternative to admission as proof of motive pursuant to R.C. 2945.59. Nevertheless, he contends that in light of the other evidence presented, under Evid.R. 403, Kaiser\u2019s testimony was unduly cumulative and prejudicial. However, neither R.C. 2903.211 nor Evid.R. 403(B) limits the state to one method of proof. Payne\u2019s felony conviction could have been based on any of four factors, including his history of violence toward Kaiser or Austin, or either of his prior convictions for domestic violence or menacing by stalking. Conversely, the jury could have chosen to discount evidence of any or all of the other factors as of little or no weight. Thus, the trial court did not allow a \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 16} Neither do we find the admission of Kaiser\u2019s testimony to be unfairly prejudicial to Payne. Although relevant, evidence may be inadmissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Evid.R. 403(A). However, the decision of whether to exclude evidence under 403(A) lies with the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Kaiser\u2019s testimony was highly probative of two of the eight circumstances in which Payne\u2019s offense could be enhanced from a misdemeanor to a felony. We are unconvinced that in light of this probative value, the trial court was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable\u201d in admitting Kaiser\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, Payne\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">Michael Payne received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel did not object to all \u201cother acts\u201d evidence offered by the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 17} In his third assignment of error, Payne claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the admission of State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4 and Kaiser\u2019s testimony as to Payne\u2019s prior bad acts. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 18} In considering a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, this court employs a two-step process. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 669, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. First, we must determine whether trial counsel engaged in a \u201c \u2018substantial violation of any * * * essential duties to his client.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141, 538 N.E.2d 373, quoting <em>State v. Lytle </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 396, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623. Second, we must determine if the trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness resulted in prejudice to the defendant. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373, quoting <em>Lytle, </em>48 Ohio St.2d at 396-397, 2 O.O.3d 495, 358 N.E.2d 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAn appellate court may analyze the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test alone if such analysis will dispose of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that the defendant did not suffer sufficient prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Kordeleski, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA008046, 2003-Ohio-641, 2003 WL 294360, at \u00b6 37, citing <em>State v. Loza </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 83, 641 N.E.2d 1082. A defendant may demonstrate prejudice in cases where there is a reasonable probability that the trial result would have been different but for the alleged deficiencies of counsel. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, at paragraph three of the syllabus. To make a sufficient showing of prejudice, a defendant must demonstrate that \u201c \u2018counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial * * * whose result is reliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Colon, </em>9th Dist. No. 20949, 2002-Ohio-3985, 2002 WL 1800274, at \u00b6 48, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 20} We fail to see how exclusion of Sharon Kaiser\u2019s testimony, along with State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4, would have changed the outcome for Payne. As previously noted, even had the trial court excluded Kaiser from testifying, there existed sufficient evidence to find Payne guilty of each of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and subject him to the enhancement provision in R.C. 2903.211(B)(2). He also would have remained subject to R.C. 2903.211(B)(2)(e) as an offender with a \u201chistory of violence toward the victim or * * * of other violent acts toward the victim,\u201d as Alesha Austin\u2019s testimony made clear. Payne has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for the alleged errors of his trial counsel. Accordingly, Payne\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">The indictment filed against Michael Payne was invalid pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 21} In his fourth assignment of error, Payne argues that his indictment was invalid because it was initialed, rather than signed, by the grand jury foreperson. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 22} Ohio law requires that an indictment be indorsed by the foreperson, by including the words <em>\u201ca </em>true bill\u201d and subscribing his or her name. R.C. 2939.20. Ohio courts have long recognized a signature by mark as legally valid where the signer intended to be so bound. <em>In </em>re <em>Young </em>(1978), 60 Ohio App.2d 390, 393, 14 O.O.3d 359, 397 N.E.2d 1223, quoting <em>Sterba v. Lienhard </em>(App.1950), 95 N.E.2d 12, 58 Ohio Law Abs. 65. Ohio courts have also held that a foreperson\u2019s initials are a sufficient subscription. <em>State v. Creasey </em>(2001), 8th Dist. Nos. 65717 and 65718, 2001 WL 1167121, at \u00b6 14, citing <em>Dun v. State </em>(1922), 17 Ohio App. 10; see also R.C. 2939.20. Therefore, Payne\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 23} Payne\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AIq\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b663-11\">Slaby and Whitmore, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
