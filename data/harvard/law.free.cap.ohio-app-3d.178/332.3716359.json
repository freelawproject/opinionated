For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\">{\u00b6 2} In March 2007, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a four-count indictment against Rogers charging two counts of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and two counts of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Rogers entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. The case proceeded to a jury trial, where the following evidence was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 3} San Pedro Garcia testified first for the state. He said that on the evening of March 16, 2007, he was driving home from the movies with his nephew and his two children when he saw a man, whom he later identified as Rogers, \u201cworking on [his] brother\u2019s truck.\u201d San Pedro\u2019s brother is Jesus Garcia. San Pedro said that he thought it was his cousin working on the truck, so he yelled to him. But the man, whom he did not know, turned around and said, \u201cNo, I am working on Dave\u2019s truck.\u201d San Pedro knew that the truck was Jesus\u2019s truck, so he walked over to the man. Meanwhile, San Pedro told his daughter in Spanish to get Jesus. San Pedro testified that he could tell from Rogers\u2019s demeanor that Rogers \u201cknew his gig was up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 4} San Pedro explained that Rogers \u201chad a hammer in his hand\u201d and was \u201cstealing the radiator and taking parts off the truck.\u201d San Pedro said that Rogers already had the radiator hoses cut and the bolts off of it. He said that Rogers had other tools too, such as \u201csockets, wrenches, [and] screwdrivers.\u201d San Pedro also stated that he knew Rogers had a knife as well because he had cut the radiator hoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 5} San Pedro further testified that Rogers tried to hit him with the hammer, but he \u201cgrabbed the hammer off [Rogers].\u201d He said that Rogers \u201cpulled on it,\u201d and he told Rogers, \u201cYou not going nowhere.\u201d San Pedro \u201cripped the [hammer] off him,\u201d and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d At that point, San Pedro explained that Rogers told him, \u201cCome on, man, I just need a couple bucks * * *. Times are hard,\u201d and \u201cI just need a couple extra dollars to get something to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 6} Jesus arrived at the scene and began looking at the truck to determine what was missing. San Pedro testified that Rogers \u201cgrabbed for something out of his side,\u201d and that is when he hit Rogers with the hammer and they began to fight. Jesus joined in the struggle and hit Rogers with a baseball bat. The police arrived about five or ten minutes later and detained Rogers. San Pedro said his arm was twisted in the fight, and his injuries included tendonitis in his \u201carmpit area,\u201d bruising, and soreness.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 7} On cross-examination, San Pedro admitted that he never saw Rogers with a knife throughout the entire incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 8} Jesus Garcia testified next for the state. He explained that his niece told him that there was somebody \u201cmessing\u201d with his truck. He went \u201cout there and [he] saw [his] brother with this guy [whom he identified as Rogers] against the hood, and he was wrestling a hammer with him.\u201d He saw San Pedro take the hammer from Rogers. Jesus said that Rogers appeared to be intoxicated. Jesus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>testified that Rogers was \u201clike, oh, man, oh, man, don\u2019t call the police. I have to get money for my family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 9} Jesus explained that \u201cat that time, [Rogers] started reaching for his waistband\u201d and was struggling to get away. Jesus looked inside his truck and saw that the radiator hoses had been cut and the bolts removed. Jesus saw that San Pedro was still struggling with Rogers, so he grabbed a baseball bat from the back of the truck and hit Rogers with it. The police soon arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 10} On cross-examination, Jesus admitted that he never saw Rogers with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 11} Next to testify was Officer Ryan Ross of the Cleveland Police Department. Officer Ross said that he received a radio call that there was a \u201ctheft in progress.\u201d When he and his partner arrived at the scene, he saw San Pedro and Jesus \u201cholding down the defendant in the snow.\u201d Officer Ross said that he handcuffed Rogers immediately and placed him inside the police cruiser. When he later patted Rogers down, he found a knife in his pocket. Rogers told the officers that he had been victimized and injured. Officer Ross explained that he also found Rogers\u2019s backpack at the scene that was full of tools, including \u201cthree screwdrivers, pry bars, [a] box cutter, [and] pliers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 12} Officer Ross said that they took Rogers to the emergency room, but he explained that Rogers became very \u201c[disruptive to the ER staff,\u201d and the staff told him he had to leave, so the officers escorted him out of the hospital and took him to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 13} Detective Gregory Cook of the Cleveland Police Department testified last for the state. He said that he interviewed Rogers in jail. Rogers told him that he had been walking down an alley when he was approached by two people who \u201caccused him of stealing from their car and they assaulted him.\u201d Detective Cook said that Rogers also told him that he was hit with a hammer and a baseball bat, that he had been working on a friend\u2019s radiator and that is why he had radiator fluid on his hands, and that he had the tools because he had been doing home improvements on a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 14} At the close of the state\u2019s case, Rogers moved for a Crim.R. 29 acquittal on all counts, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 15} Rogers took the stand on his own behalf. He testified that he was \u201ccoming back from a friend\u2019s house\u201d with his \u201cbackpack and tools\u201d when he thought, \u201cI need a couple dollars so I can get back to work.\u201d He explained that he had seen the truck parked at this abandoned house \u201cfor months,\u201d with a flat tire, busted out grill, and the back window shattered. He said that he lifted the hood of the truck and soon after, was assaulted by two men with a hammer and baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Rogers further stated, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt nobody. I\u2019m just trying to take a radiator out of a truck. I didn\u2019t know he owned it. I didn\u2019t try to rob him.\u201d Rogers said that he had had his pocket knife as a \u201cwork tool.\u201d He explained that it was \u201c[n]ot a robbery. It was a petty theft, if anything.\u201d He said that he \u201cneeded a few dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 17} On cross-examination, Rogers testified that he did not tell Detective Cook that he was stealing because he thought he \u201cwas just taking something somebody did not want.\u201d He said that when San Pedro first yelled at him, he pulled the name Dave \u201cout of the air.\u201d He admitted that San Pedro came up to him and asked him what he was doing; San Pedro did not just assault him. Rogers said that he did not have a conversation with San Pedro, however, because he was \u201cleaning * * * under the hood taking it apart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 18} Rogers further stated that he had grabbed his tools when San Pedro came up to him because he was going to put them in his backpack and try to get away from San Pedro. Rogers explained that he was trying to leave \u201cbecause [San Pedro] was trying to hit [him] with the hammer from stealing the radiator.\u201d But Rogers denied that he \u201craised [his] hammer\u201d or \u201cswung at them.\u201d He said that he was \u201cway bigger than him\u201d and \u201ccould have banged him upside the head and ran.\u201d Rogers added, \u201cI wasn\u2019t about to compound my stupidness into major crap.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 19} Rogers also admitted having prior felonies, including assault on a police officer, drug possession, and assaulting an inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 20} The jury found Rogers guilty of two counts of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), one count of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), and one count of theft, as a lesser included offense of robbery, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court sentenced Rogers to two years in prison on each of the three robbery convictions, and ordered that they be served concurrently with one another. It also sentenced him to six months in the county jail on the theft conviction and ordered that it be served concurrently with the robbery convictions in prison. Accordingly, Rogers was sentenced to an aggregate term of two years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 22} It is from this judgment that Rogers appeals, raising two assignments of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c[1] The trial court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal as to the charges when the state failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[2.] Appellant\u2019s conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>DEFECTIVE INDICTMENT UNDER COLON</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">{\u00b6 25} We will first consider an issue that Rogers raised at oral argument. Rogers contends that under <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon </em>/\u201d), which was released after he submitted his brief, his convictions for robbery should be vacated. We agree with Rogers that one of his convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) should be vacated, but not the two convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 26} The indictment charging Rogers included four counts of robbery: two counts as a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and two counts as a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). As in <em>Colon I, </em>the indictment here merely echoed the robbery statute and \u201cdid not expressly charge the mens rea element of the crime of robbery.\u201d <em>Colon I </em>at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 2911.02(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control;</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">R.C. 2911.02(A)(2): INFLICT PHYSICAL HARM</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Colon I, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201cR.C. 2911.02(A)(2) does not specify a particular degree of culpability for the act of \u2018inflict[ing], attempting] to inflict, or threatening] to inflict physical harm,\u2019 nor does the statute plainly indicate that strict liability is the mental standard.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. Because \u201c \u2018recklessness is the catchall culpable mental state for criminal statutes that fail to mention any degree of culpability,\u2019 \u201d the state was required to prove that the defendant \u201crecklessly inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13-14, quoting <em>State v. Lozier, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-732, 803 N.E.2d 770, at \u00b6 21. Because the indictment failed to charge \u201cthat the physical harm was recklessly inflicted,\u201d it omitted one of the essential elements of the crime of robbery and thus, was defective. Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">{\u00b6 32} In determining whether an indictment that fails to charge an essential element can be raised for the first time on appeal, the Supreme Court applied a structural-error analysis, rather than a plain-error analysis. Id. at \u00b6 19. It described \u201cstructural errors\u201d as constitutional defects that \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless error\u2019 standards\u201d because they \u201c \u2018affect[ ] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [being] an error in the trial process itself.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 20. It further reasoned, \u201c \u2018 \u201csuch errors permeate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>[t]he entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end so that the trial cannot \u2018reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 309, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, quoting <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 33} Having found the indictment defective, and having determined that the defect was a structural error, the Supreme Court held, \u201cWhen an indictment fails to charge a mens rea element of a crime and the defendant fails to raise that defect in the trial court, the defendant has not waived the defect in the indictment.\u201d Id. at the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 34} On July 31, 2008, the Supreme Court reconsidered <em>Colon I. </em>See <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169 <em>(\u201cColon II\u201d). </em>It made clear that \u201cthe rule announced in <em>Colon I </em>is prospective in nature and applies only to those cases pending on the date <em>Colon I </em>was announced.\u201d <em>Colon II </em>at \u00b6 5. It explained, \u201cWe assume that the facts that led to our opinion in <em>Colon I </em>are unique\u201d and \u201cemphasize[d] that the syllabus in <em>Colon I </em>is confined to the facts in that case.\u201d <em>Colon II </em>at \u00b6 6, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 35} We must now consider whether the holding in <em>Colon I, </em>as reconsidered, implicates Rogers\u2019s conviction for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). The indictment charging Rogers under this provision is substantially identical to the indictment in <em>Colon I. </em>As in <em>Colon I, </em>the indictment against Rogers failed to include language alleging that he \u201crecklessly\u201d inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict physical harm on another and thus, it omitted an essential element of the crime. Furthermore, there is no question that Rogers\u2019s appeal was pending on the date <em>Colon I </em>was announced. Accordingly, Rogers\u2019s conviction for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) (count three of the indictment) must be reversed and vacated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">R.C. 2911.02(A)(1): DEADLY WEAPON</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 36} Rogers\u2019s other two robbery convictions, under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), require a separate analysis. <em>Colon I </em>did not address whether recklessness is the mens rea for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1). The Ohio Supreme Court, however, has previously addressed whether recklessness is an element of robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>under this provision. See <em>State v. Wharf </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 375, 715 N.E.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Wharf, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cthe General Assembly intended that a theft offense, committed while an offender was in possession or control of a deadly weapon, is robbery and no intent beyond that required for the theft offense must be proven.\u201d Id. at 377, 715 N.E.2d 172. Further, the court held that \u201cby employing language making mere possession or control of a deadly weapon, as opposed to actual use or intent to use, a violation, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) be a strict liability offense.\u201d Id. at 378, 715 N.E.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, because the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) is a strict liability offense and that the deadly-weapon element does not require the mens rea of recklessness, we conclude that the provisions of that section of the robbery statute are unaffected by the holding in <em>Colon I. </em>Therefore, we conclude that <em>Colon I, </em>as reconsidered, is not applicable to Rogers\u2019s two convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) (counts one and two of the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 39} In the remaining two assignments of error, we will address only Rogers\u2019s sufficiency and manifest-weight issues as they relate to his convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and not R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). We will not consider his misdemeanor theft conviction (as a lesser included offense of robbery) either, because Rogers admits that he had been trying to take the radiator, and further concedes that it was \u201cpetty theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">SUFFICIENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 40} In his first assignment of error, Rogers argues that his convictions for robbery were not supported by sufficient evidence. Specifically, he contends that although \u201c[t]here is no question that [Rogers] was trying to take the radiator,\u201d he did not intend to hurt anyone, and he did not brandish the knife to San Pedro or Jesus.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 41} An appellate court\u2019s function in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jenks </em>at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 42} Thus, we must determine whether the state presented sufficient evidence such that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers committed robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1), the state had to present sufficient evidence that Rogers, while committing or attempting to commit a theft, had \u201ca deadly weapon on or about [his] person or under [his] control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 43} Again, Rogers admits that he was trying to take the radiator. He argues, however, that it was not robbery because San Pedro and Jesus admitted they never saw him with a knife. The state points out that the deadly weapon was not the knife, but the hammer. Indeed, the indictment specifies that the deadly weapon was a hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 44} Under R.C. 2923.11(A), \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is defined as \u201cany instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 45} As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Wharf:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cAccording to the statutory language, possession of a deadly weapon is all that is required to elevate a theft offense to robbery. See <em>State v. Merriweather </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 57, 59, 18 O.O.3d 259, 413 N.E.2d 790. In fact, R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) provides that the offender need not have actual physical possession of the weapon but only that it be \u201cunder [his or her] control.\u201d See <em>State v. Brown </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 349, 351, 588 N.E.2d 113. * * * Thus, no use, display, or brandishing of a weapon, or intent to do any of the aforementioned acts, is necessary according to the plain language of the statute. Had the legislature so intended, it certainly could have required a level of conduct more severe than it did in order to show a violation of the statute. Thus, by employing language <em>making mere possession or control of a deadly weapon, as opposed to actual use or intent to use, </em>a violation, it is clear to us that the General Assembly intended that R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) be a strict liability offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wharf, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 377-378, 715 N.E.2d 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 47} At the jury trial, San Pedro testified that Rogers had had a hammer in his hand when he was taking parts off of the radiator. San Pedro further stated that when he walked up to Rogers, Rogers tried to hit him with the hammer, but that San Pedro was able to grab it from him. Jesus testified that he saw San Pedro and Rogers \u201cwrestling\u201d over a hammer and then saw San Pedro take the hammer from Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 48} Officer Ross corroborated this testimony, stating that when he responded to a \u201ctheft in progress,\u201d San Pedro and Jesus had Rogers pinned to the ground. Rogers also told Officer Ross that the backpack full of tools was his, including \u201cthree screwdrivers, pry bars, [a] box cutter, [and] pliers.\u201d Although Rogers did not specifically state that the hammer was his, we can infer that since the backpack full of tools was his, so was the hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">{\u00b6 49} Viewing this testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of robbery proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Rogers\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">MANIFEST WEIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 50} In his second assignment of error, Rogers argues that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Again, Rogers admits to committing theft. Thus, we must determine only whether Rogers\u2019s convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) were against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 51} In <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cAlthough a court of appeals may determine that a judgment of a trial court is sustained by sufficient evidence, that court may nevertheless conclude that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence. * * * Weight of the evidence concerns \u2018the inclination of the <em>greater amount of credible evidence, </em>offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other. * * * Weight is not a question of mathematics, but depends on its <em>effect in inducing belief\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cWhen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and disagrees with the factfinder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. * * * \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 54} With this standard in mind, we conclude that Rogers\u2019s convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. San Pedro testified that he saw Rogers bent over the truck, working on it. When San Pedro approached Rogers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Rogers had a hammer in his hand and tried to hit San Pedro with it. Jesus testified that he saw San Pedro and Rogers wrestling over the hammer. San Pedro said he was able to get the hammer from Rogers and then he hit Rogers with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">{\u00b6 55} Although Rogers testified that he was confronted \u201cby two brothers with a hammer and a baseball bat and was beaten,\u201d we conclude that the jury did not clearly lose its way by believing San Pedro and Jesus over Rogers. We find this to be especially true because Rogers initially denied to Officer Ross that he had been trying to steal the radiator. And Detective Cook testified that Rogers told him that he was just \u201cwalking down an alley\u201d when he was approached by two people who assaulted him with a hammer and a baseball bat. At trial, however, Rogers completely changed his \u201cstory,\u201d and admitted that he was \u201cjust trying to take a radiator out of a truck\u201d when he was assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 56} Accordingly, after weighing all the evidence and all reasonable inferences, we conclude that this was not the \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which the evidence weighed heavily against the convictions. Rogers\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 57} Rogers\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled. His supplemental assignment raised at oral argument with respect to his conviction under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) is sustained, and therefore, his conviction under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) (count three of the indictment) is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 58} Thus, the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part (with respect to Rogers\u2019s two convictions for robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and his conviction for theft as a lesser included offense of robbery); reversed in part (with respect to count three, robbery as a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)); and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-9\">Sweeney, A.J., and Rocco, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>8th Dist. No. 88895, 2007-Ohio-5843, 2007 WL 3203040, the appellant had argued that his indictment charging robbery under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) was defective, but conceded that he did not argue it below. This court, \"[a]dhering to [its] precedent\u201d in <em>State v. Colon, </em>8th Dist. No. 87499, 2006-Ohio-5335, 2006 WL 2899957, held that he had waived this issue because he did not raise it below. After the Supreme Court reconsidered <em>Colon I, </em>it reversed <em>Davis </em>in a one-paragraph opinion, stating only that it was reversed \"on the authority of <em>[Colon </em>I].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 113, 2008-Ohio-3879, 892 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 2.
