This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">{\u00b6 2} On January 8, 2007, Gary Bickel was charged with one count of being an intoxicated pedestrian on a public highway, in violation of R.C. 4511.481, one count of failure to control, in violation of R.C. 4511.202, and two counts of driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(d). Bickel pleaded not guilty to these charges. Simultaneously, Bickel was charged with one count of obstructing official business, in violation of R.C. 2921.31, and one count of resisting arrest, in violation of R.C. 2921.33. The record indicates that on January 9, 2007, Bickel pleaded not guilty to both these charges. On May 25, 2007, the matter proceeded to a bench trial. After the state rested its case, Bickel moved for a Crim.R. 29 directed verdict. The state conceded that it had produced insufficient evidence to support the resisting-arrest charge but challenged the motion as to the obstructing-official-business charge. The trial court granted Bickel\u2019s motion, finding that the state did not present sufficient evidence to convict him of resisting arrest. While the defense did not raise it as grounds for its motion, the court on its own found that Bickel was not arraigned on the obstructing-official-business charge. The basis of the trial court\u2019s finding that Bickel was not arraigned on the obstruction-of-official-business charge is unclear. According to the record, Bickel was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge on January 9, 2007. The entry of plea was signed by a magistrate. Further, the record contains an \u201cAppearance and Entry of Plea\u201d filed on January 9, 2007, and signed by Bickel and his counsel. In this document, Bickel pleaded not guilty to obstruction of official business and demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">{\u00b6 3} At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court found Bickel guilty of being an intoxicated pedestrian on a public highway and not guilty on the remaining charges. The court\u2019s journal entry states that Bickel \u201cwas not arraigned on [R.C.] 2921.33 or 2921.31. Accordingly, the court grants [Bickel\u2019s] directed verdict on these charges.\u201d The state sought, and was granted, leave to appeal from the decision, raising one assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">The trial court erred as a matter of law in granting [Bickel\u2019s] motion for acquittal as to the charge of obstructing official business, in violation of [R.C. 2921.31], based upon [Bickel] not being previously arraigned on the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">{\u00b6 4} In its sole assignment of error, the state contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in granting Bickel\u2019s motion for acquittal as to the charge of obstructing official business in violation of R.C. 2921.31, based upon Bickel not having been previously arraigned on the charges. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">{\u00b6 5} We must first note that ordinarily the state is not afforded the right to appeal from a directed verdict of acquittal. R.C. 2945.67 grants the state the right to appeal \u201cby leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, <em>except the final verdict, </em>of the trial court in a criminal case.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>added.) The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a directed verdict is a final verdict for purposes of R.C. 2945.67. <em>State v. Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E.2d 629, paragraph two of the syllabus. In a bench trial, jeopardy attaches when the judge begins to receive evidence. <em>State v. Meade </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 419, 424, 687 N.E.2d 278, citing <em>Crist v. Bretz </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 28, 35, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24, and <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co. </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 564, 569, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642. \u201c[T]he principles of double jeopardy preclude retrial of [a defendant].\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>5th Dist. No. 03 CA-A-07038, 2004-Ohio-2804, 2004 WL 1194064, at \u00b6 8. Even so, the issue is not moot if \u201c \u2018the underlying legal question is capable of repetition yet evading review.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Storer v. Brown </em>(1974), 415 U.S. 724, 737, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714, fn. 8. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[a] court of appeals has discretionary authority pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A) to review substantive law rulings made in a criminal case which result in a judgment of acquittal so long as the judgment itself is not appealed.\u201d <em>State v. Bistricky </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, syllabus. In the instant case, the state moved to appeal on the grounds that \u201cthe [t]rial [c]ourt erred as matter of law in granting the Defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal as to the charge of Obstructing Official Business, in violation of [R.C.] 2921.31, and Resisting Arrest, in violation of [R.C.] 2921.33, based upon the Defendant not being previously arraigned on the charges.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSubstantive law\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he part of the law that creates, defines, and regulates the rights, duties, and powers of parties.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1470. Essentially, by granting Bickel\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion on the basis that he was not arraigned, the trial court created a material element to the charge, imposing a duty on the state to prove the issue. Accordingly, we find that this is a substantive issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 6} Next, we note that the state is not appealing from the judgment itself. Specifically, the state \u201crecognizes that a reversal of the Trial Court\u2019s ruling will not result in reinstatement of the charges.\u201d We find that the state is appealing from a ruling that resulted in a judgment of acquittal, not the final verdict itself. <em>Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, at syllabus. Finally, we find that this issue is capable of repetition. Without review, it is possible that the trial courts in our district will continue to grant a directed verdict on the basis that there was some defect in the arraignment. Accordingly, we find that this appeal is properly before us to review whether a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal can be granted on the ground that the defendant was not arraigned. See <em>Davis, </em>2004-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Ohio-2804, 2004 WL 1194064, at \u00b6 11 (\u201cthe question raised must be one of substantive law and capable of repetition.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">{\u00b6 7} In the instant case, the trial court found that Bickel \u201cwas not arraigned on [R.C.] 2921.33 or 2921.31. Accordingly, the court grants [Bickel\u2019s] directed verdict on these charges.\u201d However, the purposes of Crim.R. 29 and the purpose of an arraignment are separate and distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 8} Crim.R. 29(A) provides that a trial court \u201cshall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d Thus, the purpose of a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal is to test the legal sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Dayton v. Rogers </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 162, 163, 14 O.O.3d 403, 398 N.E.2d 781, overruled on other grounds, <em>State v. Lazzaro </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 261, 667 N.E.2d 384. A trial court may not grant an acquittal by authority of Crim.R. 29(A) if the record demonstrates \u201cthat reasonable minds can reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of a crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Wolfe </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 215, 555 N.E.2d 689, paragraph one of the syllabus. In making this determination, all evidence must be construed in a light most favorable to the prosecution. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe purpose of an arraignment is to inform the accused of the charges made against him and to allow him to offer an answer to those charges.\u201d <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(Mar. 24, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APA06-740, 1998 WL 134321, *2. Crim.R. 12(C)(1) requires that any objections or defenses based upon defects in the institution of the prosecution be made prior to trial. Accordingly, if a defendant fails to raise an issue regarding the arraignment prior to trial, he has forfeited the objection. Crim.R. 12(H). By continuing to trial despite several trial notices containing the obstructing-official-business charge and by cross-examining the state\u2019s witnesses about it, Bickel forfeited any objection he may have had to the alleged failure to arraign him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, an arraignment is clearly not a prerequisite for a finding that the state presented sufficient evidence at trial to convict Bickel on the indicted charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 10} An arraignment is not an element of obstructing official business. See R.C. 2921.31. The trial court erred by imposing a material element on the state that the legislature did not intend to impose. The lack of an arraignment cannot be used as a basis to find that the evidence presented by the state on the material elements of the charge was insufficient. See Crim.R. 29(A). Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue. However, as we stated above, our decision does not affect Bickel, as double jeopardy precludes retrial. <em>Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>2004-Ohio-2804, 2004 WL 1194064, at \u00b6 8. We make no judgment as to the sufficiency of the evidence presented on the obstructing official business charge,' as that question is not before us. The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 11} The state\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b578-8\">Whitmore and Dickinson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. Despite its notice of appeal, the state only refers to the obstructing-official-business charge in its assignment of error. Accordingly, we will confine our discussion to that charge.
