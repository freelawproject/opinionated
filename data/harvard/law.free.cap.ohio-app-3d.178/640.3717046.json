Buford was indicted for robbery, a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) and a felony of the second degree. A jury found Buford guilty, and he was sentenced to a term of .four years\u2019 incarceration for the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">{\u00b6 2} Buford initially asserted the following assignment of error for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cDefendant\u2019s conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">{\u00b6 4} While Buford\u2019s appeal was pending on direct review, the Ohio Supreme Court decided <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon </em>I\u201d), and <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169 <em>(\u201cColon II\u201d) </em>(on reconsideration). We sua sponte ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the issue of whether and how <em>Colon I </em>applies to Buford\u2019s conviction. The state did not submit a supplemental brief. Buford submitted the following supplemental assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cI. Appellant Buford meets <em>Colon II </em>criteria for <em>Colon I </em>reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cII. Appellant\u2019s indictment for robbery was defective by failing to include the mens rea element thereby violating his constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 7} We first address, jointly, the two errors raised in Buford\u2019s supplemental brief. In <em>Colon I, </em>the defendant was indicted for robbery, as was Buford. Colon\u2019s indictment omitted the mens rea element of \u201crecklessness\u201d for the mens rea element of inflicting harm. The Ohio Supreme Court found that the defective indictment constituted \u201cstructural error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 8} Structural errors are constitutional defects that defy analysis by harmless-error standards because they affect the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply being an error in the trial process itself. Such errors permeate the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end so that the trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence. A structural error mandates a finding of per se prejudice. <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 9} The court concluded that a defendant who fails to challenge, in the trial court, a defective indictment that omits the mens rea element of a crime does not waive his right to challenge the defect on appeal. Id. at \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 10} On a motion for reconsideration, the court in <em>Colon II </em>explained that its ruling in <em>Colon I </em>was to be applied prospectively and only to those cases pending when <em>Colon I </em>was announced. Id. at \u00b6 5. Further, <em>Colon II </em>emphasized that the facts of <em>Colon I </em>were \u201cunique\u201d and that a structural-error analysis of a defective indictment would be appropriate only in \u201crare\u201d cases, where \u201cmultiple errors\u201d follow the defective indictment. Id. at \u00b6 6, 8. <em>Colon II </em>held that the syllabus of <em>Colon I </em>was to be confined to the facts in that case. Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 11} The \u201cmultiple errors\u201d found to follow the defective indictment in <em>Colon I </em>included (1) the defendant\u2019s lack of notice that the mens rea element of robbery was recklessness, (2) the state\u2019s failure to prove the element of recklessness, (3) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on a mens rea element of recklessness, and (4) in closing arguments, the state\u2019s treatment of robbery as a strict-liability offense. This court has held that we will apply <em>Colon </em>I\u2019s structural-error analysis only to cases that present all of the <em>Colon I </em>factors. <em>State v. Mason, </em>6th Dist. No. L-06-1404, 2008-Ohio-5034, 2008 WL 4409432, \u00b6 61; <em>State v. Moss, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1401, 2008-Ohio-4737, 2008 WL 4278176, \u00b6 17. In all other cases, a plain-error analysis applies to challenges of defective indictments first raised on appeal. <em>Colon II, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Moss, </em>2008-Ohio-4737, 2008 WL 4278176, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">{\u00b6 12} We have also held that where a defendant is charged with a crime other than a violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(2), <em>Colon I </em>will not apply. <em>State v. Walker, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1156, 2008-Ohio-4614, 2008 WL 4183337, \u00b6 72, following <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number><em>Hill, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-889, 2008-Ohio-4257, 2008 WL 3878363, \u00b6 36; <em>State v. Solether, </em>6th Dist. No. WD-07-053, 2008-Ohio-4738, 2008 WL 4278210, \u00b6 74, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 13} Here, Buford was indicted only for robbery, under the same single section at issue in <em>Colon I. </em>Buford may, therefore, challenge his indictment for the first time on appeal, as his appeal was pending when <em>Colon I </em>was announced. <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, syllabus. We therefore proceed to apply the four factors of <em>Colon </em>I\u2019s structural-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 14} First, Buford\u2019s indictment was defective. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe jurors of the Grand Jury of the State of Ohio, within and for Lucas County, Ohio, * * * do find and present that Clever Watkins and Donald Buford, on or about the 16th day of April, 2007, in Lucas County, Ohio, in attempting or committing a theft offense, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense as defined in \u00a7 2913.02 of the Revised Code, did inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another, in violation of \u00a7 2911.02(A)(2) of the Ohio Revised Code, Robbery, being a felony of the second degree * *</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 16} As in <em>Colon I, </em>Buford\u2019s indictment omits recklessness as the mens rea element of the offense of robbery. Therefore, according to <em>Colon </em>I, Buford\u2019s indictment is constitutionally defective. Id. at \u00b6 29. Because of the error, Buford was not \u201cproperly informed of the charge so he could put forth his defense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28. Buford\u2019s due process rights were violated, as no evidence in the record demonstrates that Buford had \u201cnotice that the state was required to prove that he had been reckless in order to convict him of the offense of robbery.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 17} Second, the record shows that no evidence was presented during trial establishing that Buford was reckless in inflicting harm. During opening arguments, the state explained that the evidence would show that Buford, with his co-defendant and several others, accosted the victims on the street and demanded one victim\u2019s shoes. When the victim did not comply, Buford punched the victim, and a fight between the groups ensued. One victim was seriously injured, and two others had minor injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 18} As in <em>Colon I, </em>during opening arguments and through trial, the state did not argue that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct in inflicting physical harm on the victim constituted reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 30. During closing arguments, as in <em>Colon I, </em>the state treated robbery as a strict-liability offense. The state did not argue that Buford acted recklessly in inflicting harm. The prosecutor did detail the harm inflicted upon the victims. But at no time did the prosecutor argue that Buford possessed the requisite mental state when he inflicted harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Although the state briefly mentioned the terms \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cpurpose,\u201d the terms were couched inside of rhetorical questions \u2014 questions which the jury had no guidance to answer. The state\u2019s mention of \u201cpurpose\u201d occurred when explaining that the defendants beat up the victims <em>in order to </em>commit a theft offense. While this argument differs from that quoted in <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 31, the two arguments are functionally equivalent insofar as they presented the actus reus without presenting an attached mens rea.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">{\u00b6 20} Additionally, neither Buford\u2019s trial counsel nor the co-defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued in closing that the state was required to prove a mens rea for the offense. Buford\u2019s trial counsel referred to the co-defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s closing arguments and his review of the required elements of robbery. The co-defendant\u2019s trial counsel reviewed the elements of robbery in his closing arguments, but treated robbery as a strict-liability offense. Neither of the defendants\u2019 trial counsel, then, indicated awareness that recklessness was a necessary element of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 21} Fourth, the trial court failed to include the required culpable mental state for the offense in its jury instructions. After defining evidentiary rules and credibility determinations, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe defendants are charged with robbery. Before you can find defendants guilty you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 16th day of April, 2007, and in Lucas County, Ohio, the defendants did in committing or attempting to commit a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the commission or attempted offense inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThere are three elements that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the defendants can be found guilty of robbery. They are that the defendants did: One, attempt to commit or commit a theft offense, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense inflict or attempt to inflict or threaten to inflict physical harm on another. Three is venue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 24} As to the first element, attempt to commit or commission of a theft offense, the court instructed the jury regarding \u201cknowingly,\u201d the required culpable mental state for that act. As to the element of inflicting harm, the court instructed:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b625} \u201cElement two, inflict, attempt to inflict or to inflict physical harm. Physical harm means any injury, illness or any other physiological impairment regardless of its gravity or duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe act of inflicting or attempting to inflict physical harm must occur during or immediately after the commission or attempt to commit a theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cProof of fear or apprehension on the part of the victim is not required. Criminal attempt has been defined for you on page seven and applies here as well. Threat includes direct and indirect threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 28} The jury was not instructed that Buford must have been reckless in inflicting harm. The jury instructions on the act element of inflicting harm should have paralleled the instructions for the act of attempt to commit or commission of a theft offense. See <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-640, 2008-Ohio-3827, 2008 WL 2932005, \u00b6 47-48, discussing revisions to the Ohio Jury Instructions in light of <em>Colon I </em>and <em>Colon II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 29} In sum, the defective indictment was constitutionally flawed such that Buford had no notice that the state was required to prove recklessness as an element of the offense. The state treated robbery as a strict-liability offense and at no time argued that Buford possessed the requisite mental state. Buford\u2019s trial counsel and his co-defendant\u2019s trial counsel also treated robbery as a strict-liability offense in their closing arguments, demonstrating that Buford lacked notice of the elements of the offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court failed to include recklessness in its jury instructions. Buford\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the deficient jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 30} These facts mirror the factors present in <em>Colon I. </em>Due to these circumstances, as in <em>Colon I, </em>\u201cthere is no evidence in the record that the jury considered whether the defendant was reckless in inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict physical harm, as is required to convict under R.C. 2911.02(A)(2).\u201d <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 31. Neither Buford nor the jury was aware of the state\u2019s responsibility to prove the required culpable mental state. As in <em>Colon I, </em>the defective indictment permeated Buford\u2019s trial, resulting in structural error. <em>Colon I, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, Buford\u2019s first and second supplemental assignments of error are well taken. His indictment was constitutionally defective as it omitted a required element of the offense. The \u201cmultiple errors\u201d that occurred at Buford\u2019s trial mirror the multiple errors found to constitute structural error in <em>Colon I </em>and <em>Colon II. </em>His initial assignment of error, challenging his conviction on manifest weight grounds, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>{\u00b6 32} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s conviction must be vacated. The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this case is remanded to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-6\">Arlene Singer and Thomas J. Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\">. At least one appellate court has held that where the record demonstrates that the defendant had notice of the required mental state through his trial counsel's argument, no prejudice results from the defective indictment. <em>State v. Vance, </em>5th Dist. No. 2007-COA-035, 2008-Ohio-4763, 2008 WL 4286633, \u00b6 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
