Johns Manville argues that the order from which Keller has appealed is not final and appealable. Keller has filed the memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, as has the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d). Finally, Johns Manville filed a reply memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss. This matter is now decisional.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">{\u00b6 2} Keller was injured while in the employ of Johns Manville in 1997. On November 2, 2006, Keller filed a motion with the BWC to have her original 1977 injury claim additionally allowed for the new conditions of degenerative arthritis, left knee, and lateral meniscus tear, left knee. The Ohio Industrial Commission allowed Keller\u2019s claim for the additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">{\u00b63} Johns Manville filed a notice of appeal to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. Keller filed a complaint, and Johns Manville, as well as the BWC, filed answers to the complaint. Keller voluntarily dismissed the complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a), with the right to refile within one year. Johns Manville filed a motion to reinstate the case to the court\u2019s docket, stating that Keller had failed to obtain its consent prior to voluntarily dismissing her appeal. As grounds for its motion to reinstate, Johns Manville stated that R.C. 4123.512(D), revised by Senate Bill 7 in 2006, now provides that a \u201cclaimant may not dismiss the complaint without the employer\u2019s consent if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>employer is the party that filed the notice of appeal to the court pursuant to this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">{\u00b6 4} The judge of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas granted Johns Manville\u2019s motion to reinstate, finding that Keller\u2019s November 2, 2006 motion requesting allowance of additional conditions was a new claim having been made after the effective date of the revisions to R.C. 4123.512(D) and, therefore, the new revisions apply. On July 21, 2008, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas reinstated Keller\u2019s complaint and set the matter for trial. It is from this order reinstating Keller\u2019s complaint that she has filed her appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 5} Johns Manville argues that the trial court\u2019s July 21, 2008 order is not final and appealable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(A) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(1) \u2018Substantial right\u2019 means a right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(2) \u2018Special proceeding\u2019 means an action or proceeding that is specially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law or a suit in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(3) \u2018Provisional remedy\u2019 means a proceeding ancillary to an action, including, but not limited to, a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, attachment, discovery of privileged matter, suppression of evidence, * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(1) * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">{\u00b6 13} Our analysis of this issue begins with a case from the Second District Court of Appeals, <em>Anderson v. Sonoco Prods. Co. </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 305, 678 N.E.2d 631. In that case, which is also a workers\u2019 compensation case, the procedure was identical to that in the instant case up to the point when the trial court ruled on the employer\u2019s motion to strike the voluntary dismissal. Unlike the instant case, in which the motion to strike was granted, the common pleas court in <em>Sonoco </em>denied the motion finding that the claimant could legitimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>dismiss his claim under Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Sonoco Products appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">{\u00b6 14} The Second District raised the issue of appealability sua sponte. The court held that the order denying Sonoco\u2019s motion to strike the voluntary dismissal is final and appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), since workers\u2019 compensation cases are special proceedings and the denial of the motion affected a substantial right of Sonoco\u2019s, because if Sonoco had to wait to appeal from this order until after the case was refiled and heard, it would be denied a meaningful remedy from the allegedly unlawful order. The court explained that because Anderson would continue to receive benefits during the time between the voluntary dismissal and the date of refiling his complaint, and Sonoco would not be able to recoup those benefits if they were later determined to have been unnecessarily paid, the voluntary dismissal affected a substantial right of Sonoco\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">{\u00b6 15} In 2007, this court heard two workers\u2019 compensation appeals from orders that denied an employer\u2019s motion to strike claimant\u2019s voluntary dismissal pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1). In the first of those two cases, <em>Rohloff v. FedEx Ground, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1182, 2007-Ohio-6530, 2007 WL 4277886, \u00b6 10, this court stated that it \u201chas determined that this appeal is taken from a final appealable order.\u201d We did not state on what basis we made this determination. However, <em>Anderson v. Sonoco Prods. Co., 112 </em>Ohio App.3d 305, 678 N.E.2d 631, supports that determination. The second case, <em>Morrin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1173, 2007-Ohio-6888, 2007 WL 4464969, relies solely on <em>Rohloffhut </em>does not address the appealability issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">{\u00b6 16} Admittedly, the instant case is different from both <em>Rohloff </em>and <em>Morrin </em>in that the order appealed from in this case <em>granted </em>the employer\u2019s motion to strike the claimant\u2019s voluntary dismissal. This precise situation is present in a case recently addressed by this court, <em>Miller v. Land-O-Sun Dairies, L.L.C., </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1382, 2008-Ohio-2098, 2008 WL 1921713. In that case, this court decided an appeal that was taken from an order granting the employer\u2019s motion to strike the claimant\u2019s voluntary dismissal. We did not address the issue of appealability in that case, and it was not raised by either party. We find, however, that such an order is final and appealable, and we were not remiss in hearing that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">{\u00b6 17} Following the analysis used in the <em>Anderson </em>case, we find that the order appealed in this present case is appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). This case is a special-proceeding workers\u2019 compensation case, as was <em>Anderson. </em>We find that Dorothea Keller\u2019s right to dismiss her complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) is a \u201csubstantial right,\u201d in that it is a right that \u201ca rule of procedure\u201d entitles her \u201cto enforce or protect,\u201d as stated in R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). Finally, we find that Keller\u2019s substantial right is affected by the court\u2019s order, because if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>must wait to appeal until after a trial on the merits of her claim from the order requiring her to prosecute her complaint immediately, and it is later determined that she should have been allowed to dismiss the complaint and refile it within a year following the voluntary dismissal, she would have been denied the opportunity to have additional time for discovery and to prepare her case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 18} We acknowledge Johns Manville\u2019s argument that the order reinstating the complaint does not affect a substantial right of Keller\u2019s because the revision to the workers\u2019 compensation law clearly states that Keller had to obtain her employer\u2019s consent before dismissing the complaint under Civ.R. 41. However, this argument goes to the merits of Keller\u2019s appeal, which raises the issue of whether her claim arose in 1997, when she was originally injured, or in 2006, when she moved for an additional condition. We will not determine the appealability of an order on the basis of the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 20} We note that appellant has failed to attach a copy of the judgment she is appealing to her notice of appeal and has not filed a praecipe and docketing statement, as required by 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 3. Appellant is ordered to rectify these omissions within ten days of the date of this decision, or her appeal will be subject to dismissal. It is so ordered. We further note that the record on appeal in this case was due to be filed on or before September 17, 2008, and that it has not been filed as of October 17, 2008. We sua sponte grant an extension of time to file the record within 15 days of the date appellant files her praecipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b733-9\">Pietrykowski, P.J., and Handwork and Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-13\">. An identical motion was mistakenly filed by Johns Manville on October 7, 2008. Finding that this motion merely duplicates the original motion, the court hereby orders the October 7, 2008 motion stricken from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\">. Johns Manville cites <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, in support of its argument. However, the <em>Myers </em>case involves a discovery order in a workers\u2019 compensation case, not a dismissal order, and is not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
