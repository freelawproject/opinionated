For the following reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 2} Clara Marsh is the mother of Richard Marsh and Elaine Grayson. Elaine is married to John Grayson.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 3} On July 26, 2006, John filed an application to be appointed Clara\u2019s guardian in the Greene County Probate Court, alleging that Clara was suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia. The following day, John requested an order permitting the sale of Clara\u2019s condominium, located at 1524 Dee Anne Drive, to proceed to closing. John further asked that 68 percent of the proceeds be held in escrow while 32 percent be distributed to Richard, the co-owner. Following the sale, the court ordered, as agreed by the parties, that Richard be distributed $71,279.07 from the sale of the condominium and that the balance be deposited into an account of Clara Marsh pending further order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 4} After an independent mental evaluation of Clara, the probate court held a hearing on John\u2019s petition on January 31, 2007. At the hearing, Richard also requested to be appointed Clara\u2019s guardian. The court found that both John and Richard were \u201chonorable and descent [sic]\u201d men, and it noted that Clara preferred Richard to be her guardian. The court noted, however, that Richard resided near Cleveland and that John would be in a better position to make immediate health-care decisions for Clara due to the proximity of John\u2019s home to Clara\u2019s residence. The probate court appointed John as guardian of Clara\u2019s person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">{\u00b6 5} From the record, it is clear that the relationship between Richard and the Graysons has deteriorated since the filing of John\u2019s petition and his subsequent appointment as Clara\u2019s guardian. In May 2007, Richard objected to the guardian\u2019s inventory filed on April 2, 2007. Richard claimed that the inventory improperly included proceeds from the sale of the condominium, which he held jointly with Clara with right of survivorship. Richard also claimed that the inventory failed to include certain personal property of Clara\u2019s, including a grandfather clock. In June 2007, Richard moved for John to be removed as guardian and that he be appointed her guardian. Richard claimed that Clara had been unnecessarily placed in a secured nursing home facility and that he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>been allowed to stay with her per John\u2019s instructions. Richard also claimed that he was not provided medical information about his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 6} After a hearing, the probate court denied the motion to remove John as guardian. The court found that Clara\u2019s grandfather clock had been gifted to Elaine and was properly excluded from the inventory, that certain items on the inventory belonged to Richard, and that the proceeds of the sale of the condominium were properly distributed. Richard appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 7} Clara died on March 26, 2008. At that time, Richard had filed his appellant\u2019s brief, but John had not yet filed an appellee\u2019s brief. Since that time, both parties have addressed the effect of Clara\u2019s death on this appeal. We have agreed with the parties that the issues concerning the guardianship and inventory of Clara\u2019s estate are not moot and that this appeal should proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 8} Richard raises three assignments of error, which we will address in an order that facilitates our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">{\u00b6 9} Richard\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found that the grandfather clock was gifted to Elaine Grayson by an <em>inter vivos </em>gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">{\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, Richard asserts that the trial court erred in finding that Clara\u2019s grandfather clock had been gifted to Elaine, because John failed to establish Clara\u2019s donative intent and delivery to Elaine. In response, John asserts that this assignment of error is moot, because it is undisputed that Clara intended for Elaine to have the grandfather clock upon her death. Alternatively, John argues that the circumstances surrounding the clock\u2019s distribution indicated that Elaine received the clock as an inter vivos gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">{\u00b6 12} Beginning with the issue of mootness, the parties agreed throughout the probate court proceeding that Elaine would be entitled to the grandfather clock upon her mother\u2019s death based on Clara\u2019s will. Both Richard\u2019s and John\u2019s appellate briefs expressed this purported fact. On June 2, 2008, however, Richard filed a motion to stay this appeal until the Greene County Probate Court determined which of two documents was the last will and testament of Clara Marsh. Richard attached a handwritten will, dated August 19, 2006, that expressed that Clara was leaving \u201ceverything\u201d to Richard and his wife. Because Elaine would not receive the grandfather clock under the alleged August 19, 2006 will if it were found to be valid, we find that the issue of ownership of the grandfather clock is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"Apj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cAn <em>inter vivos </em>gift is an \u2018 \u201cimmediate, voluntary, gratuitous and irrevocable transfer of property by a competent donor to another.\u201d \u2019 <em>Helton v. Helton </em>[ (1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 683, 685, 683 N.E.2d 1157], quoting <em>Smith v. Shafer </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 181, 183, 623 N.E.2d 1261. The essential elements of an <em>inter vivos </em>gift are: 1) intent of the donor to make an immediate gift, 2) delivery of the property to the donee, and 3) acceptance of the gift by the donee.\u201d <em>Fricke v. Martin-Fricke </em>(May 18, 2001), Greene App. No. 00-CA-57, 2001 WL 523946. \u201cWhether the requisite elements of a gift \u2014 donative intent, delivery, and acceptance \u2014 have been proved is a mixed question of law and fact that must be determined from all the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Kenney </em>(May 13, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13384, 1993 WL 169113.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 14} According to Clara\u2019s January 7, 2004 will, which John presented at the hearing, Clara stated: \u201cThe contents of the condo are for you both to share and to decide whatever you wish to do. The grandfather clock is for Elaine \u2014 I hold an insurance policy on it paid yearly. I feel it necessary in a tornado area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 15} In January 2006, Clara moved to Elmcroft, an assisted living facility, which provided her a smaller apartment. The record establishes that the family met twice in early 2006 to clean Clara\u2019s condominium in preparation for its sale. At those times, the family divided among themselves some of the property that Clara would not be using at her new apartment. The main distribution occurred between March 15 and April 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 16} John testified that there was an auctioneer, identified at Clara\u2019s request, who inventoried the personal property. Elaine\u2019s daughter, Leslie, took a large amount of \u201cgarage sale-type stuff.\u201d Elaine and John took the grandfather clock, and it is now in their home. Richard testified that his daughter received Clara\u2019s dining-room set from the condominium and that she now has it. The residual items were sold at auction for $3,500. Neither the dining room set nor the grandfather clock were listed in the April 2007 inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 17} John testified that Clara was aware that Elaine had the grandfather clock in their home. John stated that Clara \u201ccame over to our house on several occasions after that, we showed her where the clock was. She looked at it admiringly and was glad it was working.\u201d John stated that Clara complimented him on getting the clock moved, set up, and balanced without the aid of a mover.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">{\u00b6 18} Based on the testimony, we conclude that the probate court properly determined that Elaine had received the grandfather clock by a valid inter vivos gift. Although Clara had originally intended that the grandfather clock and her other possessions in the condominium should be dispersed upon her death, the evidence established that Clara was aware of and approved of the distribution of personal property in her condominium upon her move to Elmcroft. Although Clara did not personally deliver the items to various family members, Clara\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>statements to John expressed her approval that Elaine and John had the grandfather clock at their home. There is no evidence that Clara intended to retain an ownership interest in the clock after its removal from the condominium.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 19} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 20} Richard\u2019s third assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to distribute one-half of the sale proceeds from the property to Richard Marsh as the survivorship tenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 22} Richard asserts that the probate court erred in determining that the $102,424.82 placed in a Merrill Lynch account, representing Clara\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the condominium, belonged to Clara and that Richard had no interest in those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 23} In June 2003, Richard and Clara purchased a condominium located at 1524 Dee Anne Drive in Xenia, Ohio, for approximately $165,000. Richard contributed $56,750 toward the purchase of the condominium and Clara contributed $114,831. Soon after the purchase, Clara and Richard executed a quit-claim deed, rendering them joint tenants with right of survivorship. In August 2006, Clara and Richard sold the property for $175,000. The total sale proceeds amounted to $173,703.89. Richard received $71,279.07, and the balance ($102,-424.82) was ultimately placed into Clara\u2019s Merrill Lynch account.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">{\u00b6 24} Richard\u2019s arguments regarding his entitlement to Clara\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the condominium have evolved during the course of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">{\u00b6 25} In August 2006, prior to the appointment of a guardian, the court oversaw the sale of 1524 Dee Anne Drive. On August 17, 2006, the court, by agreement of the parties, ordered distribution of $71,279.07 to Richard and the balance to an account for Clara, to be held pending further order of the court. After receiving the April 2007 inventory, Richard objected, in part on the ground that the inventory \u201cincluded certain funds in the form of proceeds of sale of real estate which he held jointly with the right of survivorship with the Ward.\u201d At the hearing, Richard argued that Clara\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the condominium should have been placed in a Neuberger Berman joint-survivorship investment account. Richard argued then that Clara intended for him to have the condominium upon her death and, therefore, he had a continued survivorship interest in the proceeds from the sale. Richard did not assert during that hearing that he was entitled to an additional $15,572.88 of the proceeds as a 50 percent owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>{\u00b6 26} In his memorandum in support of his objections, which was filed after the hearing, Richard first asserted that he was entitled to an additional $15,572.88 as a joint owner with an equal right to the property. Richard continued to assert that Clara\u2019s proceeds should also be placed in a joint-survivorship investment account.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 27} On appeal, Richard contends that he should have received 50 percent of the sale proceeds. He argues that the deed rendered him a survivor-ship tenant and that the deed failed to negate the presumption that he and Clara owned the property equally. Richard asserts that he is entitled to $15,572.88, so that both he and Clara would receive $86,851.95. Richard no longer argues that Clara\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the condominium should have been placed in a survivorship investment fund. (Although Richard has apparently abandoned his argument that Clara\u2019s proceeds should have been placed in a survivorship investment account, we would have agreed with the probate court that this argument lacked merit. A survivorship tenancy may exist only in real property, and it does not extend to sale proceeds. <em>Reifv. Reif </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 804, 808-809, 621 N.E.2d 1279. Accordingly, Richard\u2019s survivorship interest in the condominium terminated with its sale.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 28} In response, John argues that the court properly approved the inclusion of $102,424.82 in the inventory as Clara\u2019s property. John asserts that the probate court was not bound by the form of the deed and that it properly considered the proportional investments of the parties. John states that Richard received a larger percentage of proceeds than he had contributed to the purchase and that Richard is not entitled to a greater share of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b629} R.C. 5302.20 sets forth the requirements to create a survivorship tenancy. R.C. 5302.20(B) provides: \u201cIf two or more persons hold an interest in the title to real property as survivorship tenants, each survivorship tenant holds an <em>equal share </em>of the title during their joint lives unless otherwise provided in the instrument creating the survivorship tenancy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also R.C. 5302.20(C)(4) (stating that the enforcement of a lien against a survivorship tenant results in the conversion of a survivorship tenancy to the tenancy in common with each tenant in common being \u201cequal unless otherwise provided in the instrument creating the survivorship tenancy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 30} In this case, the probate court found that Clara \u201ccontributed $102,424.00 to the purchase of [the condominium], and she is entitled to same free and clear of any claim of Richard Marsh. * * * Each party received his or her apportioned share and neither party has a lien or hold on the othersf] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 31} Although the probate court\u2019s determination can be considered a fair result, we find that the present circumstances are governed by R.C. 5302.20. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The quit-claim deed between Richard and Clara created a survivorship tenancy. Nothing in the deed indicated that Richard\u2019s and Clara\u2019s ownership would be based on their proportional contributions toward the purchase price. Thus, as joint tenants with right of survivorship, Richard and Clara were equal owners of the condominium. See <em>Burge v. Preuss, </em>Athens App. No. 04CA35, 2005-Ohio-1054, 2005 WL 567310 (noting that execution of valid survivorship deed makes then-unmarried couple equal owners of property). As noted by the Ninth District, \u201c[h]ad the legislature intended to make joint and survivorship ownership that of a separate, proportional share of the ownership interest, it could have used such language.\u201d <em>West v. West </em>(Mar. 13, 2002), Wayne App. No. 01CA45, 2002 WL 388845, at fn. 2. Consequently, when the real estate was sold, Richard was entitled to an equal share of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 32} This result seems to comport with Clara\u2019s intent when creating the survivorship tenancy. As Clara wrote on January 7, 2004:</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cI am sure you know that if it were not for Richard I would not be in this Condominium today. He wanted it for me as much as I and he did all he could do to get it. I am most grateful. Richard and I own this house equally. There is a recorded document (a survivorship deed) that leaves the condo to Richard at my demise. It is only right that I do this for him. He has done everything he could (physically and financially) because he wanted this move as much as I. I sincerely hope that this will not cause any friction between my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 34} John asserts that we may \u2014 and should \u2014 look past the survivorship deed in this instance. John notes that courts have stated in the context of domestic-relations cases that the court is not bound by the title in determining marital and separate property. E.g., <em>Williams-Booker v. Booker, </em>Montgomery App. Nos. 21752 and 21767, 2007-Ohio-4717, 2007 WL 2685057, at \u00b623, citing R.C. 3105.171(H). Several cases discussing partitions have also stated that when the ownership interest is not stated in the deed, the parties are presumed to have equal interests, but this interest may be rebutted with evidence that the parties contributed unequally to the purchase of the property. We note, however, that these cases generally have been applied where the property is held as tenants in common. See <em>Bryan v. Looker </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 228, 640 N.E.2d 590. We find each of these situations distinguishable and find no basis for applying these principles in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 35} The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 36} Richard\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to remove John Grayson as the guardian and appoint an independent guardian to serve the best interest of Clara Marsh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 38} In his second assignment of error, Richard contends that John should have been removed as guardian and an independent guardian appointed, because John \u201cneglected his duty by putting his bias and ill-will against Richard Marsh ahead of the best interests of Clara Marsh.\u201d Richard claims that John failed to provide him detailed medical and financial information regarding Clara, that John directed Elmcroft to change the locks on Clara\u2019s apartment so that Richard could not spend the night with her, that John failed to include the grandfather clock on the guardian\u2019s inventory, and that there was open hostility and lack of communication between Richard and the Grayson family. Richard cites <em>In re Guardianship of Simmons, </em>Wood App. No. WD-02-039, 2003-Ohio-5416, 2003 WL 22319415, to support his contention that an independent guardian was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 39} Under R.C. 2109.24, the probate court may remove a fiduciary, such as a guardian, due to the fiduciary\u2019s failure to file an inventory. The court may also remove a fiduciary \u201cfor habitual drunkenness, neglect of duty, incompetency, or fraudulent conduct, because the interest of the property, testamentary trust, or estate that the fiduciary is responsible for administering demands it, or for any other cause authorized by law.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 40} A probate court\u2019s decision regarding the removal of guardians will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>In re Estate of Shaw, </em>Greene App. No. 2004 CA 111, 2005-Ohio-4743, 2005 WL 2179300, at \u00b6 18. An abuse of discretion implies more than an error of law or judgment, but rather, suggests that the trial court acted in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. \u201cThe probate court, as a trier of fact, has the discretion to determine what weight will be afforded to the evidence, and a presumption exists that the findings of the trier of fact are correct.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Worth </em>(June 20,1997), Darke App. No. 1430, 1997 WL 335559, *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">{\u00b6 41} It is well established that a guardianship ends with the death of the ward. <em>Simpson v. Holmes </em>(1922), 106 Ohio St. 437, 439, 140 N.E. 395. Upon the ward\u2019s death, the \u201csole duty [of the guardian] is to render an account of his stewardship up to the date of his ward\u2019s death.\u201d Id. at 439, 140 N.E. 395; see <em>State ex rel. Hards v. Klammer, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 104, 2006-Ohio-3670, 850 N.E.2d 1197, at \u00b6 12 (\u201c[A] guardian has the power after the ward\u2019s death to make a proper accounting and settlement of any acts taken in regard to the ward\u2019s assets\u201d); <em>Swift v. Gray, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2007-T-96, 2008-Ohio-2321, 2008 WL 2045018, \u00b6 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>{\u00b6 42} Initially, we note that most of Richard\u2019s bases for replacing the guardian are no longer relevant. Because Clara is deceased, Richard\u2019s concerns about communication with the guardian regarding Clara\u2019s medical and financial condition and visitation issues \u2014 in other words, the guardianship of Clara\u2019s person\u2014 are now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 43} The only remaining issue is Richard\u2019s concern that John\u2019s inventory report was unsatisfactory. Because John has the responsibility to file a final accounting after Clara\u2019s death, we consider whether the probate court erred in refusing to replace John as guardian of Clara\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 44} John filed his first inventory report \u2014 the accounting challenged by Richard \u2014 on April 2, 2007. The inventory listed four assets: (1) jewelry consisting of a gold bracelet and a two-ring wedding set, (2) a Merrill Lynch account totaling $163,160.68, (3) a Fifth Third Bank checking account with $369.57, and (4) Elmcroft apartment furnishings, consisting of furniture, costume jewelry, and clothes, valued at approximately $5,000. John reported Clara\u2019s income from Social Security as $16,476.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 45} In objecting to the inventory, Richard argued that it failed to include the grandfather clock, that the apartment furnishings included items that belonged to him, and that proceeds from the sale of the condominium were improperly placed in the Merrill Lynch account rather than an account with right of survivorship to Richard. At the September 10, 2007 hearing, Richard presented evidence that a television set, a box spring and mattress, and several other items belonged to him. Richard also presented evidence that he and his mother owned the condominium with right of survivorship. Richard\u2019s and Clara\u2019s contributions toward the purchase of the condominium were undisputed. The probate court agreed with Richard that he owned some of the apartment furnishings, but the probate court otherwise overruled Richard\u2019s objections to the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">{\u00b6 46} As discussed above, we have already determined that the probate court did not err in its rulings regarding the grandfather clock. Although we agree with Richard that he is entitled to an additional $15,572.88 from the sale proceeds, we note that the $102,424.82 in the Merrill Lynch account was placed in an account of Clara\u2019s pursuant to an August 2006 order of the probate court. We find no fault with John\u2019s inclusion of the entire amount in the inventory, and we see no evidence that John has mismanaged Clara\u2019s accounts. Accordingly, we find no basis for removing John as guardian due to the making and filing of the guardian\u2019s inventory. The probate court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to remove John as guardian of Clara\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 47} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 48} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-7\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
