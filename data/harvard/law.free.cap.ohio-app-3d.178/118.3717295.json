Charvat, plaintiff-appellant, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, in which the court granted summary judgment to Farmers Insurance Columbus, Inc. (individually, \u201cFarmers\u201d); Lonnie Perlman Insurance Agency, Inc. (individually, \u201cPerlman Agency\u201d), and Lonnie Perlman (individually, \u201cPerlman\u201d), defendants-appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 2} Perlman is the sole shareholder of and sales agent for Perlman Agency. Perlman sells insurance products offered by Farmers. In early 2005, Perlman consulted with Farmers in an effort to increase his sales. Farmers suggested he contact \u201cTake the Lead,\u201d a telemarketing company promoted by Farmers on Farmers\u2019 website that provides sales leads. Perlman contacted Take the Lead and ordered leads from its service. Appellant\u2019s name was one of the leads received by Perlman. As part of its services, Take the Lead provided an introductory letter and phone call to prospective insurance customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b6 3} On April 21, 2005, Take the Lead placed an introductory telemarketing call to appellant\u2019s residence for the purpose of selling Farmers insurance (\u201cfirst call\u201d), during which appellant requested that his telephone number be placed on its do-not-call list and that he be sent a copy of its do-not-call maintenance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">{\u00b6 4} After the initial call, Take the Lead forwarded appellant\u2019s name and telephone number to Perlman, although Take the Lead did not inform Perlman that appellant had requested to be put on the do-not-call list. On June 27, 2005, Perlman\u2019s employee called appellant\u2019s residence (\u201csecond call\u201d). On July 13, 2005, Perlman\u2019s employee called appellant\u2019s residence again (\u201cthird call\u201d). On July 18, 2005, Perlman\u2019s employee called appellant\u2019s residence again (\u201cfourth call\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">{\u00b6 5} On September 18, 2006, appellant filed a complaint, asserting in 43 separate causes of action that the calls violated the Telephone Consumer Protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tion Act of 1991, Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code et seq. (\u201cTCPA\u201d); the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, R.C. 1345.01 et seq. (\u201cCSPA\u201d); and Ohio\u2019s consumer advertising regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">{\u00b6 6} On June 25, 2007, Farmers filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was not liable for any calls made to appellant and that even if it were liable, appellant was limited to only one claim per call. Also on June 25, 2007, Perlman and Perlman Agency filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Perlman was not personally liable, appellant was limited to one claim per call, Perlman and Perlman Agency were not liable for the first call, judgment should be entered against Perlman Agency for $2,100 and the case terminated, and appellant was not entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 7} On November 15, 2007, the trial court issued a decision, which it journalized on December 4, 2007. In the decision and judgment, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment; dismissed all claims against Farmers and Perlman; ordered an award of $2,100 to appellant; and denied appellant\u2019s request for attorney fees. Specifically, the court found that Perlman and Farmers were not liable for any of the claims related to any of the four calls; no appellees were liable for any claims related to the first call; appellant could recover from Perlman Agency for violations of the TCPA and CSPA for only the second, third, and fourth calls; appellant could not recover treble damages against Perlman Agency because its violations of the TCPA were not knowing or willful; and appellant could not recover attorney fees pursuant to the CSPA. Appellant appeals the judgment of the trial court, asserting the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">[I.] The trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s claims against appellee Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc., because the calls were made to appellant for the benefit of, at the expense of, by an agent of, and at the direction of, appellee Farmers Insurance of Columbus, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">[II.] The trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s claims against appellee Lonnie Perlman because he personally authorized the unlawful telemarketing activities conducted by his own insurance agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">[III.] The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s ninth, seventeenth, thirtieth and forty-third causes of action because it is undisputed that appellees failed to state, at the beginning of each of their four telephone calls to appellant, that the purpose of the call was to make a sale, as is required by O.A.C. 109:4-3-ll(A)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">[TV.] The trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellees as to appellant\u2019s tenth cause of action because it is undisputed that, in making their first call to appellant, appellees used a fictitious name that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>not been registered with the Ohio Secretary of state, which constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A) and R.C. 1329.01. [V.] The trial court erred in denying plaintiffs claim for treble damages by applying the wrong definition of \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201cknowing\u201d to appellees\u2019 conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed his claims against Farmers because the calls were made to appellant for the benefit of, at the expense of, by an agent of, and at the direction of Farmers. When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, courts must proceed cautiously and award summary judgment only when appropriate. <em>Franks v. Lima News </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 408, 672 N.E.2d 245. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Ferreri </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 587, 589, 639 N.E.2d 1189. When reviewing the judgment of the trial court, an appellate court reviews the case de novo. <em>Franks, </em>109 Ohio App.3d 408, 672 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it granted Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment based upon a finding that the phone calls were not placed \u201con behalf of\u2019 Farmers. In support, appellant cites several sections from the TCPA and federal regulations. Section 227(c)(5), Title 47, U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">(5) Private right of action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or <em>on behalf of the same entity </em>in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">(C) both such actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">(Emphasis added.) Section 64.1200(d)(3) and (5), Title 47, C.F.R. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-12\">(d) No person or entity shall initiate any call for telemarketing purposes to a residential telephone subscriber unless such person or entity has instituted procedures for maintaining a list of persons who request not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of that person or entity. The procedures instituted must meet the following minimum standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">(3) Recording, disclosure of do-not-call requests. If a person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes (or <em>on whose behalf such a call is made) </em>receives a request from a residential telephone subscriber not to receive calls from that person or entity, the person or entity must record the request and place the subscriber\u2019s name, if provided, and telephone number on the do-not-call list at the time the request is made. Persons or entities making calls for telemarketing purposes (or <em>on whose behalf such calls are </em>made) must honor a residential subscriber\u2019s do-not-call request within a reasonable time from the date such request is made. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">(5) Affiliated persons or entities. In the absence of a specific request by the subscriber to the contrary, a residential subscriber\u2019s do-not-call request shall apply to the particular business entity making the call (or <em>on whose behalf a call is made), </em>and will not apply to affiliated entities unless the consumer reasonably would expect them to be included given the identification of the caller and the product being advertised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant asserts that the above language contemplates the liability of the organization on whose \u201cbehalf\u2019 telemarketing calls are made. While it is undisputable that the provisions above provide for liability of an entity on whose behalf telemarketing calls are made, we conclude that Farmers cannot be subject to liability pursuant to these provisions. Although there is no recording of the second call, appellant recorded the first, third, and fourth calls. The following conversation transpired between appellant and a representative from Take the Lead during the first call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">Resident: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">Sales agent: Is Philip available?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">Resident: This is him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">Sales agent: Hi. My name is Greg. I\u2019m calling with Farmer\u2019s [sic] Insurance. How are you today, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">Resident: Pretty good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">Sales agent: The reason for my call is a Farmer\u2019s [sic] agent in your area would just like to provide you with a free quote on your homeowner\u2019s and auto insurance. And I was just wondering when\u2019s a good time to have him call back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">Resident: You said Farmer\u2019s [sic] Insurance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">Sales agent: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">Resident: Is that a local outfit? A local agency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Sales agent: Yes. We have an agent in Columbus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">Resident: Who would he be, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">Sales agent: His name is Lonnie Perlman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Resident: Perlman. Do you have a phone number or address for him please? Sales agent: No. Sorry about that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">Resident: No phone number or address?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">Sales agent: No, sir. I have the Farmer\u2019s [sic] customer help line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">Resident: Okay, I\u2019ll take that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">Sales agent: Okay. If I could just get your information, sir, I could just have one give you a call back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">Resident: Well, first I\u2019d like to know who I\u2019m talking to, so please give me the phone number, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">Sales agent: Okay. It\u2019s 1-866-852-1429.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">Resident: 1429. And by any chance do you know if you called my house in the last couple of days or so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\">Sales agent: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-15\">Resident: Okay. All right. Well, for Farmer\u2019s [sic] Insurance and Lonnie Perlman and all other agents and associates of Farmer\u2019s [sic] [Insurance, I\u2019d like you to put both of my numbers on your Do Not Call list.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-16\">Sales agent: Okay, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-17\">Resident: Whoa, no, no, stay on the line. You have 895-1351 [as] one of the phone numbers. That\u2019s the one you call in on. The other one is 614-895-8940. Sales agent: Okay. Well, I can only put this one on the Do Not Call list. Resident: Okay, well write down on a little piece of paper 614-895-8940 and hand it to a supervisor and have them take care of it. And I also want you to send out a copy of your Do Not Call Maintenance Policy. Do you know what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-18\">Sales agent: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-19\">Resident: Well, you should, so I want you to contact a supervisor. Tell them they\u2019re supposed to send one of their Do Not Call Maintenance Policies to me. My address, do you have that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-20\">Sales agent: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-21\">Resident: 636 Colony Drive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-22\">Sales agent: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-23\">Resident: Westerville, Ohio 43081.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-24\">Sales agent: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Resident: And make sure you get that done. Is there any reason why you can\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">Resident: Hello? Greg, are you still there?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Resident: A little click indicates that Greg has hung up on me. Good day. The conversation between appellant\u2019s daughter and an employee of Perlman . Agency during the second call was not recorded, and there is no admissible evidence to indicate what was said during this telephone call, except that appellant was not available to take the telephone call. The following conversation took place between appellant\u2019s daughter and an employee of Perlman Agency during the third call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Resident: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Sales agent: May I speak with Philip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Resident: He\u2019s not available at the moment, may I take a message?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">Sales agent: No. Do you just know when would be a good time to get ahold of him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">Resident: Probably in like a half an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">Sales agent: Half an hour? That would be great, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">Resident: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">Sales agent: Bye-bye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">The following conversation took place between appellant\u2019s daughter and an employee of Perlman Agency during the fourth call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-15\">Resident: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-16\">Sales agent: May I speak with Philip?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-17\">Resident: He\u2019s not available at the moment, may I take a message?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-18\">Sales agent: Do you know when would be a good time to reach him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-19\">Resident: Around like 5:30. Do you have a number where he could call you back at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-20\">Sales agent: I can just give him a call back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-21\">Resident: Oh, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-22\">Sales agent: Bye-bye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-23\">Resident: Bye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-24\">{\u00b6 11} There is no dispute that none of the four calls were made directly by Farmers. The first call was made by Take the Lead, and the subsequent three calls were made by Perlman Agency employees. Thus, the only liability for Farmers under the TCPA would be if the calls were made \u201con behalf of\u2019 Farmers. Neither Section 227, Title 47, U.S.Code nor Section 64.1200, Title 47, C.F.R. provide any definition of \u201con behalf of\u2019 and \u201con whose behalf,\u201d and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>have been unable to find any authority in either this jurisdiction or any other that provides a precise definition of those terms. Webster\u2019s dictionary defines \u201con behalf of\u2019 as \u201cin the interest of: as a representative of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1987) 141. This definition adds little clarity to our concern, as it does not tell us how broadly to interpret the \u201cinterests\u201d represented by the person or entity conducting the telemarketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">{\u00b6 12} Where a word has a technical definition differing from its dictionary definition, it must be construed according to the former. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Lindley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 303, 309, 10 O.O.3d 423, 383 N.E.2d 903. If terms have acquired a particular or specialized meaning, either by way of legislative definition or by judicial construction, that meaning is to be ascribed to such terms. <em>John Ken Alzheimer\u2019s Ctr. v. Ohio Cert. of Need Rev. Bd. </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 134, 138, 583 N.E.2d 337. Here, the parties have submitted no authority to support any technical definition or specialized meaning of \u201con behalf of\u2019 or \u201con whose behalf.\u201d Further, although the circumstances of an enactment of particular legislation may persuade a court that Congress did not intend words of common meaning to have their literal effect, <em>Watt v. Alaska </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 259, 265-266, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 68 L.Ed.2d 80, we are presented with no such argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 13} This court\u2019s primary duty is to determine the intent of the legislature. <em>Dreger v. Public Emps. Retirement Sys. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 17, 20, 516 N.E.2d 214. To that end, our interpretation starts and ends with the words chosen by the legislature, but is not limited to the words alone, because the entire context of the enactment must be considered. <em>State v. Cravens </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 69, 536 N.E.2d 686. Undoubtedly, Congress passed the TCPA \u201c[i]n response to the burgeoning use of telephone solicitations to market goods and services in the United States, and the concomitant frustration of the American public.\u201d <em>Charvat v. Dispatch Consumer Sew., Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 505, 2002-Ohio-2838, 769 N.E.2d 829, at \u00b6 18. Congress has noted that many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers. Id., citing 137 Cong.Rec. 518781-02; 137 Cong.Rec. H11307-01. The TCPA was the result of Congress\u2019s effort to balance individual privacy with freedom of speech and trade. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 14} To begin, appellant alleges in his brief that the telemarketers mentioned Farmers in all of the phone calls. As can be seen from the above quotes, this is not true. The evidence establishes that only the first telephone conversation includes any mention of Farmers. Furthermore, despite appellant\u2019s claim that he established that Perlman and Perlman Agency had placed the four calls on behalf of Farmers, there is no evidence that Perlman Agency made the second, third, and fourth calls on behalf of Farmers. In his deposition, Perlman testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>several times that the four calls at issue were placed on behalf of Perlman Agency. Appellant points to no explicit evidence in the record indicating that Perlman made the calls \u201con behalf of\u2019 Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">{\u00b6 15} The record is also devoid of evidence that the second, third, and fourth calls were made to sell Farmers Insurance. There was no mention of Farmers in those calls. Notwithstanding, appellant maintains that they were clearly made on behalf of Farmers because Perlman was a \u201ccaptive agent\u201d of Farmers, which appellant defines to mean that Perlman could sell only Farmers\u2019 products. Because he could sell only Farmers\u2019 products, appellant reasons, the calls must have been made to generate sales for both Perlman and Farmers. The trial court disagreed with appellant\u2019s contention, finding that the Perlman Agency also sells insurance for many other insurance companies. We agree. Steve Andersen, the Ohio State Executive Director for Farmers averred that paragraph B.l of the agent appointment agreement between Perlman and Farmers and the corporate agent appointment agreement between Perlman Agency and Farmers both indicate that Perlman and his agency were required to write business with Farmers only for the classes of lines of insurance underwritten by Farmers and for business that is eligible for Farmers Insurance. Thus, Andersen averred, Perlman and Perlman Agency may write insurance business with other companies when that insurance is not offered by Farmers or is not eligible to be written with Farmers. Furthermore, Andersen averred that paragraph J of the agent appointment agreement and paragraph K of the corporate agent appointment agreement indicated that Perlman and his agency were independent contractors, and the persons he and the agency chose to solicit for business, as well as the methods of solicitation, were subject to Perlman\u2019s and his agency\u2019s sole discretion. Perlman also testified in his deposition that, although Farmers gave incentives and credits to use the Take the Lead program, Farmers is generally \u201cneutral\u201d with respect to whether agents engage in telemarketing. Thus, this evidence supports a finding that Perlman can sell insurance underwritten by other companies besides Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 16} It is true that Perlman testified that he was a \u201ccaptive\u201d agent with Farmers, but Perlman never defined the term, and he was never asked how he defined the term. In another case involving Farmers, \u201ccaptive agent\u201d was defined similarly to the way Andersen defined it. In <em>Cleveland Builders Supply Co. v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 708, 711, 657 N.E.2d 851, the court defined \u201ccaptive agent\u201d as meaning the agent cannot submit insurance applications to other brokers or carriers unless permitted to do so by Farmers. Thus, because Perlman, in the present case, was permitted to sell insurance for other companies under certain circumstances, appellant\u2019s contention that Perlman was allowed to sell insurance only for Farmers was not correct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Without evidence as to why Perlman made the second, third, and fourth telephone calls, only speculation remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">{\u00b6 17} Therefore, the only telephone call that mentioned Farmers was the first call. However, we also cannot find that this call was made \u201con behalf of\u2019 Farmers. Initially, we note that there exists no evidence that \u201cGreg,\u201d who presumably worked for Take the Lead, was authorized to act on behalf of or to represent Farmers. Indeed, Perlman testified that it was he who contacted Take the Lead and paid Take the Lead to commence a telemarketing campaign on behalf of Perlman Agency. Although Farmers referred agents to Take the Lead, there was no evidence presented that Farmers gave any authority to Take the Lead to act on its behalf or pursue business in its name. Furthermore, as the trial court found, even if the first call was made on behalf of Farmers, this court has held that the intent of Section 227(c)(5), Title 47, U.S.Code is not to create liability beginning with the first call, and a plaintiff is not entitled to damages for violations prior to the second call. See <em>Charvat v. ATW, Inc. </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 288, 712 N.E.2d 805. In addition, appellant does not contest the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant was relying upon Greg\u2019s statement, that he was \u201ccalling with Farmer\u2019s [sic] Insurance,\u201d to prove the truth of the statement, which renders it inadmissible hearsay pursuant to Evid.R. 801(C). Hearsay statements, unless an exception to the hearsay rule, are not admissible evidence in a summary judgment context. <em>Paulino v. McCary, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1186, 2005-Ohio-5920, 2005 WL 2981298, at \u00b6 6, fn. 1. For the above reasons, we hold that appellant failed to present any genuine issue of material fact as to whether any of the phone calls were made on behalf of Farmers. Therefore, the trial court did not err when it dismissed appellant\u2019s TCPA claims against Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant also claims that Farmers should likewise be liable under the CSPA for the first call. The CSPA provides that \u201c[n]o supplier shall commit an unfair or deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction.\u201d R.C. 1345.02(A). Appellant claims that Farmers was a \u201csupplier\u201d under the CSPA, which is defined as \u201ca seller, lessor, assignor, franchisor, or other person engaged in the business of effecting or soliciting consumer transactions, whether or not the person deals directly with the consumer.\u201d R.C. 1345.01(C). We disagree. Although Farmers may be considered a supplier for purposes of some consumer transactions, Farmers did not effect or solicit the consumer transaction in the present case. As explained above, the sales call was solicited by Take the Lead and was effected and prompted by Perlman Agency. No doubt Farmers could have obtained a financial benefit from any sales resulting from the first call, but that benefit is too far removed here from the actual solicitation by Take the Lead. Similarly, if Farmers, instead of Perlman Agency, had hired and then directed Take the Lead to make the first call, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Farmers\u2019 actions would have been more directly responsible for \u201ceffecting\u201d the consumer transaction. Having only a possible indirect benefit resulting from Perlman Agency\u2019s acts, Farmers cannot be liable for the first call under the CSPA. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred when it dismissed appellant\u2019s claims against Perlman because Perl-man personally authorized the unlawful telemarketing activities conducted by his own insurance agency. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusion, that appellant must pierce the corporate veil in order to hold Perlman personally liable because Perlman did not deceive or intend to deceive anyone, disregarded both the CSPA and the closely held nature of Perlman\u2019s business. Appellant asserts that Perlman was directly involved in the telemarketing calls, and he is the sole shareholder of the Perlman Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 20} The purpose of the CSPA is to protect consumers from the harm of deceptive or unconscionable sales practices. <em>Roelle v. Orkin Exterminating Co. </em>(Nov. 7, 2000), Franklin App. No. 00AP-14, 2000 WL 1664865. The statute is intended to give protection to consumers from unscrupulous suppliers of goods or services in a more efficient, expedient, and affordable manner than would be available in a common law tort or contract action. <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Howard </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 387, 393, 602 N.E.2d 665. The CSPA has a remedial purpose and must accordingly be liberally construed in favor of consumers. <em>Einhorn v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 27, 29, 548 N.E.2d 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 21} However, a corporation is a distinct legal entity, separate and apart from the natural individuals who formed it and own it. <em>Janos v. Murduck </em>(1996), 109 Ohio App.3d 583, 587, 672 N.E.2d 1021. Therefore, shareholders, officers, and directors will generally not be held personally liable for the acts of a corporation. <em>Lewis v. DR Sawmill Sales, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1096, 2006-Ohio-1297, 2006 WL 701140, at \u00b6 27. In <em>Belvedere Condominium Unit Owners\u2019 Assn. v. R.E. Roark Cos., Inc. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 274, 617 N.E.2d 1075, the Ohio Supreme Court recognized a limited exception to this rule. The court therein held that the corporate veil could be pierced to allow creditors to personally reach shareholders who had used the corporation for criminal or fraudulent purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 22} The court in <em>Belvedere </em>found that the corporate form may be disregarded and individual shareholders held liable for wrongs committed by the corporation when (1) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was so complete that the corporation had no separate mind, will, or existence of its own; (2) control over the corporation by those to be held liable was exercised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act against the person seeking to disregard the corporate entity; and (3) injury or unjust loss resulted to the plaintiff from such control and wrong. Id., paragraph three of the syllabus. The burden of proving that the corporate veil should be pierced lies with the party seeking to hold the individual shareholder or shareholders liable. <em>Zimmerman v. Eagle Mtge. Corp. </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 762, 772, 675 N.E.2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">{\u00b6 23} In the present case, appellant concedes that he is not seeking liability on behalf of Perlman personally based upon the theory of piercing the corporate veil, and he presents no argument regarding that theory. Rather, as mentioned, appellant maintains that Perlman should be personally liable because of his \u201cdirect involvement\u201d in the telemarketing calls and the closely held nature of Perlman\u2019s business, with Perlman being the sole shareholder of the Perlman Agency. However, as is apparent by the factors from <em>Belvedere </em>enunciated above, these are essentially factors relevant to piercing the corporate veil. Appellant presented no evidence demonstrating that Perlman exercised control over Perlman Agency so complete that the agency had no separate mind, will, or existence of its own, or that any such control was exercised in such a manner as to commit fraud or an illegal act. Thus, as any acts Perlman engaged in were in his capacity of a corporate officer for Perlman Agency, he could not be personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 24} Notwithstanding, appellant attempts to circumvent the usual legal route of piercing the corporate veil by relying upon <em>Shaffer v. Frontrunner, Inc. </em>(1990), 57 Ohio App.3d 18, 566 N.E.2d 193, for the proposition that, when a corporate officer commits a tort while in the performance of his duties, the officer is individually liable for the wrongful act. In <em>Shaffer, </em>a mother and daughter filed an action against their employer when the daughter was fired from her employment for missing work to attend jury duty and the mother was subsequently fired in retaliation for her daughter\u2019s attending jury duty. The appellate court concluded, among other things, that the individual corporate officer who fired the two could be personally liable, holding that, when a corporate officer commits a tort while in the performance of his duties, he is individually liable for the wrongful act. However, we find <em>Shaffer </em>distinguishable from the present case in one important aspect that renders it inapplicable. Here, unlike the corporate officer in <em>Shaffer, </em>Perlman did not actively participate in the wrong that resulted in liability. Although Perlman was responsible for securing the phone list from Take the Lead, he did so in the usual course of his work as an employee and had no personal involvement in any of the phone calls. None of Perlman\u2019s activities were violations of the CSPA or TCPA. The CSPA and TCPA do not impose liability for receiving a calling list that contains names and numbers of those who have indicated their desire not to be contacted or impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>liability for editing the script to be followed by the telemarketers. The violations here were the actual telephone calls made by two employees of Perlman Agency, and Perlman did not make any of the calls. Therefore, we find <em>Shaffer </em>inapplicable to the present circumstances. For the above reasons, the trial court did not err when it found that Perlman could not be personally liable. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant argues in his third assignment of error that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to appellees with regard to his ninth, 17th, 30th, and 43rd causes of action because it is undisputed that appellees failed to state, at the beginning of each of their four telephone calls, that the purpose of the call was to make a sale, as required by Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11(A)(1). Appellant contends that Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11 requires the caller to disclose the purpose of the call, no matter who answers the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 26} We first note that under this assignment of error, appellant seeks to recover separately from the other TCPA and CSPA violations for violations under Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-ll(A)(l). Appellant claims that he was entitled to damages for each violation of the CSPA, even if multiple violations occurred within a single call. Citing <em>Charvat v. Colorado Prime, </em>Inc. (Sept. 17, 1998), Franklin App. No. 97APG09-1277, 1998 WL 634922, the trial court found that appellant was limited under the TCPA to recovering $500 in damages for each of the three calls made after the first call, and, citing <em>Charvat v. Ryan, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 78, 2006-Ohio-3705, 858 N.E.2d 845 <em>(\u201cCharvat I </em>\u201d), the trial court likewise found that appellant was limited under the CSPA to recovering a single award of damages per telephone call, even when there were multiple violations during the same call.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 27} Notwithstanding, even assuming arguendo that appellant would be permitted to recover for multiple rule violations in a single call under the CSPA, which we are not concluding herein, we find there can be no additional liability under Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11 for any of the four calls in the present case. Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">(A) It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction involving any direct solicitation sale for a supplier to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">(1) Solicit a sale without clearly, affirmatively, and expressly revealing at the time the supplier initially contacts the consumer or prospective consumer, and before making any other statement, asking any question, or entering the residence of the consumer or prospective consumer, that the purpose of the contact is to effect a sale, stating in general terms the goods or services the supplier has to offer, provided that this paragraph shall not apply to solicitations by mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Here, with regard to the third and fourth calls, appellant presents no authority for the proposition that the solicitor must state the reason for the call prior to asking to speak to the consumer or actually speaking to the consumer. To the contrary, as indicated above, the express language of Ohio Adm.Code 109:4 \u2014 3\u201411(A) (1) indicates that the solicitor must state that the reason for the call is to make a sale only \u201cat the time the supplier initially contacts the consumer or prospective consumer.\u201d In the third and fourth calls, no contact was ever made with appellant, who was the consumer that the employees of the Perlman Agency were trying to contact. Without the agency\u2019s ever having made any contact with appellant, we can find no liability under Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-ll(A)(l). Further, although the second call was not transcribed and the record is unclear as to what transpired, assuming the second call proceeded similarly to the third and fourth calls, for the same reasons outlined above, we would find no liability under Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-ll(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 29} With regard to the first call, before indicating he was calling to make a sale, Greg first stated his name and that he was calling on behalf of Farmers, and asked how appellant was doing. Although Greg made these \u201ccourtesy\u201d introductions before indicating the purpose of his call was to make a sale, as a practical matter, we cannot envision that a generic salutation or brief common pleasantry at the beginning of a phone call, before any solicitation for a sale has commenced, is the type of harm contemplated by the legislature in its passage of the CSPA. The purpose of the CSPA is to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, and unconscionable acts and practices. <em>Whitaker v. M.T. Automotive, Inc., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 177, 2006-Ohio-5481, 855 N.E.2d 825, at \u00b6 11, 13. The passing comments in the present case would not be contrary to this purpose. Furthermore, after briefly engaging in these customary rules of American telephone etiquette, Greg proceeded directly to the reason for his call. Thus, the key characteristics that we believe take these comments out of the purview of the prohibitions in Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-11(A)(1) are the brevity of the comments, the content of comments as containing the hallmarks of a traditional telephone greeting, the lack of solicitation of a sale and lack of any covert sales tactics during the span of the brief introduction, and the short lapse in time between the introductory comments and the identification of the call as one being for the purpose of making a sale. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment with regard to appellant\u2019s ninth, 17th, 30th, and 43rd causes of action. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 30} Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to appellees as to his tenth cause of action because it is undisputed that, in making their first call to appellant, appellees used a fictitious name that had not been registered with the Ohio Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>State, pursuant to R.C. 1329.01, which constitutes an unfair or deceptive practice in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A). However, appellant\u2019s actual argument under his fourth assignment of error does not address the merits of the issue. Rather, appellant\u2019s only contention is that none of the appellees mentioned the tenth cause of action in their respective motions for summary judgment, and, thus, the trial court was not permitted to render summary judgment on this issue when it was not raised in the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">{\u00b6 31} It is true that, when seeking summary judgment, a party must specifically delineate the basis upon which the motion is brought. <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus. If a party files a motion based on some, but not all, issues in a case, the trial court should restrict its ruling to those matters raised. <em>Ferro Corp. v. Blaw Knox Food &amp; Chem. Equip. Co. </em>(1997), 121 Ohio App.3d 434, 700 N.E.2d 94. It is likewise true that it is reversible error to award summary judgment on grounds not specified in the motion for summary judgment. <em>Eller v. Continental Invest. Partnership, </em>151 Ohio App.3d 729, 2003-Ohio-894, 785 N.E.2d 802, \u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 32} Under the circumstances of the present case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in rendering summary judgment on appellant\u2019s tenth cause of action, given the trial court\u2019s other determinations rendered liability for any of the appellees under the theory raised in appellant\u2019s tenth cause of action moot. We first note that contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, in their motions for summary judgment, appellees did seek dismissal of appellant\u2019s tenth cause of action, although they claimed that summary judgment on this cause of action was warranted based upon the theory that appellant was limited to one measure of statutory damages per telephone call. Thus, appellant was aware that appellees were moving for summary judgment of this claim. Notwithstanding, the trial court concluded that appellant had failed to demonstrate that Greg made the first call on behalf of Farmers or as an agent of Farmers, and we concurred with this finding in overruling appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. Further, we found under appellant\u2019s second assignment of error that appellant failed to demonstrate that Perlman should be personally liable for the actions of Perlman Agency. Therefore, it follows that Perlman and Farmers cannot be liable under R.C. 1345.02(A) for Greg\u2019s use of the name \u201cFarmers Insurance\u201d in the first call.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 33} Having found that neither Perlman nor Farmers may be liable under this theory, we note that the only remaining defendant was Perlman Agency, and clearly Perlman Agency cannot be held liable for another company\u2019s failure to register an allegedly fictitious name. R.C. 1329.01(D) specifically indicates that its requirements apply only to the entity that does business under the fictitious name. The Perlman Agency does not do business under \u201cFarmers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Insurance,\u201d and appellant does not allege so much. The whole of Ohio case law relating to the deceptive or unfair consumer practice of using an unregistered fictitious name involves an entity\u2019s own use of an unregistered fictitious name for its own business.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">{\u00b6 34} In addition, it has been held in two reported Ohio appellate cases that an entity\u2019s use of a fictitious name may be deemed a deceptive and unfair practice only when used by the entity in connection with some effort to avoid its responsibilities to consumers. In appellant\u2019s complaint here, appellant merely alleges that a fictitious name was used in the first call. Where no other deceptive acts are alleged in connection with the use of a fictitious business name, the mere failure to register does not violate the CSPA. See <em>Ganson v. Vaughn </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 689, 694, 735 N.E.2d 483 (the mere use of a fictitious name is not an unfair or deceptive practice when the use did not create a subterfuge preventing the plaintiff from attempting to obtain redress for alleged violations of the CSPA, and the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that she was damaged or prejudiced in any way by the defendant\u2019s failure to report the use of the fictitious name to the secretary of state); <em>Crull v. Maple Park Body Shop </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 153, 521 N.E.2d 1099 (the mere failure to report the use of a fictitious name, pursuant to R.C. 1329.01, is not an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the CSPA, but in some cases, such as when a business uses numerous fictitious names in a concerted effort to avoid its responsibilities to consumers, the failure to report the use of a fictitious name may be some evidence, when combined with other factors, of a deceptive or unfair consumer practice). Therefore, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s tenth cause of action relating to Greg\u2019s use of an allegedly fictitious name in the first call. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant argues in his fifth assignment of error that the trial court erred when it denied his claim for treble damages by applying the wrong definition of \u201cwillful\u201d and \u201cknowing\u201d to appellees\u2019 conduct. Pursuant to Section 277(b)(3), Title 47, U.S.Code, a court may, in its discretion, triple the damages awarded for a violation of the TCPA for a residential customer if the court finds that the defendant acted \u201cwillfully or knowingly.\u201d In the present case, citing <em>Charvat v. Colorado Prime, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 97APG09-1277, 1998 WL 634922, the trial court found that to knowingly violate the TCPA regulations for purpose of treble damages, a defendant must do more than make a telephone call: The defendant must affirmatively know it is violating a regulation when making the telephone call. Id. Thus, in the present case, the trial court concluded that because there was no evidence that any of the calls placed by Perlman Agency were placed with knowledge that the TCPA regulations were being violated, any damages awarded under the TCPA should not be trebled.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>{\u00b6 36} However, after the trial court rendered its decision, the Ohio Supreme Court issued <em>Charvat v. Ryan, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 394, 2007-Ohio-6833, 879 N.E.2d 765 <em>(\u201cCharvat II </em>\u201d), in which the court held that to establish a knowing violation of the TCPA for an award of treble damages, a plaintiff must prove only that the defendant knew that it had acted or had failed to act in a manner that violated the statute, not that the defendant knew that the conduct itself constituted a violation of law. Id. at \u00b6 18. To establish a willful violation of the TCPA for an award of treble damages, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant consciously and deliberately committed or omitted an act that violated the statute, irrespective of any intent to violate the law. Id. at \u00b6 21. Thus, in the present case, it is apparent that the trial court utilized the wrong definitions for determining whether a violation of the TCPA was knowingly or willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">{\u00b6 37} However, the Supreme Court in <em>Charvat II </em>also noted that because Congress chose to employ a low threshold to assess treble damages, by requiring a caller\u2019s actions to be \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cwillful,\u201d it was important to highlight the language in the second part of the provision for treble damages that the award of treble damages is subject to the court\u2019s discretion. Id. at \u00b6 22. Thus, a two-part test is presented for the trial court to employ when ascertaining whether treble damages are appropriate in a particular case. First, the court must decide whether a violation was \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cwillful,\u201d and then the court may, but need not, award treble damages. Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 38} Here, although the trial court acknowledged that its determination of treble damages was subject to the discretion of the court, it appears that its refusal to award such treble damages was based upon the improper definitions of \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwillfully\u201d that it employed. Therefore, we remand the matter back for a determination of whether treble damages are warranted under the circumstances of the present case using the standards set forth in <em>Charvat II. </em>Thus, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled; appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is sustained; the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part; and this matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with the law, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Judgment affirmed in part</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">and reversed in part,</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-8\">Petree and Sadler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
