A stop sign is located on U.S. 250 to alert approaching motorists. As a result of the construction work, appellee removed the stop sign and relocated it away from the edge of the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 2} On January 6, 2006, appellant, James Schuster, was traveling on U.S. 250 toward U.S. 42. Appellant did not see the stop sign, crossed through the intersection, and careened down an embankment, crashing into a ditch. He received injuries, as did his wife and son, who were passengers in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 3} On April 14, 2006, appellant, together with his wife and son, filed a complaint against appellee, claiming negligence regarding the stop sign. On June 30, 2006, appellants filed an amended complaint to include the city of Ashland as a party defendant. Appellants dismissed the city of Ashland on July 18, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">{\u00b6 4} On July 26, 2007, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that appellants failed to establish the existence of a duty, a breach of that duty, and an injury resulting therefrom. By a judgment entry filed September 7, 2007, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">{\u00b6 5} A jury trial commenced on November 6, 2007. At the close of appellants\u2019 case-in-chief, appellee moved for a directed verdict. The trial court granted the motion, finding that there was no evidence to establish that the location of the stop sign violated Section 2B.06 of the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. A judgment entry journalizing this decision was filed on November 16, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant, Kokosing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Kevin Theriault, could [not] render an opinion that the placement of the stop sign violated MUTCD standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants claim that the trial court erred in directing the verdict for appellee. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 10} The standard for granting a directed verdict is set out in Civ.R. 50(A)(4) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhen a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">{\u00b6 12} In their complaint filed April 14, 2006, appellants alleged the following at \u00b6 6:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Defendant, Kokosing, was negligent in one or more of the following particulars:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(a) in failing to design the intersection in a reasonably safe manner and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and industry standards;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(b) in failing to provide appropriate signage warning of the approaching intersection;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(c) in temporary locating certain signage (specifically, a stop sign) in a manner that prevented it from reasonably being seen by drivers;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(d) in failing to provide appropriate lighting to make the intersection and signage clearly visible;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(e) in failing to take prompt and appropriate remedial steps upon being advised of at least three prior crashes occurring at the same intersection within a two week time period; and</p>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(f) other negligent acts or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In its November 16, 2007 entry directing the verdict for appellee, the trial court concluded the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe evidence, construed most favorably to the Plaintiffs, established that the State of Ohio inspected the work done by Defendant Kokosing, including the placement of the STOP sign at issue in this case, and accepted the work, signed off on the completed project and opened the road to the traveling public prior to the accident in this case. That evidence establishes that Defendant Kokosing\u2019s placement of the STOP sign was in compliance with Section 2B.06, absent testimony to the contrary. The Plaintiffs presented no evidence to the contrary in their case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe Plaintiffs argued to the Court that the question of whether the STOP sign\u2019s placement was in compliance with Section 2B.06 of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and/or was negligent was a question of fact to be decided by the jury. The Court concurs with that position. However, just as a jury cannot decide a doctor\u2019s negligence without expert opinion testimony, the jury in this case could not decide whether the location of the STOP sign was negligent without expert opinion testimony. It is undisputed that the Plaintiffs did not pr\u00e9sent any expert testimony establishing that the sign\u2019s placement violated Section 2B.06 or that the sign\u2019s placement was negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 23} We find that the trial court\u2019s decision addressed only the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and did not address the other issues raised by the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 24} A reading of the trial testimony and a review of the evidence in a light most favorable to appellants establish the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">{\u00b6 25} 1. The stop sign was replaced after the completion of the construction project and was not in compliance with the specifications of the contract, even though appellee was specifically instructed to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">{\u00b6 26} 2. The 12-foot placement of the stop sign from the white edge line was discussed, but not complied with. The stop sign was 20 feet from the white edge line.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">{\u00b6 27} 3. On November 10, 2005, an Ohio Department of Transportation engineer opened the roadway with the stop sign in the wrong place.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">{\u00b6 28} 4. The Ohio Department of Transportation accepted the work that appellee had performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">{\u00b6 29} 5. On December 14, 2005, the Ohio Department of Transportation requested a bid to correct the placement of the stop sign to be compliant with the 12-foot specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>{\u00b6 30} 6. The regulations in the Ohio Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices govern the placement of the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 31} 7. The accident occurred prior to the correction of the stop-sign placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 32} 8. There was expert opinion testimony from Kevin Theriault that the stop sign\u2019s placement was a factor in appellant\u2019s failure to see the sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 33} 9. There was testimony that a headlight would not illuminate a stop sign placed 20 feet from the white edge line.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 34} 10. Appellant testified that he was aware that there should be a stop sign in the area and was searching for it. He never saw the stop sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 35} 11. Plaintiffs Exhibit 19, the letter from the Ohio Department of Transportation, set forth the placement requirements and appellee\u2019s failure to fulfill those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 36} We conclude that despite the lack of engineering expertise by appellants\u2019 witness, Kevin Theriault, there was ample evidence in the record, when construed most favorably for appellants, that a jury could find negligence on behalf of appellee. Plaintiffs Exhibit 19, signed by an engineer from the Ohio Department of Transportation, was sufficient to meet the burden. Further, there was testimony from appellant and Theriault that the stop sign was not visible at 20 feet from the white edge line.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 37} Upon review, we find that the trial court erred in granting the directed verdict to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">{\u00b6 38} Assignment of error I is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">{\u00b6 39} Appellants claim that the trial court erred in precluding and limiting Theriault\u2019s testimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">{\u00b6 40} The admission or exclusion of evidence lies in the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343. In order to find an abuse of that discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">{\u00b6 41} The trial court is the gatekeeper on issues of admissibility and qualifications of an expert witness. Evid.R. 104(A). Qualification of an expert is controlled by Evid.R. 702. Further, under Evid.R. 701, a witness may testify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>to his perceptions that are \u201chelpful to a clear understanding of [his] testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 42} Contained within some 20-plus pages of the transcript is the dialogue between the trial court and counsel as to the limitations on Theriault\u2019s testimony. The most definitive ruling was at the beginning of the colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cTHE COURT: All right, at this point, based on the qualifications and the questions that have been asked, I am not going to allow this witness to give an opinion concerning whether or not the sign was properly placed, all right, in accordance with the Uniform Traffic Manual, that is based on the qualifications that you have done thus far.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 44} The trial court further clarified the decision on the issue as it related solely to the manual\u2019s standards as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE COURT: Because my ruling is \u2014 the basis of the ruling is, the manual doesn\u2019t have a set distance standard in the manual, and the diagram does not say that it has to be within the specific locations. That is just, see as figure A. There is a discretionary element of this, and the ruling was that he cannot give an opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 46} Section 2B.06 of the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices states, \u201cThe stop sign shall be located as close as practical to the intersection it regulates, while optimizing its visibility to the road user it is intended to regulate.\u201d This section is labeled as a \u201cstandard,\u201d which is defined in the manual at Section 1A.09 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cStandard:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThis Manual describes the application of traffic control devices, but shall not be a legal requirement for their installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cGuidance:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe decision to use a particular device at a particular location should be made on the basis of either an engineering study or the application of engineering judgment. Thus, while this Manual provides Standards, Guidance, and Options for design and application of traffic control devices, this Manual should not be considered a substitute for engineering judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cEngineering judgment should be exercised in the selection and application of traffic control devices, as well as in the location and design of the roads and streets that the devices complement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">{\u00b6 52} Pursuant to that section, because Theriault was not an engineer, he could not testify as to engineering judgment. The trial court specifically stated that Theriault could not give an opinion on whether the stop-sign placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>violated the manual. The questions and answers that precipitated this ruling were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cQ. Now, that is the diagram that came to Kokosing from ODOT?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cQ. What does that document reflect?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA. This reflects the proper placement of the stop sign at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ. Having evaluated the case, was the stop sign there January 2nd placed consistently with the diagram?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA. No, it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cMR. VALENTINE: Objection, your Honor, if we could approach on this, I do have an issue with the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 60} Although the trial court and counsel wove themselves through a convoluted argument, Theriault\u2019s opinion as to sign placement was not stricken and was reinforced after the discussion between the trial court and counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cQ. Was the stop sign as it existed placed consistent with the diagram?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cQ. Was it placed inconsistent with the diagram in the Ohio Uniform Manual?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-16\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cQ. Given your training, what is your opinion as to the cause of the wreck?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA. It would be the failure of the Plaintiff to visibly see the sign as they approached the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-18\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cQ. What was the factors that went into the failure to see the stop sign?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-19\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA. The sign, the position as it was on the day of the crash, and the weather conditions on the night of the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-20\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cQ. What was it about the placement of the sign that led it not to be seen?</p>\n<p id=\"b418-21\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA. It was not consistent with where it is in the diagram.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">{\u00b6 71} Given the specific landscape of the testimony, we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in so limiting the inquiry. As we found in assignment of error I, the complaint was broadly drawn as to general negligence. Although guidelines from the manual would have been a more definitive opinion, it was not fatal to the general negligence cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>{\u00b6 72} Assignment of error II is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 73} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Ashland County, Ohio is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-7\">Hoffman, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
