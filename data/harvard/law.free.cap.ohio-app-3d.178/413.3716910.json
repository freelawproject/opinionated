Braun appeals the March 10, 2008 judgment entry of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, overruling his objections to the magistrate\u2019s April 20, 2007 decision with respect to an award of attorney fees, and approving and adopting said decision as an order of the court. Defendants-appellees and cross-appellants Peter Watson et al. appeal the same with respect to the trial court\u2019s overruling their objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, which ordered partial enforcement of the parties\u2019 previous settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant and appellees are neighbors. They live on adjoining parcels. Appellant was the plaintiff in a prior action against appellees relative to stormwater runoff in appellant\u2019s backyard, case No. 04-CV-H-09-0958. On the eve of trial, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 3} Section 1 of the agreement reads: \u201c[Appellees] shall cause Buckeye Landscape (or another qualified contractor if Buckeye fails to timely perform) to re-grade the entire Disputed Area by lifting the existing sod, lowering the grade approximately 2\u201d-3\u201d, hauling away the excess soil and reinstalling the sod. The parties agree that the intent of the foregoing is to insure that surface water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>flowing across [appellant\u2019s] Lot will exit [Ms] lot onto [appellees\u2019] Lot and drain in such a manner that water will not accumulate or \u201cpond\u201d on [appellant\u2019s] Lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 4} Section 2 of the agreement provides: \u201c[Appellees] shall cause the Remedial Measures to be completed no later than October 15, 2005, subject to the scheduling priorities of Buckeye Landscape. After completing the Remedial Measures, [Appellees agree] not to alter the grade of the Disputed Area in the future or to otherwise impede the flow of surface water off of [appellant\u2019s] Lot. At [appellant\u2019s] expense, Hockaden and Associates shall be entitled to field verify the water will drain to from [sic] [appellant\u2019s] Lot to the \u2018original drain.\u2019 If Hockaden and Associates concludes that the water will not so drain, then Hockaden and Buckeye Landscape will agree upon the appropriate corrective action. If Hockaden and Buckeye cannot agree as to the corrective action, the parties will agree upon an independent engineer to be the final arbiter of the issue. [Appellees agree] to cause Buckeye Landscape to complete such corrective action within 14 days of notice of the measures needed * *</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellees had Buckeye Landscape perform certain work. Appellant was not happy with the completed work, claiming it was not carried out in accordance with the agreement. Appellant ultimately filed a complaint against appellees, alleging breach of the agreement and seeMng specific performance. Appellants counterclaimed, maintaining that the agreement required the parties to submit any disputes to an independent engineer who would be the final arbiter of the issues in dispute. Appellees also filed a motion to enforce the alternative-dispute-resolution provision set forth in the agreement, requesting that the trial court issue an order to that effect. Appellant filed a motion for partial summary judgment, alleging that appellees had breached the terms of the agreement as the entire disputed area had not been regraded. The trial court denied the motion, finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the entire disputed area had been regraded. The matter proceeded to trial before the magistrate on November 21, 2006, on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 6} The magistrate found that the agreement did not define the disputed area. Based upon an original sketch of appellees\u2019 backyard, which was prepared by appellees\u2019 expert, as well as the expert\u2019s testimony, the magistrate determined the disputed area to be 30 feet by 30 feet. Appellees\u2019 expert also testified that if excavation did not occur to the tree line on appellees\u2019 property, the remedial measures called for in the agreement were not satisfied. Such excavation did not occur. A representative of Buckeye Landscape, who viewed the completed work, testified that the regraded/resodded area was only 20 feet by 20 feet. The magistrate concluded that appellees had not completed the remedial measures as required by the agreement. The magistrate further found that the regrading of the disputed area did not comply with the terms of the agreement. Several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>experts testified that the regrading that had been done did not lower the grade the two to three inches required by the agreement. The magistrate recommended after the entire disputed area was regraded, any unresolved issues relative to drainage be sent to an independent arbiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 7} The parties each filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Appellant objected to the magistrate\u2019s failure to recommend appellees pay appellant\u2019s attorney fees, expert fees, and costs as appellees were the \u201cunsuccessful party\u201d under Section 8.8 of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 8} Appellees objected to the magistrate\u2019s finding in favor of appellant, finding the disputed area to be 30 feet by 30 feet, finding that the regrading did not comply with the terms of the agreement and granting their motion to enforce only in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court overruled all of the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision via judgment entry filed March 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 10} It is from this entry that appellant appeals, raising as his sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI. The trial court erred in failing to award to plaintiff-appellant Robert A. Braun his attorneys\u2019 fees experts\u2019 fees and costs because the plain language of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement provided that the \u2018unsuccessful party <em>shall </em>pay the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees experts\u2019 fees and costs.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 12} Appellees cross-appeal, assigning as error:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI. The trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that the court grant the appellees/cross-appellants\u2019 motion to enforce the settlement agreement in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. The trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s determination that appellees/cross-appellants did not cause buckeye landscape to execute the work called for in the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cHI. The trial court erred in determining that the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to find in favor of appellant represents a legal determination that appellees/cross-appellants breached the terms of the settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">APPEAL I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">{\u00b6 16} In his sole assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court in failing to order appellees to pay his attorney fees, expert fees, and costs as required by the clear and unambiguous language of the agreement, specifically Section 8.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Section 8.8 of the agreement provides: \u201cShould either party be required to enforce this Agreement, the unsuccessful party shall pay the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, experts\u2019 fees and costs in an amount to be determined by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellees contend that they do not fall within the definition of \u201cunsuccessful party\u201d because the magistrate\u2019s decision with respect to appellant merely amounted to a declaration as to what constitutes the disputed area. They argue that such declaration did not render appellees unsuccessful. According to appellees, the ultimate issue was the exact measurement of the disputed area. Appellees explain that without this determination, the parties were not able to fully comply with the agreement. Appellees conclude that the trial court properly found that appellant was not entitled to fees and costs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 19} In his complaint, appellant alleged breach of contract based upon appellees\u2019 failure to regrade the entire disputed area. The record reveals that prior to the parties\u2019 entering into the agreement, David Amorose, on behalf of Buckeye Landscape and upon request of appellees, prepared a sketch of appellees\u2019 backyard that showed the area that needed to be regraded/resodded. The original sketch was drawn to scale with one inch reflecting 20 feet. An enlargement of the sketch was attached to the agreement as \u201cExhibit A.\u201d Amorose testified that, although the enlargement of the sketch caused the removal of the scale from the sketch, there was no intent to change the scale from that of the original sketch.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 20} Appellees hired Buckeye Landscape to determine the extent and type of remedial work that needed to be performed in order to address the drainage issue. Appellees knew, prior to entering into the agreement, that the size of the area that needed to be addressed was 30 feet by 30 feet; nonetheless, Buckeye Landscape only performed work on a 20-by-20 area. Appellees cannot subsequently claim that the agreement was ambiguous as to the exact measurement of the disputed area because they requested the preparation of the original sketch that became part of the agreement. Appellees\u2019 failure to have Buckeye Landscape complete the work on the entire disputed area resulted in appellant\u2019s bringing the instant action in order to enforce the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 21} Because appellees did not comply with the terms of the agreement, and appellant was required to seek its enforcement, we find that the trial court erred in failing to award appellant attorney fees, expert fees, and costs associated with this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>CROSS-APPEAL I, II, III</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 23} In their brief to this court, appellees discuss their assignments of error together. We shall do the same. In their first cross-assignment of error, appellees submit that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation their motion to enforce the arbitration provision be granted only in part. In their second assignment of error, appellees maintain that the trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s determination that they did not have Buckeye Landscape execute the work required by the agreement. In their third assignment of error, appellees argue that the trial court erred in determining that the magistrate\u2019s recommendation to find in favor of appellant represents a legal determination that appellees breached the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 24} Section 8.4 of the agreement specifically provides: \u201cAny dispute concerning this Agreement shall be resolved in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio.\u201d Only a single, narrow, technical issue was subject to submission to an arbiter after Buckeye Landscape completed the regrade as agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court found that it had jurisdiction over the issue of whether the work initially performed by Buckeye Landscape complied with the agreement as to the disputed area and the appropriate regrading. The trial court further found that the only issue subject to arbitration was drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 26} Appellees contend that the issues raised by appellant fall within the purview of the alternative-dispute-resolution provision set forth in the agreement. After the work was completed by Buckeye Landscape, appellant asserted that the remedial measures were not executed in such a manner as to ensure the proper drainage of water and that the failure was due to deficiencies in the work performed by Buckeye Landscape. Appellees submit that these complaints of alleged failures to comply triggered Section 2 of the agreement; therefore, the entire matter should have been resolved by an independent arbiter rather than the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 27} With respect to appellees\u2019 second and third assignments of error, appellees, as they did in their response to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, assert that the agreement was silent as to the dimensions of the disputed area.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 28} As discussed above, appellees knew the dimensions of the disputed area when they entered into the agreement. Buckeye Landscape was hired by appellees to create a plan that became the basis of the agreement. The drawing provided by Buckeye utilized a scale of one inch equals 20 feet. Using this scale, the drawing measures the disputed area as 30 feet by 30 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">{\u00b6 29} We find that the plain language of the agreement establishes that the arbitration provision applied only to situations in which the parties\u2019 experts could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>not agree on the appropriate corrective action <em>if </em>the water is not properly-draining after the remedial measures were completed. The record contains sufficient evidence to establish that the disputed area was 30 feet by 30 feet; the area Buckeye Landscape regraded was only 20 by 20; and the regrading was not in compliance with the agreement. The agreement is very specific as to the remedial measures required to cure this water problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 30} Appellees\u2019 first, second, and third cross-assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 31} The judgment of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for a determination of the amount of attorney fees and costs to which appellant is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-7\">Gwin and Wise, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
