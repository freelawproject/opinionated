Ellison challenges her conviction for telecommunications harassment under R.C. 2917.21(B). We find merit to her appeal and reverse her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">{\u00b6 2} Ellison and Savannah Gerhard were childhood friends but had a falling out during seventh grade. According to Ellison, the fallout occurred when her younger brother accused Gerhard of molesting him. The Hamilton County Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cJFS\u201d) investigated the claim and determined that it did not have enough evidence to substantiate that the abuse had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>{\u00b6 3} As teenagers, Ellison and Gerhard attended the same high school. During the summer of 2007, Ellison posted on her Internet \u201cMySpace\u201d page a picture of Gerhard that was captioned \u201cMolested a little boy,\u201d and she stated in her personal profile that she hated Gerhard. Ellison allowed for public, rather than private, viewing of her MySpace page.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 4} After hearing about the posting from others, Gerhard used the Internet to view Ellison\u2019s MySpace page. Gerhard had previously observed a short remark by Ellison on a contemporary\u2019s MySpace page that also referred to the molestation accusation. But Ellison never directly communicated these postings to Gerhard, who also had a MySpace account.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 5} Gerhard complained to authorities at her school about the postings. Ellison removed them from her MySpace page at the request of the school\u2019s resource officer investigating Gerhard\u2019s complaint. Ellison was then charged criminally for telecommunications harassment under R.C. 2917.21(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 6} At a bench trial, Gerhard confirmed that Ellison had never directly communicated with her over the Internet and that she had sought out the postings. She added, however, that she had felt \u201charassed\u201d by the postings and that she had overheard Ellison make a similar remark about her at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 7} Ellison testified that she believed her brother\u2019s accusations against Gerhard were true. And she gave the following explanation for posting the offensive material: \u201cI think that other people need to know how she is. And she denies everything, but a lot of people believe that she did it. And I was told that she did it. And so I think that other people have a right to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 8} Subsequently, Ellison was convicted on one count of telecommunications harassment. In this appeal, she argues that her conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and violated her free-speech rights under the federal and state constitutions. We hold that the evidence was not sufficient to support the conviction, and, therefore, we do not address Ellison\u2019s freedom-of-speech challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">{\u00b6 9} Whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We must determine whether, with the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, it would have convinced a rational factfinder of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Telecommunications Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 10} The state prosecuted Ellison under R.C. 2917.21(B), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall make or cause to be made a telecommunication, or permit a telecommunication to be made from a telecommunications device under the person\u2019s control, with purpose to abuse, threaten, or harass another person.\u201d The state proceeded in this case under a theory that Ellison had posted a \u201crumor\u201d on the Internet to harass Gerhard.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Telecommunication</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">{\u00b6 11} Ellison contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she had made a \u201ctelecommunication\u201d where she did not directly contact Gerhard. She concedes, however, that a direct contact is not expressly required by the statutory definition of telecommunication: \u201cthe origination, emission, dissemination, transmission, or reception of data, images, signals, sounds, or other intelligence or equivalence of intelligence of any nature over any communication system by any method, including, but not limited to, a fiber optic, electronic, magnetic, optical, digital, or analog method.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 12} And we find it significant that the legislature defined a telecommunication broadly, with words such as dissemination. For these reasons, we decline to hold that a direct contact is required to establish a telecommunication under the statute. In this case, the state presented sufficient evidence of a telecommunication, despite the lack of a direct contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Purpose to Harass</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{\u00b6 13} Ellison contends also that the lack of a direct communication completely contradicted any assertion that she had intended to harass Gerhard when she made the telecommunication.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">{\u00b6 14} Harassment is not defined in the statute, but it is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary as \u201c[w]ords, conduct, or action (usu. repeated or persistent) that, being directed at a specific person, annoys, alarms, or causes substantial emotional distress in the person and serves no legitimate purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 1999, the legislature deleted the word \u201cannoy\u201d from R.C. 2917.21(B). Thus, for conduct to rise to the level of criminal harassment under this section of the statute, the accused must have intended to alarm or to cause substantial emotional distress to the recipient, not just to annoy her.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Importantly, the statute creates a specific-intent crime: the state must prove the defendant\u2019s specific purpose to harass. The burden is not met by establishing only that the defendant knew or should have known that her conduct would probably cause harassment. The legislature has created this substantial burden to limit the statute\u2019s scope to criminal conduct, not the expression of offensive speech. Whether Ellison was liable for defamation was not established in the proceedings below and can be addressed in civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">{\u00b6 16} In this case, the state had the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that Ellison\u2019s specific purpose in making the telecommunication was to harass Gerhard. The state argued that Ellison\u2019s posting of the \u201crumor\u201d after JFS had found the allegation unsubstantiated showed a purpose to harass. But JFS\u2019s conclusion did not mean that dissemination of the allegation could not serve the legitimate purpose of warning others of what Ellison believed to be criminal behavior. Moreover, it was undisputed that Ellison never directed a telecommunication to Gerhard despite the opportunity to do so. These facts rendered the state\u2019s position untenable. No rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, could have been convinced of Ellison\u2019s specific intent to harass Gerhard when she made the telecommunication.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, we hold that the state failed to establish that Ellison had made a telecommunication with the purpose to harass, where she had a legitimate purpose for posting the accusation against Gerhard on the Internet, and where Ellison did not directly telecommunicate with Gerhard. Accordingly, we sustain the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">{\u00b6 18} We reverse the judgment of conviction and discharge Ellison from further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b776-9\">Hildebrandt, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b776-10\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-12\">. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\">. <em>Slate v.

If so, we could not build jails fast enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">{\u00b6 20} The statute on telecommunications harassment is the successor to the former telephone-harassment law. It is designed to prohibit harassing or threatening calls. Of course the calls may now be made over a traditional phone line, a cellular phone, or the Internet. But posting an annoying \u2014 but nonthreatening \u2014 comment on a website is not a crime under this statute. It might well be a civil wrong, but it is not jailable. The First Amendment would not allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>punishment for making a nonthreatening comment on the Internet, just as it would not for writing a newspaper article, posting a sign, or speaking on the radio.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
