Swint also sued the village of Golf Manor, claiming that it was vicariously liable for Golf Manor Police Officer Matt Haverkamp\u2019s actions at the scene of the attack, which had allegedly resulted in Swint sustaining further injuries from the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">{\u00b6 2} Golf Manor moved to dismiss Swint\u2019s complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), claiming governmental immunity. The trial court denied the motion, but it did not include a Civ.R. 54(B) certification in its decision. Golf Manor now appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of governmental immunity under R.C. 2744.02(C). Because we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">A Final Order is Not Necessarily an Appealable Order</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">{\u00b6 3} R.C. 2744.02(C) provides that an \u201corder that denies a political subdivision * * * the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability * * * is a final order.\u201d But a final order is not always tantamount to an <em>appealable </em>order, and in this respect we find our decision in <em>Sullivan v. Anderson Twp.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In <em>Sullivan, </em>the plaintiff sued multiple parties, including Anderson Township, alleging multiple causes of action in his complaint. Anderson Township moved to dismiss the case against it on the basis of governmental immunity. The trial court denied governmental immunity as to some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of Sullivan\u2019s claims. It did not include a Civ.R. 54(B) certification in its order. On appeal, we held that \u201ceven when the challenged governmental-immunity order is clearly final [under R.C. 2744.02(C) ], this court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment as to fewer than all the claims or all the parties in a multi-claim, multi-party case in the absence of the trial court\u2019s determination, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), \u2018that there is no just reason for delay.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reasoned that Civ.R. 54(B) must be followed when a case involves multiple claims and/or multiple parties to avoid piecemeal litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The same concerns apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The Pending Case was not Dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 5} Golf Manor contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>Sullivan </em>because, after Golf Manor had filed its notice of appeal, the trial court sua sponte dismissed this case in an entry entitled \u201cOrder Staying Proceedings (Appeal).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 6} This entry provided that the case had been dismissed \u201cother than on the merits and without prejudice\u201d on the grounds that an appeal would \u201cindefinitely stay further proceedings.\u201d The entry also stated that the case could \u201cbe reactivated upon either party\u2019s motion for good cause shown or upon order of the Appellate Court, and reactivation will be retroactive to the original filing date and without additional filing costs.\u201d Based on this language, Golf Manor asserts that there were no other claims or parties below, and therefore that <em>Sullivan </em>and Civ.R. 54(B) did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court\u2019s order, however, was not a proper dismissal. While the Supreme Court has recognized that a trial court may dismiss a case sua sponte,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the reasons for such a dismissal must be recognized by the rules of civil procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And in some instances, the trial court must adhere to procedural safeguards before dismissing a case on its own volition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, the reason for the trial court\u2019s \u201cdismissal\u201d was not a legitimate one. There is no civil rule allowing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>trial court to dismiss a case \u201cbecause an appeal will indefinitely stay further proceedings.\u201d Nor is there a rule that allows a trial court to dismiss a case subject to reactivation \u201cretroactive to the original filing date and without additional filing costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court\u2019s entry was, at best, an order staying the proceedings, as it was entitled. At worst, it was a legal nullity. In any event, it was not a proper dismissal and <em>Sullivan </em>controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 9} We therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. This case is returned to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-8\">Cunningham, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b572-9\">Painter, P.
