This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">{\u00b6 2} Christy Motley was an employee of the Akron Health Department and a union member of the Civil Service Personnel Association, Inc. (\u201cCSPA\u201d). In August 2006, Motley sought to attend college courses during regular working hours through the city\u2019s \u201cAcademic Flexible Work Schedules\u201d program. Motley withdrew her request to participate in the program, however, when management indicated that staffing shortages necessitated her working all of her regular hours. Instead, Motley submitted a request for Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) leave time in order to care for her sick son. Health Department investigators later discovered Motley attending a college course during the hours that she had been approved to take her FMLA leave time.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">{\u00b6 3} According to the city, the city subsequently notified Motley that she was being recommended for discharge. After Motley received this recommendation, the parties held a pre-termination hearing consistent with <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. v. Loudermill </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494. The city further claims that CSPA sent the city a <em>\u201cLoudermill </em>response\u201d after the hearing, the city considered the information before it, and the city finally notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Motley on October 23, 2006, that she was in fact being discharged, effective October 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">{\u00b6 4} According to CSPA, the first notice that Motley ever received from the city was her notice of discharge, which she received on October 11, 2006. In response to the written notice, CSPA filed a grievance to challenge the discharge and filed a <em>\u201cLoudermill </em>response\u201d on October 20, 2006. CSPA claims that the city notified Motley that her discharge would be upheld on October 23, 2006, and effective the next day. On October 31, 2006, CSPA notified the city that the union wished to submit an appeal on behalf of Motley to arbitration pursuant to the collective-bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between CSPA and the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 5} On March 7, 2007, the matter proceeded to hearing before an arbitrator. The city and CSPA agreed to limit the arbitration to the following sole issue(s): \u201cWhether the discharge was for just cause under Article 28 [of the CBA]? If not, what shall the remedy be?\u201d The parties also entered two stipulations before the arbitrator: (1) that the matter was properly before the arbitrator for resolution and (2) that Motley had been given a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing. The arbitrator issued her decision on May 21, 2007, granting CSPA\u2019s grievance and ordering the city to reinstate Motley with full back pay and restoration of seniority. The arbitrator determined that Motley\u2019s termination was not for just cause under Article 28 of the CBA because the city had failed to comply with <em>Loudermill </em>and the due process protections afforded to Motley as a civil servant. The arbitrator reasoned that the city\u2019s notice of discharge, issued on October 11, 2006, clearly informed Motley that she was \u201chereby discharged\u201d even though it preceded any response from CSPA. Therefore, the arbitrator determined that the city never gave Motley a pre-termination opportunity to respond to the charges against her and terminated her without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 6} On August 20, 2007, the city filed a motion to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitration award in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. On September 28, 2007, CSPA filed an application to confirm and enforce the arbitration award. The trial court issued its decision on February 27, 2008, confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 7} On March 25, 2008, the city filed its notice of appeal in this court raising four assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Assignment of Error No. One</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The trial court erred as a matter of law because an arbitrator is bound by the parties\u2019 stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>{\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in failing to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award because the arbitrator exceeded her authority by disregarding the parties\u2019 stipulation. Specifically, the city argues that the parties stipulated at the arbitration hearing that Motley had received a \u201cpre-termination <em>Loudermill </em>hearing,\u201d but that the arbitrator ignored this stipulation in ruling that Motley had not been afforded adequate due process. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cOhio courts give deference to arbitration awards and presume they are valid.\u201d <em>Lauro v. Twinsburg, </em>9th Dist. No. 23711, 2007-Ohio-6613, 2007 WL 4322559, at \u00b6 5, citing <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 186, paragraph one of the syllabus, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in <em>Cincinnati v. Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., AFL-CIO </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 658, 576 N.E.2d 745. \u201cWhen parties agree to binding arbitration, they agree to accept the result and may not relitigate the facts as found by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Lauro </em>at \u00b6 5, citing <em>Gingrich v. Wooster </em>(Jan. 10, 2001), 9th Dist. No. 00CA0032, 2001 WL 22256, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2711.10 gives a trial court limited authority to review an arbitration award upon a party\u2019s request that the award be confirmed, modified, corrected, or vacated. <em>Warren Edn. Assn. v. Warren City Bd. of Edn. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 170, 173, 18 OBR 225, 480 N.E.2d 456. The limited grounds upon which a court may vacate an arbitration award are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">(A) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(B) There was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrators * * *[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(C) The arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced}; or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(D) The arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">R.C. 2711.10. The court may not review the actual merits upon which the award was based. <em>Lauro </em>at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">{\u00b6 11} Although a party may appeal from a trial court\u2019s order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an arbitration award, R.C. 2711.15, an appellate court\u2019s authority to review such an order is similarly limited. Id. at \u00b6 7. An appellate court may review the order only \u201cto discern whether an error occurred as a matter of law.\u201d Id., citing <em>Union Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Fraternal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>Order of Police, Ohio Valley Lodge No. 112 </em>(2001), 146 Ohio App.3d 456, 459, 766 N.E.2d 1027. Indeed, this court may review only the trial court\u2019s order, not the underlying arbitration proceeding. <em>Lauro </em>at \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Lockhart v. Am. Reserve Ins. Co. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 99, 101, 2 OBR 112, 440 N.E.2d 1210. \u201c[T]he arbitrator is the final judge of both law and facts, and * * * an award will not be set aside except upon a clear showing of fraud, misconduct or some other irregularity rendering the award unjust, inequitable, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Sunny wood Land Dev., Inc., </em>9th Dist. No. 06CA0089-M, 2007-Ohio-2154, 2007 WL 1309566, at \u00b6 12, quoting <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Local Union No. 200, United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of Am. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 516, 522, 71 O.O.2d 509, 330 N.E.2d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"> {\u00b6 12} An arbitrator exceeds her power when an award fails to draw its essence from the agreement of the parties. <em>Gingrich, </em>supra, at *5, citing <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining v. Ohio Civ. Serv. Emp. Assn., Local 11, AFSCME, AFL-CIO </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 177, 179-180, 572 N.E.2d 71. This occurs when there is an absence of \u201ca rational nexus between the agreement and the award,\u201d or when the award is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.\u201d <em>Gingrich, </em>supra, at *5, citing <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 132, 551 N.E.2d 186. An arbitrator also exceeds her authority, however, when she misinterprets or exceeds the conditions of a stipulation. <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 184, 572 N.E.2d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 13} The city argues that the arbitrator exceeded her authority because she ignored the parties\u2019 stipulation that a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing had taken place and erroneously awarded the grievance based on an issue beyond that to which the parties stipulated. CSPA concedes that the parties stipulated that a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing occurred, but argues that this concession was not akin to a stipulation that Motley was afforded all of her due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 14} <em>Loudermill </em>requires a \u201cclassified civil service employee\u201d to be given a pre-termination disciplinary hearing. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 545, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494. \u201c[S]uch hearing need not be elaborate, but must afford the employee the opportunity to have an explanation of the employer\u2019s charges and evidence against [her], and an opportunity to present [her] side of the story.\u201d <em>Local 4501, Communications Workers of Am. v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 1, 5-6, 550 N.E.2d 164, citing <em>Loudermill, </em>supra. In her award, the arbitrator noted that the parties stipulated that the matter was properly before her for resolution, but failed to mention the parties\u2019 other stipulation that a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing had occurred. The arbitrator specifically determined that the city failed to comply with <em>Loudermill, </em>and thus, failed to discharge Motley for \u201cjust cause.\u201d In confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award, the trial court determined that it lacked authority to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>on an alleged error regarding the parties\u2019 stipulation because it was a factual determination. See <em>United Paperworkers Internatl. Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc. </em>(1987), 484 U.S. 29, 36, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (noting that a court may not reconsider the merits of an arbitrator\u2019s award when the alleged error concerns the underlying facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b6 15} Contrary to the trial court\u2019s holding, the parties\u2019 stipulation (that a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing was held) was not a factual determination outside of the court\u2019s reviewing authority. This is not an instance where the parties disagree as to whether a stipulation occurred. CSPA concedes that the parties stipulated before the arbitrator that a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing took place. CSPA\u2019s argument that it did not intend for this stipulation to encompass all of Motley\u2019s due process rights is inapposite. The phrase <em>\u201cLoudermill </em>hearing\u201d is a term of art with a distinct legal meaning, not some amorphous concept subject to debate. Thus, the parties removed the issue of whether the city afforded Motley her due process rights under <em>Loudermill </em>from the arbitrator\u2019s consideration. By wholly ignoring the stipulation, the arbitrator went beyond the scope of the issue presented to her and exceeded her authority. See <em>Ohio Office of Collective Bargaining, </em>59 Ohio St.3d at 184, 572 N.E.2d 71. Accordingly, the city\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Assignment of Error No. Two</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The trial court erroneously concluded that the arbitrator\u2019s use of an implied due process requirement was a reasonable interpretation or plain and ordinary use of te [sic] phrase just cause by erroneously interpreting precedent regarding arbitrators considering due process as part of a just cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Assignment of Error No. Three</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The trial court erred in finding that the arbitrator did not make a material mistake regarding the date of motley\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Assignment of Error Number Four</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The trial court erred in finding that there is not an explicit, well-defined public policy supporting the use of FMLA leave time.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">{\u00b6 16} In its remaining assignments of error, the city argues that the trial court erred in confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award because (1) the arbitrator exceeded her authority by interjecting a due process analysis into her just-cause determination and finding the interjection dispositive, (2) the arbitrator exceeded her authority by concluding that Motley was effectively discharged some two weeks earlier than her actual discharge date, and (3) a court may not confirm an award that violates public policy, as this award does by condoning Motley\u2019s abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of FMLA leave time. Given our determination that the arbitrator exceeded her authority and her award must be reversed, the city\u2019s remaining assignments of error are moot and we decline to address them. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 17} The city\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. The city\u2019s remaining assignments of error are moot, and we decline to address them. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-8\">Caer, P.J., and Slaby, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
