During the pendency of this appeal, Marc Dann resigned as Attorney General, and Nancy Hardin Rogers was named interim Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-4\">McFarland, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 1} Appellant, the Ohio Department of Health (\u201cODH\u201d), appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment that reversed its decision finding that the mail-delivery policy of appellee, Washington County Home, violates R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a). Appellant contends that the trial court improperly interpreted the statute so as to require a resident to request that he or she receive sealed, unopened mail. The trial court did not improperly interpret the statute. The statute plainly and unambiguously requires the resident to request to receive sealed, unopened mail. However, the statute excepts communications from the resident\u2019s attorney or physician, or from a public official from this requirement. Therefore, to this limited extent, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and. remand for clarification. In all other respects, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant further argues that the trial court erroneously determined that R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a) conflicts with the financial duties contained in R.C. Chapter 5155. Our disposition of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error renders this argument moot. Therefore, we need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 3} Finally, appellant contends that the trial court incorrectly applied the standard of review applicable to administrative appeals. Because the instant case involves a question of law, i.e., the interpretation of a statute, appellant\u2019s assertions that the court improperly substituted its judgment or improperly considered the evidence are unavailing. In an administrative appeal, the trial court has plenary power to review questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, we reverse and remand the trial court\u2019s judgment so that it may determine whether reliable, probative, and substantive evidence exists to support a finding that appellee violated R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a) as it relates to communications from a resident\u2019s physician or attorney, or from a public official. In all other respects, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">{\u00b6 5} An Ohio Department of Health surveyor investigated a complaint at appellee\u2019s facility that residents did not have the right to receive unopened mail. She spoke with some residents who informed her that they were called to a facility office to open \u201cofficial-looking\u201d mail in front of a facility employee. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>stated that the residents advised her that they did not want to go to the office to open their mail. Appellant subsequently found probable cause to believe that appellee violated R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a) regarding residents\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 6} At a hearing, Washington County Home assistant administrator Rosalind Williams testified that the facility\u2019s current mail-delivery policy is to send \u201cofficial-looking\u201d mail to the social-services office. The social-services director then calls each resident to the office and inquires whether the resident needs help with the mail. Williams stated that the residents are not required to open the mail in front of the director and may refuse to do so. She further stated that the facility has never opened residents\u2019 mail. She explained that at one point, the facility delivered all mail directly to the residents, but found that residents missed appointments or failed to file the proper paperwork to receive financial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 7} The hearing examiner found that appellee\u2019s mail-delivery policy violated R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a). The acting director of health subsequently adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation and ordered appellee to stop \u201cits policy of retaining official looking mail for later opening by the recipient in the presence of facility staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellee then appealed the decision to the trial court. The trial court reversed appellant\u2019s decision. The court found as follows. When mail arrives at the home, the facility sorts the mail into \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cofficial\u201d mail. The personal mail is delivered to the residents, but the official-looking mail is sent to the social-services director. The director summons the resident to the office, provides the resident with the unopened mail, and then asks the resident if he or she needs help with the matters contained in the mail. If the mail contains a check, the director takes the check to use for supporting the resident. The court found no evidence that appellee actually opens its residents\u2019 mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 9} The court determined that appellant\u2019s decision finding that appellee\u2019s mail-delivery policy violates R.C. 3721.12(A)(21)(a) is not supported by the law. The court explained that the obligation set forth in R.C. 3721.12(A)(21) \u201cis not an absolute requirement,\u201d but \u201cis conditioned by the language \u2018upon reasonable request.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 10} The court further concluded that to construe the statute as appellant suggested would subvert appellee\u2019s statutory obligation to secure possession of its residents\u2019 assets. The court explained that appellee has an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF3\">obligation to gather the assets of their residents and to apply those funds to the care of that resident in accordance with law. The county home has an obligation to provide unopened mail to their residents. Many of the residents receive some form of assistance or disability in the form of checks mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>them. These checks are often not turned over to the county home as required, absent some oversight by county home personnel. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">The county home has attempted to meet it\u2019s [sic] obligation to the county and to its residents by instituting, and then re-instituting, the procedure that is in question here. The State fails to appreciate the difficulties faced by the county home in meeting its obligation to the county and the county tax payers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">The county home sees no option to its current practice, which is an attempt to meet both of it\u2019s [sic] legal obligations \u2014 to provide private unopened mail, and to gather assets to pay for the care of residents. The State has suggested various other methodologies to meet the obligation to obtain assets and income. None of the methods suggested meets the needs of the county home. The suggested solutions do not provide for the transfer of funds to the county to partially reimburse for the care of the residents. They are methodologies that leave the funds in the control of the resident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The court thus concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">To read the mail requirement as absolute would require a finding that the legislature determined that the damage to residents by loss of income, loss of services and deterioration to health and general condition that results from missed services and appointments is outweighed by the rubric of \u201cprivacy protection.\u201d Under the statute the unopened mail obligation is not absolute. The legislature is presumed to know of the obligation to obtain assets and assist residents with care under the county home statutes when it enacted this section. To read the section as argued by the [ODH] would be tantamount to finding that the legislature enacted this section to eliminate a sensible, low cost, efficient, and minimally invasive methodology to acquire information so as to be able to provide needed help and to maximize reimbursement and minimize the burden on the tax payers. Such a tortured reading of the statute is not warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant timely appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">{\u00b6 12} Appellant raises three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">{\u00b6 13} I. \u201cThe lower court erred as a matter of law in holding that the obligation of a long term care facility to guarantee the rights of its residents to private and unrestricted communications, including the right to receive, send and mail sealed, unopened correspondence as set forth in Revised Code Section 3721.13(A)(21), \u2018is not an absolute statutory requirement.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>{\u00b6 14} II. \u201cThe lower court erred as a matter of law in finding a conflict of duties imposed on county homes by Revised Code Chapter 5155 and Revised Code Section 3721.13(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 15} III. \u201cThe lower court erred as a matter of law in interpreting R.C. 3721.12(A)(21) to allow a facility to compel its residents to open their mail in the presence of a county home staff person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant\u2019s three assignments of error challenge the propriety of the trial court\u2019s judgment reversing ODH\u2019s decision. Because they are interrelated, we address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 17} In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in interpreting the statute. Specifically, appellant contends that the trial court improperly interpreted the statute so as to require the resident to request to receive sealed, unopened mail. Appellant further argues that the \u201cupon reasonable request\u201d provision does not apply when the mail originates from public officials, physicians, or attorneys and claims that at least one resident was summoned to the office to open a letter from his attorney. Appellant additionally asserts that the trial court erred by concluding that the rights contained in the statute are not absolute, but may be trumped by a county home\u2019s alleged statutory financial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 18} Appellee argues that the trial court properly determined that it did not violate R.C. 3721.13(A)(21). Appellee asserts that the evidence shows that it does not open its residents\u2019 mail and does not require them to open mail in front of a staff member. However, appellee\u2019s argument does not address whether the resident must affirmatively assert the right to receive sealed, unopened mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">{\u00b6 19} In its second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by concluding that R.C. 3721.13(A)(21) conflicts with R.C. 5155.23, 5155.24, and 5155.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">{\u00b6 20} In its third assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court improperly applied the standard of review that governs an administrative appeal. Appellant asserts that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of ODH. In particular, appellant complains that the court ignored ODH\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s mail policy violates the statute, as ODH interpreted it. Appellant appears to posit that the trial court was bound by ODH\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute and that it could not independently interpret the statute. Appellant further argues that the trial court improperly conducted a de novo review of the evidence in reaching its decision. Appellant states that some of the facts that the trial court cited in its decision \u201cdo not readily appear in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>hearing transcript and are not included in the Hearing Officer\u2019s Findings of Fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A. TRIAL COURT STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 21} In an R.C. 119.12 administrative appeal, a common pleas court must affirm the agency\u2019s decision if it is supported by \u201creliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\u201d See <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748; <em>In re Williams </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 85, 86, 573 N.E.2d 638. \u201c \u2018Reliable\u2019 evidence is dependable or trustworthy; \u2018probative\u2019 evidence tends to prove the issue in question and is relevant to the issue presented; and \u2018substantial\u2019 evidence carries some weight or value.\u201d <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Case W. Res. Univ. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 168, 178, 666 N.E.2d 1376, citing <em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 22} Thus, when a trial court reviews the commission\u2019s finding, it must \u201cappraise all the evidence * * * \u2018and, if from such a consideration it finds that the * * * [board\u2019s] order is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law, the court is authorized to reverse, vacate, or modify the order * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265, quoting <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 131 N.E.2d 390, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201c[W]hether an agency order is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence essentially is a question of the absence or presence of the requisite quantum of evidence. Although this in essence is a legal question, inevitably it involves a consideration of the evidence, and to a limited extent would permit a substitution of judgment by the reviewing Common Pleas Court.\u201d Id. at 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265. Furthermore, while \u201ca Court of Common Pleas \u2018must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts,\u2019 [id.], [d]ue deference * * * does not contemplate uncritical acquiescence to administrative findings.\u201d <em>Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 192, 200, 20 O.O.3d 200, 421 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 23} Although a trial court may not try the issues de novo or substitute its judgment for the administrative agency, see <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848, and <em>Conrad, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 110, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265, it may decide purely legal questions de novo. See <em>Ohio Historical Soc. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 466, 470-471, 613 N.E.2d 591; <em>Joudah v. Ohio Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 614, 616-617, 641 N.E.2d 288. Thus, \u201c[t]o the extent that an agency\u2019s decision is based on construction of the state or federal Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>a statute, or case law, the common pleas court must undertake its R.C. 119.12 reviewing task completely independently.\u201d <em>Ohio Historical Soc. </em>at 471, 613 N.E.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">B. APPELLATE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 24} In contrast to the trial court\u2019s standard of review, an appellate court\u2019s review of an administrative agency\u2019s order is more limited. See <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 260-261, 533 N.E.2d 264. It is incumbent on a trial court to examine the evidence. See <em>Pons, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 621, 614 N.E.2d 748. Such is not the charge of an appellate court. Id. Instead, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court has abused its discretion. Id. Thus, absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, a court of appeals must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. See id. An abuse of discretion constitutes more than an error of law or judgment; rather, it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. See, e.g., <em>Landis v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 339, 342, 695 N.E.2d 1140; <em>Malone v. Courtyard by Marriott L.P. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 440, 448, 659 N.E.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 25} Additionally, an appellate court must not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency or a trial court. <em>Pons, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 621, 614 N.E.2d 748. The fact that the court of appeals might have arrived at a different conclusion than did the administrative agency is immaterial. \u201cWith respect to purely legal questions, however, the court is to exercise independent judgment.\u201d <em>VFW Post 8586 v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 79, 81-82, 697 N.E.2d 655; see also <em>Nye v. Ohio Bd. of Examiners of Architects, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 502, 2006-Ohio-948, 847 N.E.2d 46, at \u00b6 11 (stating that appellate court has plenary review of legal questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">C. INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 26} The instant case requires us to examine whether the trial court properly interpreted the residents\u2019 rights provision contained in R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">{\u00b6 27} The interpretation of a statute involves a purely legal question. Thus, we conduct a de novo review of a trial court\u2019s judgment interpreting a statute and afford no deference to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute. See, e.g., <em>Oliver v. Johnson, </em>Jackson App. No. 06CA16, 2007-Ohio-5880, 2007 WL 3227668, at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">{\u00b628} In construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770, 886 N.E.2d 206, at \u00b6 17; <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11. \u201c \u2018The court must look to the statute itself to determine legislative intent, and if such intent is clearly expressed therein, the statute may not be restricted, constricted, qualified, narrowed, enlarged or abridged; significance and effect should, if possible, be accorded to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. McGraw v. Gorman </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 147, 149, 17 OBR 350, 478 N.E.2d 770, quoting <em>Wachendorf v. Shaver </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 231, 36 O.O. 554, 78 N.E.2d 370, paragraph five of the syllabus. To determine legislative intent, a court must \u201c \u2018read words and phrases in context and construe them in accordance with rules of grammar and common usage.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966, \u00b6 11. \u201cIn construing the terms of a particular statute, words must be given their usual, normal, and/or customary meanings.\u201d <em>Proctor v. Kardassilaris, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 71, 2007-Ohio-4838, 873 N.E.2d 872, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">{\u00b6 29} When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need to apply rules of statutory construction. Id.; see also <em>Cline v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 573 N.E.2d 77; <em>Sears v. Weimer </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 312, 28 O.O. 270, 55 N.E.2d 413, paragraph five of the syllabus. However, when a statute is subject to various interpretations, a court may invoke rules of statutory construction to arrive at legislative intent. R.C. 1.49; <em>Cline, </em>supra; <em>Carter v. Youngstown </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">D. RESIDENTS\u2019 RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cR.C. Chapter 3721 contains provisions for protecting the rights of patients and residents at nursing homes, a quickly growing segment of Ohio\u2019s population. R.C. 3721.10 through 3721.17 provide specific rights to nursing home patients and residents, such as the right to certain living conditions and the right to adequate medical treatment. These provisions are referred to as the \u2018nursing home patients\u2019 bill of rights.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Belinky v. Drake Ctr., Inc. </em>(1996), 117 Ohio App.3d 497, 503, 690 N.E.2d 1302. The administrator of the home must furnish each resident a copy of the rights upon admission to the home. See R.C. 3721.12(A)(3)(a). Moreover, R.C. 3721.13(C) states that any attempted waiver of those rights is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 31} As relevant to the case at bar, R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a) provides a resident with the following right:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>(21) The right upon reasonable request to private and unrestricted communications with the resident\u2019s family, social worker, and any other person, unless not medically advisable as documented in the resident\u2019s medical record by the attending physician, except that communications with public officials or with the resident\u2019s attorney or physician shall not be restricted. Private and unrestricted communications shall include, but are not limited to, the right to:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">(a) Receive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 32} Under the rules of statutory interpretation, the first question we must decide is whether the statute is unambiguous. If it is, then we simply apply the statute as written and have no need to resort to the rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a) is not ambiguous. The statute states that the resident has the \u201cright upon reasonable request to private and unrestricted communications with the resident\u2019s family, social worker, and any other person * * *.\u201d The statute states that \u201c[pjrivate and unrestricted communications\u201d includes the right to \u201c[r]eceive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence.\u201d Inserting this definition into the first part of the statute, the statute provides a resident the right upon reasonable request to receive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence with the resident\u2019s family, social worker, and any other person. Thus, the statute plainly grants a resident the right, upon reasonable request, to receive sealed, unopened correspondence from the resident\u2019s family, social worker, and any other person. The phrasing of the statute is neither ambiguous nor subject to varying interpretations. The phrase \u201cupon reasonable request\u201d qualifies a resident\u2019s right to receive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence. The statute plainly requires the resident to request to receive, send, and mail sealed, unopened correspondence. The requirement that the resident request this right \u201cenables \u2018home\u2019 officials to consult with a resident\u2019s physician prior to granting the request if there is any question regarding the medical advisability of the request.\u201d <em>State v. Otten </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 341, 515 N.E.2d 1009. As applied to the situation in the case at bar, if a resident requests that he or she receive sealed, unopened correspondence, then facility officials may consult with a physician to determine the medical advisability of the request. For instance, a physician may determine that a resident lacks the mental ability to adequately handle and process his or her mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 34} However, the statute does not allow communications from the resident\u2019s attorney, physician, or public officials to be restricted. Therefore, to the extent that appellee restricts residents\u2019 access to mail from attorneys, physicians, or public officials, appellee\u2019s policy violates the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>{\u00b6 35} Appellant claims that the official-looking mail from the Social Security Administration, for example, is mail from \u201cpublic officials\u201d that appellee cannot restrict. Appellant does not provide any argument as to why the Social Security Administration should be included in the definition of \u201cpublic official.\u201d Our own research suggests that a federal agency, such as the Social Security Administration, is not the same as a \u201cpublic official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">{\u00b6 36} To determine the plain meaning of \u201cpublic official,\u201d we look to the ordinary use of that term. Blacks Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, 1990, defines \u201cpublic official\u201d as: \u201cA person who, upon being issued a commission, taking required oath, enters upon, for a fixed tenure, a position called an office where he or she exercises in his or her own right some of the attributes of sovereign he or she serves for the benefit of public. The holder of a public office though not all persons in public employment are public officials, because public official\u2019s position requires the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power, whether great or small.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Sperry v. Licking Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(Sept. 18, 1995), Licking App. No. 95CA52, 1995 WL 615951. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, 1993, defines \u201cpublic officer\u201d as: \u201cA person who has been legally elected or appointed to office and who exercises governmental functions.\u201d See id. Both of these definitions state that a \u201cpublic official\u201d is a person, not an agency. Thus, a state or federal agency is not the same as a public official, and such agencies are not reasonably encompassed within the term \u201cpublic officials\u201d as used in R.C. 3721.13(A)(21). Consequently, appellant\u2019s contention that the Social Security Administration or other federal or state agencies are \u201cpublic officials\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 3721.13(A)(21) is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 37} In addition to R.C. 3721.13(A)(21), the Ohio Administrative Code contains a regulation that addresses resident mail. See Ohio Adm.Code 3701-17-09(G). \u201c \u2018An Ohio Administrative Code section is a further arm, extension, or explanation of statutory intent implementing a statute passed by the General Assembly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Belinky, </em>117 Ohio App.3d at 505-506, 690 N.E.2d 1302, quoting <em>State ex rel. Meyers v. State Lottery Comm. </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 232, 234, 517 N.E.2d 1029. Thus, when reasonably possible, courts must harmonize, reconcile, and construe statutes and administrative regulations together. See <em>State ex rel. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 25, 27, 27 OBR 442, 500 N.E.2d 1370, citing <em>State ex rel. McGraw v. Gorman </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 147, 17 OBR 350, 478 N.E.2d 770, and <em>Wooster Republican Printing Co. v. Wooster </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 126, 10 O.O.3d 312, 383 N.E.2d 124. Moreover, a rule implemented as an extension of a statute has the full force and effect of a statute, unless it is unreasonable or conflicts with a statute covering the same subject matter. See <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 377, 382, 627 N.E.2d 538; <em>Belinky, </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Ohio App.3d at 505, 690 N.E.2d 1302. \u201c[W]here a potential conflict exists between an administrative rule and a statute, an administrative rule is not inconsistent with a statute unless the rule contravenes or is in derogation of some express provision of the statute.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Accountancy Bd. of Ohio </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 453, 459, 624 N.E.2d 292, citing <em>McAninch v. Crumbley </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 31, 34, 19 O.O.3d 225, 417 N.E.2d 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">{\u00b6 38} Ohio Adm.Code 3701-17-09(G) states: \u201cThe administrator shall ensure that: (1) All mail, telegrams, or other communications addressed to residents is delivered to the addressee unopened and unread immediately upon receipt at the nursing home, and opened and read to the resident after delivery if the resident so requests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 39} Unlike the statute, the administrative code provision does not require the resident to request to receive mail unopened. Instead, the code requires the facility administrator to immediately deliver mail to the resident unopened and unread. Then, if the resident requests, a facility member may open and read the mail to the resident. This process appears to conflict with the statute, which requires the resident to request that he or she receive the mail unopened. To the extent that the code provision conflicts with the statute, the code provision is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 40} In sum, appellee\u2019s policy of summoning a resident to the office to open mail does not violate R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a), unless the mail originates from the resident\u2019s attorney or physician or from a public official. The statute does not prohibit a county home from monitoring and sorting a resident\u2019s mail. Instead, the statute imposes a duty upon the resident to request private and unrestricted communications, which includes the right to receive sealed, unopened mail. Consequently, appellant\u2019s arguments in its first and third assignments of error that the trial court erred by interpreting the statute are without merit. However, to the extent that appellee restricts residents\u2019 access to mail that originates from an attorney or physician, or a public official, appellee\u2019s policy violates R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a). Therefore, to this limited extent, we reverse and remand the trial court\u2019s judgment for clarification whether appellee\u2019s mail policy violates R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, the foregoing analysis renders appellant\u2019s second assignment of error moot. The above statutory interpretation does not include any discussion of R.C. Chapter 5155 and appellee\u2019s alleged financial duties under those statutes. The statute is clear and unambiguous, and we need not consider whether the contrary interpretation appellant suggests would conflict with R.C. Chapter 5155. \u2022 Because we may uphold the trial court\u2019s judgment without considering the impact of R.C. Chapter 5155 on R.C. 3721.13(A)(21)(a), we need not consider appellant\u2019s second assignment of error that the trial court improper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ly determined that compliance with R.C. 3721.13(A)(21) conflicts with R.C. Chapter 5155. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 42} Additionally, we reject appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court improperly applied the standard of review. The appeal involved only questions of law, i.e., whether the policy violates R.C. 3721.13(A)(21). A trial court may independently review purely legal questions and need not defer to the agency\u2019s decision. The trial court did not reverse appellee\u2019s decision on an evidentiary basis, but because its decision was not in accordance with the law. Consequently, appellant\u2019s arguments that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary findings conflict with ODH\u2019s findings do not impact the outcome of this appeal. See <em>Kelly, </em>88 Ohio App.3d at 461, 624 N.E.2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 43} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s third and second assignments of error. We overrule in part and sustain in part appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-8\">Abele, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b130-9\">Kline J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. The parties do not dispute that R.C. 3721.13 applies to appellee, a county home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
