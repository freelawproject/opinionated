Byrd subsequently entered negotiated pleas of guilty to three of the offenses charged, and the state dismissed the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">{\u00b6 2} In common pleas case No. 2006CR5353/1, Byrd pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01(A), with a firearm specification attached to that felony charge pursuant to R.C. 2941.145. Byrd was sentenced to serve a three-year prison term for the specification offense, to run prior to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>three-year term for the aggravated-robbery offense, for an aggregate term of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">{\u00b6 3} In common pleas case No. 2007CR532/2, Byrd pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated robbery and to two counts of kidnapping, R.C. 2905.01, and the firearm specifications attached to each of those felony charges. The court merged the specifications. Byrd was sentenced to serve a three-year prison term for the specification offense, to run prior to a four-year sentence for each aggravated-robbery offense and three years for each kidnapping offense, to run concurrently, for an aggregate prison term of seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">{\u00b6 4} The aggregate six-year term in case No. 2006CR5353/1 and the aggregate seven-year term in case No. 2007CR532/2 were ordered to run consecutively, for a total prison term of 13 years. Byrd filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cContrary to appellant\u2019s rights to due process and the requirements of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), appellant\u2019s plea was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered because the court\u2019s colloquy never explained that his sentences would be mandatory and make him ineligible for judicial release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 6} Aggravated robbery is a first-degree felony. R.C. 2911.01(C). Kidnapping is a second-degree felony. R.C. 2905.01(C). Per R.C. 2929.13(F)(6), a sentencing court is mandated to impose a prison term for first- and second-degree felony offenses when the offender was previously convicted of a first- or second-degree felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 7} Byrd was previously convicted of a second-degree felony offense in Montgomery Common Pleas case No. 2004CR2605. Therefore, in the present cases the prison sentences the court imposed were mandatory, and Byrd was told by the court during the Crim.R. 11 colloquy on his guilty pleas that the prison sentences were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">{\u00b6 8} A court that imposes a prison sentence on an \u201celigible offender\u201d may subsequently reduce the term of that sentence by ordering a judicial release. R.C. 2929.20(B). Division (A) of R.C. 2929.20 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018eligible offender\u2019 means any person serving a stated prison term of ten years of less when either of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(1) The stated prison term does not include a mandatory prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(2) The stated prison term includes a mandatory prison term, and the person has served the mandatory prison term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">{\u00b6 12} Because Byrd was sentenced to mandatory prison terms, he is ineligible for judicial release. Byrd argues on appeal that his pleas of guilty were improperly accepted by the court, because the court failed to determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Byrd understood that he is ineligible for judicial release before it accepted his guilty pleas. Byrd relies on Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) and our prior holding in <em>State v. Pape </em>(Nov. 21, 2001), Clark App. No. 2000CA98, 2001 WL 1473764.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 13} Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) provides that in felony cases a court \u201cshall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first addressing the defendant personally and * * *. [determining that the defendant is making the plea voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved, and if applicable, that the defendant is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Pape, </em>we held that though the defendant understood that he faced a mandatory prison sentence of four years, and though the court was unaware that the defendant\u2019s counsel had allegedly told defendant he would be eligible for judicial release, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) required the court to determine that the defendant understood that he would be ineligible for judicial release because his sentence was mandatory. We relied on two decisions of other districts that involved failure to advise a defendant that he was ineligible for shock probation: <em>State v. Colbert </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 734, 595 N.E.2d 401, and <em>State v. Brigham </em>(Feb. 27, 1997), Franklin App. Nos. 96APA07-964 and 96APA07-970, 1997 WL 84650.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">{\u00b6 15} <em>Colbert </em>was an appeal from an order denying a defendant\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. At the plea hearing, the prosecutor stated that defense counsel had indicated an intent to move for super shock probation and that \u201cwe will not oppose that.\u201d The court added: \u201cFor the record, the court had indicated in chambers that the court would recommend it upon proper motion.\u201d 71 Ohio App.3d at 738, 595 N.E.2d 401. The court\u2019s written entry on the plea also stated, \u201cThe Court indicated that it would allow the Defendant to be brought back from prison on motion by the Defendant after the Defendant has served six months in prison.\u201d Id. However, when the defendant moved for super shock probation, the court denied the motion. The defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas, and the court also denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">{\u00b6 16} On appeal, the defendant in <em>Colbert </em>might have relied on the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard of Crim.R. 32.1 to argue that the trial court induced his guilty pleas by misrepresenting the court\u2019s intention to grant super shock probation. Instead, the defendant relied on Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). Addressing that rule and its requirements, the Court of Appeals of Portage County cited the rule of substantial compliance with Crim.R. 11 announced in <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163, noting that \u201ccompliance with the rule can be based upon a consideration of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the entry of the plea.\u201d 71 Ohio App.3d at 737, 595 N.E.2d 401. The appellate court also observed that \u201cthe failure to inform the defendant of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ineligibility for probation, under certain circumstances, may be prejudicial error requiring the vacation of the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d Id. at 738, 595 N.E.2d 401. The appellate court then found that the statements the court made constituted such circumstances, and it reversed the trial court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Brigham, </em>the defendant entered guilty, pleas to having weapons under disability, with a firearms specification, and carrying a concealed weapon. When the defendant inquired of the court whether he was eligible for shock probation, the court advised him that he was ineligible during his term of three years\u2019 actual incarceration on the firearm specification. Defendant\u2019s counsel indicated he would move for shock probation after that, and stated: \u201cI said if we were able to file, we would file, and you (the court) would consider it at that time.\u201d When the defendant asked the court whether it would consider the motion, the court replied that it would make no promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">{\u00b6 18} On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Franklin County held in <em>Brigham </em>that the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas were accepted in violation of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), because his \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s representations were \u2018unfulfillable\u2019 because appellant\u2019s convictions were nonprobationable.\u201d Id. at *2. The court rejected the state\u2019s substantial-compliance argument, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cCrim.R. 11(C) does not require the trial court to discuss shock probation eligibility, nor does this court hold that, in every case, the trial court must advise a defendant that he is ineligible for super shock probation. On a case-by-case basis, that may or may not be necessary. We merely hold that, whe[n] a defendant asks that specific question, the defendant is entitled to an accurate answer so he can make an intelligent waiver of his rights by entering a guilty plea.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 20} Unlike in <em>Colbert </em>and <em>Brigham, </em>in neither the present case nor in <em>Pape </em>was there any claim or indication that either counsel or the court had misstated or misrepresented that the defendant was eligible for judicial release when he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">{\u00b6 21} After acknowledging that fact, we wrote in <em>Pape :</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cNevertheless, we conclude that requiring the trial court to determine that a defendant understands he is ineligible for judicial release is a salutary interpretation of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) which furthers the purpose of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) that pleas of guilty and no contest be voluntarily and intelligently made, i.e., \u2018with full understanding of the consequences,\u2019 <em>Brigham, supra, </em>citing <em>Kercheval v. United States </em>(1927), 274 U.S. 220, 223 [47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009].\u201d <em>Pape, </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>{\u00b6 23} When <em>Colbert </em>and <em>Brigham </em>were decided, Crim.R. 11(C)(2) required the court to determine that the defendant entered his guilty or no-contest plea with the \u201cunderstanding * * *, <em>if applicable, </em>that [h]e is not eligible for probation.\u201d (Emphasis added.). The rule now requires a determination of the Defendant\u2019s \u201cunderstanding * * *, <em>if applicable, </em>that he is not eligible for probation or for the imposition of community control sanctions at the sentencing hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 24} On closer review, we believe that the holdings in <em>Colbert </em>and <em>Brigham </em>stand for the proposition that when a defendant\u2019s eligibility for probation or community control sanctions is misrepresented or misstated, a determination by the court that the defendant understands he is ineligible is then \u201capplicable,\u201d and that the same applies to the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for \u201csuper shock probation\u201d or, as it is now, judicial release. Neither <em>Colbert </em>nor <em>Brigham </em>held that in every instance in which a mandatory sentence is imposed that the court must determine that a defendant understands he is ineligible for judicial release. Indeed, <em>Colbert </em>expressly disclaimed that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 25} Furthermore, a careful reading of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) convinces us that, absent some misstatement or relevant inquiry, that rule imposes no requirement relative to judicial release. The rule is concerned with and limited to sentencing alternatives that are available \u201cat the sentencing hearing.\u201d The Staff Note to the rule states:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe 1998 amendment to Crim.R. 11(C) was made in light of changes in terminology used in the criminal law of Ohio effective July 1, 1996. Prior to this amendment, a court was required to advise a defendant facing a mandatory prison term that he or she was not eligible for probation before accepting a plea of guilty or no contest. Since \u2018probation\u2019 was replaced by \u2018community control sanctions\u2019 for felony offenses occurring on or after July 1, 1996, but continues to be used for felonies committed prior that date, neutral language requiring a court to advise a defendant of any minimum incarceration that must be imposed was inserted into the rule for simplification and universal application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 27} The focus of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) is now minimum sentences that the court is required by law to impose \u201cat the sentencing hearing,\u201d and a defendant\u2019s understanding that when that requirement applies, he is ineligible for a more lenient sentence of probation or community-control sanctions instead. That requirement does not extend to a defendant\u2019s ineligibility for judicial release, for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 28} First, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) is concerned with sentences the court can impose, and probation and community-control sanctions are sentences the court can impose. Judicial release, on the other hand, reduces a stated prison term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>that was imposed. A defendant\u2019s ineligibility for judicial release is not one of the matters regarding which Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) requires the court to determine a defendant\u2019s understanding concerning the sentence the court may impose when the defendant enters a plea of guilty or no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 29} Second, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) is expressly limited to sentences that may be imposed \u201cat the sentencing hearing.\u201d A person is eligible for judicial release only if he is \u201cserving a stated prison term of ten years or less.\u201d R.C. 2929.20(A). Necessarily, that prison term is one that was imposed at the sentencing hearing. Judicial release cannot be ordered instead, and because judicial release is then unavailable, no defendant can be potentially eligible for judicial release \u201cat the sentencing hearing.\u201d Properly construed, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) applies only to sentences that are available at that time, for which a particular defendant is ineligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 30} We hold that when a defendant on whom a mandatory prison sentence is imposed enters a plea of guilty or no contest, before accepting the plea the court must determine the defendant\u2019s understanding that the mandatory sentence renders the defendant ineligible for alternative sentences of probation or community-control sanctions. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). However, though the mandatory sentence likewise renders the defendant ineligible for judicial release during his prison term, R.C. 2929.20(A), the court is not required by Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) to determine the defendant\u2019s understanding of that fact, absent notice of some misstatement or misrepresentation that causes the determination to be \u201capplicable\u201d in order to ensure that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or no contest is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. <em>Colbert; Brigham. </em>To the extent that our decision in <em>Pape </em>holds otherwise, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 31} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cContrary to appellant\u2019s rights to due process the state of Ohio contaminated the sentencing process by breaching their plea agreement not to pursue sentencing enhancements, and to treat the offenses as one single offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">{\u00b6 33} When defendant offered his guilty pleas on September 4, 2007, and after reviewing the terms of the plea agreement, defendant\u2019s attorney made the following representation to the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cAdditionally, your Honor, there was some discussion this morning regarding whether or not the State would be pursuing a sentencing enhancement against my client for the convictions of multiple felony ones. And the State said that they would not be pursuing that, they would treat this as one single conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>{\u00b6 35} On September 14, 2007, the state filed a memorandum in which it recommended that the court impose maximum, consecutive sentences. Byrd argues that the recommendation breached the plea agreement, requiring a reversal of defendant\u2019s sentence and vacation of his guilty pleas. <em>Santobello v. New York </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 36} Defendant failed to object to the state\u2019s recommendation. He therefore forfeited the error he assigns on appeal. <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306. In that case, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c{\u00b6 15} Typically, if a party forfeits an objection in the trial court, reviewing courts may notice only \u2018[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights.\u2019 Crim.R. 52(B). Inherent in the rule are three limits placed on reviewing courts for correcting plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c{\u00b6 16} \u2018First, there must be an error, <em>ie., </em>a deviation from the legal rule. * * * Second, the error must be plain. To be \u201cplain\u201d within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B), an error must be an \u201cobvious\u201d defect in the trial proceedings. * * * Third, the error must have affected \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d We have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.\u2019 <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Courts are to notice plain error \u2018only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> {\u00b6 39} \u201c{\u00b6 17} The burden of demonstrating plain error is on the party asserting it. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jester </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 147, 150, 512 N.E.2d 962. A reversal is warranted if the party can prove that the outcome \u2018would have been different absent the error.\u2019 <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 203, 749 N.E.2d 274.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 40} Defendant argues that the state\u2019s recommendation of maximum, consecutive sentences breached the plea agreement to not seek a \u201csentencing enhancement\u201d and to \u201ctreat this as one single conviction.\u201d We do not agree. The firearms specifications attached to the felony offenses to which defendant entered guilty pleas required additional sentences which, by operation of law, \u201cenhanced\u201d the sentences the court imposed for the felonies. There was nothing for the state to do in that respect, and recommending maximum sentence for those felony offenses within their available statutory ranges did not \u201cenhance\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">{\u00b6 41} Treating the felony sentences \u201cas one single conviction,\u201d as defendant\u2019s counsel had characterized the state\u2019s promise, could be construed to preclude the consecutive sentences the state recommended. However, it would not exclude the possibility of maximum concurrent sentences. The maximum sentence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>court could impose for each aggravated robbery offense, a first-degree felony, R.C. 2911.01(C), is ten years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The court was required to impose an additional three-year term for the firearm specification, R.C. 2941.145, even if all were merged. The aggregate sentence the court imposed was 13 years, which was within the range of punishments the state\u2019s alleged promise would permit. No manifest miscarriage of justice necessary for plain error is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">{\u00b6 42} The second assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-6\">Walters, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b693-7\">Wolff, P.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b693-8\">Sumner E. Walters, J., retired, of the Third Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b693-9\">Wolff, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A0q\">concurring separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">{\u00b6 43} I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of the first assignment, its opinion and disposition of the second assignment, and the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">{\u00b6 44} I continue to believe that <em>State v. Pape </em>(Nov. 21, 2001), Clark App. No. 2000CA98, 2001 WL 1473764, was properly decided and that \u201crequiring the trial court to determine that a defendant understands [that] he is ineligible for judicial release is a salutary interpretation of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) which furthers the purpose of Crim.R. (C)(2)(a) that pleas of guilty and no contest be voluntarily and intelligently made, i.e., \u2018with full understanding of the consequences.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">{\u00b6 45} Nevertheless, I concur in the disposition of the first assignment because the trial court substantially complied with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), which was not so in <em>Pape.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">{\u00b6 46} In <em>Pape, </em>we observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cThe trial court made no inquiry of Pape\u2019s understanding that he was not eligible for community control sanctions, which ineligibility was integral to his receiving a mandatory sentence. Nor did the written plea of guilty mention Pape\u2019s ineligibility for community control sanctions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">{\u00b6 48} In this ease, the trial court informed Byrd that he could receive a maximum sentence of ten years for the aggravated robbery counts, with a maximum penalty of 30 years of incarceration, in addition to three years for the firearm specifications. The court further told Byrd that he could receive eight years in prison for each kidnapping count plus three years for the firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>specifications. Byrd was also informed of the maximum fines that could be imposed. The trial court then stated: \u201cAnd obviously you understand that you\u2019re not eligible for community control sanctions on the robberies and the kidnapping; do you understand that?\u201d Byrd responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 49} Byrd\u2019s written plea agreements \u2014 which Byrd signed \u2014 provided that Byrd was not eligible for community control sanctions and that \u201c[t]he prisons term(s) * * * is/are mandatory and cannot be reduced by judicial release, earned credit, or furlough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">{\u00b6 50} It is clear from the record that the trial court asked Byrd whether he understood that he was ineligible for community control on all of the charges, and Byrd responded, \u2018Yes, sir.\u201d Byrd\u2019s written plea agreement also acknowledged that judicial release was unavailable. Although the trial court did not expressly inform Byrd that he was not eligible for judicial release, the trial court substantially complied with the requirements of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). See <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 5 O.O.3d 52, 364 N.E.2d 1163.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
