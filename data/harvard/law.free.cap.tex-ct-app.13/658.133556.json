Tried below before the Hon. J. C. Russell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">The appellant was indicted for the murder of Lewis Meyers, on or about the thirtieth day of June, A. D. 1882. The indictment charges murder by shooting with a pistol with express malice aforethought. He appeals from a conviction of murder in the second degree, wherein the verdict assessed the punishment at fifty years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">Domingo Villareal testified, for the State, that he knew the defendant, and was acquainted with Lewis Meyers in his lifetime. Meyers was killed by the defendant in June, 1882, at El Pico ranch, in Webb county, Texas. The defendant shot the deceased while the deceased was sitting on a box in a house of which the witness did not know the owner. The weapon used was a pistol. The ball struck the deceased somewhere in the breast. The defendant had been drinking with a man named Inez. The witness did not know where Inez was at the time of this trial. The deceased had beer and other things to sell. The defendant had his revolver strapped around him when he entered the house and called for beer. He drank for a good while and then asked the deceased if the beer had been paid for. He then left the room and went out to where Inez was, and presently returned and told the deceased that the beer had been paid for. He then struck the counter twice with the handle of his pistol, the muzzle pointing up. The deceased then told him to put up the pistol, as it might go off. The defendant then struck the counter flat with the side of the pistol. The witness then heard the pistol discharged, after which the defendant turned his pistol and fired a second time in another direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-8\">On his cross-examination the witness stated that the defendant went to Meyers\u2019s place about seven o\u2019clock in the morning. The shooting took place at about ten o\u2019clock in the morning. The defendant had been drinking beer from the time he went to the Meyers place until the shooting took place. The beer was in quart bottles, and the defendant alone drank about eight of them. There was no trouble between the defendant and Meyers, nor did they have any kind of a dispute. The defendant struck the counter several times with the pistol, at one of which times it was discharged. He did not point it at the deceased. The two shots were fired very near together. The defendant was very drunk. When the defendant took out his pistol he said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>nothing. When the deceased told him to put up the pistol, he lowered it to his side, and then, raising it to a level with the deceased and pointing towards the deceased, he said: \u201cI will put it up when I please.\u201d It was then that the pistol was discharged. It was the first of the two shots which struck the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-6\">Lasero Garza testified, for the State, that he knew the defendant by sight, and he was acquainted with the deceased Meyers, who was killed by the defendant at the \u201cRanch of the Flowers.\u201d The witness and Domingo Villareal were invited by the defendant to accompany him to the store of the deceased, which they did. The defendant proposed that the party should drink. The defendant himself drank beer until he was very drunk, and then pulled out his pistol and struck the counter with the handle first and then with the side of the pistol. The pistol was discharged while it was pointing towards Meyers, and the latter fell. Thereupon the witness and Domingo secured the defendant. The defendant said something when the shot fired, but he was so drunk that the witness could not understand him. One shot was fired towards the deceased as the defendant struck the counter with the pistol. The other shot was fired in an opposite direction. It was a forty-four calibre brass cartridge Colt\u2019s pistol, with a wooden handle, that the defendant used. It was nickel-plated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-7\">A. Bruni testified, for the State, that he went to the store and found Meyers lying behind his counter, dead. He found the defendant tied down at a ranch about five miles from the store. There were two marks on the counter, showing that they were made with the handle of a pistol. The witness took the revolver used by the defendant and tried it, and found that the handle exactly fitted into the dents. In thus fitting it, its position forced the muzzle of the pistol upwards. The defendant was very drunk when the witness found him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-8\">The witness also found where the second shot struck. It was on a line with and beyond the body of the deceased from the point where the defendant was said to have been standing. The marks on the counter could only have been made as indicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-9\">The charge of the court on the subject of drunkenness, which is held by this court to be consistent with statutory provisions, is the subject of the ninth subdivision of the general charge, and reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\">\u201cYou are further charged that intoxication produced by the voluntary recent use of ardent spirits constitutes no excuse for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the commission of crime; nor does intoxication mitigate either the degree or the penalty of crime. However, in a case where the defendant is accused of murder, as in the case before you, you may take into consideration the mental condition of the defendant for the purpose of determining the degree of murder, if you should find the defendant guilty of murder under the evidence of this case and the foregoing instructions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-6\">The motion for new trial sets up that the court erred as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-7\">1. In overruling the motion to quash the <em>venire.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-8\"><em>2. </em>In not setting the verdict aside as informal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-9\">3. In not setting it aside for the want of evidence to establish malice aforethought, express or implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-10\">4. In not setting it aside as unsupported by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-11\">5. In the substance of the general charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-12\">6. In refusing charges asked.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-13\"><em>C. A. McLane, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9E\">The verdict reads as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-14\">\u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant, Patricio Charles, guilty of murder in the second degree, and assess his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for the term of fifty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-15\">\u201cGeo. W. Woodman, Foreman.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-16\">To merely show the form of the verdict is to argue its nullity. Article <em>22, </em>Code of Criminal Procedure, declares that \u201cHo person can be convicted of a felony except upon the verdict of a jury duly rendered and recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-17\">Article 713, same Code, provides that \u201cWhere a prosecution is for an offense consisting of different degrees, the jury may find the defendant not guilty of the higher degree (naming it), but guilty of any degree inferior to that charged in the indictment or information.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-18\">Article 714, following, places murder within the category of offenses which include lesser degrees. Articles 715 and 716 point out in mandatory tones the duty of the court and jury in respect to informal verdicts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b671-19\">How, permit me that I ask your honors, has the appellant been, convicted upon a verdict of a jury duly rendered? In <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>The State, </em>decided at the present term, it is held that the verdict of the jury was a nullity, because in finding the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, the letter \u201cr\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in the word \u201cfirst\u201d was omitted, leaving it \u201cfist degree\u201d instead of \u201cfirst degree.\u201d It is a subject of remark that the honorable court, in its elaborate and exhaustive opinion in this case, soars high above the popular clamor for an ensanguined sacrifice in the name of justice. Proud is the glow in the heart of the citizen that his life and his liberty is protected by a tribunal of last resort who dares administer the law as it is !</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-6\">In <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 24 Texas, 410, it is decided that \u201con an indictment for an offense divided into different degrees, a general verdict of guilty, assessing a penalty applicable only to one of the inferior degrees, and which does not find the defendant not guilty of the higher degrees, is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction; and is ground to arrest the judgment. Such an informality in the verdict is the proper subject of correction, with the consent of the jury; and if they refuse to make it they should again retire.\u201d (See also 2 Texas Ct. App., 204; 32 Texas, 476.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-7\">It might be urged with some degree of plausibility that so long as appellant is acquitted of murder in the higher degree, and the vital spark in him is still permitted to burn, that he ought not to be heard to complain of that which is to his benefit. Nor ought he, aside from all question as to the sufficiency of the evidence, if his conviction is had, and he is deprived of his liberty alone, by due course of the law of the land. (Bill of Rights, sec. 19.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b672-8\">Independent of every other consideration, appellant demands, if convicted he is to be, that it shall be according to the law of the land. Let me ask, Does not that law, in express and positive terms, require the verdict to acquit of the higher degree, naming it? \u201cOh!\u201d but it might be said, \u201cthis is merely a question of practice, not touching the merits of the case nor materially affecting the rights of the defendant.\u201d Ah! but that very practice has for its sole object the defining, establishing and maintaining of those very rights. Practice, forsooth ! ' Call it practice, and every invasion of sacred right\u2014every encroachment upon the inestimable privileges of the citizen\u2014becomes legitimized confiscation! Out upon the insidious phrase ! There must be a stopping point somewhere. If practice is not law, then what is it? If it be law, then it must be obeyed .to the letter as well as in the spirit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b672-9\"><em>J. H. Burts, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Willson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdE\">Defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree, and his punishment was assessed at fifty years confinement in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Defendant moved to quash and set aside the special venire and return thereof for the reason that the entire venire of sixty men had not been summoned, and because no sufficient diligence was shown in the sheriff\u2019s return why the jurors mentioned in the motion to quash were not summoned. Article 613 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cThe sheriff or other officer</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">executing the writ shall summon the persons whose names are upon the lists attached to the writ, which summons shall be made verbally upon the jurors in person;\u201d and Article 614 provides for the officer\u2019s return as follows: \u201cThe officer executing the writ shall return the same promptly on or before the time it is made returnable. The return shall state the names of those who have been summoned; and if any of those whose names are upon the list have not been summoned, the return shall state the diligence that has been used to summon them, and the cause of the failure to summon them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In the case before us thirty-six of the sixty persons named in the venire were summoned, leaving twenty-four not summoned. Fourteen of those not summoned are shown to have been absent from the county at the time. One was shown to have been dead. Some of the remaining nine, although residing in the county, could not be found after due diligence used, and some of them resided at such great distances from the county site that they could not be served for want of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">While we regard the articles of the code which we have quoted as wise provisions of law, and safeguards against that great evil popularly known as \u201cstocked juries,\u201d still we do not think a slight disregard of their provisions would be sufficient per <em>se </em>to warrant the setting aside of a verdict of conviction. It is the duty of the trial judge to see that these provisions are substantially observed, and he should, in all cases where they are applicable, be careful to enforce them with such strictness as to certainly accomplish their purpose, which is to secure an impartial jury for the trial of the cause. This court, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, will presume that the trial judge in this important matter has discharged his duty. If, however, a case should come before us wherein it was made to appear that this discretion confided by law to the trial judge had been abused, whereby the defendant had probably been injured in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>rights, we would not hesitate to set aside the conviction and award him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In this case it does not appear that the trial judge committed any error in overruling the motion to quash the venire, nor that any right of the defendant was prejudiced thereby. For aught that appears from the record the jury that tried the case was composed of men selected from the thirty-six summoned jurors. If so, the defendant certainly cannot complain that he was injured by the ruling of the court upon his motion. It is not shown that the defendant, by reason of the ruling of the court, was compelled to pass upon talesmen jurors, or to accept any objectionable juror, or in any other manner suffer injury by reason of the overruling of his motion. Furthermore, we think the return of the sheriff upon the venire shows good reason why fifteen of the jurors were not served, and, if the return as to the remaining nine not served be true, it is also sufficient as to them; and we must presume, in the absence of contradiction, that the officer made a truthful return.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">It would have been more strictly in compliance with the law if the officer, instead of stating in his return that he had used due diligence to serve these jurors, had stated the facts which constituted the diligence, so as to enable the court to determine whether or not due diligence had in fact been used. In the manner in which the question is presented to us, we cannot say that the court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the venire, nor if we were to hold that this action of the court was error, would we be justified in further holding, upon the facts presented in the record, that it was that character of error which would vitiate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">As to the objection made to the sufficiency of the verdict, the same question was elaborately discussed and decisively determined by this court in <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Texas Court of Appeals, 204, in which a precisely similar verdict was held to be sufficient; and we approve and reaffirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">In response to the several assignments of error relating to the charge of the court, and the refusal of the court to give special charges requested by defendant\u2019s counsel, we will say that after careful examination we find no error in the charge of the court as given, nor in the refusal of the court to give the special charges requested. We think the charge of the court presented all the law applicable to the facts of the case, and presented it correctly. That portion of the charge relating to the drunken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ness <em>of </em>the defendant at the time of the homicide was in accordance with the statute on that subject. (Acts Seventeenth Leg., chap. 14, p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">There was sufficient evidence, we think, to support the verdict. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Opinion delivered March 22, 1883.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
