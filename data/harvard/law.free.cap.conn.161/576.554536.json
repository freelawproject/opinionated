The court\u2019s memorandum of decision denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict stated that the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \u201cfailed to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>that the defendant had \u2018procured\u2019 the arrest of the plaintiff. . . . There was no intimation in the evidence that the defendant expressed a desire that the plaintiff should be arrested, requested that the plaintiff be arrested or insisted upon it. A person is deemed to have initiated a proceeding if his direction or request, or pressure of any kind by him, was the determining factor in the officer\u2019s (or prosecutor\u2019s) decision to commence the prosecution. <em>Zenik </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>137 Conn. 592, 596 [79 A.2d 769]. The plaintiff\u2019s proof was lacking in this essential element.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The record discloses that this observation by the trial court was correct.
