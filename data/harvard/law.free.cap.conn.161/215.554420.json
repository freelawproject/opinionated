The plaintiffs, who are operators of licensed ambulance services pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-383, opposed the granting , of the permit on the ground that the ambulance commission, rather than the public utilities commission, had jurisdiction over such an application. After reserving decision on the jurisdictional question, and after the hearing, the public utilities commission, on August 25, 1969, determined that it had jurisdiction, granted the application and issued the livery permit. Pursuant to \u00a7 16-35, the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court. That court affirmed the commission\u2019s jurisdictional decision and rendered a judgment dismissing the appeal. Prom the judgment rendered the plaintiffs have taken this appeal, assigning as error the conclusion that the public utilities commission had authority to grant the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The sole issue which we must resolve is whether the, medicar is an ambulance within the contemplation of \u00a7 20-378. If it is, then only the ambulance commission could have issued the permit If, however, the medicar is not an ambulance, then the public utilities commission has acted within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-378 defines an ambulance as \u201ca motor vehicle specifically designed to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>patients.\u201d A patient is defined as \u201can injured or ill person requiring assistance and transportation.\u201d Beyond those specific definitions we must employ the commonly approved usage of the words, General Statutes \u00a7 1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">While the statute and dictionary definitions do not specifically limit the meaning of \u201cambulance\u201d to emergency vehicles, a reading of chapter 397, Ambulance Services, leaves little doubt as to its purpose. It is apparent that the ambulance commission was formed to protect the public by assuring that all ambulances in the state are properly equipped, and that all ambulance personnel are thoroughly and adequately trained in order to be able to provide emergency medical services. The purpose of the chapter, read in its entirety, is to assure emergency medical aid and safe, speedy transportation. We must be certain that we read the definitions in \u00a7 20-378 so as to coincide with the general purpose as expressed throughout the chapter. See <em>Biz </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>133 Conn. 556, 559, 53 A.2d 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The mediears which the application concerns clearly are not offering emergency medical service, and the application specifically so states. In fact, the application does not even concern emergency transportation. Rather, it concerns transportation of specified types of individuals who cannot, or cannot comfortably, avail themselves of the usual modes of public transportation: buses or taxicabs. The application clearly refers to people who require no medical assistance in transit, and who desire transportation at a normal speed in order to be taken from one place to another. It seems obvious that this is not ambulance service. It is a livery service for physically handicapped individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>In the application, Kennedy Medi-Car, Inc., used the term \u201cwheelchair patients.\u201d It is through the word \u201cpatients\u201d that it is claimed that chapter 397 applies. It is clear that the term \u201cpatient,\u201d as used in the application, is not the same as the definition of that term in \u00a7 20-378. Clearly, the term \u201cwheelchair patient,\u201d in the context of the application, refers to persons who are moved in wheelchairs and who are not in need of immediate medical assistance. It is clear that the service proposed by the applicant was a specialized livery service rather than an ambulance service. Thus, an application to the public utilities commission for a livery permit was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">If one wishes to provide medical assistance <em>and </em>transportation to persons in need thereof, a permit must be obtained from the ambulance commission. \u00a7\u00a7 20-383, 20-385. If, however, one wishes to provide transportation of passengers for hire either to the public in general, or to a special class of people, a permit must be obtained from the public utilities commission. General Statutes \u00a7 16-326. Here, Kennedy Medi-Car, Inc., sought only to provide transportation. It applied to the proper commission, and that commission properly accepted jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Chapter 397 was enacted in order to assure that ambulance service in Connecticut would be safe and adequate. The ambulance statutes are not intended to provide exclusive control over <em>all </em>services rendered to ill or injured persons. Eather, as the chapter\u2019s title indicates, it is to control \u201cAmbulance Services.\u201d Our conclusion, therefore, that the service here involved is controlled by chapter 288 is not incompatible with the enactment of chapter 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
