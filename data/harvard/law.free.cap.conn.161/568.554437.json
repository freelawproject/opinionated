Such use was to continue until there was erected on the defendants\u2019 premises \u201ca building or buildings of a permanent nature, ... so placed as to prevent the use of said driveway in which event the said reserved right shall terminate.\u201d The amended complaint further alleged that the defendants \u201chas [sic] commenced construction of a small addition to the existing building and has [sic] blocked the plaintiffs from using said right of way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The defendants demurred to the amended complaint on the ground that \u201cbecause by the terms of the reserved right and the facts alleged the reservation has terminated and is of no further effect.\u201d The court sustained the demurrer for the reason that the \u201cerection of a bathroom as an addition to the existing building is permanent in nature and in and of itself, by reasonable interpretation, constitutes a \u2018building.\u2019 \u201d The plaintiffs failed to plead over and judgment was rendered on demurrer sustained. The plaintiffs have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of a pleading. <em>Mainolfi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>146 Conn. 634, 636, 153 A.2d 460; see Practice Book \u00a7 106. In testing the legal sufficiency of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>complaint on demurrer, the court is limited to and controlled entirely by the information which the complaint itself affords. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Knights of Columbus, </em>82 Conn. 91, 92, 72 A. 574. The hearing on a demurrer is restricted to arguments on the points of law raised by the demurrer. See 2 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.), p. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Whether the construction of \u201ca small addition to the existing building\u201d has blocked the plaintiffs\u2019 use of their right of way was a question of fact to be determined by the trier. Whether that addition constitutes a \u201cbuilding or buildings\u201d and is \u201cof a permanent nature\u201d depends on the facts to be adduced. See <em>Katsoff </em>v. <em>Lucertini, </em>141 Conn. 74, 77, 103 A.2d 812. There is nothing in the record to indicate what \u201csmall addition\u201d was being constructed by the defendants, much less that the addition was to be a bathroom. Clearly, the court went beyond the limits of the information contained in the complaint. The demurrer was not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to overrule the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
