The appeal concerns the assessment, by the defendant, of additional taxes plus interest as against the plaintiff, and also the defendant\u2019s refusal to allow certain refunds or offset credits. For the reservation to this court the parties have provided a stipulation of facts, and have proffered seven questions to which they request answers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The plaintiff is, and long has been, a public utility. As such, it is subject to a tax on its gross earnings as prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 12-264 and 12-265 of chapter 212 of the General Statutes. The plaintiff is subject to accounting regulation by the public utilities commission. Accounting regulations are prescribed in the uniform system of accounts, referred to herein as the uniform system. In 1962, uniform systems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>were in effect for both electric and gas utilities, and each was dated January 1, 1941. In 1963 and 1964 the uniform systems in effect for both electric and gas utilities were those of January 1, 1963. There are separate uniform systems for electric utilities and gas utilities. The portions of both uniform systems which are pertinent to our consideration are basically identical. Citations to the uniform systems will be by section number and will refer to the electric regulations, since the specific issues here involved relate to electric company accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In the years 1962,1963 and 1964, the plaintiff duly reported its gross earnings taxes and paid them in full. On March 28, 1966, after an audit by the defendant, the plaintiff was notified of the assessment of additional gross earnings taxes for the years 1962, 1963 and 1964. The plaintiff filed a timely request for a hearing on the assessment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-268\u00cd, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>granted. On April 3, 1967, after a hearing on May 12, 1966, the plaintiff received a second notice of assessment for the years 1962, 1963 and 1964 in lesser amounts than the original assessment, and which superseded the original assessment. Pursuant to \u00a7 12-2681 the plaintiff next filed an appeal with the Superior Court in Hartford County, appealing from the April 3 assessment. The defendant filed an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The case thereafter came to this court on a reservation, with the questions as already noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The basic issue with which we are faced concerns General Statutes \u00a7 12-264, and the term therein \u201cgross earnings.\u201d We must determine whether contributions in aid of construction, transmission receipts and transmission credits are included within that term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, in order to answer the questions proffered, we must determine the meaning of \u201cgross earnings\u201d as employed in \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Section 12-264, whose predecessor was amended in 1945 (Cum. Sup. 1945, \u00a7298h), states: \u201cGross earnings . . . shall include all income classified as operating revenues by the public utilities commission in the uniform systems of accounts prescribed by said commission . . . , all income classified in said uniform systems of accounts as income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work, income from nonutility operations and revenues from lease of physical property not devoted to utility operation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and receipts from the sale of residuals and other byproducts obtained in connection with the production of gas, electricity or steam.\u201d The initial question with which we are faced is the interpretation of the term \u201cshall include.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the term is one of limitation, that the items which follow it are the only items which may be included in taxable gross earnings. The defendant argues, to the contrary, that \u201cgross earnings\u201d merely <em>includes </em>the items stated and that other items may be prescribed by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The last time this court considered \u00a7 12-264 was in <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>152 Conn. 671, 211 A.2d 697, which dealt with revenues from nonutility sources. In the Superior Court memorandum, the court considered the meaning of the term \u201cshall include.\u201d It first noted the dictionary definition of \u201cinclude,\u201d found it to be a term of enlargement, and not to be ambiguous. A-444 Rec. &amp; Briefs, pp. 64, back of 65. We have also turned to the dictionary. We have found, however, that \u201cinclude\u201d is primarily defined as a term of limitation. See Webster, Third New International Dictionary; Random House Dictionary. The legal dictionaries also consider the term to be one of limitation, while indicating that \u201cincluding\u201d can be a term of enlargement. See Black, Law Dictionary (4th Ed.); Bouvier, Law Dictionary (1934 Rev.); Ballentine, Law Dictionary (3d Ed.). The definition employed in the Superior Court memorandum appears to be the secondary definition in Webster\u2019s dictionary. It thus appears that, although the most likely common use of the term \u201cshall include\u201d would be one of limitation, we cannot say, with certainty, that it must be so employed. We thus find the term \u201cshall include\u201d as used in \u00a7 12-264, to be ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Where the meaning of a statute is ambiguous, the history and policy underlying it may be considered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreno, </em>156 Conn. 233, 239, 240 A.2d 871; <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>I. S. Spencer\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 162, 164-65, 223 A.2d 808; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154. In 1944 we held, in <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>131 Conn. 1, 6, 37 A.2d 361, that the statute, as it then read, included <em>all </em>earnings of a utility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is significant that the statute was amended in the next legislative session. Clearly, without an amendment, the statute included <em>all </em>income. The only reason for the legislature to act on that statute would be to clarify it, and since this court had already clarified the fact that the old statute contemplated <em>all </em>income, it is only logical to infer that the legislature intended to restrict that definition. Were that not the intent, the legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>would have accomplished no purpose, and we may not presume that the legislature has enacted futile or meaningless legislation. <em>In re Application of Plantamura, </em>149 Conn. 111, 114, 176 A.2d 61, cert. denied, 369 US. 872, 82 S. Ct. 1141, 8 L. Ed. 2d 275; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, 421, 162 A.2d 175. We note further that the stated purpose of 1945 Public Act 279, was to \u201cclarify the meaning of the words \u2018gross earnings from operations.\u2019 \u201d If the only effect of that act had been to specify what might be <em>part </em>of \u201cgross earnings from operations,\u201d then the amendment would not have clarified the statute as interpreted by <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>supra, but rather, it would have confused the items to be included within the term \u201cgross earnings from operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The bill originally introduced to amend what is now \u00a7 12-264 was phrased: \u201cCross earnings from operations are defined as . . . .\u201d H.B. 683,1945 Sess. The definition included all receipts classified in the uniform system as operating revenues, and all receipts from the sale or rental of specific types of appliances. Sometime thereafter, however, a substitute bill replaced House Bill 683, and that bill was eventually passed. Sup. 1945, \u00a7 298h. The substitute bill changed \u201care defined\u201d to \u201cshall include\u201d and added all income classified as income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work, income from nonutility operations and revenues from lease of other physical property not devoted to utility operation, and receipts from the sale of residuals and other by-products obtained in connection with the production of gas or electricity. It is argued that the change from \u201cdefine\u201d to \u201cinclude\u201d demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to define and thus limit, but rather, intended to exemplify. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Had the only change been that term, the argument might be convincing. As demonstrated, however, the change was far more comprehensive. Several items were included in the revised bill which had not been included in the original bill, thus extending the income stated to be taxable thereunder. Recalling that the term \u201cinclude\u201d is more generally used as a term of limitation, we have concluded that the use of \u201cinclude\u201d instead of \u201cdefine\u201d was precipitated by the addition of the several items noted, which created a comprehensive list rather than a compact definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">One last portion of legislative history convinces us that the result which we have reached is correct. In 1961, \u00a7 12-264 was repealed, and then reenacted as \u00a7 14 of 1961 Public Act 604. In the new statute, municipal utilities were added, but the portion of the statute which included operating revenues as gross earnings was left basically unchanged. Immediately thereafter, however, and preceding the rest of the categories of included revenue, the phrase \u201cand, with respect to each such company\u201d was added, replacing \u201cfor such companies.\u201d Were we to adopt the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, then the 1961 phrasing would be for naught, since the items stated in the statute would not be inclusive. Thus, municipal utilities could be taxed on the same income as could other utility companies. The only other approach to sustain the defendant\u2019s interpretation, in keeping with what seems to be an obvious intent to restrict the tax liability of municipal utilities, would be to find that the single use of \u201cshall include\u201d in the statute was intended to be a term of limitation as regards municipal utilities and a term of enlargement as regards all other utility companies. The patent absurdity of such a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>confirms our conclusion that \u201cshall include,\u201d as employed in \u00a7 12-264, is a term of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The next issue concerns the phrase, also in \u00a7 12-264, \u201cclassified as operating revenues by the public utilities commission in the uniform systems of accounts.\u201d It is contended that this phrase adopts the uniform system of accounts, and that any items which appear in any revision of that system as \u201coperating revenues\u201d are taxable. In interpreting statutes which adopt other statutes, the rule of construction which is applied assumes that the statute which is adopted is taken as it existed at the time of adoption, unless there is language expressing or implying an intent to the contrary. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 498, 280 A.2d 351; <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 248, 278 A.2d 766; <em>Legat </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>138 Conn. 134, 150-52, 83 A.2d 185. It is only in instances in which the adopting statute purports to include, by reference, the law generally applicable to a given subject that subsequent modifications of the adopted statute are considered to have been intended to be included in the adopting statute. See note, 168 A.L.R. 627, 628 \u00a711. Moreover, where, as here, a taxing statute is involved, ambiguities are resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Consolidated Diesel Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>156 Conn. 33, 36, 238 A.2d 410; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>154 Conn. 498, 503, 227 A.2d 76. Administrative rules and regulations are given the force and effect of law. <em>Citerella </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>158 Conn. 600, 608, 266 A.2d 382; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bruneau\u2019s Truck Service, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 46, 54, 175 A.2d 372. Certainly, when a statute adopts administrative regulations which are legislative in nature, the adoption rule would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The statute refers to the uniform system of accounts, and specifies the operating revenues there \u201cclassified.\u201d The term used is \u201cclassified,\u201d and not \u201cas shall be classified\u201d or the like. The reference to \u201cthe uniform systems of accounts\u201d is a reference to a specific regulation or document. The adoption, therefore, considered a classification, or list, which was already in existence. The reference to the uniform system is merely a shorthand method of listing items which are already listed in another source. The uniform systems which were in existence at the time of the 1945 amendment to the predecessor of \u00a7 12-264, and relevant to gas and electric companies, were those of January 1, 1941. The items listed therein, therefore, were those adopted by the legislature in \u00a7 12-264. Absent a clear grant of power to do so, we will not imply an intent on the part of the legislature to allow the commission to amend a statutory provision, here \u201coperating revenues\u201d as related to tax liability, at will. <em>South East Property Owners &amp; Residents Assn. </em>v. <em>City Plan Commission, </em>156 Conn. 587, 592, 244 A.2d 394; <em>State ex rel. Huntington </em>v. <em>McNulty, 151 </em>Conn. 447, 449, <em>199 </em>A.2d 5; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 523, 134 A.2d 351. \u201cOperating revenues,\u201d as used in \u00a7 12-264, are thus limited to those items classified as such in the 1941 uniform system of accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Contributions in aid of construction include revenue received by the plaintiff as a reimbursement for the cost of installing equipment to which it retains title. A common example is the installation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of power lines to a remote area in order to service a single customer or several customers. In such a situation the customer or customers would reimburse the plaintiff for the cost of installation. The 1941 uniform system lists fifteen items as \u201coperating revenues.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 600-615 as adopted by \u00a7 501. None of these includes contributions in aid of construction, although the regulations recognize such income in \u00a7 265. Thus, it seems evident that such contributions are not included in \u201coperating revenue,\u201d and are not taxable as such. Likewise, these contributions are not included under income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work (\u00a7 520); income from nonutility operations (\u00a7 521); and revenues from the lease of physical property not devoted to utility operations (\u00a7 522). \u201cReceipts from the sale of residuals and other by-products\u201d does not appear in the 1941 uniform system, but contributions in aid of construction, as stipulated, obviously do not fall thereunder. It is, therefore, clear that contributions in aid of construction are not taxable earnings under \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Transmission receipts are included in \u00a7 739 of the uniform system. They include revenue received from sales of electric energy to other utilities. The reasonable interpretation of this section is that credits for energy transmission to other utilities are to be recorded, but not taxable. When such credits are liquidated, they become payments or receipts and enter a different category. \u00a7739 (B). Thus, liquidated credits become revenue and can be taxed as \u201coperating revenue,\u201d probably under \u00a7 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Transmission credits, as herein contemplated, are amounts owed to the plaintiff by another utility for the use of its transmission lines. Such credits are balanced with amounts owed by the plaintiff to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the other utility for the use of their transmission lines. The specific transaction here involved was a credit of approximately $225,000 in favor of the plaintiff in its dealings with the Connecticut Light and Power Company (C. L. &amp; P.). By prior written agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s annual debt to C. L. &amp; P., which was a result of its use of C. L. &amp; P.\u2019s transmission lines, was reduced by that amount, The credit was a result of C. L. &amp; P.\u2019s use of the plaintiff\u2019s transmission lines. In effect, the amount of the credit is a rental fee for the use of those lines. To say that the $225,000 was never received by the plaintiff, or that it never had a right to receive the money, would be to close our eyes to the actual fact. Clearly, the credit arrangement was to avoid having C. L, &amp; P. pay the plaintiff for the use of its lines and then have the plaintiff turn around and pay C. L. &amp; P. It is, in effect, a bookkeeping method to avoid crosspayments. That transmission credits are indeed revenues received is demonstrated by a hypothetical situation wherein the plaintiff has $200,000 worth of credits against C. L. &amp; P. and where C. L. &amp; P. has no credits against the plaintiff. At the end of the year the plaintiff would receive $200,000. Thus, the receipt of revenues is there; it is merely paid in the form of transmission line use, rather than in cash. Transmission credits, therefore, can be taxed as \u201coperating revenues,\u201d probably under \u00a7 610, as rents received for the use by others of property devoted to electrical operation by the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">In the present situation, transmission receipts and credits for the sale of energy to other utilities and for the use of transmission lines were not considered taxable operating revenue by the commission during the years 1962-64. It was not until 1966 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that they were so classified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to assess the plaintiff on the increased basis which included transmission receipts and transmission credits, the defendant has invoked chapter 212a of the General Statutes, specifically \u00a7 12-268a. Thereunder, in respect to all utilities, \u201cthe commissioner at any time within three years after the filing by it [the utility] of a return based on the method of apportionment provided for in this chapter, may change such method.\u201d The question with which we are faced is whether a new interpretation of the revenue included in \u201coperating revenue\u201d is a change in \u201cmethod of apportionment.\u201d Section 12-268a states that the method of apportionment applicable to this case is provided in \u00a712-265. Section 12-265 deals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>with the rate of tax on utilities and provides both the rate and the manner in which to apply that rate. Thus, it is apparent that a change in the taxable base, where proper under \u00a7 12-264, would not be a change in the method of apportionment. Absent specific authority to interpret retroactively, and because of the uncertainty, difficulties and hardship which could thus arise, we have never hesitated, on the ground of public policy, to curb the right of an administrative body to change its decision with retroactive effect. <em>Waterbury Savings Bank </em>v. Danaher, 128 Conn. 78, 92, 20 A.2d 455. There is no indication that the plaintiff is obtaining any inequitable advantage from applying the new rule on a purely prospective basis. Indeed, the tax commissioner has suggested no justification at all for applying the rule retroactively. Thus, a change in the tax base would be proper if the authority for that change could be found in \u00a7 12-264 and the pre-1945 uniform systems, but such a change, absent specific authority to the contrary, must be applied prospectively from the date of the new interpretation. Therefore, while from 1966 on, transmission credits and receipts became taxable income, they were not taxable in 1962, 1963 and 1964, and, therefore, the plaintiff could not be taxed on them.

For the sake of clarity, we will specifically answer each.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">(1) Chapter 212 of the General Statutes does not impose a tax on all receipts of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>(2) The plaintiff\u2019s gross earnings from operations are taxable under chapter 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">(3) \u201cGross earnings from operations\u201d are all of the items contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 600-615 of the 1941 uniform system of accounts prescribed for electrical utilities (operating revenues) as well as any other receipts which fall reasonably under any of the categories there listed; income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work as classified in the 1941 uniform system of accounts, and the other items which appear in \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">(4) and (5) We do not have sufficient information to determine whether \u201cany other receipts of the plaintiff\u201d are taxable. As stated in the answer to question 3, any receipts which reasonably fall under the categories listed in \u00a7\u00a7 600-615 of the 1941 uniform system of accounts are taxable prospectively, from the time of their inclusion by the commissioner, as is income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work as classified in the 1941 uniform systems and also income from the other items listed in \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">(6) Amendments to the uniform system of accounts after 1945, have no effect on the tax base as stated in \u00a7 12-264, except to the extent that \u201cincome from non-utility operations and revenues from lease of physical property not devoted to utility operation, and receipts from the sale of residuals and other by-products obtained in connection with the production of gas, electricity or steam\u201d are interpreted, prospectively, by such amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">(7) (a) Transmission receipts were not taxable in 1964, and thus the plaintiff is entitled to a refund for the taxes paid thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">(7) (b) Since reimbursement for damages to electric and gas properties has been conceded to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>not taxable, the plaintiff is entitled to a reimbursement of the taxes paid on such amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">No costs will be taxed in this court in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In this opinion Ryax and Shapiro, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> \u201c(1) Does Chapter 212 of the General Statutes of Connecticut, Revision of 1958, as amended, impose a tax on all receipts of the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201c(2) If the answer to question (1) is \u2018No\u2019, what receipts of the plaintiff are subject to the tax imposed by Chapter 212?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u201c(3) If the answer to question (2) is that the plaintiff is subject to tax on \u2018gross earnings from operations\u2019, what receipts are to be classified as \u2018gross earnings from operations\u2019?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u201c(4) If the answer to question (3) is that \u2018gross earnings from operations\u2019 means (a) all income classified as operating revenues by the public utilities commission in the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the commission for electric and gas utilities, (b) all income classified in said uniform system of accounts as income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work, (e) all income classified in said uniform system of accounts as income from non-utility operations and revenues from lease of other physical property not devoted to utility operation and, although not included in an income or operating revenue account in such system of accounts, (d) all receipts from the sale of residuals and other by-products obtained in connection with the production of gas or electricity, are any other receipts of the plaintiff subject to the tax imposed by Chapter 212?</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201c(5) If the answer to question (4) is \u2018Yes\u2019, what receipts of the plaintiff are \u2018gross earnings from operations\u2019 which are subject to tax under Chapter 212, which are not included in the income and operating revenue accounts of the Commission\u2019s uniform system of accounts referred to in paragraph (4), other than receipts from the sale of residuals: and other by-products obtained in connection with the production of gas or electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u201c(6) If the answer to question (4) is \u2018No\u2019, do amendments which have been made by the Commission to the uniform system of accounts since October 1, 1945, the effective date of the substantially similar predecessor of Section 12-264 of the General Statutes of Connecticut, Revision of 1958, as amended, have the effect of changing the base upon which the Chapter 212 tax is imposed, or, does the Commission\u2019s uniform system of accounts in effeet on October 1, 1945, constitute the basis for the imposition of the Chapter 212 tax even though such system of accounts may have been amended from time to time by the Commission since October 1, 1945?</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u201c(7) Is the plaintiff entitled to a refund of taxes paid on account of the inclusion in \u2018gross earnings from operations\u2019 of its (a) transmission receipts in 1964 and (b) the reimbursements for damage to electric and gas properties in 1962, 1963 and 1964?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> A fourth category, reimbursement for damage to eleetrie and gas properties, was originally included.

Each company, the principal business of which is manufacturing, selling and distributing gas or electricity to be used for light, heat or motive power or operating a system of water works for selling and distributing water for domestic or power purposes, shall pay an annual tax upon gross earnings from operations in this state. No deduction shall be allowed from such gross earnings for any commission, rebate or other payment, except a refund resulting from an error or overcharge, and those specifically mentioned in section 1323. Each such company shall, on or before the thirty-first day of March in each year, return to the tax commissioner a statement under the oath of its treasurer, or the person performing the duties of treasurer, or of an authorized agent or officer, specifying the name and location of such company, the amount of gross earnings from operations for the year ended the thirty-first day of December next preceding, or the portion of such year that such company has carried on business in the state, the gross earnings from the sale or rental of appliances, using water, gas or electricity and the gross earnings from the sale of any water, gas or electricity to other public service corporations in the state, the number of miles of water pipes, gas mains or electric wires operated by such company within this state on said thirty-first day of December and the number of miles of water pipes, gas mains or electric wires wherever operated by such company on said date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> The parties stipulated that transmission receipts were classified as taxable income in the 1963 uniform system of accounts. We find the only mention of them in \u00a7 447 of the 1963 uniform system, which is entitled \u201cSales for Resale.\u201d This section is substantially the same as \u00a7 605 of the 1941 uniform system of accounts which is entitled \u201cSales to Other Electrie Utilities.\u201d The direction for accounting in \u00a7447 (1963) and \u00a7 605 (1941) is identical. The repetition, therefore, of this section in 1963 in no manner apprised the plaintiff of a change in interpretation by the defendant. The first notice of the new interpretation appearing in the record occurred when the defendant assessed the additional taxes on March 28, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Transmission credits are mentioned in \u00a7 456 of the 1963 uniform system of accounts, entitled \u201cOther Electric Revenue.\u201d The parties appeared to stipulate that this section refers to transmission receipts. That section, in pertinent part reads: \u201c(5) Revenues from transmission of electricity of others over transmission facilities of the utility.\u201d That item clearly refers to what the parties have termed \u201ctransmission credits\u201d in their stipulation. Section 456 (5) (1963) is a new section, one not found in the 1941 uniform system. As such it was of no value relative to \u201coperating revenue\u201d in the tax base as specified in General Statutes \u00a7 12-264; it did not interpret any section of the 1941 uniform system. It, therefore, did not serve to notify the plaintiff of a change in interpretation of the 1941 uniform system such that transmission credits were to become taxable. Again, sueh notification, according to the record, did not occur until the additional assessment of March 28, 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b177-7\">House, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">(dissenting in part). I disagree in part with the holding of the majority opinion and deem it of some significance that Public Act 604 of the 1961 session made a material change in the base of the tax on public utilities. When <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>131 Conn. 1, 37 A.2d 361, was decided in 1944, the governing statute, \u00a7 1322 of the Revision of 1930, provided that \u201c[e]ach company, the principal business of which is manufacturing, selling and distributing . . . electricity to be used for light, heat or motive power . . . shall pay an annual tax upon gross earnings from operations in this state.\u201d This court logically held that the legislature used the words \u201cgross earnings\u201d in the sense of the entire receipts from the company\u2019s operations. In the Revision of 1958, what had been \u00a7 1322 of the 1930 Revision became \u00a7 12-264 and, in the same words, imposed a tax on \u201cgross earnings from operations in this state.\u201d Section 14 of Public Act No. 604 of the 1961 .session of the General Assembly repealed \u00a7 12-264 and substituted what is now \u00a7 12-264. As thus amended and now in effect the base of the tax applicable to each company, \u201cthe principal business of which is manufacturing, selling or distributing . . . electricity,\u201d is no longer gross earnings from all operations in this state but instead is \u201cupon gross earnings from such operations in this state.\u201d By the insertion of the word \u201csuch\u201d before the word \u201coperations,\u201d it seems clear that the tax base was by this portion of the statute limited in the first in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>stance to those encompassed by the preceding words \u201cmanufacturing, selling or distributing . . . electricity\u201d but was then broadened by the inclusion of specifically stated sources of income, whether or not these enumerated sources in fact arose out of \u201cmanufacturing, selling or distributing\u201d the electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The public utility product involved in the present ease being electricity, and the plaintiff being a company \u201cthe principal business of which is manufacturing, selling or distributing .. . electricity,\u201d the basic question for determination is whether contributions in aid of construction, transmission receipts and transmission credits are included within the statutory term \u201cgross earnings from such operations,\u201d either because they directly fall within the broad category of \u201cmanufacturing, selling or distributing . . . electricity\u201d or because they fall within one of the categories which the statute specifically prescribes shall be included within the term \u201cgross income from such operations.\u201d This latter category is \u201cincome classified as operating revenues by the public utilities commission in the uniform systems of accounts prescribed by said commission . . . and all income classified in said uniform systems of accounts as income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work, income from nonutility operations and revenues from lease of physical property not devoted to utility operation, and receipts from the sale of residuals and other by-products obtained in connection with the production of . . . electricity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">I agree with the conclusion of the majority opinion that contributions in aid of construction are not taxable earnings under \u00a7 12-264. I incline to the belief that the transmission receipts and transmission credits are subject to tax as gross earnings from the portion of the plaintiff\u2019s principal business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u201cselling or distributing . . . electricity.\u201d It is, however, unnecessary to decide that question since the majority opinion, properly, I believe, concludes that transmission receipts and transmission credits are operating income within the definitions of the 1941 uniform system of accounts \u00a7\u00a7 605, 610. My disagreement with this portion of the majority opinion lies in the conclusion that \u201cwhile from 1966 on, transmission credits and receipts became taxable income, they were not taxable in 1962, 1963 and 1964, and, therefore, the plaintiff could not be taxed on them. It is entitled to a refund for the amount paid in 1964, and it may not be assessed for the amounts received or credited in 1962 and 1963.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_u\">Since the majority opinion concludes that \u201c \u2018[operating revenues,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 12-264, are thus limited to those items classified as such in the 1941 uniform system of accounts,\u201d and that transmission receipts and transmission credits are operating income within the definitions of the governing 1941 uniform system of accounts, \u00a7\u00a7 605, 610, it seems to me to follow that the transmission receipts and credits for 1962, 1963 and 1964, were all subject to the tax. I do not agree with the statement in the opinion that transmission receipts and credits were not classified as operating revenues until 1966. In fact, as the majority opinion concludes, they were so classified in 1941. What happened in 1966 was that the tax commissioner filed the deficiency assessment for the 1962, 1963 and 1964 tax years. The fact that the tax commissioner had not been enforcing this tax liability before 1966 does not, in my opinion, now bar its enforcement except to the extent that enforcement is barred by the statute of limitations. \u201cAn administrative agency, charged with the protection of the public interest, is certainly not precluded from taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>appropriate action to that end because of mistaken action on its part in the past. ... Nor can the principles of equitable estoppel be applied to deprive the public of the protection of a statute because of mistaken action or lack of action on the part of public officials.\u201d <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Baltimore Transit Co., </em>140 F.2d 51, 55 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 321 U.S. 795, 64 S. Ct. 848, 88 L. Ed. 1084. As the court in <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>v. <em>Newport Industries, Inc., </em>121 F.2d 655, 657 (7th Cir.), expressed it: \u201cOur thought in the matter is that the Commissioner has the power in a tax case to undo what he has done in order to eliminate error .... It is the general rule that within the period of limitations the Commissioner may reopen his own administrative rulings and findings.\u201d See also <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>283 U.S. 230, 51 S. Ct. 416, 75 L. Ed. 996; <em>Stanford University Book Store </em>v. <em>Helvering, </em>83 F.2d 710 (D.C. Cir.); \u201cRes Judicata in Administrative Law,\u201d 49 Yale L.J. 1250, 1265; note, 73 A.L.R.2d 939, 943-948 and Later Case Service, p. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I find in the stipulation by the parties no support for a theory that the tax commissioner was \u201creinterpreting\u201d the provisions of the 1941 uniform system of accounts. The relevant meanings of \u201cinterpret\u201d are \u201c1: to explain or tell the meaning of; translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms ... 2: . . . construe.\u201d Webster, Third New International Dictionary. There is no indication that he, or the attorney general, or any other official, ever \u201cinterpreted\u201d the regulations at all. The true situation is that prior to 1966 the existing statutory tax liability was not enforced by the tax commissioner. Subject to the operation of the statute of limitations, this laxity in enforcement of the tax law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>does not operate to bar the collection of the taxes due but remaining unpaid. See <em>National Labor Relations Board </em>v. <em>Kobritz, </em>193 F.2d 8, 13 (1st Cir.); 66 Harv. L. Rev. 348, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">In summary, it is my opinion that the plaintiff is subject to tax on its transmission receipts for the year 1964, and for transmission credits for the years 1962, 1963 and 1964. Accordingly, I agree with the majority opinion in the answers to reserved questions 1 and 7 (b), but would answer the remaining questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">(2) Gross earnings from its principal business of manufacturing, selling or distributing electricity, including in such gross earnings the specified items required by \u00a7 12-264 to be included.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">(3) The tax is levied not on \u201cgross earnings from operations\u201d but on gross earnings from the plaintiff\u2019s manufacture, sale and distribution of electricity and \u201cgross earnings from such operations\u201d include all of the items specified in \u00a7\u00a7 600-615 of the 1941 uniform system of accounts (operating revenues) as well as any other receipts which fall reasonably under any of the categories there listed; income from merchandising, jobbing and contract work as classified in the 1941 uniform system of accounts and the other items which appear in \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">(4) and (5) We do not have sufficient information to determine whether any other receipts of the plaintiff are taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">(6) Amendments to the uniform system of accounts after 1945 have no effect on the tax base as prescribed in \u00a7 12-264.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">(7) (a) The plaintiff is not entitled to a refund of taxes paid on account of the inclusion in gross earnings of its transmission receipts in 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">In this opinion Alcorn, C.
