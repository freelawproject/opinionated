Forrest, <em>Judge, </em>convicting him of conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1201; conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; possession of a firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(g), and sentencing him principally to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Delva contends principally that the district court erred in denying his motions for suppression of his cellphone and of letters addressed to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>uncle, Gregory Accilien, seized by law enforcement agents without a search warrant, from the bedroom, he shared with Accilien. The district court ruled that the seizure of those items did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they were in plain view and were seized during a protective sweep of the apartment following Accilien\u2019s arrest in the apartment pursuant to an arrest warrant in connection with the kidnapping and robbery. Although we agree with Delva that the record shows that the cellphone and letters were in fact seized after the protective sweep had been completed and the agents had left and reentered the bedroom, we conclude that the agents\u2019 warrantless reentry into that room did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it was justified by the exigencies of the circumstances, given that the agents had found four adult males in the small apartment and had seen narcotics and a gun during the protective sweep, and that that bedroom was the only unoccupied room, other than the bathroom, in which to question Accilien and the others individually in order to determine whom to arrest for possession of the narcotics and gun. As the district court\u2019s' findings that the cellphone and letters were in plain view in that room and were recognizable as evidence are not clearly erroneous, we reject Delva\u2019s challenge to the denial of his suppression motions. Rejecting as well his additional evidentiary, procedural, and sentencing challenges, <em>see </em>Part II.B. below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">The present prosecution of Delva had its origin in the kidnapping and robbery of a woman and a man in the Bronx, New York, which began on Labor Day weekend in 2012. Those crimes were investigated by a joint task force of Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) agents and New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) detectives and officers (collectively or in combination, the \u201cOfficers\u201d). The evidence against Delva at trial (his codefendants had pleaded guilty) included drugs, a gun, and a cellphone, all belonging to him, and letters sent to Accilien by Accilien\u2019s brother (the \u201cAccilien Letters\u201d). Prior to trial, Delva initially moved to suppress only the drugs and gun, and a hearing was held; Delva thereafter sought to suppress the cellphone and, eventually, the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The following description of the relevant events is taken from findings by the district court after the suppression-motion hearing, from credited evidence at that hearing which included testimony by the two law enforcement agents leading the investigation, and from evidence at Delva\u2019s ensuing trial which included testimony by those agents, Accilien, and the two victims of the kidnapping/robbery, as well as DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">A. <em>The Kidnapping and Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Late on Sunday evening September 2, 2012, the female victim (or \u201cFV\u201d), who was the girlfriend of a drug dealer\u2014the male victim (or \u201cMV\u201d)\u2014was accosted by code-fendants Trevor Cole and Dominique Jean Philippe, brandishing guns, outside of her apartment in a building on Magenta Street. She was forced to enter the apartment with Cole and Jean Philippe, who proceeded to search unsuccessfully for drugs and money. FV was blindfolded and assaulted as Cole, Jean Philippe, and others who joined them attempted to force her to telephone MV to get him to come to her apartment. FV stalled for about a day by calling a number she knew had been disconnected; but she eventually yielded and reached MV after being raped by three of the intruders, and urinated on by one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Accilien, the brother of Jean Philippe (who was the author of the Accilien Letters), became involved in the early stages of the robbery when he telephoned Jean Philippe in an attempt to borrow money. At Jean Philippe\u2019s request, Accilien purchased duet tape and latex gloves and brought them to FV\u2019s apartment, where Jean Philippe and Cole informed him that they were in the middle of a robbery. When Accilien expressed unease and decided to leave, Jean Philippe told Accilien to bring their nephew Delva to FV\u2019s apartment to assist because Delva had had more experience than Accilien in committing robberies. Accilien returned with Del-va. All of the robbers donned the latex gloves brought by Accilien and waited for MV to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Accilien and Delva left FV\u2019s apartment on September 3; Delva returned early on September 4. MV arrived thereafter and was held captive by Cole, Jean Philippe, and Delva, attempting to force him to disclose where he kept his cash. MV was bound, blindfolded (albeit ineffectively), stabbed, and repeatedly beaten. Accilien, who had remained at home, attempted to call Jean Philippe, Cole, and Delva to learn whether the robbery was proceeding as planned; when none of them answered their phones, Accilien went to FV\u2019s apartment to see whether everything was all right. MV ultimately capitulated and revealed the location of his cash. Cole and Jean Philippe went to that location while Accilien and Delva remained behind to guard FV and MV. During that time, MV managed to shift his blindfold sufficiently to see Accilien, who complained to Delva about the intruders\u2019 blindfolding proficiency. Accilien testified that Delva then readjusted MV\u2019s blindfold and hit MV several times with a mop handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The home invasion ended on September 4, after the robbers got, <em>inter alia, </em>more than $40,000 in cash, jewelry, and clothing, along with six pounds of marijuana and FV\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">B. <em>The Early Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The investigation of the kidnapping and robbery was led by FBI Special Agent John Reynolds and NYPD Detective Ellis Deloren. Deloren arrived at the kidnapping/robbery scene and spoke with FV and MV before they were taken to a hospital, and he later interviewed them at the hospital. Deloren prepared photographic arrays, each of which included one suspect. FV identified Cole from one array; MV identified Jean Philippe from another. A sealed federal indictment was filed in late October 2012; Cole and Jean Philippe were arrested about a week later, and the indictment was unsealed as to them. Pictures of several items stolen from MV were found on Cole\u2019s cellphone.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">MV also identified Accilien from a photo array. Accilien had a significant criminal history, which included a charge of assault on a police officer, and Deloren found in police files Accilien\u2019s last known address, a second-floor apartment on South Oak Drive in the Bronx. Deloren went to that address under the guise of looking for someone else who was supposedly wanted for a different crime. Accilien himself answered the street-level outer door, thereby allowing Deloren to infer that Accilien still lived at and/or frequented that address. An arrest warrant for Accilien was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">At about 6:00 a.m. on June 4, 2013, approximately 10 Officers, led by Deloren and Reynolds, went to the South Oak Drive address, knocked on the outer door, and identified themselves as police. Delo-ren, through the door\u2019s window, saw a man he thought was Accilien start to descend the stairs and promptly retreat; the Officers then breached the door and entered. In the second-floor apartment they found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Accilien, a woman and two children, and three other men\u2014including Delva, who at that time was not a suspect in the kidnapping/robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">C. <em>The Denial of Delva\u2019s Suppression Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The events following the Officers\u2019 entry into the building are recounted in the findings of the district court in denying Delva\u2019s initial suppression motion\u2014which challenged the seizure only of the drugs and gun. <em>See United States v. Delva, </em>No. 12 Cr. 802, 2014 WL 465149 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2014) <em>(\u2018Delva I\u201d). </em>The findings in that opinion\u2014uncontested on appeal, except for a general challenge to credibility\u2014include the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u201cThe outer door entered onto a staircase that leveled off at a landing adjoining the kitchen. There was no interior door between the stairs and the kitchen.\u201d <em>Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *2 (citations to the suppression hearing transcript (\u201cH.Tr.\u201d) omitted). The apartment consisted of a kitchen, a bedroom/living room (the \u201cliving room\u201d), a second bedroom (or \u201cbedroom\u201d), and a bathroom. \u201cThe apartment was about 500 square feet in total.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">As Reynolds was climbing the stairs, he could see Accilien at the top looking down at him. Both Reynolds and Delo-ren were stating: \u201cPolice, get down.\u201d Accilien complied and lay down on the floor in the kitchen. As Reynolds reached the top of the stairs, he saw two other men in the kitchen; Reynolds stepped further into the kitchen and instructed the two other men to get down. The kitchen was very small. Reynolds then noticed somebody in the second bedroom.... [whom he] later identified ... as Delva.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *3 (citations to H.Tr. omitted). Both Reynolds and Deloren observed Delva inside the second bedroom walking toward the kitchen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">Reynolds instructed Delva to get down on the ground. Delva did not immediately comply; Reynolds had to instruct him several times, and he did eventually comply. When Delva was lying on the ground, his head was in the bedroom near the doorway, with the rest of his body and legs stretching behind him into the bedroom. Reynolds then stepped either to the side of Delva or over Delva to make sure no one else was in the room. Reynolds testified that he could not see the entire bedroom from the kitchen and needed to enter the bedroom to determine if anyone else was in that room and whether there could be any threats coming from that room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">When Reynolds entered the bedroom and looked to see if anyone else was present, he noticed a closet, the door of which was ajar. He saw a clear, plastic bag on the floor of the closet that contained a white, powdery substance which he believed to be drugs. The bag was on top of or right next to sneakers. Reynolds testified that he did not touch anything or open anything before seeing the bag and the sneakers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">Immediately thereafter, Deloren entered the bedroom. He [had] handcuffed Accilien very quickly and proceeded to the second bedroom. He saw that Delva was on the ground, his body completely inside the bedroom. Reynolds was focused on Delva and told Deloren about the bag in the closet. Deloren stated that the closet door was open when he approached it. He could see the floor of the closet and saw a clear, plastic bag with a white powdery substance in it; based on his experience he believed it to be cocaine. Deloren bent down to pick the bag up and saw that just to the side of it, only a few inches away, was a sneaker with a firearm in it. The gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>was inserted barrel-first into the shoe. Deloren then used the word \u201clunch\u201d to notify Reynolds and others that there was a gun. Deloren then quickly recovered the gun and made it safe by removing the magazine and emptying the chamber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">As he was handcuffing Delva, Reynolds heard Deloren almost immediately use the word \u201clunch,\u201d which Reynolds understood to be code for \u201cgun.\u201d <em>Reynolds then moved Delva into the kitchen with the others. Only two minutes had elapsed between the time the Officers entered the apartment and the apartment Was secured with the men in handcuffs in the kitchen. </em>Deloren testified that the men in the apartment were handcuffed to ensure officer safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\"><em>Reynolds and Deloren then brought Accilien into the bedroom and asked him to identify the other people in the </em>apartment; Accilien identified Delva as his nephew and the closet in the bedroom as belonging to Delva.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Delva <em>I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *3-*4 (footnote and citations to H.Tr. omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The district court concluded that given the presence of other people in the apartment and the Officers\u2019 knowledge of Acci-lien\u2019s criminal history, \u201cit would ... have been imprudent and unreasonable for the Officers to have entered the premises, seen the other men, and not conducted a protective sweep.\u201d Delva <em>I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *6 (emphasis added). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHy\">when Reynolds saw the defendant in his bedroom, moving towards them, it was only prudent for Reynolds to ensure that the defendant was not going to create a safety issue. It was therefore perfectly appropriate for Reynolds to instruct the defendant to \u201cget down.\u201d Reynolds and Deloren testified that, when the defendant was on the ground, he was positioned entirely inside the bedroom. There is no doubt that it was appropriate for Reynolds to step into the bedroom at that point in order to secure the defendant. Once Reynolds entered the bedroom, it was perfectly reasonable for him to look quickly around the room to determine if there were any other individuals in the room who might constitute a safety risk. <em>In doing so, his eyes noticed the open door to the closet and drugs in plain view. Deloren\u2019s entry to assist Reynolds led to recovery of the drugs Reynolds saw as well as the gun immediately next to it, which was also in plain view.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">There is no evidence in the record that the drugs and gun were not in the position in which Deloren and Reynolds testified they were in\u2014on the floor of the closet, with the door open, in plain view.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">Under these circumstances, the factual record is straightforward and supportive of a reasonable search and seizure of the <em>[drugs and gun]. </em>Under the circumstances described above, the protective sweep conducted by Reynolds and Deloren was reasonable. In addition, there is no factual basis to suggest that, once Reynolds and Deloren were in the bedroom, the <em>[drugs and gun] </em>w[ere] not in plain view. All of the evidence before the Court is that they were. Given the highly incriminating character of these items, their seizure was therefore perfectly lawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-12\"><em>Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *7 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The district court also noted that, \u201c[o]n cross-examination,\u201d at the hearing, \u201cDelo-ren testified that, when the Officers first went to the residence, their intent was to arrest Accilien but not conduct a search; after recovering the [drugs and gun], the Officers then performed a general search.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Id. </em>at *7 n.5. However, the court concluded that that \u201ctestimony d[id] not undermine the legality of the recovery of the [drugs and gun]\u2014these items were found in plain view during what was clearly a protective sweep.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">At the hearing on Delva\u2019s initial motion\u2014to suppress the drugs and gun\u2014 Reynolds and/or Deloren testified that in the June 4, 2013 raid on Accilien\u2019s apartment, cellphones (one of which they later learned belonged to Delva) and the Acpi-lien Letters had also been seized. Deloren testified that he saw the envelopes on the top of a small cabinet; he recognized that Accilien was the addressee and that the sender was Jean Philippe, whom Deloren had arrested in November 2012 in connection with the kidnapping and robbery of FV and MV.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">During the hearing with respect to the drugs and gun, Delva expanded his suppression request to include his cellphone. The district court invited supplemental briefing on that request, and Delva\u2019s supplemental reply brief added a request to suppress the Accilien Letters. The government\u2019s position was that \u201claw enforcement observed [those] items in plain view\u201d\u2014 along with the drugs and the gun\u2014\u201cMuring a lawful protective sweep.\u201d (Government\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant David Delva\u2019s Motion To Suppress His Cellular Telephone, dated February 3, 2014, at 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The district court, relying on evidence presented at the hearing following Delva\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs and gun, denied these supplemental motions to suppress Delva\u2019s cellphone and the Accilien Letters. <em>See United States v. Delva, </em>13 F.Supp.3d 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) <em>(\u201cDelva II\u201d). </em>The court reiterated many of the findings it had made in <em>Delva I </em>with rer spect to the need for a protective sweep of the apartment and the plain-view observation of the drugs and gun, <em>see, e.g., Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 272 (\u201cThe facts relevant to resolution of this motion were established at the evidentiary hearing on January 21, 2014. They are recited in this Court\u2019s January 27, 2014, 2014 WL 465149, decision on defendant Delva\u2019s first motion to suppress .... \u201d), and it made additional findings focusing on the cellphone and the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">With respect to the cellphone, the court noted that the Officers had gone to the apartment to arrest Accilien because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZD\">Accilien was alleged to have participated in a brutal robbery and kidnapping. At the time of the arrest, fhe officers who entered the Apartment knew that one or more cell phones had been used during the robbery and kidnapping,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\"><em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 271. After noting that the government argued that the Officers had seen \u201cdrugs, a gun, <em>and the Cell Phone </em>in plain view\u201d \u201cduring the course of legitimate efforts <em>incidental to a protective sweep </em>that was itself incident to the arrest of Accilien,\u201d and that it was \u201cundisputed that the Officers saw the drugs and gun <em>prior to </em>seeing the Cell Phone,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphases added), the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">Delva\u2019s arguments on this motion are <em>the same as those on his prior motion </em>with respect to <em>the gun and drugs: </em>(1) the Officers[] had no need or right to enter the Apartment; (2) once in the Apartment, the Officers had no right to enter the bedroom which the defendant shared with others; (3) that the Cell Phone, which was recovered in the bedroom, was not in plain view; and (4) even if the Cell Phone was in plain view, it was not in and of itself contraband, evidence of a crime, or associated with evidence of a crime,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\"><em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 271-72 (emphases added). The district court rejected those arguments, noting that Delva</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>proffered no evidence, nor elicited any evidence on cross-examination, that at the time it was seized, the Cell Phone was not in plain view in a bedroom that had been occupied the previous night by Accilien (the robbery and kidnapping suspect).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 271. After describing Deloren\u2019s discovery and unloading of Delva\u2019s gun, the court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\"><em>Reynolds then moved Delva into the kitchen with the others. Only two minutes had elapsed between the time the Officers entered the Apartment and the Apartment was secured with the men in handcuffs in the kitchen. Reynolds and Deloren then brought Accilien into the bedroom and asked him to identify the other people in the Apartment; </em>Accilien identified Delva as his nephew and the closet in the bedroom as belonging to Delva....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">The Apartment was small. Two Officers stepped into the bedroom with Ac-eilien to ask him who the other individuals were and to whom the items in the closet belonged. <em>While that was occurring, the Officers noticed and seized a letter and two cell phones. </em>The two cell phones were in plain view: one on a television stand and the other on the bed. At about the same time, Reynolds [sic] also saw an envelope in plain view with Accilien\u2019s name as the addressee. Reynolds [sic] saw that the sender of the envelope was one of the suspects in the same robbery and kidnapping; the letter had been sent from the sender\u2019s place of incarceration. While the cabinet on which the letter was located had a number of items on it, Special Agent Reynolds [sic] testified credibly that there was room for the letter to be in plain view on the cabinet with the address information visible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 273-74 (footnote and citations to H.Tr. omitted) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Having noted that \u201c[p]atently incriminating evidence that is in plain view <em>during a proper security check </em>may be seized without a warrant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 275 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis ours), the district court denied Delva\u2019s supplemental suppression motions, concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\"><em>This Court previously determined that the Officers[] entry into both the Apartment and the bedroom in which the defendant had been living was lawful. ... </em>The Court also previously determined that the <em>drugs and gun </em>which the Officers seized were in plain view.... No facts have been proffered disputing the fact that the cell phones were observed by Special Agent Reynolds in plain view on a table and on the bed in the bedroom in which Delva was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\"><em>There were multiple lawful reasons why the Officers had probable cause to believe that the Cell Phone was evidence of or contained evidence of criminal activity: the Officers were in the Apartment to arrest a man (Accilien) whom they were arresting for kidnapping, and they knew that cell phones had been used in connection with that crime. </em>Ac-cilien identified himself as an occupant of the bedroom in which the cell phones were found, and a letter addressed to Accilien was found on a table in that bedroom from another individual who was already incarcerated for the same crime. At the time of its seizure, the Officers believed that the cell phones belonged to Accilien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\"><em>The Officers had probable cause to seize the Cell Phone even if they believed or had reason to believe that it may have belonged to defendant Delva: Delva had just been handcuffed in the same </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>room, drugs and a gun had been found in plain view near him, and Accilien had identified the items in the closet as belonging to Delva. </em>The association between narcotics trafficking (for which Delva was initially arrested) and cell phones has been long established\u2014cell phones can store information and images relating to the crime and participants in the crime (that is, who bought and sold the drugs).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">In determining whether probable cause to seize the Cell Phone existed, the Court looks at the totality of the facts and circumstances as they existed at the scene.... Those facts and circumstances leave no doubt that the Officers were acting within the law when they seized the Cell Phone.... The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution only prohibits <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures; here, the seizure was perfectly reasonable.FN4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">FN4 On cross-examination, Deloren testified that, when the Officers first entered the Apartment, their intent was to arrest Accilien but not to conduct a search; after recovering the drugs and gun, the Officers then performed a general search. This testimony does not undermine the legality of the recovery of <em>the Cell Phone\u2014it was found in plain view during what was clearly a protective sweep.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 277 &amp; n.4 (citations to H.Tr. omitted) (penultimate emphasis in original; other emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">D. <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As indicated above, at the time of his arrest on June 4, 2013, Delva was not a suspect in the kidnapping and robbery of FV and MV. Accilien, who began to cooperate with the authorities almost immediately after his arrest, did not reveal that Delva was involved in those crimes until mid-July. Thus, the drugs and gun found in Delva\u2019s closet on June 4 initially led to his arrest only on New York State drug and gun charges. After the Accilien Letters were reviewed by the Officers, however, Delva became a suspect: In one of the letters, received by Accilien several weeks after Jean Philippe was arrested, Jean Philippe wrote that he had not cooperated with the authorities, and he urged Accilien and Delva to \u201cstand[ ] tall\u201d and not inform on Jean Philippe. In August 2013, Delva was rearrested on federal charges, alleging not only narcotics and firearm offenses, but also substantive and conspiracy kidnapping and robbery crimes against FV and MV.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">At Delva\u2019s trial (Cole and Jean Philippe by then had pleaded guilty to charges relating to the kidnapping and robbery and had been sentenced to prison terms of life plus seven years) the government\u2019s evidence included testimony by FV and MV and law enforcement officials; Accilien testified about his and Delva\u2019s involvement in the kidnapping and robbery and about Delva\u2019s narcotics distribution business. The government also presented evidence that one of the latex gloves recovered from FV\u2019s apartment contained Delva\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The jury found Delva guilty of conspiring to commit kidnapping and robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1201 and 1951; conspiring to distribute narcotics, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; and substantive firearms offenses, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 922(g). It found Delva not guilty of the substantive offenses of kidnapping, robbery, and use of a gun in furtherance of kidnapping and robbery. He was sentenced principally to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>Part II.B.3. below.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">On appeal, Delva contends principally that the district court erred in denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>motions to suppress his cellphone and the Accilien Letters, arguing chiefly that the court erred in finding that the seizure of those items occurred during the Officers\u2019 protective sweep of the apartment. He also contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court abused its discretion (a) in allowing FV to testify that she was raped during the home invasion, because she could not identify Delva as one of those who raped her, (b) in excusing a juror before the end of trial, and (c) in imposing a severe sentence based in part on conduct of which he was acquitted; we find no merit in these contentions for the reasons stated in Part II.B. below. For the reasons discussed in Part II.A. below, we see no error in the district court\u2019s findings that the cellphone and letters\u2014recognizable as likely evidence (cellphones having been used in the kidnapping/robbery, and the letters being post-kidnapping/robbery communications between two of the charged coconspira-tors)-\u2014were in plain view in the second bedroom; but the court erred in finding that the cellphone and letters were seen and seized during the Officers\u2019 protective sweep. The record and the court\u2019s findings reveal that the apartment was secured before the Officers reentered the bedroom, and that the cellphone and letters were seen only after their reentry. Nonetheless, we affirm the denial of the motions to suppress those items because we conclude that the agents\u2019 warrantless reentry into that bedroom was justified by the exigencies of the circumstances, and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment, given that the agents had found four adult males in the small apartment and had seen narcotics and a gun during the protective sweep, and that that bedroom was the only unoccupied room, other than the bathroom, in which to question Accilien and the others individually in order to determine whom to arrest for possession of the narcotics and gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">A. <em>Fourth Amendment Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause .... \u201d U.S. Const, amend.

Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 748, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, generally, as \u201ca basic principle of Fourth Amendment law,\u201d entries into a home without a warrant, or \u201csearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant[,] are presumptively unreasonable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 749, 104 S.Ct. 2091 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Kentucky v.

Whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, given the nonerroneous findings of historical fact, is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See id. </em>at 105-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">1. <em>Protective Sweeps</em></p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">Law enforcement authorities generally do not need a search warrant to enter a suspect\u2019s home when they have an arrest warrant for the suspect, as \u201can arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 603, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Further, \u201c[i]t is well settled that a search incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the [search] warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Thus, \u201ca search may be made of the person of the arrestee by virtue of the lawful arrest. [In addition,] a search may be made of the area within the control of the arrestee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">When a person is arrested inside a residence, the officers may permissibly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">as an incident to the arrest ..., as a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Maryland, v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990). Such a security check or \u201cprotective sweep\u201d is subject to limitations. The <em>Buie </em>Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABT\">emphasize[d] that such a protective sweep, aimed at protecting the arresting officers, if justified by the circumstances, is nevertheless not a full search of the premises, but may extend only to a cursory inspection of those spaces where a person may be found.FN3 The sweep lasts no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">FN3 .... A protective sweep is without question a \u201csearch\u201d ...; [it is] permissible on less than probable cause only because [it is] limited to that which is necessary to protect the safety of officers and others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 335-36 &amp; n.3,110 S.Ct. 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">2. <em>The Plain View Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"Acv\">The \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine is a recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment requirement of a warrant for seizures. <em>See, e.g., Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 134, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990) (objects in plain view are not found through a privacy-invading search; thus, \u201c[i]f \u2018plain view\u2019 justifies an exception from an otherwise applicable warrant requirement, ... it must be an exception that is addressed to the concerns that are implicated by seizures rather than by searches\u201d). Under the plain-view exception, \u201cif police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993); <em>see Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301; <em>Illinois v. Andreas, </em>463 U.S. 765, 771, 103 S.Ct. 3319, 77 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1983). \u201cIf an article is already in plain view, neither its observation nor its seizure would involve any invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 133, 110 S.Ct. 2301. However, the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine cannot be invoked to justify an extended search; \u201cthe doctrine is associated only with the seizure of items\u201d that are\u2014as the label indicates\u2014in plain view. <em>Ruggiero v. Krzeminski, </em>928 F.2d 558, 562 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Thus, under the \u201csecurity check\u201d exception, when law enforcement officers have lawfully entered premises in connection with an arrest, and in the course of making a permissible quick and limited protective sweep of the premises they see an object whose incriminating character is immediately apparent, \u201cand if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant,\u201d <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130; <em>see Horton, </em>496 U.S. at 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301. The plain-view doctrine may allow discovered items to be admitted in evidence even where \u201cthe discovery of the evidence was not inadvertent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 110 S.Ct. 2301 (\u201ceven though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate \u2018plain-view\u2019 seizures, it is not a necessary condition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">3. <em>The District Court\u2019s Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">In support of his contention that the district court erred in denying his supplemental motions to suppress his cellphone and the Accilien Letters, Delva argues principally that the court erred in ruling that those items were seen and seized during the Officers-\u2019 protective sweep of the apartment. He also contends that those items were not in fact in plain view and that the testimonies of Reynolds and Delo-ren were not credible. Leaving aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>question of whether Delva even has standing to challenge the seizure of the Accilien Letters, which were not authored by or addressed to Delva\u2014an issue not raised by the government in the district court\u2014we find no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The challenges to the court\u2019s credibility assessments and to its findings as to where the cellphone and letters were found do not require extended discussion. First, we see no basis in the present record for overturning the credibility determinations by the district judge, who had the opportunity to view and hear the witnesses. Second, for the proposition that the letters were not in plain view, Delva cites testimony by Accilien at trial that the letters were in the closet. Accilien, however, was not called as a witness at the suppression hearing. At that hearing, the only witness as to the location of the letters was Deloren, who testified that he saw them on the top of a low cabinet. Apart from the district court\u2019s misattributing to Reynolds the Deloren testimony as to the observation of the letters, its finding that the Accilien Letters were in plain view is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Delva\u2019s contention that the district court erred in ruling that his cellphone and the Accilien Letters were seen and seized during the Officers\u2019 protective sweep of the apartment gives us greater pause. While most of the court\u2019s findings, further discussed in Part II.A.4. below, are amply supported by the record, we see three difficulties with the court\u2019s conclusion that Delva\u2019s motions to suppress those items should be denied because they were seen during the protective sweep: (1) the court misunderstood the basis for Delva\u2019s principal argument for suppression of the cellphone and the letters; (2) it assumed that its prior findings with respect to the drugs and the gun were fully applicable to the cellphone and the letters; and (3) it failed to take into account that the protective sweep had been completed before the Officers reentered the bedroom and saw the cellphone and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">First, the court stated that Delva\u2019s arguments in support of his request to suppress his cellphone and the Accilien Letters were \u201cthe same as those on his prior motion with respect to the gun and drugs,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>essentially that \u201cthe Officers had no right to enter\u201d the apartment or the bedroom, and that the cellphone \u201cwas not in plain view\u201d and was not contraband or evidence of a crime. <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 271-72. However, Delva argued that the hearing testimony established that by the time the cellphone and letters were found, the protective sweep had in fact been completed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">[T]he [government\u2019s] Opposition Memorandum claims the cell phones and envelope were observed in the bedroom, \u201cin plain view,\u201d during the protective sweep. However, this allegation is not accurate and belied by the record. <em>The Hearing established, during the 'protective sweep, only the gun and crack cocaine were observed and seized by the agents. </em>This observation, and seizure, occurred while Mr. Delva was handcuffed (while lying on the floor of his bedroom). After the gun and cocaine were recovered from the closet, the agents lifted Mr. Delva (who was handcuffed) off the ground and walked him, out of the bedroom, into the kitchen. (Hearing p. 29-30, 45). In addition, at that time, one of the agents further checked the bedroom closet and looked under the bed to make sure no one else was in the bedroom. (Hearing p. 50).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\">After Mr. Delva, and the agents, were out of the, now vacant and secure, bedroom, the agents asked Mr. Delva for his consent to re-enter and search his bedroom. (Hearing p. 32). Mr. Delva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>expressly refused to give consent to the agents. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, thereafter, agents re-entered the bedroom with Ac-cilien. Supposedly, <em>while in the room, </em>Accilien gave consent to search the bedroom. <em>During the course of this general search, </em>the cell phones and envelope were allegedly observed to be in \u201cplain view.\u201d (Hearing p. 87-90). In addition, other items such as a box of ammunition, was [sic] recovered from a closed drawer. (Hearing p. 87-88).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">However, <em>after the protective sweep was completed, and after the agents had left the bedroom with Mr. Delva, there was no lawful basis to re-enter the bedroom. The bedroom was clear and secure pursuant to the prior protective sweep. </em>In addition, <em>Mr. Delva, Accilien and all of the other occupants had been secured. </em>(Hearing p. 72-73). Moreover, Mr. Delva expressly refused to give the agents consent to re-enter and search the bedroom. <em>Under these circumstances, the re-entry into the bedroom, with Accilien, was not a part of a protective sioeep. It was a warrantless reentry, into Mr. Delva\u2019s bedroom, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. </em>As such, all items seized (including the cell phone, letters and anything else) must be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">(Delva Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion To Suppress Cellular Telephone and Other Property at 3-5 (emphases added).) The court did not acknowledge this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Second, the district court noted that it had \u201cpreviously [in <em>Delva </em>7] determined that the Officers['] entry into ... the bedroom in which [Delva] had been living was lawful,\u201d <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 277. But that prior determination was made in connection with Delva\u2019s initial motion, which had sought suppression of only the drugs and the gun, <em>see Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *1 (\u201cDelva moved to suppress evidence of drugs and a gun (the \u2018Evidence\u2019)\u201d); <em>id. </em>at *7 (concluding that the record showed a \u201creasonable search and seizure of the Evidence\u201d because \u201cthe protective sweep conducted by Reynolds and Deloren was reasonable\u201d). The drugs and gun were seen during the Officers\u2019 first visit to the bedroom while they were conducting the protective sweep. There was no testimony that cellphones and letters were seen before Deloren and Reynolds completed their protective sweep of the bedroom and took Delva into the kitchen. Thus, the district court\u2019s prior ruling with respect to the drugs and the gun could not be controlling with respect to the cellphone and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Finally, although the district court noted that \u201cthe Officers saw the drugs and gun <em>prior to </em>seeing the Cell Phone,\u201d <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 271 (emphasis added), it failed to recognize that the second sighting did not occur during the protective sweep, and occurred only after that sweep had been completed and the Officers had vacated the bedroom and then returned. The court found, based on the testimonies of Reynolds and Deloren, that after the Officers entered the apartment, Accilien and the two men other than Delva had promptly complied with the Officers\u2019 orders to lie down on the floor and had been handcuffed in the kitchen; that Deloren, after quickly handcuffing Accilien, went into the bedroom where Reynolds was handcuffing Delva; that after Deloren retrieved and unloaded the gun seen in the bedroom closet, Reynolds moved Delva into the kitchen with Accilien and the other two handcuffed men; and that the protective sweep had been completed in no more than two minutes. <em>See Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 271-73; <em>Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *3-*4. The court found that after \u201cReynolds ... moved Delva into the kitchen with the others.... Reynolds and Deloren <em>then </em>brought Accilien into the bedroom\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>question him, <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 273 (emphasis added); <em>Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *4 (emphasis added), and saw the cellphone and letters \u201cin plain view,\u201d <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s bottom-line finding that Delva\u2019s cellphone and the Accilien Letters were found \u201cduring\u201d the protective sweep, <em>e.g., id. </em>at 277 n.4 (\u201cthe Cell Phone ... was found in plain view during what was clearly a protective sweep\u201d), is clearly erroneous. The above detailed factual findings make it plain that the Officers returned to the bedroom with Accilien only after the protective sweep had been completed, and that they saw the cellphone and letters only after their return and not during their protective sweep. Thus, the discovery of the cellphone and the letters was not covered by the protective-sweep exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">4. <em>The Exigent Circumstances Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The conclusion that the plain-view discovery of Delva\u2019s cellphone and the Accilien Letters did not occur during the Officers\u2019 protective sweep of the apartment, however, does not end our inquiry, for \u201c[w]e are free to affirm on any ground that finds support in the record, even if it was not the ground upon which the trial court relied,\u201d <em>Headley v. Tilghman, </em>53 F.3d 472, 476 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 877, 116 S.Ct. 207, 133 L.Ed.2d 140 (1995). Based on other findings that are not clearly erroneous, we conclude that despite the fact that Delva\u2019s cellphone and the Accilien Letters were seen in a room reentered by the Officers after the conclusion of the protective sweep, the Officers\u2019 reentry into that room did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">As \u201creasonableness is always the touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis,\u201d <em>Birchfield v.

Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 457 (2d Cir.) (\u201cguns are tools of the narcotics trade\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 990, 125 S.Ct. 1878, 161 L.Ed.2d 751 (2004). There was a clear need for the Officers to remain in the apartment long enough to ensure, <em>inter alia, </em>that persons engaged in drug trafficking were not released.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There were four adult males in the small apartment when the Officers arrived around 6:00 a.m. The living room, equipped with a mattress on the floor or a pull-out couch, was occupied by the woman and children. <em>(See </em>H.Tr. 72.) The bedroom in which the drugs and gun were found contained not only a bed but an inflatable mattress. <em>(See id. </em>at 48.) There was thus probable cause to believe that the drugs and gun were owned by one of the four men; whoever owned those items was subject to immediate arrest; all four men were suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Although at the time of the Officers\u2019 reentry into the by-then-empty bedroom there was no reason to believe that any of the suspects were armed, it was objectively reasonable to fear that if the owner of the drugs and gun were not identified and were allowed to depart he would likely attempt to escape apprehension or further detection. In the interest of protecting the public, it was the responsibility of law enforcement not only to seize the drugs and the gun, but also to determine who owned or possessed them and to place that person under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">No doubt the Officers could have sought (and obtained) a search warrant for the apartment; but a search would likely not tell the Officers who owned the drugs and gun. The purpose of their reentry into the bedroom was not to search for additional items that might be found there\u2014a task that could have been performed without bringing Accilien or any of the other suspects into the room\u2014but rather to seek information as to who owned the drugs and the gun. <em>See Delva I, </em>2014 WL 465149, at *4 (the Officers \u201cbrought Accilien into the bedroom and asked him to identify the other people in the apartment\u201d); <em>Delva II, </em>13 F.Supp.3d at 274 (the Officers \u201cstepped into the bedroom with Accilien to ask him who the other individuals were and to whom the items in the closet belonged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Thus, the Officers reasonably sought to determine expeditiously whom, if anyone other than Accilien, they should arrest. <em>(See also </em>H.Tr. 84 (the Officers spent some 15-20 minutes \u201crunning names of people that were in the apartment\u201d\u2014thereby \u201cdiscovering] an outstanding warrant for David Delva\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Perhaps, instead of questioning Accilien as to the identities of the other three men and as to who owned the drugs and gun, the Officers could have taken all four men to the police station for questioning. But mere presence at a place in which there are illegal drugs is not a crime. Certainly it was less intrusive for the Officers to attempt to find out immediately whom, other than Accilien, to arrest and whom not to. Further, given the possibility that the drugs and gun did not belong to Acci-lien, it was reasonable for the Officers to attempt to have him name the owner outside of the presence of the other men, in order to facilitate Accilien\u2019s candor and reduce the possibility of intimidation by the owner. But in order to interview Acci-lien beyond the hearing of the other three men, the Officers were forced to go somewhere other than the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The apartment was very small, about 500 square feet in total, consisting of the living room occupied by the woman and children, the kitchen, the bathroom, and the bedroom. There was no door between the kitchen entrance to the apartment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the landing at the top of the stairs; there was no anteroom, or any hallway, in which the Officers could question Accilien privately. In these circumstances, given the need to determine which of the other men in the apartment\u2014if any of them\u2014should be arrested, the Officers\u2019 decision to return to the bedroom, the only unoccupied room other than the bathroom, in order simply to question Accilien, or to question any of the other men individually, in order to determine whom to arrest for possession of the drugs and the gun, was objectively reasonable. After Accilien identified Delva and stated that those items belonged to Delva, the Officers arrested Del-va.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In sum, the law enforcement interest in promptly questioning Accilien in private while the other three men were still being detained was strong, and the return to the empty bedroom for that purpose was .a reasonable and minimal intrusion into the residents\u2019 privacy. Although the government did not argue exigent circumstances in the district court, we conclude that the facts found by the district court, and substantiated by the evidence, provide ample basis for application of the exigent circumstances exception to the Officers\u2019 reentry into the bedroom. In these circumstances, as we see no error in the district court\u2019s finding that the cellphone and letters were observed in that room in plain view, we conclude that the record required the denial of Delva\u2019s motions to suppress the cellphone and the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">B. <em>Other Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Delva also raises challenges to certain of the court\u2019s evidentiary, procedural, and sentencing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">1. <em>FV\u2019s Testimony that She Was Raped</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Delva contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting FV to testify that during the kidnapping/robbery she was raped. He contends that even if FV was raped, the government failed to prove that he was a participant or that the rape was reasonably foreseeable to him, and therefore her testimony about the rape was irrelevant and highly prejudicial. The district court denied Delva\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude that evidence, noting that Delva was charged not only with the substantive offenses of kidnapping and robbery but also with conspiring to commit those offenses; the court concluded that the rape evidence was relevant and, given the circumstances of the crimes, was not unfairly prejudicial. <em>See United States v. Delva, </em>No. 12 Cr. 802, 2014 WL 4460360, at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2014) <em>(\u201cDelva III\u201d). \u201cWe </em>review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, and we will disturb an evidentiary ruling only where the decision to admit or exclude evidence was manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. McGinn, </em>787 F.3d 116, 127 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">FV testified that for about a day, she managed to resist the intruders\u2019 orders to summon MV to her apartment and that she gave in only after three of them, in close succession, raped her. Her testimony was directly relevant to the manner in which the robbery succeeded: \u201c[T]hreatened or actual use of force or violence\u201d was an element in the crimes. <em>Delva III, </em>2014 WL 4460360, at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Further, although Delva contends that there was no evidence to show that he could have anticipated that his codefen-dants would commit rape, Accilien testified that Jean Philippe instructed Accilien to bring Delva to FV\u2019s apartment specifically because Delva was experienced in committing robberies\u2014evidence that the court , found had a tendency to show a \u201crelationship of trust between the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>his eoeonspirators,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *8. We cannot conclude that there was error, much less \u201cmanifest\u201d error, in the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We also reject Delva\u2019s related contention that his attorney\u2019s decision not to cross-examine FV and attempt to shake her testimony that she had in fact been raped, violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. In order to prevail on such a claim, a defendant must show, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). An attorney\u2019s \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and counsel\u2019s obligation to consult with his client with regard to \u201cimportant decisions\u201d \u201cdoes not require counsel to obtain the defendant\u2019s consent to every tactical decision,\u201d <em>Florida v. Nixon, </em>543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Delva did not and does not claim that his attorney had not conducted a sufficient investigation. His disagreement with counsel, aired to the district court at the.start of trial, was an objection as to trial strategy. Delva stated, \u201cReally, basically the whole thing was just about disagreements about his method and the fact that he was going one way that I\u2019d agreed with before. Then at the end, that he changed at the last moment.\u201d (Trial Transcript (\u201cT.Tr.\u201d) 49.) Counsel stated that after extended consideration, he had made a \u201cstrategic decision.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>And in his summation to the jury, he argued that as FV was blindfolded and unable to say which three men had raped her, and that given that at one point only Cole, Jean Philippe, and Acci-lien were there, it was reasonable to infer that those were the three men, not including Delva, who raped her. <em>(See id. </em>at 1255-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Given the evidence as to the manner in which the kidnapping/robbery was committed, we conclude that counsel\u2019s strategic decision to make that argument, rather than to attempt to shake FV\u2019s testimony that she had in fact been raped, did not fall below an objectively acceptable level of competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">2. <em>The Replacement of Juror No. 7</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Delva also complains of the district court\u2019s removal of one of the jurors late in the trial. We conclude that the circumstances, which we set out below, warranted the juror\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">After the jury retired to deliberate, the district court pointed out that during Del-va\u2019s closing argument, Juror No. 7 had acted in an \u201cunusual\u201d manner by frequently nodding her head. (T.Tr. 1363.) That night, the government ran a background check on the juror .and reported that she appeared to have a criminal record, including a felony conviction for possession of crack cocaine. The court\u2019s voir dire had included the question \u201cHave any of you been charged with a crime or been the subject of any government investigation or accusation?\u201d and the juror had not responded affirmatively. Over Delva\u2019s objection, the court decided to question Juror No. 7 to determine whether she in fact had a criminal record and, if so, why she had failed to disclose that fact on her juror questionnaire or during voir dire. The court conducted two such rounds of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">In the first, when asked at the outset how many times she had been arrested, Juror No. 7 responded \u201cOnce.\u201d (T.Tr. 1383.) Upon further questioning, she again stated that she had been arrested just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>once <em>(see id.); </em>but then she admitted that she had been imprisoned for a felony conviction and that she had two additional arrests <em>(see id. </em>at 1384-85). She stated that she did not disclose the felony conviction on her juror questionnaire or during voir dire because her civil rights had been restored and that she did not disclose the other two arrests because the cases were old. The court briefly sent the juror out of the courtroom; the government argued that the juror was still being untruthful because her criminal record revealed that she had actually been arrested 10 times from 1986 through 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In the second round of questioning, the court proceeded, date by date, to ask Juror No. 7 whether she had been arrested. She admitted being arrested on three dates <em>(see id. </em>at 1391-93), including once for her narcotics \u201c[djealing\u201d felony <em>(id. </em>at 1393). As to each of the other seven dates, she denied, or stated that she had no recollection of, being arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The court found that \u201c[Juror No. 7] was being decidedly untruthful\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1395), and it concluded that there was a strong possibility of bias:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">Well, we\u2019ve gone from one to three arrests, and we\u2019re getting I think varying and shifting stories about the arrests each time. I don\u2019t think we have a clear answer on whether or not she recalls or doesn\u2019t recall earlier arrests.... I think that she\u2019s embarrassed about some of the convictions, I think that she\u2019s not wanted to talk about them because she finds them embarrassing, but I believe that they occurred and I think, based upon how she was responding when I was going through the other dates, I would bet that if we fingerprinted her as [counsel] suggests, that we would And that the others occurred as well. I certainly believe that the three are sufficient. We\u2019ve gotten several different answers now on these arrests, and that concerns me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA9s\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">The court is going to dismiss juror no. 7, based upon juror misconduct, based upon the court\u2019s determination that there are a number of instances where the juror has been untruthful with the court, starting potentially with the questionnaire, though there\u2019s a possible explanation for that, but certainly in the voir dire process and then most recently during the questioning this morning before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">(T.Tr. 1394-97.) Juror No. 7 was replaced with an alternate and the reconstituted jury was instructed to begin deliberations anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The trial judge is authorized to remove a juror for \u201cgood cause\u201d after deliberations have begun and to replace that juror with an alternate, so long as the reconstituted jury is instructed to begin deliberations anew. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Yousef, </em>327 F.3d 56, 160 n.72 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 933, 124 S.Ct. 353, 157 L.Ed.2d 241 (2003); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Crim.

The trial judge\u2019s decision to replace a juror for good cause is reviewable for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Whether or not Juror No. 7\u2019s civil rights had been restored, she had no right to fail to respond truthfully to the juror questionnaire or the court\u2019s questions on voir dire. Her lack of candor about her criminal record at the pretrial stage, which the court found continued in response to the court\u2019s direct inquiry, gave the court ample cause to dismiss Juror No. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">3. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared on Delva calculated that his base offense level under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) was 32, <em>see </em>Guidelines \u00a7 2A4.1(a); that level was increased by six steps because a ransom demand was made, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2A4.1(b)(1); plus two steps because the victims sustained serious bodily injury, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2A4.1(b)(2)(B); plus six steps because a victim was sexually exploited during the commission of the kidnapping/robbery, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2A4.1(b)(5); plus one step for the grouping of his offenses, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.4, bringing the total offense level to 47, which was reduced to the Guidelines maximum of 43. The PSR found that Delva\u2019s criminal history category was IV. The advisory-Guidelines-recommended range of imprisonment was thus life imprisonment for the conspiracies to commit kidnapping, robbery, and narcotics distribution, and for being a felon in possession of a firearm, plus a mandatory consecutive five-year term for possession of a firearm in furtherance of the narcotics conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">The district court found that Delva\u2019s criminal history category should be III instead of IV but otherwise adopted the factual findings in the PSR. The court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Delva was present at various times at the scene of the kidnapping/robbery and assisted in those crimes. It concluded that Delva\u2019s advisory-Guidelines-recommended range of imprisonment, despite the lower criminal history category, remained life imprisonment plus five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Cole and Jean Philippe, for their roles in the kidnapping/robbery, had been sentenced to prison terms of life plus seven years. The court found that Delva\u2019s conduct was somewhat less heinous, and it sentenced Delva to a below-Guidelines prison term of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">On appeal, Delva challenges his sentence as unduly harsh, arguing principally that the court impermissibly sentenced him largely for conduct of which he was acquitted, <em>i.e., </em>the substantive offenses of kidnapping, robbery, and brandishing a firearm in furtherance of the kidnapping/robbery. He argues that MV was unable to identify him as one of the perpetrators of the kidnapping/robbery, that he presented evidence that he was elsewhere during the period in which those crimes were committed, and that the court\u2019s finding as to his presence in FV\u2019s apartment at various times during the kidnapping/robbery is erroneous in light of his acquittals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>by the jury on those substantive counts. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">A district court commits a procedural error if it bases its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>556 U.S. 1268, 129 S.Ct. 2735, 174 L.Ed.2d 247 (2009). It commits substantive error if its \u201cdecision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Because the quantum of proof required for a verdict of guilt is higher than the quantum required for sentencing, it is established that \u201ca jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court from considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long as that conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 157, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <em>see also United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 527 (2d Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1060, 126 S.Ct. 1665, 164 L.Ed.2d 405 (2006); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 685 (2d Cir. 1997) (not error for the sentencing court to rely on evidence at trial that the jury considered insufficient to establish a factual proposition beyond a reasonable doubt, where the court itself finds that proposition established by a preponderance), <em>cert. denied, </em>524 U.S. 905, 118 S.Ct. 2063, 141 L.Ed.2d 140 (1998). Although Delva asks us not to follow <em>Watts, </em>we are bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Nor are we entitled, as Delva urges, to overturn the district court\u2019s finding that he was, at various points, present at the kidnapping/robbery. Although Delva argues that \u201ca far more reasonable view of the evidence\u201d would be \u201cthat Delva was not present\u201d (Delva brief on appeal at 69), it is beyond cavil that credibility assessments by the judge who presided over the trial are entitled to considerable deference, <em>see, e.g., Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Norman, </em>776 F.3d 67, 76-77 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2333, 191 L.Ed.2d 995 (2015), and that \u201c[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Plainly, there was evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Delva was present at the kidnapping/robbery; Delva acknowledges that the court relied on trial testimony by \u201cAccilien [and] the government\u2019s DNA evidence\u201d (Delva brief on appeal at 69). We cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous or that its ultimate decision was beyond the range of permissible decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">We have considered all of Delva\u2019s arguments on this appeal and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b184-12\">DENNIS JACOBS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Apb\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis on all issues other than the Fourth Amendment holding, which is of course the heart of the matter. As to the holding that exigent circumstances allowed the survey of a bedroom in which the police spotted things in plain view, I would remand for the district court to consider it in the first instance. The government, which bears the burden of proof, did not assert exigent circumstances in the district court, or here; and Delva\u2019s counsel has not had a chance to say a word about it. Because I would remand rather than affirm, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The Fourth Amendment prohibits war-rantless searches unless an exception applies. The exception for items in plain view is subject to a proviso: \u201claw enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view, provided that they have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made.\u201d Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 462-63, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011). The cellphone and the letters that Delva sought to suppress came into plain view when the police reentered a bedroom that had already been subject to a protective sweep. The question (not an easy one) is whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot (the bedroom) from which they saw evidence in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The district court held that the officers were lawfully in the bedroom as part of a protective sweep. The majority opinion demonstrates why the protective sweep exception is inapplicable, and there is no reason for me to recapitulate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The majority opinion nevertheless affirms on the ground of a different Fourth Amendment exception: exigent circumstances. In a nutshell, the majority opinion treats as exigency the need to find a private space to interview a suspect in a small and crowded apartment with no front door. The evidence was spotted when the police took Accilien into the only separate bedroom in the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The exigent circumstances exception is a limited one. Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 749, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984). The Supreme Court has recognized exigent circumstances where, for instance, police \u201cneed to provide urgent aid,\u201d or where they are \u201cin hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect,\u201d or where they \u201cfear the imminent destruction of evidence.\u201d Birchfield v. North Dakota, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2160, 2173, 195 L.Ed.2d 560 (2016). And importantly, \u201c \u2018the police bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests.\u2019 \u201d Harris v. O\u2019Hare, 770 F.3d 224, 234 (2d Cir. 2014), as amended (Nov. 24, 2014) (quoting Welsh, 466 U.S. at 749-50, 104 S.Ct. 2091).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The government did not argue exigent circumstances in the district court; the district court did not rule on exigent circumstances; and the government did not argue exigent circumstances on this appeal. It follows that Delva\u2019s counsel has not had an opportunity to argue the point, which has become crucial. It is not as though there would have been nothing for Delva\u2019s counsel to say: no published circuit opinion has found exigent circumstances in a case analogous to this one; and even if the bedroom was the only space for a private interrogation inside the apartment, an alternative venue may have been the street or a patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">The government has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to establish exigent circumstances, Harris, 770 F.3d at 234; the question is \u201cheavily fact dependent,\u201d United States v. Andino, 768 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir. 2014); and we lack the benefit of a ruling by the district court or of briefing by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Rather than affirm, I would remand this case to the district court for briefing and for a finding as to whether the exigent circumstances exception (or some other Fourth Amendment exception) applies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
