The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Engelmayer, J.) granted Whole Foods\u2019 motion to dismiss John\u2019s complaint for lack of Article III standing because he failed to allege a sufficient injury in fact. Because we conclude that John plausibly alleged an injury in fact, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Because John appeals from a judgment dismissing the complaint on the pleadings, we accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint, \u201cand we may consider documents incorporated into or integral to the complaint.\u201d WC Capital Mgmt., LLC v. UBS Sec., LLC, 711 F.3d 322, 325 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">1. Alleged Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">In 2014 and 2015 John \u201croutinely shopped\u201d at two Whole Foods stores in Manhattan and made \u201cregular[ ] purchase[s]\u201d of pre-packaged products, including \u201cpre-packaged cheese and cupcakes approximately one or two times per month.\u201d \u201cPre-packaged\u201d food products are those that Whole Foods weighs and prices prior to shelving, assigning a price to each package based on the weight of the food.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">Whole Foods routinely inflated the weight listed on the labels of pre-packaged products, and, as a result of the mislabeling, overcharged unwitting customers for pre-packaged food. The complaint does not identify a specific food purchase as to which Whole Foods overcharged John. Instead, it more generally describes pervasive overcharging of pre-packaged food throughout Whole Foods\u2019 stores in New York City. But the complaint does attach a June 2015 press release of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (the \u201cDCA\u201d) entitled \u201cDepartment of Consumer Affairs Investigation Uncovers Systemic Overcharging for Pre-packaged Foods at City\u2019s Whole Foods.\u201d As its title suggests, the press release announced the DCA\u2019s investigation of overcharging by Whole Foods and its preliminary findings that Whole Foods\u2019 New York City stores \u201croutinely overstated the weights of its prepackaged products\u2014including meats, dairy and baked goods.\u201d App\u2019x 26. The press release elaborated on these findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-14\">DCA tested packages of 80 different types of pre-packaged products and found all of the products had packages with mislabeled weights. Additionally, 89 percent of the packages tested did not meet the federal standard for the maximum amount that an individual package can deviate from the actual weight, which is set by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The overcharges ranged from $0.80 for a package of pecan panko to $14.84 for a package of coconut shrimp.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">The DCA\u2019s findings, the press release continued, \u201cpoint to a systematic problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>with how products ... are weighed and labeled\u201d and \u201csuggest[] that individual packages are routinely not weighed or are inaccurately weighed, resulting in overcharges for consumers.\u201d Id.- Finally, according to the press release, the DCA planned to \u201cfurther evaluate\u201d Whole Foods\u2019 \u201ccompliance with City and state laws\u201d and estimated that the \u201cpotential number of violations that Whole Foods faces for all pre-packaged goods in the NYC stores is in the thousands.\u201d App\u2019x 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The DCA\u2019s investigation leading up to the June 2015 press release took place from fall 2014 to winter 2015, the same period in which John allegedly made monthly purchases of cheese and cupcakes. The investigation focused on the eight Wfiiole Foods stores operating in New York City during that period, which included the two stores that John patronized. Whole Foods has since confirmed that cheese and cupcakes were among the pre-packaged products that the DCA alleged were mislabeled with overstated weights.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">2. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">In filing this class action, John alleged violations of sections 349 and 350 of the New York General Business Law as well as a claim for unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He sought compensatory damages, refunds, punitive damages, injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The proposed class includes all persons who purchased at least one of fourteen types of pre-packaged product within the six years prior to the filing of the complaint from a Whole Foods store in New York State.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The District Court granted Whole Foods\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), holding that John lacked Article III standing because he failed to plausibly allege that he was personally overcharged by Whole Foods for a specific purchase. In re Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc. Overcharging Litig., 167 F.Supp.3d 524, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Again citing John\u2019s failure to allege that he personally had been overcharged, the District Court explained that, even if John had standing, it would grant Whole Foods\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that amending the complaint would be futile. Id. at 538-39. Despite its conclusion that John lacked standing, the District Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Id. at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">As a preliminary matter, we again \u201cnote that where a complaint is dismissed for lack of Article III standing, the dismissal must be without prejudice, rather than with prejudice.\u201d Carter v. Health-Port Techs., LLC, 822 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 2016). \u201cSuch a dismissal is one for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id. And \u201cwithout jurisdiction, the district court lacks the power to adjudicate the merits of the case\u201d or \u201cdismiss a case with prejudice.\u201d Id. at 54-55 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThus, if we were to agree with the [District [C]ourt\u2019s conclusion that the Complaint failed to show Article III standing,\u201d we would remand with instructions that the judgment be \u201camended to provide that the dismissal is without prejudice.\u201d Id. at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">We need not do so, however, because we conclude that John\u2019s complaint plausibly alleges that he has Article III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>standing and therefore vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">To satisfy the \u201c \u2018irreducible constitutional minimum\u2019 of standing,\u201d a plaintiff \u201cmust have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d Spokeo, Inc, v. Robins, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1547, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L,Ed.2d 351 (1992)). Each element of standing \u201cmust be supported ... with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation,\u201d and at the pleading stage, \u201cgeneral factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may suffice.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130. And, because Whole Foods mounts only a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge to John\u2019s allegations of standing, John bears no evidentiary burden at the pleading stage. Carter, 822 F.3d at 56. As we explained in Carter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">When the Rule 12(b)(1) motion is facial, i.e., based solely on the allegations of the complaint or the complaint and exhibits attached to it (collectively the \u201cPleading\u201d), the plaintiff has no evidentiary burden. The task of the district court is to determine whether the Pleading \u201callege[s] facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that [the plaintiff] has standing to sue.\u201d On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s decision on such a facial challenge de novo, \u201caccepting] as true all material [factual] allegations of the complaint,\u201d and \u201cdraw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Id. at 56-57 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The District Court dismissed John\u2019s suit on the ground that he failed to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement. We have repeatedly described that requirement as \u201ca low threshold,\u201d WC Capital Mgmt., 711 F.3d at 329 (quoting Ross v. Bank of Am., N.A., 524 F.3d 217, 222 (2d Cir. 200,8)), which \u201chelps to ensure that the plaintiff has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\u201d Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2334, 2341, 189 L.Ed.2d 246 (2014) (quotation marks omitted). Injury in fact consists of \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Spokeo, 136 S.Ct. at 1548 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">John argues that his complaint adequately and plausibly alleges that Whole Foods overcharged him at least once for pre-packaged cheese and cupcakes. Here, no one disputes that overpaying for a product results in a financial loss constituting a particularized and concrete injury in fact. See Carter, 822 F.3d at 55 (\u201cAny monetary loss suffered by the plaintiff satisfies this element; [e]ven a small financial loss suffices.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Rather, the dispute arises from the following: in addition to the allegation that he made monthly purchases of Whole Foods pre-packaged cheese and cupcakes, the critical basis for John\u2019s claim that he was overcharged is the DCA\u2019s press release announcement that 89 percent of Whole Foods\u2019 pre-packaged products tested by the DCA were mislabeled, and the press release\u2019s conclusion that the mislabeling was \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201croutine[ ].\u201d We consider whether the press release together with John\u2019s monthly purchases provides a plausible basis to conclude that John overpaid Whole Foods for pre-packaged cheese or cupcakes during the period alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">The District Court was unswayed by the statistic that 89 percent of all packages tested by the DCA failed to satisfy federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>labeling standards. Relying on our statement in Shipping Financial Services Corp. v. Drakos that \u201cjurisdiction must be shown affirmatively, and that showing is not made by drawing from the pleadings inferences favorable to the party asserting it,\u201d 140 F.3d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1998), the District Court believed that John\u2019s complaint failed adequately to allege that he personally overpaid for any specific purchase. Our broad statement in Drakos relied on a more circumscribed statement by the Supreme Court in Norton v. Larney that appeared to prohibit drawing \u201cargumentative\u201d inferences favorable to the party asserting jurisdiction. 266 U.S. 511, 515, 45 S.Ct. 145, 69 L.Ed. 413 (1925). To the extent Norton shunned the drawing of inferences in favor of a plaintiffs standing at the pleading stage, the Supreme Court more recently has held that \u201cgeneral factual allegations of injury ... may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we presumfe] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quotation marks omitted). When the defendant asserts a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge to standing, therefore, it remains the case that courts should continue to draw from the pleadings all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor and \u201care to \u2018presum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u2019 \u201d Carter, 822 F.3d at 58 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130); see Amidax Trading Grp, v. S.W.I.F.T. SCRL, 671 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Here, the District Court did not draw all reasonable inferences in John\u2019s favor. To the contrary, it faulted the complaint for failing to allege \u201can investigative finding of ubiquitous, systematic over-weighting at Whole Foods\u2019 New York City stores,\u201d \u201cinvariable incidents of this deceptive labeling practice,\u201d and \u201cacross-the-board overcharging so as to embrace, other than by conjecture, the cheese and cupcakes ... that John ... occasionally bought in 2014 and 2015.\u201d 167 F.Supp.3d at 534. The District Court was also troubled by the absence of allegations describing the DCA\u2019s methodology. But the DCA\u2019s press release asserted that the mislabeling by Whole Foods was \u201csystematic\u201d and \u201croutine[],\u201d and a facial attack on the pleadings is not the proper stage to determine whether the DCA\u2019s sampling methods justified its declaration of widespread overcharging. At the pleading stage, John need not prove the accuracy of the DCA\u2019s findings or the rigor of its methodology; he need only generally allege facts that, accepted as true, make his alleged injury plausible. See Lewert v. P.F. Chang\u2019s China Bistro, Inc., 819 F.3d 963, 968 (7th Cir. 2016) (identifying injury in fact based in part on plausible allegation that restaurant customer\u2019s data was stolen, where restaurant sent notice of data breach to all of its diners nationwide but did not know which specific customers were affected). John may ultimately be unable to show he was injured under the more demanding standards applicable at summary judgment or trial. Of course, we understand the District Court\u2019s concern that John faces what may be significant evidentiary obstacles on the merits; but targeted discovery might show whether those obstacles can be surmounted. For present purposes, John has plausibly alleged a nontrivial economic injury sufficient to support standing: according to the DCA\u2019s investigation, Whole Foods packages of cheese and cupcakes were systematically and routinely mislabeled and overpriced, and John regularly purchased Whole Foods packages of cheese and cupcakes throughout the relevant period. Taking these allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, it is plausible that John overpaid for at least one product. John\u2019s complaint thus satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>fies the \u201clow threshold\u201d required to plead injury in fact. WC Capital Mgmt., 711 F.3d at 329 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Our decision in Amidax Trading Group v. S.W.I.F.T. SCRL is not to the contrary. In that case, Amidax accused the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (\u201cSWIFT\u201d) of turning over information about Amidax\u2019s financial transactions, contained in SWIFT\u2019s database, in response to requests from the federal government related to a terrorism investigation. 671 F.3d at 143-44. Because Amidax had not established that the entire SWIFT database was turned over, we required that Amidax allege at least that its customers \u201cso frequently utilized the SWIFT network to transfer funds that it is plausible, not just possible, that Amidax\u2019s data was handed over.\u201d Id. at 147-48. We affirmed the dismissal of the complaint because Amidax had failed to provide any such allegations of past frequency of use of the SWIFT network. Id. at 148. In doing so, however, we did not foreclose the possibility that injury in fact could be adequately pleaded with plausible allegations of a likelihood of past injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that John has plausibly alleged that he suffered an injury in fact by pleading both the frequency of his purchases and the systematic overcharging of pre-packaged foods at the Whole Foods stores he patronized. See Carter, 822 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We VACATE the District Court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. This case was originally filed in New York State court, but Whole Foods successfully removed it to federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act.
