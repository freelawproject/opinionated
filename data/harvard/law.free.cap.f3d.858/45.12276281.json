Nieto (collectively, the \u201cZoni Centers\u201d). On behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, plaintiffs filed this putative class and collective action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (P. Kevin Castel, <em>Judge), </em>alleging that defendants violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 <em>et seq., </em>and New York Labor Law, <em>see </em>N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7\u00a7 650 <em>et seq., </em>in failing to pay them both the statutory minimum wage for hours worked out of the classroom and statutory overtime when plaintiffs\u2019 classroom and out-of-classroom work exceeded 40 hours per week. On this appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of their FLSA claims for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6); <em>Fernandez v. Zoni Language Ctrs., Inc., </em>No. 15-cv-6066, 2016 WL 2903274 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2016). They argue that defendants were not entitled to the exemption from the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime requirements applicable to teachers working as bona fide professionals, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(a), because defendants are not \u201ceducational establishments,\u201d as required for that exemption to apply, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 541.303(a), 541.204(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-14\">For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that the Zoni Centers are \u201ceducational establishments\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b) and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">A. Defendants Zoni Centers</p>\n<p id=\"ANB\">Defendants Zoni Centers are part of a chain of private, for-profit facilities offer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>mg English language instruction. Both Zoni Centers are licensed by the New York State Department of Education as English-as-a-Second-Language schools, as required by state law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Educ. Law \u00a7 5001(1), (l)(b), (4)(f)(4). They are also accredited by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training, one of ten institutions deemed \u201cNationally Recognized Accrediting Agencies\u201d by the United States Department of Education. <em>See Accreditation-Agency List, </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Educ., http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ Agencies.aspx (last visited May 23, 2017).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Employment at Defendants\u2019 Zoni Centers</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Each of the named plaintiffs is or was employed as an English-language instructor at one of the two defendant Zoni Centers. As such, they not only teach English language classes held at the Zoni Centers, but also devote time outside of class to creating lesson plans consistent with Zoni\u2019s curriculum standards, grading students\u2019 midterm and final examinations, and attending professional development meetings. Like teachers at primary and secondary schools, plaintiffs receive no extra compensation for these outside-the-classroom activities. But unlike primary and secondary school teachers, who generally receive a fixed salary for the totality of their work, plaintiffs are paid at an hourly rate^\u2014here, $16 to $17 per hour\u2014calculated by reference only to their classroom teaching time. Plaintiffs allege that their preparation and grading of student work represents a material part of their work-time and should be compensated in addition to classroom time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">C. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Plaintiffs filed this action on August 3, 2015, seeking compensation under the FLSA and applicable state law for (1) unpaid minimum wages for their out-of-classroom work, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a); and (2) overtime pay for any weeks in which a teacher\u2019s total work time inside and outside the classroom exceeded 40 hours, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 207(a). The Zoni Centers moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that plaintiffs, as \u201cteachers\u201d at an \u201ceducational establishment,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(a), are subject to the FLSA\u2019s exemption from minimum wage and overtime requirements for persons \u201cemployed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1). In opposing the motion, plaintiffs conceded that they were \u201cteachers\u201d under the applicable regulation, but disputed the Zoni Centers\u2019 status as an \u201ceducational establishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">On May 18, 2016, the district court concluded, based on its review of eight factors, that the Zoni Centers were properly characterized as \u201cother educational institution[s]\u201d within the meaning of the Department of Labor\u2019s (\u201cDOL\u2019s\u201d) exemptive regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, it dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 FLSA claims on the merits and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state-law claims. A final judgment of dismissal was entered the same day, from which plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>both the district court\u2019s interpretation of administrative regulations, <em>see Ramos v. Baldor Specialty Foods, Inc., </em>687 F.3d 554, 558 (2d Cir. 2012), and its judgment of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting plaintiffs\u2019 plausible allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, <em>see Chen v. Major League Baseball Props., Inc., </em>798 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">B. The FLSA\u2019s Exemption for Bona Fide Professionals, Including Teachers at Educational Establishments</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The FLSA generally requires employers to pay \u201cemployees a specified minimum wage, and overtime of time and one-half for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week.\u201d <em>Glatt v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc., </em>811 F.3d 528, 533 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206-207). Because the FLSA is remedial legislation, we construe its exemptions narrowly and place the burden on the employer to show that his establishment is \u201cplainly and unmistakably within the[ ] terms and spirit\u201d of the exemption. <em>Chen v. Major League Baseball Props., Inc., </em>798 F.3d at 81 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-19\">The statutory exemption at issue here states that the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime requirements \u201cshall not apply with respect to ... any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity (including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); <em>see Anani v. CVS RX Servs., Inc., </em>730 F.3d 146, 150 &amp; n.4 (2d Cir. 2013). The DOL, which administers the FLSA, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 204, has promulgated regulations pertinent to this exemption, <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. pt. 541. The regulations at issue here, having undergone the notice-and-comment process, <em>see </em>Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees, 69 Fed. Reg. 22,122 (Apr. 23, 2004) (codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 541), \u201c \u2018have the force of law, and are to be given controlling weight unless they are found to be arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute,\u2019 \u201d <em>Ramos v. Baldor Specialty Foods, Inc., </em>687 F.3d at 559 (quoting <em>Freeman v. Nat\u2019l Broad. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>80 F.3d 78, 82 (2d Cir. 1996)). The parties here make no such challenge to the DOL\u2019s regulations. Rather, they dispute only the regulations\u2019 meaning. Before addressing that dispute, we make a few observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In general, an employer relying on the \u201cbona fide professional\u201d exemption from the FLSA\u2019s minimum wage and overtime mandates \u201cmust satisfy both a duties requirement and a salary requirement.\u201d <em>Anani v. CVS RX Servs., Inc., </em>730 F.3d at 147. To satisfy the duty requirement, the employer must generally show that the employee\u2019s work requires \u201cknowledge of an advanced type in. a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction,\u201d or \u201cinvention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.300(a)(2). To satisfy the salary requirement, the employer must show that the employee has been \u201c[c]ompensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.600(a); <em>see Anani v. CVS RX Servs., Inc., </em>730 F.3d at 147-48.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">These generalized duty and salary requirements, however, do not apply to \u201cteaching professionals.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(d). Rather, the applicable regulations dispense with the salary requirement entirely, <em>see id., </em>and establish a more specific duty test, identifying a teaching professional as an employee (1) \u201cwith a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge,\u201d (2) \u201cwho is employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational establishment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 541.303(a). Plaintiffs concede that their primary duty while employed by defendants is teaching in order to impart knowledge, specifically, knowledge of the English language. What they dispute is defendants\u2019 status as qualifying \u201ceducational establishments].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">DOL regulations define \u201ceducational establishment\u201d as \u201can elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other educational institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 541.204(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Zoni Centers are not associated with an elementary or secondary school, or with any institution of higher education. Thus, to qualify for the FLSA exemption applicable to bona fide professionals, they must be <em>\u201cother </em>educational institution^.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">DOL regulations do not specifically define \u201cother educational institution.\u201d Instead, they state that (1) the term \u201cincludes special schools for mentally or physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of such schools as elementary, secondary or higher\u201d; (2) \u201c[f]actors relevant in determining whether post-secondary career programs are educational institutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency responsible for the state\u2019s educational system or accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting organization for career schools\u201d; and (3) \u201cfor purposes of the [teaching professional] exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or between those operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>for profit and those that are not for profit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">C. Regulatory Interpretation of \u201cOther Educational Institution\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In this case, we address whether the Zoni Centers constitute such an \u201cother educational institution.\u201d In so doing, we look to the plain language of the regulatory text, which we consider \u201cin light of its purpose, as stated in the regulation\u2019s preamble ... as well as the purpose of the regulation\u2019s authorizing statute.\u201d <em>Halo v. Yale Health Plan, Dir. of Benefits &amp; Records Yale Univ., </em>819 F.3d 42, 52 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing approvingly to Kevin M. Stack, <em>Interpreting Regulations, </em>111 Mich. L. Rev. 355 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">1. Plain Meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The word \u201ceducational,\u201d as used both in the operative regulations and in DOL opinion letters, appears here to bear its common meaning, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cof, relating to, or concerned with education or the field of education.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) </em>723 (1986 ed.). \u201cEducation\u201d is \u201cthe act or process of providing with knowledge, skill, competence or us[ually] desirable qualities of behavior or character or of being so provided especially] by a formal course of study, instruction, or training.\u201d <em>See id. </em>This comports with \u00a7 541.303, captioned \u201cTeachers,\u201d which states that the FLSA\u2019s bona fide professional exemption applies to \u201cany employee with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in <em>the activity of imparting knowledge. </em>...\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(a) (emphasis added). Whether an institution is \u201ceducational\u201d thus turns not upon the subject matter that is learned, but upon whether and how it is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The open-ended nature of this definition is confirmed by the applicable regulation, which does not explain what an \u201cother educational institution\u201d means or is limited to, but only what it <em>\u201cincludes,\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b) (emphasis added). Such language indicates that the facilities discussed thereafter-\u2014special schools for disabled or gifted children\u2014are merely illustrative, and not exhaustive, as to what might qualify as an \u201cother educational institution.\u201d <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>831 (9th ed. 2009) (explaining that \u201cparticiple <em>including </em>typically indicates a partial list\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) </em>1143 (defining \u201cinclude\u201d as \u201cto place, list, or rate as a part or component of a whole of a larger group, class, or aggregate\u201d). This conclusion is reinforced by \u00a7 541.204(b)\u2019s next sentence, which recognizes that \u201cpost-secondary career programs\u201d\u2014entities distinct from the aforementioned special schools\u2014 can also qualify as educational establishments, particularly if they are state-licensed or nationally accredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Applying these plain-language considerations here, the Zoni Centers are \u201cother educational institution^].\u201d As described in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, their primary purpose is to provide English-language instruction to students using prescribed books in a traditional classroom environment. Every lesson plan must include speaking, listening, writing, and reading English, with student progress assessed on midterm and final examinations. These allegations confirm that plaintiffs were engaged in the transmittal of knowledge to students in much the same way as primary and secondary school teachers, except that plaintiffs\u2019 students were adults, not children, and the knowledge conveyed to them focused on a single subject, the English language. Further, as discussed by the regulation in the context of career schools, the Zoni Centers have both national educational accreditations and state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>licensure. Indeed, the latter qualification requires that Zoni Center teachers have completed a program in teaching English as a second language or have at least one year\u2019s experience teaching English as a second language, <em>see </em>8 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 126.10(j)(3)(iii)(a), further indicating that the teaching of English as a second language in New York is conducted by bona fide professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">2. Regulatory Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"AM3\">The purpose of the regulation warrants no different conclusion. What scant legislative history there is regarding 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1)\u2019s bona fide professional exemption suggests that it was premised on the intention to exempt workers who \u201ctypically earned salaries well above the minimum wage, and ... were presumed to enjoy other compensatory privileges ... setting them apart from the nonexempt workers entitled to overtime pay.\u201d Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees, 69 Fed. Reg. at 22, 124. Here, plaintiffs\u2019 $16-to-$17 hourly pay for their classroom work is well above the federal hourly minimum wage. Even when plaintiffs\u2019 earnings are attributed to the total hours worked inside and outside the classroom, no plaintiffs hourly rate of pay declines to less than $10 per hour, still above the federal and state minimum wage during that period. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a)(1)(C) (mandating federal minimum wage of $7.25 as of July 2009); N.Y. Lab. Law \u00a7 652(1) (raising state minimum wage to $8 per hour effective December 31, 2013, and $8.75 effective December 31, 2014).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Certainly, plaintiffs\u2019 total weekly earnings are hardly munificent and much lower than those of a new teacher employed by the New York City Board of Education. <em>See </em>United Fed\u2019n of Teachers, Salary Schedules for 2009-2018 Contract 2-5, http://www.uft.org/files/attachments/ secure/teacher-schedule-2009-2018.pdf (announcing increases in minimum base salary for New York City teachers to $45,985 as of May 1, 2013, and to $49,908 as of May 1, 2015). Also, because the FLSA is a remedial statute intended \u201cto remedy the evil of overwork,\u201d <em>Cheeks v. Freeport Pancake House, Inc., </em>796 F.3d 199, 206 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), we must limit the application of FLSA exemptions \u201cto those establishments plainly and unmistakably within their terms and spirit,\u201d <em>Chen v. Major League Baseball Props., Inc., </em>798 F.3d at 81 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we need not further address the aptness of a comparison between the wages of plaintiffs and other teachers because DOL regulations\u2014the enforceability of which plaintiffs do not challenge\u2014specifically exclude any salary requirement for exempt teaching professionals. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">As for the regulatory preamble, it too has little to say about application of the bona fide professional exemption to teachers. It highlights the DOL\u2019s decision to use state licensure and national accreditation as relevant factors in deciding whether post-secondary career programs qualify for the exemption. <em>See </em>69 Fed. Reg. at 22,147. Otherwise, the preamble simply states, in response to industry commen-ters, that DOL opinion letters can provide guidance in deciding whether a particular entity constitutes an \u201cother educational institution\u201d for purposes of the FLSA bona fide professional exemption. <em>See id.; see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>also Barfield v. N.Y.C. Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>537 F.3d 132, 149 (2d Cir. 2008) (observing that this court has \u201coften relied\u201d on such letters \u201cfor their persuasive value\u201d as illustrating \u201ca body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Our review of applicable DOL opinion letters confirms the breadth of subject-matter areas that may be encompassed by an \u201ceducational institution.\u201d For example, the DOL has concluded that the bona fide professional exemption for teachers applies to instructional programs for automobile, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle, and marine technicians, <em>see </em>Opinion Letter from Dep\u2019t of Labor, Wage &amp; Hour Div. (\u201cOpinion Letter\u201d), 2006 ,WL 3406601 (Oct. 26, 2006); to cosmetology schools, <em>see </em>Opinion Letter, 2008 WL 4906284 (Oct. 1, 2008); and to daycare providers, at least insofar as they provide \u201cgrade school curr\u00edculums, introductory programs in kindergarten, or nursery school programs in elementary education,\u201d and not simply childcare, Opinion Letter, 2008 WL 4906283 (Sept. 29, 2008). While no DOL opinion letters address the status of an English language instructor at a standalone language instruction facility, we see no principled ground for differentiating such a facility from those discussed in the cited opinion letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">D. Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"Apu\">1. \u201cOther Educational Institution\u201d Is Not Limited to Schools for the Disabled or Gifted, or to Post-Secondary Career Programs</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In urging the contrary conclusion, plaintiffs first assert that 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b), by specifically identifying schools for \u201cdisabled or gifted children\u201d and \u201cpost-secondary career programs\u201d as \u201cother educational institution[s],\u201d necessarily excludes other instructional programs from that phrase. <em>See NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 137 S.Ct. 929, 940, 197 L.Ed.2d 263 (2017) (explaining <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d </em>canon, which suggests that expression of one or several items in enumerated list signals intent to \u201cexclude[ ] another left unmentioned.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">As a preliminary matter, \u201c[o]ther educational institution\u201d is the third and final category listed in the definition of an \u201ceducational establishment,\u201d with the prior two being elementary or secondary school systems and institutions of higher learning. Where such a series of specifically defined disjunctive terms ends with a generalized \u201cother\u201d category, that can indicate that the ultimate term is a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision. <em>See, e.g., T.M. ex rel. A.M. v. Cornwall Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>752 F.3d 145, 164 (2d Cir. 2014) (so concluding as to phrase \u201cor other removal of children\u201d in least-restrictive-environment provision of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act); <em>City of New York v. Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, </em>618 F.3d 172, 183 (2d Cir. 2010) (concluding that \u201cother benefits\u201d term in definition of benefits under Foreign Missions Act not limited by preceding specific terms that were merely \u201cillustrative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">That \u00a7 541.204(b) <em>is </em>such a catchall provision is evident from its text, which does not state what an \u201cother educational institution\u201d is, or is limited to, but only what the term <em>\u201cincludes.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b) (emphasis added). As we have already observed, the use of that word generally indicates a partial list. <em>See supra </em>Part II.C.1. Thus, \u201c[t]he word \u2018include\u2019 ... generally signals that entities not specifically enumerated are not excluded.\u201d 2A N. Singer <em>&amp; </em>S. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47:25, at 444 (7th rev. ed. 2014); <em>see Environmen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>tal Encapsulating Corp. v. City of New York, </em>855 F.2d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 1988) (\u201cWe are reluctant to read the term \u2018includes\u2019 as meaning \u2018is limited to.\u2019 \u201d). The <em>expressio unius </em>canon warrants no different conclusion because it requires \u201cidentifying a series of two or more terms or things that should be understood <em>to go hand in hand, </em>which is abridged in circumstances supporting a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, </em>536 U.S. 73, 81, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 153 L.Ed.2d 82 (2002) (emphasis added). That is not so here because special schools for the disabled or gifted are not so closely related to post-secondary career programs as to admit the necessary inference that all other instructional programs were deliberately excluded from the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">2. Neither Certificates Held by Teachers nor Earned by Students Are Necessary for the Zoni Centers To Qualify as \u201cOther Educational Institution[s]\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Plaintiffs argue that, even if the institutions specifically enumerated in \u00a7 541.204(b) are not exclusive, defendant Zoni Centers do not qualify as \u201cother educational institutionfs]\u201d because their instructors do not possess, and their students do not earn, certificates akin to their primary school, secondary school, or college counterparts. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that Zoni completion certificates are not required for a career; Zoni teachers need not themselves possess teaching certificates, or even major in a field related to English language instruction; and some Zoni teachers may, in fact, lack the baccalaureate degrees required by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">These arguments fail because plaintiffs point to nothing in the statute or its implementing regulations indicating that an \u201ceducational establishment\u201d must (1) require instructors to hold teaching certificates or (2) award students certificates necessary for employment or educational opportunities. The need for the latter certificate is belied by DOL\u2019s inclusion in a non-exhaustive list of \u201c[ejxempt teachers\u201d persons teaching nursery school, home economics, and vocal or instrumental music\u2014areas where a certificate of course completion would not be a necessary prerequisite for employment or academic advancement. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(b). Even if facility with English is not a prerequisite for particular jobs, plaintiffs cannot dispute that English fluency is a gateway for many more employment opportunities in the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jennifer Cheeseman Day &amp; Hyon B. Shin, U.S. Census Bureau, <em>How Does Ability To Speak English Affect Earnings? </em>6-8, http://www. census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/data/ acs/PAA_2005_AbilityandEarnings.pdf (conducting study using 2000 Census data and concluding that greater English-language proficiency correlated with higher earnings in United States labor market). As for teacher certification, while \u201can elementary or secondary [school] teacher\u2019s certificate [is] a clear means of identifying the individuals contemplated as being within the scope of the exemption for teaching professionals,\u201d \u00a7 541.303(c), the same regulation observes that \u201ca teacher\u2019s certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions of higher education or other educational establishments,\u201d and that \u201ca teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption,\u201d <em>id. </em>DOL opinion letters make equally plain that \u201cthere is no minimum educational or academic degree requirement for bona fide teaching professionals in educational institutions.\u201d Opinion Letter, 2008 WL 4906281 (Sept. 26, 2008); <em>see </em>Opinion Letter, 2008 WL 4906284 (Oct. 1, 2008) (\u201c[U]nlike the learned professional exemption, there is no requirement that exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>teachers possess an advanced degree in a field of science or learning.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(stating that cosmetology instructors are exempt teachers notwithstanding that they \u201cdo not possess teaching certificates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">3. Further Discovery Was Not Required</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Finally, plaintiffs submit that dismissal was premature insofar as the Zoni Centers and/or certain of its teacher-employees may not be in full compliance with their licensure and accreditation requirements. We are not persuaded because that factual question does not bear on the legal issue of whether the Zoni Centers are the type of institution DOL regulations deem \u201ceducational.\u201d DOL\u2019s regulations speak only of whether the establishment has received licensure or accreditation, not whether it is actually compliant therewith. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">E. Other Factors Bearing on Defendants\u2019 Educational Status</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In identifying the Zoni Centers here as educational establishments, whose teachers are bona fide professionals exempt from FLSA minimum wage and overtime requirements, we do not conclude that the factors that decide this case are the only ones relevant to determining whether an establishment is \u201ceducational\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b), or whether an employee is a \u201cteacher,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 541.303(a)-(b). Specifically, we do not disapprove consideration of any other factors relied on by the district court. We hold only that consideration of ah eight factors identified by the district court is not compelled in every case by the plain language of the relevant regulations. Where, as here, there is no dispute that the plaintiffs are teachers employed by defendants \u201cwith a primary duty of teaching\u201d in order to \u201cimpart\u00ed ] knowledge,\u201d the pleadings themselves established that plaintiffs \u201cengaged in this activity as ... teacher[s] in an educational establishment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 541.303(a), <em>ie., </em>an establishment whose primary purpose was to convey knowledge. Other evidence, subject to judicial notice in this case, such as defendants\u2019 state licensure and national accreditation, and state requirements for professionals teaching English as a second language, only reinforces that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that because the FLSA bona fide professional exemption applies here, plaintiffs cannot state plausible FLSA claims for minimum wage and overtime payments. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">1. Defendants\u2019 language-instruction facilities are \u201cother educational insti-tutionfs]\u201d under 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b) because plaintiffs\u2019 complaint demonstrates that their primary purpose is to impart knowledge, specifically, knowledge of the English language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">2. This status is further supported by defendants\u2019 possession of state licen-sure and recognized national accreditation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">3. These conclusions, considered together, plainly establish defendants\u2019 entitlement to the FLSA\u2019s bona fide professional exemption applicable to teachers, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.303(a), and prevent plaintiffs from pleading plausible minimum wage and overtime claims. Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed these federal claims with prejudice and related state-law claims without prejudice to refiling in state court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The challenged district court judgment is, therefore, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-12\">. Upon dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 federal claims on the merits, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims and, instead, dismissed these claims without prejudice to refiling in state court. <em>See Fernandez v. Zoni Language Ctrs., Inc., </em>2016 WL 2903274, at *12-13. Because plaintiffs raised no challenge to that decision but, rather, urged it, <em>see </em>Pl's Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 16 n.3, <em>Fernandez v. Zoni Language Ctrs., Inc., </em>No. 15-cv-6066, (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2015), ECF No. 21 (\"Plaintiffs acknowledge that if the Court dismisses Plaintiffs['] federal claims, the Court should decline to continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims of the Complaint.\u201d), we affirm this part of the judgment without further discussion, <em>see Indiana Pub. Ret. Sys. v. SAIC, Inc., </em>818 F.3d 85, 93 (2d Cir. 2016) (declining to consider any challenge to dismissal of claims where \"affirmatively waived\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\">. Various allegations in the complaint can be summarized as asserting that plaintiffs on average were paid for approximately between 25 and 35 hours of in-class time each week, but that they spent on average between 8 and 10 uncompensated hours per week preparing for class. Thus, the complaint asserts that something on the order of 15-30% of plaintiffs\u2019 work time was uncompensated, depending on the plaintiff and the particular week (since plaintiffs\u2019 hours varied depending on the curriculum and exam schedules).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\">.

Training &amp; Apprenticeship Fund, </em>No. 11-cv-3653, 2012 WL 4838880, at *4-6 (D. Minn. Oct. 11, 2012), as well as the applicable DOL regulation, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.204(b), the district court identified the following eight factors as relevant to determining whether a facility qualifies as an \"other educational institution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-15\">(1) the title of employees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>(2) the certifications required of [employees];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">(3) the formality of courses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">(4) the granting of certificates or degrees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-14\">(5) the [institution\u2019s] charter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-15\">(6) the [employees\u2019] involvement in organizing, communicating and delivering curriculum;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-16\">(7) whether the [institution] is licensed by a state agency responsible for the state\u2019s educational system; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-17\">(8) whether the [institution] is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-20\">App\u2019x 91-92; <em>see Fernandez v. Zoni Language Ctrs., Inc., </em>2016 WL 2903274, at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">While we agree that these factors can be helpful in identifying an \u201cother educational institution\u2019\u2019 that may qualify under the bona fide professional exemption applicable to teachers, we do not adopt these factors as a formal test determinative in every case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-22\">.
