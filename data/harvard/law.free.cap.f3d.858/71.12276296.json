LYNCH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Defendant Ross William Ulbricht appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence to life imprisonment entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Katherine B. Forrest, /.). A jury convicted Ulbricht of drug trafficking and other crimes asso-dated with his creation and operation of Silk Road, an online marketplace whose users primarily purchased and sold illegal goods and services. He challenges several aspects of his conviction and sentence, arguing that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence assertedly obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) the district court committed numerous errors that deprived him of his right to a fair trial, and incorrectly denied his motion for a new trial; and (3) his life sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Because we identify no reversible error, we AFFIRM Ulbricht\u2019s conviction and sentence in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">In February 2015, a jury convicted Ross William Ulbricht on seven counts arising from his creation and operation of Silk Road under the username Dread Pirate Roberts (\u201cDPR\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Silk Road was a massive, anonymous criminal marketplace that operated using the Tor Network, which renders Internet traffic through the Tor browser extremely difficult to trace.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Silk Road users principally bought and sold drugs, false identification documents, and computer hacking software. Transactions on Silk Road exclusively used Bitcoins, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>anonymous but traceable digital currency.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The site also contained a private message system, which allowed users to send messages to each other (similar to communicating via email), a public forum to discuss topics related to Silk Road, and a \u201cwiki,\u201d which is like an encyclopedia that users could access to receive advice about using the site. Silk Road customers and vendors could also access a support section of the website to seek help from the marketplace\u2019s administrators when an issue arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">According to the government, between 2011 and 2013, thousands of vendors used Silk Road to sell approximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs, as well as other goods and services. Ulbricht, acting as DPR, earned millions of dollars in profits from the commissions collected by Silk Road on purchases. In October 2013, the government arrested Ulbricht, seized the Silk Road servers, and shut down the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I. Silk Road Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">After Ulbricht created Silk Road in 2011, the site attracted the interest of at least two separate divisions of the Department of Justice:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the United States Attorney\u2019s Offices for the District of Maryland and for the Southern District of New York. Throughout the investigations, law enforcement agents knew that the person using Dread Pirate Roberts as his or her Silk Road username had created and managed the site, but they did not know DPR\u2019s actual identity. In 2012 and 2013, agents from both offices investigated several individuals who the government suspected were operating Silk Road as DPR. Those individuals included Ulbricht, Anand Atha-vale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, the New York office identified Ulbricht as DPR, but the Maryland office had investigated and later abandoned the theory that either Athavale or Karpeles might have been Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Two aspects of the pre-arrest investigation into Ulbricht are particularly relevant to this appeal: (1) the pen/trap orders that the government obtained to monitor Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address traffic to and from various devices associated with Ul-bricht; and (2) the corrupt behavior of two Baltimore agents who worked on the Silk Road investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">A. The Pen/Trap Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">In September 2013, after Ulbricht became a primary suspect in the DPR investigation, the government obtained five \u201cpen/trap\u201d orders. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3121-27 (\u201cPen/Trap Act\u201d). The orders authorized law enforcement agents to collect IP address data for Internet traffic to and from Ulbricht\u2019s home wireless router and other devices that regularly connected to Ulbricht\u2019s home router. According to the government\u2019s applications for the pen register and trap and trace device, \u201c[ejvery device on the Internet is identified by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>unique number\u201d called an IP address. S.A. 73.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThis number is used to route information between devices, for example, between two computers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73-74. In other words, an \u201cIP address is analogous to a telephone number\u201d because \u201cit indicates the online identity of the communicating device without revealing the communication\u2019s content.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. Ulbricht does not dispute that description of how IP addresses function.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The pen/trap orders thus did not permit the government to access the content of Ulbricht\u2019s communications, nor did the government \u201cseek to obtain[ ] the contents of any communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. According to Ulbricht, the government\u2019s use of his home Internet routing data violated the Fourth Amendment because it helped the government match Ulbricht\u2019s online activity with DPR\u2019s use of Silk Road. Ul-bricht argues that he has a constitutional privacy interest in IP address traffic to and from his home and that the government obtained the pen/trap orders without a warrant, which would have required probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">B. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">One of the many other tactics that the government used to expose DPR\u2019s identity was to find low-level Silk Road administrators who helped DPR maintain the site, obtain their cooperation, take over their Silk Road usernames, and chat with DPR under those identities. The true owners of the administrator accounts would assist in the investigation by helping the government chat with DPR and access various aspects of the site. Government agents would also create their own new user-names and pose as drug dealers or buyers to purchase or sell narcotics and occasionally contact DPR directly. One of the government\u2019s principal trial witnesses, Special Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, used the former technique to chat with DPR under the name Cirrus. Cirrus had been a member of the Silk Road support staff before the government took over his account, and Der-Yeghiayan frequently used Silk Road\u2019s messaging system to communicate with DPR and other administrators as Cirrus. Cirrus also gave the government access to the staff chat, a separate program allowing DPR to communicate only with his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Two undercover agents involved in the Silk Road investigation are of particular import to this appeal: Secret Service Special Agent Shaun Bridges and Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) Special Agent Carl Force, both of whom were assigned to the Baltimore investigation. Both Force and Bridges used their undercover access to exploit the site for their own benefit in various ways, and they eventually pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with their work on the Silk Road investigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">For example, Force and Bridges took over an administrator account belonging to Curtis Green, who worked for Silk Road under the name Flush. According to the criminal complaint against Force and Bridges, in January 2013, Bridges used the Flush username to change other users\u2019 passwords, empty their Bitcoin wallets,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>and keep $350,000 in Bitcoins in offshore bank accounts, all while attempting to hide his activity through a series of transactions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the complaint against Force and Bridges alleges that Bridges \u201cact[ed] as an administrator to reset pins and passwords on various Silk Road vendors\u2019 accounts,\u201d then exchanged the Bit-coins for U.S. dollars using the Mt. Gox exchanger.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Supp. App\u2019x 180. Shortly after he committed the January 2013 thefts, Bridges asked' Force to chat with DPR as Nob, Force\u2019s authorized undercover user-name, to get advice about how to liquidate Bitcoins. He also sought Force\u2019s help in convincing Curtis Green (formerly Flush) to help him transfer Bitcoins to other accounts, and he ultimately tried to blame Green for the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">With the government\u2019s approval, Force also posed as a drug dealer and communicated with DPR as Nob. As part of his official undercover work as Nob, Force agreed to sell fraudulent identification documents to DPR for $40,000 in Bitcoins. According to the criminal complaint against the agents, Force kept the Bitcoins received by his Nob account in connection with that transaction for his personal use. On another occasion, again as part of his authorized undercover work, Force advised DPR that he had access to information about Silk Road from an invented corrupt government employee. DPR paid Force $50,000 in Bitcoins for purported inside law enforcement information; Force allegedly purloined that payment as well. Moreover, outside his authorized undercover work, Force operated another account under the name French Maid, through which he again offered to sell DPR information about the government\u2019s Silk Road investigation. Acting as French Maid, Force received about $100,000 in Bitcoins that he kept for his personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Force created yet another unauthorized Silk Road account, under the name Death-FromAbove, which was unknown to law enforcement until the defense identified it during trial..Force used the DeathFromA-bove account to try to extort money from DPR. For example, in one such chat that took place on April 16, 2013, DeathFromA-bove told DPR that he knew that DPR\u2019s true identity was Anand Athavale. Death-FromAbove demanded a payment of $250,000 in exchange for which DeathFro-mAbove would remain silent about DPR\u2019s identity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no evidence that DPR made the requested payment to DeathFro-mAbove; indeed, DPR shrugged off the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>attempted blackmail as \u201cbogus.\u201d App\u2019x 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">As will be explained in more detail below, the district court prevented Ulbricht from introducing evidence at trial related to Force\u2019s corruption because doing so would have exposed the ongoing grand jury investigation into Force\u2019s conduct. The district court also denied Ulbricht discovery related to the investigation and excluded certain hearsay statements that arguably revealed Force\u2019s corruption. Ul-bricht contends on appeal that the district court\u2019s various rulings concerning evidence related to Force deprived him of a fair trial. Additionally, Ulbricht did not learn of Bridges\u2019s corrupt conduct until after trial when the criminal complaint against both agents was unsealed. Thus, in his motion for a new trial, he argued that the belated disclosure violated his due process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court incorrectly denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">II. Ulbricht\u2019s Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Ulbricht was arrested in a San Francisco public library on October 1, 2013, after the government had amassed significant evidence identifying him as Dread Pirate Roberts. The arrest was successfully orchestrated to catch Ulbricht in the act of administering Silk Road as DPR. Federal agents observed Ulbricht enter the public library, and a few minutes later Dread Pirate Roberts came online in the Silk Road staff chat. Der-Yeghiayan, under the undercover administrator username Cirrus, initiated a chat with DPR, asking him to go to a specific place on the Silk Road site to address some flagged messages from users. Der-Yeghiayan reasoned that this would \u201cforce [Ulbricht] to log in under ... his Dread Pirate Roberts account\u201d in the Silk Road marketplace, as well as in the staff chat software. Tr. 331-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Once Der-Yeghiayan knew that DPR had logged onto the flagged message page in the marketplace, he signaled another agent to effect the arrest. Ulbricht was arrested, and incident to that arrest agents seized his laptop. The same chat that Der-Yeghiayan had initiated with Dread Pirate Roberts a few minutes earlier was open on Ulbricht\u2019s screen. Ulbricht also visited the flagged post in the marketplace that Der-Yeghiayan (as Cirrus) had asked DPR to look at during their chat. While he was chatting with Cirrus, moreover, Ulbricht had accessed Silk Road by using the \u201cMastermind\u201d page. That page was available only to Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">A great deal of the evidence against Ulbricht came from the government\u2019s search of his laptop and his home after the arrest. On the day of Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, the government obtained a warrant to seize Ulbricht\u2019s laptop and search it for a wide variety of information related to Silk Road and information that would identify Ul-bricht as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht moved to suppress the large quantity of evidence obtained from his laptop, challenging the constitutionality of that search warrant. Ulbricht argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. More details concerning the search warrant will be described in context below.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">III. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Ulbricht\u2019s trial lasted approximately three weeks, from January 13 through February 4, 2015. Judge Forrest handled the complex and contentious trial with commendable patience and skill. Although Ulbricht does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on any of the counts of conviction, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>summarize the evidence presented at trial as context for the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">A. The Government\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The government presented overwhelming evidence that Ulbricht created Silk Road in 2011 and continued to operate the site throughout its lifetime by maintaining its computer infrastructure, interacting with vendors, crafting policies for site users, deciding what products would be available for sale on the site, and managing a small staff of administrators and software engineers. Defense counsel conceded in his opening statement that Ul-bricht did in fact create Silk Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">According to Ulbricht\u2019s own words in a 2009 email, Ulbricht originally conceived of Silk Road as \u201can online storefront that couldn\u2019t be traced back to [him] ... where [his] customers could buy [his] products\u201d and pay for them \u201canonymously and securely.\u201d Tr. 991. From 2009 through 2011, Ulbricht worked to get the site up and running, relying on computer programming assistance from others, including his friend Richard Bates. According to one of the journal entries discovered on his laptop, in 2010 Ulbricht began to grow hallucinogenic mushrooms to sell on the site \u201cfor cheap to get people interested.\u201d Tr. 899. As the site began to garner significant interest in 2011, Ulbricht wrote in his journal that he was \u201ccreating a year of prosperity and power beyond what I have ever experienced before. Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one person will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator.\u201d Tr. 899-900.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">1. Evidence Linking Ulbricht to Dread Pirate Roberts</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">Around January 2012, the Silk Road user who represented himself as the lead administrator of the site adopted the user-name Dread Pirate Roberts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The name alludes to the pseudonym of a pirate in the popular novel and film <em>The Princess Bride </em>that is periodically passed on from one individual to another.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In order to assure users that posts purporting to be authored by DPR were indeed his own, DPR authenticated his posts using an electronic signature known as a PGP key.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Silk Road users had access to a public PGP key, and DPR had a private PGP key that he alone could use to sign his Silk Road posts. When DPR signed a post using his private key, Silk Road users could run the code in the public key, and if the post was signed with the correct private key the user would receive a message that the authentication was successful. The government recovered DPR\u2019s private PGP key on Ul-bricht\u2019s laptop. Importantly, the public PGP key did not change during the site\u2019s life span, meaning that DPR used the same private key to sign his posts throughout the time that he administered Silk Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Additional evidence supported the conclusion that Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts. For example, the instructions that DPR provided to Cirrus (the account that Der-Yeghiayan later used for undercover work) for how to access the staff chat and contact DPR directly were found in a file on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop. The government also discovered the following evidence, covering the entire period during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>which DPR managed the Silk Road site, on Ulbricht\u2019s computer: thousands of pages of chat logs with Silk Road employees; detailed journal entries describing Ulbricht\u2019s ownership of the site; a list that tracked Ulbricht\u2019s tasks and ideas related to Silk Road; a copy of Silk Road\u2019s database; and spreadsheets cataloguing both the servers that hosted Silk Road and expenses and profits associated with the site. The government seized approximately $18 million worth of Bitcoins from the wallet on Ul-bricht\u2019s laptop and analyzed their transaction history (through blockchain records) to determine that about 89% of the Bit-coins on Ulbricht\u2019s computer came from Silk Road servers located in Iceland.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">A search of Ulbricht\u2019s home yielded additional evidence linking him with the site. That evidence included two USB hard drives with versions of documents related to Silk Road that were also stored on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop. There were also handwritten notes crumpled in Ulbricht\u2019s bedroom trash can about ideas for improving Silk Road\u2019s vendor rating system\u2014an initiative that Dread Pirate Roberts had just revealed through a post in a discussion forum on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The government also introduced other circumstantial evidence connecting Ul-bricht to DPR\u2019s activity on Silk Road, such as evidence matching Ulbricht\u2019s actual travel history with' DPR\u2019s online discussion of his travel plans. As one concrete example, the government discovered a Tor Chat log<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop memorializing DPR\u2019s chat with a user named H7. On October 30, 2011, DPR told H7 that he would be traveling soon. On Ulbricht\u2019s Gmail account, which uses an email address that incorporates his full name, the government discovered a travel itinerary from CheapAir that indicated that Ulbricht would be traveling on November 15, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The government introduced several additional examples of DPR discussing travel plans that matched up with travel disclosed in Ulbricht\u2019s email and social media activity. At one point, for example, Ul-bricht uploaded photos to his Facebook account in an album entitled \u201cThailand, February 2012.\u201d DPR discussed going to Thailand in a Tor chat on January 27, 2012, indicating that he was in \u201cThailand now,\u201d attracted by the \u201callure of a warm beach.\u201d Tr. 1300. He also mentioned in a January 26 chat with a user named \u201cvj,\u201d which stood for Variety Jones, that he was in Thailand to experience the \u201cbeaches and jungles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298. One of the photos in the Thailand Facebook album depicted Ul-bricht \u201cin front of what appears to be jungles and beaches,\u201d both of which were referenced in DPR\u2019s chats from late January. <em>Id. </em>at 1301,</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">2. Murders Commissioned by Dread Pirate Roberts</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">The government also presented evidence that DPR commissioned the murders of five-people to protect Silk Road\u2019s anonymity, although there is no evidence that any of the murders actually occurred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>March 2013, a Silk Road vendor whose username was FriendlyChemist threatened to release \u201cthousands of usernames, ordr [sic] amounts, [and] addresses\u201d of Silk Road customers and vendors if DPR did not ensure that FriendlyChemist received money from another person, Lucy-drop. Tr. 1806. Releasing the information would have destroyed the affected users\u2019 anonymity, undermining the security of the site. In a later chat with another person, RealLucyDrop, DPR wrote that it would be \u201cterrible\u201d if the personal information were to be released, and thus he needed FriendlyChemist\u2019s \u201creal world identity so I can threaten him with violence if he were to release any names.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1811.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The episode escalated from there. DPR connected with Redandwhite, who was FriendlyChemist\u2019s supplier, and wrote that \u201cFriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1822. After negotiating the logistical details of the murder, Ulbricht agreed to pay Redandwhite $150,000 in Bitcoins to kill FriendlyChemist. DPR paid Redandwhite, who later confirmed that he had received the payment and carried out the murder, and sent what appeared to be a photo of the dead victim to DPR. DPR replied that he had \u201creceived the picture and deleted it,\u201d and thanked Redandwhite for his \u201cswift action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1892. Around the same time, Ulbricht recorded in a file on his laptop that he \u201c[g]ot word that the blackmailer was executed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1887. The government was not able to develop any evidence linking these conversations to an actual murder. A reasonable jury could easily conclude, however, that the evidence demonstrated that Ulbricht ordered and paid for the killing, and that he believed that it had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Later, DPR ordered four other murders through Redandwhite. Dread Pirate Roberts identified another Silk Road user, Tony76, who knew FriendlyChemist and might compromise the site\u2019s anonymity. After some negotiations, DPR agreed to pay Redandwhite $500,000 in Bitcoins to kill Tony76 and three of his associates. DPR then sent the payment to Redand-white. On April 6, 2013, Ulbricht wrote in a file on his laptop that he \u201c[g]ave angels go ahead to find tony76.\u201d Tr. 1900. Two days later, Ulbricht recorded that he \u201c[s]ent payment to angels for hit on tony76 and his three associates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the government\u2019s expert witnesses was able to link the payments for all five murders to Bitcoin wallets located on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop. Again, while the evidence demonstrates that Ulbricht ordered and paid substantial sums for the murders, there is no evidence that the killings actually took place; the government theorized that Re-dandwhite had tricked Ulbricht into thinking that he actually committed the murders, but that in fact he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">B. The Defense Case</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">As noted above, Ulbricht conceded at trial that he had created' Silk Road, and he was caught red-handed operating the site at the end of the investigation. His principal defense strategy at trial\u2014more of an effort at mitigation than outright denial of his guilt of the conspiracy and other charges in the indictment\u2014was to admit his role at the beginning and end of the site\u2019s operation, but to contend that he sold Silk Road to someone else in 2011 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>abandoned his role as its administrator, only to be lured back by the successor DPR near the end of its operation to take the blame for operating the site. The defense attempted on several occasions to implicate as alternative suspects Karpeles and Athavale, both of whom the government had investigated for a possible connection to Silk Road but later abandoned as candidates for DPR\u2019s real-world identity. As part of his alternative-perpetrator defense, Ulbricht theorized that the person or persons who operated as the true Dread Pirate Roberts during the purported interim period planted incriminating evidence on his laptop in order to frame him. For the most part, the defense advanced this theory through cross-examination of government witnesses. Ulbricht did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">One point in the testimony of Richard Bates exemplifies the defense\u2019s approach and the government\u2019s response. Bates, Ul-bricht\u2019s friend who assisted with computer programming issues when Ulbricht launched Silk Road, testified for the government. According to Bates, Ulbricht told him in November 2011 that he had sold Silk Road to someone else, a claim that Bates believed at the time to be true. Moreover, in a February 2013 Google chat between Bates and Ulbricht, Ulbricht wrote that he was \u201c[g]lad\u201d that Silk Road was \u201cnot [his] problem anymore.\u201d Tr. 1140-41.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Bates understood that to mean that Ulbricht no longer worked on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">To mitigate any damage from Bates\u2019s testimony, the government introduced a December 9, 2011 Tor chat between Ul-bricht and vj. In that chat, vj asked Ul-bricht whether anyone else knew about his involvement in Silk Road. Ulbricht responded: \u201c[U]nfortunately yes. There are two, but they think I sold the site and got out and they are quite convinced of it.\u201d Tr. 1191. He further wrote that those two people thought he sold the site \u201cabout a month ago,\u201d <em>id., </em>which roughly corresponds to the November 2011 conversation between Bates and Ulbricht. Significantly, it was shortly after this conversation that vj suggested that Ulbricht change his online identity to DPR. In view of the fictional character it referenced, the government contended that the online moniker DPR was deliberately adopted to support the cover story that the lead administrator of Silk Road changed over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">Thus, although the government elicited testimony that Ulbricht told Bates that he sold the site in 2011, it also presented evidence that Ulbricht had lied to Bates about that sale and continued to operate the site in secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">1. Cross-Examination of Government Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Ulbricht\u2019s defense depended heavily on cross-examination of government witnesses, much of which was designed to support the argument that either Karpeles or Athavale was the real DPR, or that multiple people operated as Dread Pirate Roberts during Silk Road\u2019s life span. The district court limited his cross-examination in two ways that Ulbricht challenges on appeal. First, the district court prevented Ulbricht from exploring several specific topics with Der-Yeghiayan, the government\u2019s first witness, through whom it introduced much of its evidence. Those topics included, <em>inter alia, </em>Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s prior suspicions that Karpeles was DPR. Second, the district court limited Ul-bricht\u2019s ability to cross examine FBI computer scientist Thomas Kiernan, who testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>fied about evidence that he discovered on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop, concerning several specific technical issues related to software on Ulbricht\u2019s computer. More details about those attempted cross-examinations will be discussed in context below.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">2. Hearsay Statements</p>\n<p id=\"ACs\">Ulbricht also attempted to introduce two hearsay statements in his defense, both of which the district court excluded as inadmissible. Those hearsay statements comprise: (1) chats between DPR and DeathFromAbove (Force) .concerning Force\u2019s attempt to extort money from DPR in exchange for information about the government\u2019s investigation of Silk Road; and (2) the government\u2019s letter describing a statement by Andrew Jones, a site administrator, concerning one particular conversation that he had with DPR. The contents of those hearsay statements and other relevant facts will be discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">3. Defense Expert Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"AF4\">Long after the trial began on January 13, 2015, and shortly before the government rested on February 2 and the defense rested on February 3, Ulbricht disclosed to the government his intent to call two expert witnesses: Dr. Steven Bellovin and Andreas Antonopoulos.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Antono-poulos disclosure indicated that he would testify on several subjects relevant to Silk Road, including \u201cthe origins of Bitcoin,\u201d \u201cthe various purposes and uses of Bitcoin,\u201d \u201cthe mechanics of Bitcoin transactions,\u201d \u201cthe value of Bitcoin over time since its inception,\u201d and \u201cthe concepts of Bitcoin speculating and Bitcoin mining,\u201d among other things. App\u2019x 349. The Bellovin disclosure followed a similar pattern, indicating that he would testify about \u201c[gjeneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,\u201d the \u201cimport of some lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in discovery,\u201d and \u201c[gjeneral principles of public-key cryptography,\u201d among other topics. <em>Id. </em>at 360. Neither disclosure summarized the opinions that the experts would offer on those subjects, nor did either identify the bases for the experts\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">On January 29 and 31, the government moved to preclude the testimony of both proffered experts. The government argued that the expert notices were untimely and did not contain the information required by Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including a summary of the opinions that the experts would offer on the stand.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On February 1\u2014three days before the end of the trial\u2014the district court granted the government\u2019s motions and precluded both experts from testifying, concluding that the defendant\u2019s notices were late and that the disclosures were substantively inadequate under Rule 16. Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in precluding his experts from testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">In sum, the defense case was limited to cross-examining government witnesses, briefly calling four character witnesses, having a defense investigator authenticate a task list on Ulbricht\u2019s computer, and reading a few of DPR\u2019s posts into the record. Ulbricht contends, however, that his defense was hamstrung by the rulings described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">C. The Verdict and Post-Trial Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">After deliberating for about three and a half hours, the jury returned a guilty ver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>diet on all seven counts in the Indictment. As described in more detail below, Ul-bricht then moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P. The district court denied the motion, and Ulbricht argues here that it erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">IV. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The United States Probation Office prepared the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in March 2015. It described the offense conduct in detail and discussed the five murders that Ulbricht allegedly hired Redandwhite to commit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Over Ul-bricht\u2019s objection, the PSR also discussed six drug-related deaths that the government contended, and the district court found, were connected with Silk Road. Circumstantial evidence linked each of those fatalities with varying degrees of certainty to the decedent\u2019s purchase of drugs on Silk Road. For example, one user died from an overdose of heroin combined with other drugs. The deceased individual was found with a needle and a bag of heroin, as well as a torn-open delivery package. Open on his computer was a Silk Road chat in which a vendor described the package of heroin that was due to arrive that day, including a tracking number that matched the opened package.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Two other individuals whose deaths the PSR described were Silk Road customers who purchased drugs on the site shortly before their deaths. A fourth person died after ingesting a synthetic drug originally purchased on Silk Road that he obtained through an intermediary dealer, and a fifth died after leaping from a balcony while high on a psychedelic drug that he bought from the site. A sixth person died of pneumonia after placing over thirty orders for heroin and other drugs on Silk Road; the autopsy report theorized that his drug use may have \u201cblunted the deceased\u2019s perception of the severity of his illness,\u201d thus contributing to his premature death. PSR \u00b6 83. In arguing that the district court should consider the six deaths, the government explained that they \u201cillustrate the obvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.\u201d App\u2019x 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">In the first of several sentencing submissions, Ulbricht urged the district court not to consider the six drug-related deaths and to strike them from the PSR. In support of that argument, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road had harm-reducing effects, meaning that it made drug use less dangerous. Specifically, Ulbricht employed Dr. Fernando Caudevilla (username Doctor X), a physician who provided drug-use advice to the site\u2019s customers. Caudevilla spent up to two or three hours a day on Silk Road discussion fora and sent over 450 messages providing guidance about illegal drug dosage and administration, as well as information about the harms associated with certain drugs. Caudevilla also provided weekly reports to DPR concerning the advice he gave to the site\u2019s users. Ulbricht further claimed that Silk Road allowed for better drug quality control because vendors were subject to a rating system,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> buyers were able to choose from among many different sellers, and the site\u2019s anonymity encouraged free dialogue about drug use that helped mitigate the stigma accompanying drug addiction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>to Caudevilla, when the site received negative feedback about the quality of the drugs sold by a vendor, that vendor was removed from the site. Finally, Ulbricht claimed that the site reduced violence associated with the drug trade by providing a safe, computer-based method of purchasing drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Ulbricht also submitted an expert report from Dr. Mark Taff, which provided an alternative reason for excluding the six deaths from the PSR. In his report, Dr. Taff explained that, based on the information available, it was impossible to know with medical certainty that Silk Road drugs caused the six deaths described in the PSR. There were \u201cgaping holes\u201d in the investigations into each death, and some were missing autopsy reports, toxicology reports, and death certificates. App\u2019x 911. Moreover, Dr. Taff claimed that it was impossible to know the cause of each death because several of the deceased had ingested multiple drugs prior to their deaths. Ulbricht argued that, absent a clear causal link between the deaths and the offense conduct, the deaths were not relevant to his sentencing at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The defense later submitted another sentencing memorandum, which included 97 letters from friends and family describing Ulbricht\u2019s good character as well as academic articles about the myriad problems associated with unduly severe sentences for drug crimes. He also urged the district court not to consider the five murders commissioned by DPR, in part because he claimed only to have fantasized about the murders, implying that he did not expect them to be carried out. In its sentencing submission, the government requested that the district court impose a sentence substantially above the twenty-year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing hearing took place on May 29, 2015.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The district court concluded that Ulbricht\u2019s offense level was 43\u2014the highest possible offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines\u2014and that his criminal history category was I.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The high offense level largely resulted from the massive quantity of drugs trafficked using Silk Road, as well as several enhancements, including one for directing the use of violence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Ul-bricht does not dispute that calculation. Due to the high offense level, the Guidelines advisory sentence \u201crange\u201d was life in prison, and the U.S. Probation Office recommended that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court resolved several disputed issues of fact. For example, because Ulbricht con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>tested his responsibility for the five commissioned murders for hire, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulbricht did in fact commission the murders, believing that they would be carried out. The district court characterized the evidence of the murders for hire, which included Ulbricht\u2019s journal, chats with other Silk Road users, and the evidence showing that Ulbricht actually paid a total of $650,000 in Bitcoins for the killings, as \u201cample and unambiguous.\u201d App\u2019x 1465.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The court then turned to the six drug-related deaths described in the PSR. Over Ulbricht\u2019s objection, the district court found that the deaths were \u201crelated conduct relevant to his sentencing\u201d because the \u201cquestion as to whether this information is properly included in the PSR is whether the Court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence[,] that the deaths, in some way, related to Silk Road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1472. It went on to explain that \u201cthe relevant offense committed is the unlawful distribution of drugs and the running of a criminal drug enterprise, ... [and] based on the evidence before the Court, the sale of the drugs through Silk Road caused harm to the decedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1473. The district court described the facts associated with five of the deaths and specifically found that each was connected to Silk Road, rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that but-for causation was required in order for the court to consider the deaths as relevant to the offense conduct.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Parents of two of the decedents also made statements at the proceeding, describing the emotional impact that the losses had on them and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In the course of explaining its reasons for choosing Ulbricht\u2019s sentence, the district court discussed the facts of Ul-bricht\u2019s offense, his apparent character, and the purposes of criminal punishment. The court described Doctor X as \u201cenabling,\u201d App\u2019x 1530, rather than reducing the harms associated with drug use, emphasized the social costs attendant to expanding the scope of the drug market, discussed the five murders for hire, and stated that the sentence imposed on Ul-bricht could have a powerful general deterrent effect because the case had attracted an unusually large amount of publicity. The court then sentenced Ul-bricht principally to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">On appeal, Ulbricht raises a number of claims of error. For purposes of organizational clarity, we group them into three categories, and present them in the order in which the issues arose in the district court. Accordingly, we discuss first Ul-bricht\u2019s claims that much of the evidence against him should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights; second, his arguments that the district court\u2019s evidentia-ry errors denied him a fair trial; and third, his objections to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">I. Fourth Amendment Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. On appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its resolution of questions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Bohannon, </em>824 F.3d 242, 247-48 (2d Cir. 2016). Ulbricht raises two principal arguments. First, he contends that the pen/trap orders that the government used to monitor IP address traffic to and from his home router violated the Fourth Amendment because the government obtained the orders without a warrant. Second, he claims that the warrants authorizing the government to search his laptop as well as his Google and Facebook accounts violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement. We reject those contentions and affirm the denial of Ulbricht\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A. Pen/Trap Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Pursuant to orders issued by United States magistrate judges in the Southern District of New York, the government used five pen registers and trap and trace devices to monitor IP addresses associated with Internet traffic to and from Ulbricht\u2019s wireless home router and devices that regularly connected to that router. The government obtained the orders pursuant to the Pen/Trap Act, which provides that a government attorney \u201cmay make [an] application for an order ... authorizing or approving the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device ... to a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d 18 U.S.G. \u00a7 3122(a)(1). A \u201cpen register\u201d is defined as a \u201cdevice or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or .facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted,\u201d and \u201cshall not include the contents of any communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3127(3). A \u201ctrap and trace\u201d device means \u201ca device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3127(4). Like pen registers, trap and trace devices may not capture the \u201ccontents of any communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute does not require a search warrant for the use of a pen register or trap and trace device, nor does it demand the kind of showing required to obtain such a warrant. Rather, the statute requires only that the application contain a \u201ccertification ... that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3122(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The orders in this case authorized the government to \u201cuse a pen register and trap and trace device to identify the source and destination [IP] addresses, along with the dates, times, durations, ports of transmission, and any Transmission Control Protocol (\u2018TCP\u2019) connection data,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> associated with any electronic communications sent to or from\u201d various devices, including Ulbricht\u2019s home wireless router and his laptop.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> S.A. 93. In each order, the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ernment specified that it did not seek to obtain the contents of any communications. Instead, it sought authorization to collect only \u201cdialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information\u201d that was akin to data captured by \u201ctraditional telephonic pen registers and trap and trace devices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130. Ulbricht claims that the pen/trap orders violated the Fourth Amendment because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the IP address routing information that the orders allowed the government to collect.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d The \u201ccornerstone of the modern law of searches is the principle that, to mount a successful Fourth Amendment challenge, a defendant must demonstrate that he personally has an expectation of privacy in the place searched.\u201d <em>United States v. Haqq, </em>278 F.3d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a \u201cFourth Amendment 'search[ ]\u2019 ... does not occur unless the search invades an object or area [in which] one has a subjective expectation of privacy that society is prepared to accept as objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>551 F.3d 138, 143 (2d Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The Supreme Court has long held that a \u201cperson has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties,\u201d including phone numbers dialed in making a telephone call and captured by a pen register. <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 743-44, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979). This is so because phone users \u201ctypically know that they must convey numerical information to the phone company; that the phone company has facilities for recording this information; and that the phone company does in fact record this information for a variety of legitimate business purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 99 S.Ct. 2577. Similarly, \u201ce-mail and Internet users ... rely on third-party equipment in order to engage in communication.\u201d <em>United States v. Forrester, </em>512 F.3d 500, 510 (9th Cir. 2008). Internet users thus \u201cshould know that this information is provided to and used by Internet service providers for the specific purpose of directing the routing of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cIP addresses are not merely passively conveyed through third party equipment, but rather are voluntarily turned over in order to direct the third party\u2019s servers.\u201d <em>United States v. Christie, </em>624 F.3d 558, 574 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">Ulbricht notes that questions have been raised about whether some aspects of modern technology, which entrust great quantities of significant personal information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>third party vendors, arguably making extensive government surveillance possible, call for a re-evaluation of the third-party disclosure doctrine established by <em>Smith. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, </em>565 U.S. 400, 417-18, 132 S.Ct. 945, 181 L.Ed.2d 911 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring); <em>American Civil Liberties Union v. Clapper, </em>785 F.3d 787, 824 (2d Cir. 2015). We remain bound, however, by that rule until and unless it is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Gomez, </em>580 F.3d 94, 104 (2d Cir. 2009); <em>see also United States v. Wheelock, </em>772 F.3d 825, 829 (8th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Moreover, whatever novel or more intrusive surveillance techniques might present future questions concerning the appropriate scope of the third-party disclosure doctrine, the orders in this case do not present such issues. The recording of IP address information and similar routing data, which reveal the existence of connections between communications devices without disclosing the content of the communications, are precisely analogous to the capture of telephone numbers at issue in <em>Smith. </em>That is why the orders here fit comfortably within the language of a statute drafted with the earlier technology in mind. The substitution of electronic methods of communication for telephone calls does not alone create a reasonable expectation of privacy in the identities of devices with whom one communicates. Nor does it raise novel issues distinct from those long since resolved in the context of telephone communication, with which society has lived for the nearly forty years since <em>Smith </em>was decided. Like telephone companies, Internet service providers require that identifying information be disclosed in order to make communication among electronic devices possible. In light of the <em>Smith </em>rule, no reasonable person could maintain a privacy interest in that sort of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We therefore join the other circuits that have considered this narrow question and hold that collecting IP address information devoid of content is \u201cconstitutionally indistinguishable from the use of a pen register.\u201d <em>Forrester, </em>512 F.3d at 510; <em>see, e.g., Wheelock, </em>772 F.3d at 828 (holding that the defendant \u201ccannot claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in [the] government\u2019s acquisition of his subscriber information, including his IP address and name,\u201d because it had been \u201crevealed to a third party\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Christie, </em>624 F.3d at 573 (holding that there is no expectation of privacy in \u201csubscriber information provided to an internet provider,\u201d such as an IP address (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Guest v. Leis, </em>255 F.3d 325, 336 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding that \u201ccomputer users do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their [bulletin board] subscriber information because they have conveyed it to another person\u201d); <em>United States v. Graham, </em>824 F.3d 421, 432 (4th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (noting that \u201cthird-party information relating to the sending and routing of electronic communications does not receive Fourth Amendment protection\u201d); <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>819 F.3d 880, 887 (6th Cir. 2016) (\u201c[C]ourts have not (yet, at least) extended [Fourth Amendment] protections to the internet analogue to envelope markings, namely the metadata used to route internet communications, like ... IP addresses.\u201d). Where, as here, the government did not access the contents of any of Ulbricht\u2019s communications, it did not need to obtain a warrant to collect IP address routing information in which Ul-bricht did not have a legitimate privacy interest. We therefore reject Ulbricht\u2019s contention that the issuance of such orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>violated his Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Ulbricht\u2019s additional arguments are not persuasive. Ulbricht contends generally that pen/trap orders may monitor a communication\u2019s content by tracking metadata, but he does not identify what metadata the government might have collected or explain how the pen/trap orders in this case gave the government information concerning the content of his communications. He also claims that the orders violated the Fourth Amendment by impermissibly monitoring activity within his home, relying on <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). In <em>Kyllo, </em>the Court held that using thermal-imaging technology from outside the home to discern whether a person was growing marijuana in the home might reveal innocent, non-criminal information in which a resident has a privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 121 S.Ct. 2038. Ulbricht contends that monitoring IP address traffic through his router is similar to the thermal-imaging technology because it might reveal when and how Ulbricht used his computer when he was at home. The same can be said, however, of an ordinary telephone pen register, which can reveal if, when, and how a person uses his or her home phone to make calls. <em>See, Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 743, 99 S.Ct. 2577. IP address traffic similarly reveals whether an Internet subscriber (or, more precisely, a person who uses the subscriber\u2019s Internet connection) is home and using the Internet. Nothing in <em>Kyllo </em>suggests that government monitoring of data disclosed to an outside telephone or Internet provider for ordinary business purposes becomes constitutionally suspect when investigators use that information to draw inferences about whether someone is making telephone calls or accessing websites from inside his or her home. We therefore see no constitutional difference between monitoring home phone dialing information and IP address routing data. Thus, we conclude that the pen register and trap and trace orders did not violate the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>B. Search Warrants</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Ulbrieht also contends that the warrants authorizing the search and seizure of his laptop as well as his Facebook and Google accounts violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement. The Fourth Amendment explicitly commands that warrants must be based on .probable cause and must \u201cparticularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. \u201cIt is familiar history that indiscriminate searches and. seizures conducted under the authority of \u2018general warrants\u2019 were the immediate evils that motivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 583, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). Those general warrants \u201cspecified only an offense,\u201d leaving \u201cto the discretion of the executing officials the decision as to which persons should be arrested and which places should be searched.\u201d <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 220, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981). The principal defect in such a warrant was that it permitted a \u201cgeneral, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings,\u201d <em>Andresen v. Maryland, </em>427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted), a problem that the Fourth Amendment attempted to resolve by requiring the warrant to \u201cset out with particularity\u201d the \u201cscope of the authorized search,\u201d <em>Kentucky v. King, </em>563 U.S. 452, 459, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">To be sufficiently particular under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant must satisfy three requirements. First, \u201ca warrant must identify the specific offense for which the police have established probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Galpin, </em>720 F.3d 436, 445 (2d Cir. 2013). Second, \u201ca warrant must describe the place to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445-46. Finally, the \u201cwarrant must specify the items to be seized by their relation to designated crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">\u201cWhere, as here, the property to be searched is a computer hard drive, the particularity requirement assumes even greater importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A general search of electronic data is an especially potent threat to privacy because hard drives and e-mail accounts may be \u201cakin to a residence in terms of the scope and quantity of private information [they] may contain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cseizure of a computer hard drive, and its subsequent retention by the government, can [therefore] give the government possession of a vast trove of personal information about the person to whom the drive belongs, much of which may be entirely irrelevant to the criminal investigation that led to the seizure.\u201d <em>United States v. Ganias, </em>824 F.3d 199, 217 (2d Cir. 2016) (en banc). Such sensitive records might include \u201c[t]ax records, diaries, personal photographs, electronic books, electronic media, medical data, records of internet searches, [and] banking and shopping information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218. Because of the nature of digital storage, it is not always feasible to \u201cextract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive data,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 213, creating a \u201cserious risk that every warrant for electronic information will become, in effect, a general warrant,\u201d <em>Galpin, </em>720 F.3d at 447 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we have held that warrants that fail to \u201clink [the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>sought] to the criminal activity supported by probable cause\u201d do not satisfy the particularity requirement because they \u201clack[ ] meaningful parameters on an otherwise limitless search\u201d of a defendant\u2019s electronic media. <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>626 F.3d 56, 62 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The Fourth Amendment does not require a perfect description of the data to be searched and seized, however. Search warrants covering digital data may contain \u201csome ambiguity ... so long as law enforcement agents have done the best that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, have acquired all the descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to cover, and have insured that all those facts were included in the warrant.\u201d <em>Galpin, </em>720 F.3d at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that a search warrant does not necessarily lack particularity simply because it is broad. Since a search of a computer is \u201cakin to [a search of] a residence,\u201d <em>id., </em>searches of computers may sometimes need to be as broad as searches of residences pursuant to warrants. Similarly, traditional searches for paper records, like searches for electronic records, have always entailed the exposure of records that are not the objects of the search to at least superficial examination in order to identify and seize those records that are. And in many cases, the volume of records properly subject to seizure because of their evidentiary value may be vast. None of these consequences necessarily turns a search warrant into a prohibited general warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">1. Laptop Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"A_l\">The warrant authorizing the search and seizure of Ulbricht\u2019s laptop (the \u201cLaptop Warrant\u201d) explicitly incorporated by reference an affidavit listing the crimes charged, which at the time included narcotics trafficking, computer hacking, money laundering, and murder-for-hire offenses in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030, 1956, and 1958. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. &amp; Related Properties, </em>830 F.3d 66, 101 (2d Cir. 2016) (describing the requirements for a criminal search warrant\u2019s incorporation of an affidavit by reference).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The affidavit also described the workings of Silk Road and the role of Dread Pirate Roberts in operating the site and included a wealth of information supporting a finding that there was probable cause to believe that Ulbricht and DPR were the same person. Based on that information, the Laptop Warrant alleged that Ulbricht \u201cuse[d] [the laptop] in connection with his operation of Silk Road,\u201d and that there was \u201cprobable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of the [charged offenses]\u201d would be found on the laptop. S.A. 246.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Generally speaking, the Laptop Warrant divided the information to be searched for and seized into two categories. The first covered evidence concerning Silk Road that was located on the computer, including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cdata associated with the Silk.Road website, such as web content, server code, or database records\u201d; any evidence concerning servers or computer equipment connected with Silk Road; emails, private messages, and forum postings or \u201cother communications concerning Silk Road in any way\u201d; evidence concerning \u201cfunds used to facilitate or proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>derived from Silk Road,\u201d including Bitcoin wallet files and transactions with Bitcoin exchangers, or \u201cinformation concerning any financial accounts ... where Silk Road funds may be stored\u201d; and \u201cany evidence concerning any illegal activity associated with Silk Road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The second category of information in the Laptop Warrant included \u201cevidence relevant to corroborating the identification of Ulbricht as the Silk Road user \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. In order to connect Ulbricht with DPR, the Laptop Warrant authorized agents to search for: \u201cany communications or writings by Ul-bricht, which may reflect linguistic patterns or idiosyncra[s]ies associated with \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts,\u2019 or political/economic views associated with [DPR] ... \u201d; \u201cany evidence concerning any computer equipment, software, or usernames used by Ulbricht, to allow comparison with\u201d computer equipment used by DPR; \u201cany evidence concerning Ulbricht\u2019s travel or patterns of movement, to allow comparison with patterns of online activity of [DPR] \u201d; \u201cany evidence concerning Ulbricht\u2019s technical expertise concerning Tor, Bitcoins,\u201d and other computer programming issues; any evidence concerning Ulbricht\u2019s attempts to \u201cobtain fake identification documents,\u201d use aliases, or otherwise evade law enforcement; and \u201cany other evidence implicating Ulbricht in the subject offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248-49 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">After careful consideration of the warrant, the supporting affidavit, and Ul-bricht\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the Laptop Warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We note, at the outset of our review, that the warrant plainly satisfies the basic elements of the particularity requirement as traditionally understood. By incorporating the affidavit by reference, the Laptop Warrant lists the charged crimes, describes the place to be searched, and designates the information to be seized in connection with the specified offenses.' Each category of information sought is relevant to Silk Road, DPR\u2019s operation thereof, or identifying Ulbricht as DPR. We do not understand Ulbricht\u2019s arguments to contest the Laptop Warrant\u2019s basic compliance with those requirements.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Rather, Ulbricht\u2019s arguments turn on the special problems associated with searches of computers which, as we have acknowledged in prior cases, <em>Galpin, </em>720 F.3d at 447; <em>Ganias, </em>824 F.3d at 217-18, can be particularly intrusive. These arguments merit careful attention. For example, Ulbricht questions the appropriateness of the protocols that the Laptop Warrant instructed officers to use in executing the search. Those procedures included opening or \u201ccursorily reading the first few\u201d pages of files to \u201cdetermine their precise contents,\u201d searching for deliberately hidden files, using \u201ckey word searches through all electronic storage areas,\u201d and reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>file \u201cdirectories\u201d to determine what was relevant. S.A. 253. Ulbrieht, supported by <em>amicus </em>the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (\u201cNACDL\u201d), argues that the warrant was insufficiently particular because the government and the magistrate judge failed to specify the search terms and protocols <em>ex ante </em>in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">We cannot agree. As illustrated by the facts of this very case, it will often be impossible to identify in advance the words or phrases that will separate relevant files or documents before the search takes place, because officers cannot readily anticipate how a suspect will store information related to the charged crimes. Files and documents can easily be given misleading or coded names, and words that might be expected to occur in pertinent documents can be encrypted; even very simple codes can defeat a pre-planned word search. For example, at least one of the folders on Ulbricht\u2019s computer had a name with the misspelling \u201caliaces.\u201d App\u2019x 309. For a more challenging example, Ul-bricht also kept records of certain Tor chats in a file on his laptop that was labeled \u201cmbsobzvkhwx4hmjt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The agents reasonably anticipated that they would face such problems in this case. Operating Silk Road involved using sophisticated technology to mask its users\u2019 identities. Accordingly, although we acknowledge the NACDL\u2019s suggestions in its <em>amicus </em>submission for limiting the scope of such search terms, the absence of the proposed limitations does not violate the particularity requirement on the facts of this ease. We therefore conclude that, in preparing the Laptop Warrant, \u201claw enforcement agents [did] the best that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, [had] acquired all the descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to cover, and [had] insured that all those facts were included in the warrant.\u201d <em>Galpin, </em>720 F.3d at 446 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The fundamental flaw in Ul-bricht\u2019s (and the NACDL\u2019s) argument is that it confuses a warrant\u2019s breadth with a lack of particularity. As noted above, breadth and particularity are related but distinct concepts. A warrant may be broad, in that it authorizes the government to search an identified location or object for a wide range of potentially relevant material, without violating the particularity requirement. For exampie, a warrant may allow the government to search a suspected drug dealer\u2019s entire home where there is probable cause to believe that evidence relevant to that activity may be found anywhere in the residence. Similarly, \u201c[w]hen the criminal activity pervades [an] entire business, seizure of all records of the business is appropriate, and broad language used in warrants will not offend the particularity requirements.\u201d <em>U.S. Postal Serv. v. C.E.C. Servs., </em>869 F.2d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 1989). Ulbrieht used his laptop to commit the charged offenses by creating and continuing to operate Silk Road. Thus, a broad warrant allowing the government to search his laptop for potentially extensive evidence of those crimes does not offend the Fourth Amendment, as long as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>warrant meets the three particularity criteria outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">It is also true that allowing law enforcement to search his writings for linguistic similarities with DPR authorizes a broad search of written materials on Ulbricht\u2019s hard drive. That fact, however, does not mean that the warrants violated the Fourth Amendment. The Laptop Warrant clearly explained that the government planned to compare Ulbricht\u2019s writings to DPR\u2019s posts to confirm that they were the same person, by identifying both linguistic patterns and distinctive shared political or economic views. Ulbricht and the NACDL similarly claim that searching for all evidence of his travel patterns and movement violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirement. Again, the warrant explained that it sought information about Ulbricht\u2019s travel \u201cto allow comparison with patterns of online activity of \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019 and any information known about his location at particular times.\u201d S.A. 248. Thus, the Laptop Warrant connects the information sought to the crimes charged and, more specifically, its relevance to identifying Ulbricht as the perpetrator of those crimes.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We remain sensitive to the difficulties associated with preserving a criminal defendant\u2019s privacy while searching through his electronic data and computer hard drives. In the course of searching for information related to Silk Road and DPR, the government may indeed have come across personal documents that were unrelated to Ulbricht\u2019s crimes. Such an invasion of a criminal defendant\u2019s privacy is inevitable, however, in almost any warranted search because in \u201csearches for papers, it is certain that some innocuous documents will be examined, at least cursorily, in order to determine whether they are, in fact, among those papers authorized to be seized.\u201d <em>Ganias, </em>824 F.3d at 211, quoting <em>Andresen, </em>427 U.S. at 482 n.11, 96 S.Ct. 2737. The Fourth Amendment limits such \u201cunwarranted intrusions upon privacy,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), by requiring a warrant to describe its scope with particularity. The Laptop Warrant satisfied that requirement. Ulbricht has challenged only the facial validity of the Laptop Warrant and not its execution. Because we have no reason to doubt that the officers faithfully executed the warrant, its execution did not result in an undue invasion of Ulbricht\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Finally, we note that the crimes charged in this case were somewhat unusual. This case does not involve a more typical situation in which officers searched for evidence of a physician\u2019s illegal distribution of pain medications, to use the NACDL\u2019s example, which may have electronically-stored data associated with the alleged crimes on a hard drive that largely contains non-criminal information. Here the crimes under investigation were committed largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>through computers that there was probable cause to believe included the laptop at issue, and the search warrant application gave ample basis for the issuing magistrate judge to conclude that evidence related to Silk Road and Ulbricht\u2019s use of the DPR username likely permeated Ul-bricht\u2019s computer. Thus, given the nature of Ulbricht\u2019s crimes and their symbiotic connection to his digital devices, we decline to rethink the well-settled Fourth Amendment principles that the Laptop Warrant may implicate. A future case may require this Court to articulate special limitations on digital searches to effectuate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity or reasonableness requirements. Such a case is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">2. The Google and Facebook Warrants</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">Ulbricht also challenges the warrants that allowed the government to search his Google and Facebook accounts, although he does not present any specific arguments related to those warrants. Both warrants, through affidavits incorporated by reference, set forth the basis for probable cause to search those accounts for evidence of Ulbricht\u2019s involvement in Silk Road. The warrants also authorized the government to search his Google and Fa-cebook accounts for \u201cevidence, fruits, and instrumentalities\u201d of the specified offenses, including, <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cany communications or writings by Ulbricht\u201d; \u201cany evidence concerning any computer equipment, software, or usernames used by Ulbricht\u201d; \u201cany evidence concerning Ulbricht\u2019s travel or patterns of movement\u201d; and any \u201cother evidence of the\u201d crimes charged. S.A. 334-35, 393-94. The scope of the Google and Facebook warrants thus substantially paralleled that of the Laptop Warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The Google and Facebook warrants were constitutional for the same reasons that the Laptop Warrant was valid. They satisfied all three of the particularity requirements because they listed the subject offenses, described the things to be searched, and identified the information to be seized in relation to the charged crimes. Ulbricht does not advance any additional arguments specific to the Google and Fa-cebook warrants, nor have we identified any independent reason to find them unconstitutionally lacking in specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">3. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">In sum, the issuance of the pen/trap orders and the three search warrants that Ulbricht challenges in this appeal did not violate the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Ul-bricht\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">II. The District Court\u2019s Trial Rulings and Ulbricht!s Rule 33 Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Ulbricht contends that he did not receive a fair trial for several reasons: (1) the district court\u2019s rulings surrounding corrupt agents Force and Bridges violated his due process rights; (2) the district court erroneously precluded two defense experts from testifying; (3) the district court abused its discretion when it curtailed Ul-bricht\u2019s cross-examination of two government witnesses; and (4) the district court erred when it ruled that certain hearsay statements were inadmissible. He also contends that, even if each individual error is harmless, the cumulative effect of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>errors prejudiced him to the extent that his trial was fundamentally unfair. We detect no error in the district court\u2019s rulings on any of those issues and therefore conclude that Ulbricht was not deprived of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">A. Corrupt Agents Force and Bridges</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Ulbricht\u2019s principal fair trial argument is that the district court erred in numerous ways by preventing him from relying on information related to the corruption of two federal agents, Force and Bridges, involved in the investigation of the Silk Road site. Before trial, the district court (1) precluded Ulbricht from referring at trial to the secret grand jury proceeding against Force; (2) denied Ulbricht discovery related to the Force investigation; and (3) denied Ulbricht an adjournment- of the trial until the Force investigation was complete. During trial, the district court excluded as hearsay certain chats that related to Force\u2019s illicit use of Silk Road. Finally, Ulbricht learned after trial that the government was investigating a second corrupt agent, Bridges. Ulbricht contends that the failure to disclose Bridges\u2019s corruption until after the trial violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a new trial on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Without question, the shocking personal corruption of these two government agents disgraced the agencies for which they worked and embarrassed the many honorable men and women working in those agencies to investigate serious criminal wrongdoing. Even more importantly, when law enforcement officers abuse their offices for personal gain, commit other criminal acts, violate the rights of citizens, or lie under oath, they undermine the public\u2019s vital trust in the integrity of law enforcement. They may also compromise the investigations and prosecutions on which they work.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">At the same time, the venality of individual agents does not necessarily affect the reliability of the government\u2019s evidence in a particular case or become relevant to the adjudication of every case in which the agents participated- Courts are obligated to ensure that probative evidence is disclosed to the defense, carefully evaluated by the court for its materiality to the case, and submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration where admissible. But courts must also take care that wrongdoing by investigators that has no bearing on the matter before the court not be used as a diversion from fairly assessing the prosecution\u2019s case. Like any other potential evidence, information about police corruption must be evaluated by reference to the ordinary rules of criminal procedure and evidence, a task to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">1. Background: Pretrial Disclosure of the Force Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">The government disclosed its investigation into Force\u2019s corruption to the defense about six weeks before trial. Initially, on November 21, 2014, the government wrote a sealed <em>ex parte </em>letter to the district court seeking permission to disclose to the defense information about the Force grand jury investigation subject to a protective order.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The district court granted the application. On December 1, the government provided a copy of the November 21 letter, which otherwise remained sealed, to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>fense counsel. According to the letter, Force leaked information to DPR in exchange for payment and \u201ccorruptly obtain[ed] proceeds from the Silk Road website and converged] them to his personal use.\u201d App\u2019x 649. The government then undertook to purge its trial evidence of anything arguably traceable to Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Ulbricht moved to unseal the entire November 21 letter so that he could rely on the information in the letter that related to Force\u2019s corruption at trial, arguing that the letter included <em>Brady </em>information and that he therefore had a particularized need to disclose the information that outweighed the presumption of grand jury secrecy. He also requested discovery and subpoenas under Rules 16 and 17, Fed. R. Crim. P., to learn more about the scope of Force\u2019s corruption. In the alternative, Ulbricht sought an adjournment of the trial until the Force investigation concluded and information about his corruption might become public through the filing of charges against him. On December 15, the district court held a sealed hearing on that issue and invited further written submissions, including a particularized list of Ulbricht\u2019s discovery requests. One week later, the district court issued a sealed and partially redacted opinion<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> denying all of Ul-bricht\u2019s requests. The court did indicate, however, that throughout the trial it would \u201centertain specific requests to use information from the November 21, 2014 Letter on cross-examination.\u201d App\u2019x 700. Moreover, the court explained that it would \u201centertain a renewed application\u201d for a \u201cparticularized disclosure\u201d of facts relevant to Force\u2019s corruption if the government\u2019s trial tactics or evidence \u201copen[ed] the door\u201d to such facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">2. Preclusion of Force Investigation Evidence: Rule 6(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to unseal the November 21 letter because he demonstrated a particularized need that rebutted the presumption of secrecy that attaches to grand jury investigations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u201c[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.\u201d <em>Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Nw., </em>441 U.S. 211, 218, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979). We have described five rationales for such secrecy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">(1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before the grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; (5) to protect the innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\"><em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>103 F.3d 234, 237 (2d Cir. 1996). Rule 6(e)(6) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure implements this policy of secrecy by requir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>ing that \u201call records, orders, and subpoenas <em>relating to </em>grand jury proceedings [must] be sealed.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>103 F.3d at 237 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Information falling within Rule 6(e)\u2019s protections is entitled to a \u201cpresumption of secrecy and closure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. To rebut the presumption of secrecy, the party \u201cseeking disclosure [must] show a particularized need that outweighs the need for secrecy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). To prove a particularized need, parties seeking disclosure must show that the \u201cmaterial they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision as to whether the burden of showing a particularized interest has been met will be overturned only if the court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Ulbricht\u2019s request to unseal the November 21 letter discussing the Force grand jury investigation. It is undisputed that the letter contained information related to a grand jury proceeding that, if made public, would disclose matters occurring before the grand jury. Ulbricht did not demonstrate a particularized need for disclosure because he did not show that the need for disclosure was greater than the need for continued secrecy or that a possible injustice would result if the grand jury investigation was not disclosed. Specifically, the district court did not err in concluding that revealing the entire letter could have compromised the Force grand jury investigation in a number of ways. For example, potential co-conspirators might have learned of the investigation and attempted to intimidate witnesses or destroy evidence. The investigation was also likely to garner significant media attention, a fact that might influence witnesses or grand jurors. And, although Force knew of the investigation, revealing its existence to the public might have harmed him if the allegations had ultimately proved untrue. Finally, Ulbricht\u2019s request was not structured to cover only the information needed to avoid any possible injustice; instead, he sought to unseal the entire November 21 letter and did not propose a more narrowly tailored disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">In redacted portions of its opinion, the district court also considered <em>ex parte </em>arguments concerning how the Force investigation might be relevant to Ulbricht\u2019s defense. In general terms, Ulbricht argued that the agents\u2019 corruption was critical to his defense because it would reveal the agents\u2019 ability to falsify evidence against him and demonstrate their motive to do so. According to the district court\u2019s characterization of his <em>ex parte </em>letters, Ulbricht speculated that Force may have used Curtis Green\u2019s (Flush) administrative capabilities to impersonate DPR; Force\u2019s corrupt conduct might have demonstrated technical vulnerabilities in the site that would render it susceptible to hacking; and learning that Force had good information about the Silk Road investigation might have caused the true DPR to recruit Ulbricht as his successor.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The district court reasoned that much of the information that might have arguably supported any of those theories was made available to the defense in discovery. The only new information in the November 21 letter concerned the investigation of Force\u2019s corruption; the fact of that investigation and its scope does not bolster any of the defense theories that Ulbricht described before the district court or on appeal. That Force was personally corrupt and used his undercover identity to steal money from Silk Road and DPR does not suggest either a motive or an ability on his part to frame Ulbricht as DPR. Absent any explanation of how Force could have orchestrated a massive plant of incriminating information on Ulbricht\u2019s personal laptop, his larcenous behavior does not advance the claim that such a frame-up was possible beyond mere speculation. Thus, Ulbricht was equally capable of presenting his various defense theories to the jury with or without the November 21 letter.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The government\u2019s commitment to eliminating all evidence that came from Force\u2019s work on the Silk Road investigation<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> further undermines Ulbricht\u2019s claim that he needed the information to avoid a possible injustice. Had Force been called as a government witness, or had any of the government\u2019s evidence relied on his credibility, his character for truthfulness would have been at issue during the trial, and information that impeached his credibility would have become highly relevant. Ulbricht\u2019s reliance on the general fact of cooperation among different government agencies and different U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices does not undermine the government\u2019s explicit representations that none of the evidence presented at trial derived from Force, and nothing in the record suggests that those representations were false. Ulbricht had no need to rely on the grand jury investigation of Force to attack the credibility of the actual government witnesses or the integrity of its other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In sum, Ulbricht has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in maintaining the secrecy of the Force grand jury investigation. He did not demonstrate to the district court, and has not demonstrated on appeal, that keeping the November 21 letter under seal resulted in any injustice, or that his need for disclosing the investigation was greater than the need for continued secrecy.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>3. Denial of Discovery Related to Force</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Ulbrieht claims that the district court erred in denying him discovery, including requested subpoenas, related to the Force investigation. Rule 16(a)(1)(E), Fed. R. Crim. P., requires the government to disclose information within its control if the information is \u201cmaterial to preparing the defense\u201d or will be a part of the government\u2019s case-in-chief. Evidence is material if it \u201ccould be used to counter the government\u2019s case or to bolster a defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>985 F.2d 1175, 1180 (2d Cir. 1993). \u201cAn appellate court, in assessing the materiality of withheld information, considers not only the logical relationship between the information and the issues in the case, but also the importance of the information in light 'of the evidence as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To justify a new trial, there \u201cmust be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence would have enabled the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Rule 17(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., allows parties to subpoena documents and objects to be introduced at criminal trials. A subpoena must meet three criteria: \u201c(1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; [and] (3) specificity.\u201d <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 700, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). The party requesting the subpoena must also show that the information sought is \u201cnot otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence,\u201d that \u201cthe party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production,\u201d and that \u201cthe application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general \u2018fishing expedition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 699-700, 94 S.Ct. 3090. We review the district court\u2019s discovery rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>583 F.3d 108, 125 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ulbricht\u2019s discovery requests related to the Force investigation. Ulbrieht submitted 28 individual discovery requests in connection with the Force disclosure. Those ranged from the reasonably specific, such as \u201crecords from any and all Bitcoin accounts\u201d used by Force, to the very broad, such as \u201cany spending, net worth, or other financial analysis conducted with respect to former SA Force,\u201d \u201cany and all phone records relating to former SA Force,\u201d and \u201cbank account records from any and all bank accounts maintained by former SA Force or his spouse.\u201d App\u2019x 669-70. The district court concluded that those requests were too broad and unfocused, and that the information requested was not material in the Rule 16 sense because the defense \u201chas not articulated a coherent and particular reason why\u201d the Force investigation could \u201ccounter the government\u2019s case or bolster a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697. Next, the district court concluded that the Rule 17 subpoenas were part of the same overall fishing expedition and that the issuance of such subpoenas could compromise the Force grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">There was no abuse of discretion in those rulings. Ulbrieht has not shown that, had the government produced every piece of requested information, he would have been able to alter the quantum of proof in his favor at trial. That is so because there is no indication, beyond Ulbricht\u2019s speculation, that Force manufactured any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>evidence on which the government relied at trial, let alone the most damning evidence discovered on the hard drive on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop and at his apartment. Because Force did not testify at trial, information related to his corruption would not have been relevant to attack the credibility of any testimony he would have given. Moreover, Ulbricht has not identified any specific aspect of the trial evidence that he could have undermined using the requested information. Thus, even if the district court erred in not granting at least some of Ulbricht\u2019s discovery requests, any such error does not justify a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">4. Ulbricht\u2019s Motion to Adjourn the Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Ulbricht contends that the district court erred in denying his request to adjourn the trial until the Force investigation was complete. \u201c[A] district court has a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials.\u201d <em>United, States v. Griffiths, 750 </em>F.3d 237, 241 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201ctrial courts enjoy very broad discretion in granting or denying trial continuances.\u201d <em>United States v. Stringer, </em>730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013). A decision to grant or deny a request for an adjournment is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and we \u201cwill find no such abuse unless the denial was an arbitrary action that substantially impaired the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the party seeking a continuance has the burden of showing \u201cboth arbitrariness and prejudice in order to obtain reversal\u201d based on a denial of an adjournment. <em>Id. </em>at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ulbricht\u2019s request for an adjournment of the trial. In a sealed portion of the proceedings on the first day of trial, the district court explained its reasons for denying the adjournment. The court ruled that because none of the evidence revealed by the government concerning Force\u2019s corruption was exculpatory, there was no reason to believe that delaying the trial would assist Ulbricht\u2019s defense. That analysis was not irrational or arbitrary. Moreover, as explained in more detail both above and below, Ulbricht has not shown how information related to Force\u2019s corruption was either exculpatory or material to his defense. Thus, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s refusal to adjourn the trial was prejudicial, let alone substantially so.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">5. Preclusion of the DeathFromAbove Chats</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">As already described, Force used Death-FromAbove as an unauthorized Silk Road username through which he attempted to extort money from DPR. The government only learned of Force\u2019s activity as Death-FromAbove during trial, when the defense attempted to introduce a redacted chat between DPR and DeathFromAbove. In the chat at issue, DeathFromAbove implied that he knew that DPR\u2019s real identity was Anand Athavale. DeathFromAbove then attempted to blackmail DPR by saying that, if DPR gave him $250,000, he would not \u201cgive you [sic] identity to law enforcement.\u201d App\u2019x 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The government objected to admitting the chat on three grounds: (1) it was hearsay; (2) its probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice under Rule 403, Fed. R. Evid.; and (3) it was a \u201cback-door attempt to re-inject\u201d Force\u2019s corruption into the defense\u2019s trial evidence. App\u2019x 707. The district court excluded the chat as hearsay. At trial, Ulbricht claimed that the chat was not being offered for its truth, but instead to show its effect on DPR; that is, if DPR was actually Atha-vale, one would expect DPR to take certain steps to protect his identity. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>court disagreed and ruled that the Death-FromAbove chat was hearsay because it was offered for the truth of the matter asserted therein\u2014that government agents at one time thought that Athavale was DPR\u2014and it did not fall into any hearsay exceptions. In the alternative, the district court found that the Athavale-as-DPR theory lacked sufficient support, was speculative, and risked jury confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In general, hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 802. \u201cThe Federal Rules of Evidence define hearsay as a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\u201d <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>706 F.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). If \u201cthe significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ultimate decisions as to the admission or exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Davis v. Velez, </em>797 F.3d 192, 201 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The district court concluded that the DeathFromAbove chat was hearsay because it was an out-of-court statement being offered for the truth of the matter asserted therein. That ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Contrary to Ulbricht\u2019s assertions on appeal, the district court did not rest its decision on the need for grand jury secrecy to protect the Force investigation. Instead, the decision was a straightforward application of the rule against hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Ulbricht does not provide any detailed arguments to the contrary that are specific to the DeathFromAbove chat; instead, he discusses the district court\u2019s preclusion of all of the evidence related to the Force investigation collectively. At trial, however, he claimed that the statement was offered only to demonstrate \u201cthe fact that it was communicated to DPR ... in that this particular piece of evidence communicates to DPR the name and profile of the person [D]eath[F]rom[A]bove believes is DPR.\u201d Tr. 1866. Ulbricht claimed that the statement was \u201coffered for the fact that DPR was getting information about people who were supposed to be DPR,\u201d and \u201cone of these people is [Athavale].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1867. Once the district court expressed skepticism about his argument, Ulbricht claimed that he sought to admit the chat to demonstrate its effect on DPR: \u201cif you\u2019re DPR and you get a name ... this Anand Atha-vale and a profile and details ... and you\u2019re put on notice that it\u2019s you, you\u2019re going to take steps.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1867-68. In other words, Ulbricht claimed that he did not offer it for the truth of the matter asserted in the chat: that agents in the Baltimore investigation, including Force, believed that Athavale was the real Dread Pirate Roberts, or that Athavale was in fact the real DPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Ulbricht\u2019s proposed non-hearsay use of the chat\u2014to show its effect on DPR\u2014is not sufficiently probative that the evidence\u2019s exclusion prejudiced him. The statement does not appear to have had an effect on DPR that would bolster Ul-bricht\u2019s defense. DPR did not alter his behavior in response to the extortion attempt. Indeed, he referred to it as \u201cbogus\u201d in one of the journal entries discovered on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop. App\u2019x 710. If Athavale had been the real Dread Pirate Roberts, he likely would have had a different reaction to the threatened exposure of his identity. DPR\u2019s reactions to other attempts to destroy the site\u2019s anonymity were dramatic, and included hiring people to kill the users who threatened to compromise Silk Road. Therefore, even if Ulbricht did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>offer the chat for its truth, any relevance of the arguably non-hearsay use of the statement was entirely too remote to outweigh the possible jury confusion that would result from the injection of Force into the trial or the likelihood that the jury would confuse the hearsay and non-hearsay significance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">6. Ulbricht\u2019s Rule 33 Motion: <em>Brady v. Maryland</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Ulbricht moved for a new trial under Rule 33, Fed. R. Crim. P., raising several issues concerning the unfairness of the assertedly belated disclosures of the investigations into Force and Bridges.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The only argument that he pursues in this appeal is that the belated disclosures violated his due process rights under <em>Brady </em>because the information was both material and exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Rule 33(a) provides that, on \u201cthe defendant\u2019s motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d We have advised district courts to \u201cexercise Rule 33 authority sparingly and in the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Cot\u00e9, </em>544 F.3d 88, 101 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim was raised in a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33[,] ... we review the denial of the motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>525 F.3d 225, 245 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of denying a Rule 33 motion, a \u201cdistrict court abuses ... the discretion accorded to it when (1) its decision rests on an error of law ... or a clearly erroneous factual finding, or (2) its decision\u2014though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding\u2014cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Forbes, </em>790 F.3d 403, 406 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">There are three components of a <em>Brady </em>violation: \u201c(1) The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the [government], either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice must have ensued.\u201d <em>United States v. Certified Envtl. Sens., Inc., </em>753 F.3d 72, 91 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Information is exculpatory if it relates to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>United States v. Avellino, </em>136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998). In order to show that he has been prejudiced, a defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different, such that the failure to disclose undermines confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Certified Envtl. Sens., Inc., </em>753 F.3d at 91 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Thus, the prosecution \u201cmust disclose ... exculpatory and impeachment information no later than the point at which a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome would have been different if an earlier disclosure had been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92 (internal quotation marks omitted). In general, a \u201cprudent prosecutor will err on the side of transparency, resolving doubtful questions in favor of disclosure.\u201d <em>Cone v. Bell, </em>556 U.S. 449, 470 n.15, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 173 L.Ed.2d 701 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">Although the agents\u2019 illegal behavior in connection with the Silk Road investigation is deeply troubling, the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ernment\u2019s December 2014 disclosure of the Force investigation and the post-trial disclosure of Bridges\u2019s corruption did not violate Ulbricht\u2019s due process rights. Evidence concerning the agents\u2019 corruption is not <em>Brady </em>information because it is not exculpatory or impeaching of the government\u2019s trial evidence. For this reason, the government\u2019s failure to reveal the full extent of the investigations until after Ul-bricht\u2019s trial did not prejudice him. As already explained, the fact that Force purloined Bitcoins from Silk Road and attempted to blackmail DPR does not relate to Ulbricht\u2019s guilt or innocence; the same logic applies to Bridges\u2019s similar behavior. The agents\u2019 corruption has nothing to do with whether Ulbricht operated the site as Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbricht has not raised any credible doubts about the reliability of the evidence that the government presented at trial, nor has he explained why the agents\u2019 illegal actions relate to <em>his </em>guilt at all. Indeed, the government removed from its exhibit list the items relevant to Force, including communications between Nob (his authorized undercover username) and DPR. Those communications included an instance in which DPR hired Nob to kill Curtis Green (Flush) as punishment for using his administrator status to steal Bitcoins from Silk Road users. Ulbricht does not identify any particular evidence introduced by the government at trial that is traceable to either Force or Bridges, or the admissibility of which depends on either agent\u2019s integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Ulbricht\u2019s arguments to the contrary largely rest on speculation. First, Ulbricht contends that the Silk Road investigations occurring in Baltimore and New York were \u201c[c]oordinated and [c]ombined,\u201d suggesting that Force\u2019s corruption may have somehow infected the evidence that the New York office used in its prosecution. Appellant Br. 40. Ulbricht explains that the offices communicated frequently and shared information through emails and reports. Assuming that Ulbricht is correct, the fact that the Silk Road investigation took place in several offices, one of which employed two corrupt agents, does not alter our analysis. Ulbricht still has not shown how the agents\u2019 corrupt behavior is exculpatory as to him, even if Force and Bridges at times shared their work product with New York and that work product influenced the larger investigation. The relevant question, on which none of Ul-bricht\u2019s arguments casts any light or raises any doubt, is whether any particular item of evidence was tainted in some way by the misconduct of Bridges or Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Next, Ulbricht surmises that the agents may have fabricated evidence suggesting that Ulbricht was DPR. In so arguing, Ulbricht implies that Force and Bridges may have had sufficiently high-level administrator access to Silk Road to manipulate the \u201cfinancial, transactional, and communications infrastructure of the Silk Road site.\u201d Reply Br. 14. Nothing in the government\u2019s disclosures, and nothing that Ulbricht identifies in the record or has produced from any independent source, suggests that either Bridges or Force had such capacity. Absent further detail or evidence that Force and Bridges were able to infiltrate DPR\u2019s communications or transactions, Ulbricht\u2019s argument is simply too speculative to warrant a new trial. Ulbricht further claims that Bridges used sophisticated techniques to try to place blame on others for his corrupt conduct, reflecting a pattern of framing others for his own crimes. That fact alone does not suggest that Bridges fabricated any evidence against Ulbricht or attempted to frame him. That Bridges undertook to deflect blame for things <em>he </em>had done does not suggest any reason why Bridges would be motivated to frame Ulbricht for things that DPR had done. Nor does Ulbricht explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>how Bridges\u2019s actions should undermine our confidence in any of the specific evidence on which the government relied at trial.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Finally, Ulbricht submitted a supplemental appendix that included a newly-discovered, unredacted report from the Joint Automated Booking System (\u201cJABS\u201d).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In that report, under the heading \u201cArrested or Received Information,\u201d Force is listed as the officer on the case, and the Baltimore DEA is listed as the relevant agency. Ulbricht apparently means to suggest that this report shows that Force played a more pervasive role in the investigation than the government has acknowledged. In response, the government argues that Force was simply the most recent person to make changes to the JABS report by updating it to include information about Ulbricht\u2019s family members and the pending charges in Maryland. In any event, the JABS report. bearing Force\u2019s name does not show how information related to Force\u2019s corruption exculpates Ulbricht. It merely confirms that Force was, a participant in the Baltimore Silk Road investigation and that he continued to be.involved in the case after Ul-bricht was arrested. In the face of the entire record of the trial, in which the provenance of the government\u2019s evidence was exhaustively displayed without indication that Force was responsible for any of it, this single report has little or no probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In sum, we conclude that the Force and Bridges complaint did not contain <em>Brady </em>information because the agents\u2019 corruption does not bear on Ulbricht\u2019s guilt or innocence. Thus, any delay in the government\u2019s disclosure of their corruption did not violate Ulbricht\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">B. Preclusion of Defense Experts</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The district court precluded both of Ul-bricht\u2019s proposed expert witnesses from testifying because he did not timely or adequately disclose his intent to call them under Rule 16, Fed. R. Crim. P. In general, the \u201cdefendant must, at the government\u2019s request, give to the government a written summary of any [expert] testimony that a defendant intends to use.... This summary must describe the witness\u2019s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness\u2019s qualifications.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). The purpose of the expert disclosure requirement is to \u201cminimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert\u2019s testimony through focused cross-examination.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, advisory committee\u2019s note to 1993 amendment. Indeed, \u201c[w]ith increased use of both scientific and nonscien-tifie expert testimony, one of counsel\u2019s most basic discovery needs is to learn that an expert is expected to testify.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>If a party fails to comply with Rule 16, the district court has \u201cbroad discretion in fashioning a remedy,\u201d which may include granting a continuance or \u201cordering the exclusion of evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>834 F.3d 145, 158 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2)(A)-(D) (a district court may order \u201cany other [remedy] that is just under the circumstances\u201d). We thus review the district court\u2019s choice of remedy for abuse of discretion. \u201cIn considering whether the district court abused its discretion, we look to the reasons why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>834 F.3d at 159 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the defense from calling its proposed experts. Not only were the disclosures late, more importantly, they were plainly inadequate. Both disclosures merely listed general and in some cases extremely broad topics on which the experts might opine. For example, the disclosures indicated that the experts would testify on general topics, including: \u201cthe origins of Biteoin,\u201d \u201cthe various purposes and uses of Biteoin,\u201d \u201cthe mechanics of Biteoin transactions,\u201d \u201cthe value of Biteoin over time since its inception,\u201d \u201cthe concepts of Biteoin speculating and Biteoin mining,\u201d \u201c[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities,\u201d the \u201cimport of some lines of PHP code provided to defense counsel in discovery,\u201d and \u201c[g]en-eral principles of public-key cryptography,\u201d among others. App\u2019x 349, 360. They did not summarize the experts\u2019 opinions about those topics, let alone describe the bases for the experts\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Indeed, although the listed topics certainly pertained generally to Silk Road, the disclosures were so vague that it is difficult, to discern whether the proffered expert testimony would have been at all relevant under Rules 401 and 702(a), Fed. R. Evid.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> In his opposition to the government\u2019s motion to preclude Antonopoulos, Ulbricht described the expert\u2019s proposed testimony in more detail, but he still did not disclose the opinions that the expert intended to offer. For example, that supplemental disclosure indicated that an \u201c[independent defense investigation has uncovered that\u201d the government\u2019s claim that over 700,000 Bitcoins were transferred to Ulbricht\u2019s Biteoin wallet \u201cis implausible,\u201d and the expert would \u201cdispute this finding.\u201d App\u2019x 382. Although that is more specific, it is not a summary of Anto-nopoulos\u2019s opinion, nor does it identify the basis for that opinion. Thus, to this day Ulbricht has not described what opinions the experts would offer or explained the methods they used to arrive at any of those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in finding that the government would be prejudiced by the belated and inadequate disclosures, in part because the government was due to rest the following day, providing it with no time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>to prepare to respond to the experts. Moreover, the district court considered intermediate sanctions short of preclusion but found them to be inadequate. In rejecting a continuance as a possible remedy, the district court emphasized the \u201cknown issues with a continuance,\u201d especially in a lengthy trial. <em>Id. </em>at 369. Two of the jurors had time constraints, and a continuance might have caused the court to lose one or both of those jurors, especially if the continuance was lengthy. If it were to grant a continuance, the court would also need to perform its function as a gatekeeper of expert testimony under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), which requires the district court to make a \u201cpreliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the [expert] testimony is scientifically valid\u201d and \u201ccan be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The district court cannot perform that complex evaluation of an expert\u2019s proposed methodology without a clear articulation of what the expert\u2019s opinions are and, even more importantly, of the bases for those opinions. In light of the risk of losing jurors and the lack of a sufficiently compelling reason for the defense\u2019s clear violation of Rule 16, the district court was within its discretion when it determined that a continuance was not practical and that the appropriate remedy was to preclude the witnesses altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Ulbricht\u2019s arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Ulbricht argues that the two experts were necessary to rebut portions of the government\u2019s case that he was precluded from addressing during cross-examination, as well as the testimony of Ilhwan Yum, a government witness who analyzed transactions associated with Bitcoin wallets found on Ul-bricht\u2019s laptop. Ulbricht now contends that portions of Yum\u2019s testimony were incorrect, including his description of what a \u201chot\u201d Bitcoin wallet is.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Ulbricht does not, however, explain <em>how </em>Yum\u2019s testimony was incorrect, what contrary evidence his experts would have provided had they been allowed to testify, or how any purported correction of Yum\u2019s testimony would have affected the case against Ul-bricht. Nor has he produced any summaries of his proposed expert testimony or described how that testimony would have been material to Ulbricht\u2019s guilt or innocence. In other words, Ulbricht has not shown that precluding Bellovin and Anto-nopoulos from testifying prejudiced him. Ulbricht\u2019s alternative argument that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>disclosures were in fact adequate is incorrect for the reasons already explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Ulbricht next argues that preclusion was an unduly harsh remedy under the circumstances. Along those lines, he claims that certain exhibits, such as the summary chart on which Yum relied, were not produced until mid-trial. Thus, according to Ulbricht, he could not have known about his need for expert witnesses to counter specific trial exhibits until it was already too late to comply with Rule 16. In his view, the district court should not have held him so strictly to Rule 16\u2019s requirements because he could not have known until Yum testified that he would need to call an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">While Ulbricht is correct that excluding his experts was a harsh sanction and was not to be imposed lightly, the district court considered the possibility of granting a continuance or a more limited sanction and found those remedies to be inappropriate under the circumstances. Such careful consideration of a range of possible sanctions short of preclusion is especially important in the atypical case where a criminal defendant, rather than the government, is precluded from putting on his case because of a Rule 16 violation. Limiting the defense\u2019s presentation of his case implicates the fundamental right of \u201can accused to present witnesses in his own defense.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). However, the defendant must still \u201ccomply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Ulbricht did not comply with the procedural requirements associated with expert disclosures. The district court gave the issue due consideration and appropriately exercised its discretion in remedying the defense\u2019s Rule 16 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Finally, Ulbricht cannot credibly argue that Yum\u2019s testimony was the first notice he had about the possible need for an expert witness to testify as part of his affirmative case. The Silk Road prosecution was uniquely laden with issues related to technology, computer servers, forensics, cyber security, digital currency, and myriad other issues that are indisputably \u201cbeyond the ken of the average juror.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>545 F.3d 179, 191 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ulbricht surely knew from the outset that, in order to mount a meaningful attack on the government\u2019s voluminous and technically complex evidence, he would need to call his own expert. Indeed, in his opening statement, Ulbricht\u2019s counsel claimed that he would show that the Bitcoins in Ul-bricht\u2019s wallet were from innocent transactions associated with Bitcoin speculation, rather than, as the government contended, related to Silk Road.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Ulbricht\u2019s opening statement also implied that BitTorrent\u2019s<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> security deficiencies could have allowed the true DPR to plant incriminating evidence on his laptop. It is difficult to fathom how he planned to advance those theories without relying on expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>In short, Ulbrieht argues that the district court\u2019s preclusion of his proffered expert witnesses denied him a fair opportunity to present his defense. But the same failings that render Ulbricht\u2019s expert disclosures inadequate under Rule 16 preclude us from finding the kind of prejudice he asserts. Ulbrieht did not disclose to the district court, and has not presented on appeal, any explanation of what the proposed experts would have said that would have supported a non-speculative basis for doubting the probative value of evidence from a variety of electronic and other sources identifying Ulbrieht as DPR throughout the life of Silk Road. Thus, we cannot conclude that he was prejudiced by the experts\u2019 exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">C. Curtailing Cross-Examination</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Ulbrieht contends that the district court erred in limiting his ability to cross-examine two government witnesses: Der-Yeghiayan and Kiernan. \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cedeno, </em>644 F.Sd 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2011). \u201cA district court is accorded broad discretion in controlling the scope and extent of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 103 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see </em>Fed. R. Evid. 611(a). Thus, \u201ca district court may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect against, <em>e.g., </em>harassment, prejudice, confusion, and waste.\u201d <em>James, </em>712 F.3d at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted). In general, however, a \u201cdistrict court should afford wide latitude to a defendant in a criminal case to cross-examine government witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). That is so because the Confrontation Clause gives \u201ca defendant the right not only to cross-examination, but to effective cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]t does not follow, of course, that the Confrontation Clause prevents a trial judge from imposing <em>any </em>limits\u201d on defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of government witnesses. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">1. Agent Der-Yeghiayan</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Ulbrieht argues that the district court erred when it struck portions of Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s testimony that referenced his prior belief that Karpeles might be Dread Pirate Roberts. Ulbrieht also challenges the striking of a similar but analytically distinct piece of testimony: Der-Yeghiay-an\u2019s statement that Karpeles\u2019s attorney had offered information about Silk Road in exchange for Karpeles receiving immunity from prosecution. Ulbrieht wanted the jury to infer that Karpeles had some criminal involvement in Silk Road that motivated him to pursue a cooperation agreement with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Der-Yeghiayan answered the defendant\u2019s initial questions about those topics, and the government did not object to them until a later side bar. During the side bar, the district court expressed its initial view that the questions were proper, but requested written briefing on the subject. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, the district court agreed with the government that neither Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s prior opinions about whether Karpeles was DPR nor Karpeles\u2019s offer of information about Silk Road was relevant to Ulbricht\u2019s case. The court thus directed the government to identify portions of Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s testimony to strike. After the government identified the improper testimony, the district court gave a general limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">You heard testimony while Mr. Der-Ye-ghiayan was on the stand regarding personal beliefs or suspicions he may have had about particular individuals at various points during his investigation. And I instruct you that what the agent sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>pected about others isn\u2019t evidence and should be disregarded. Now, consistent with all of the instructions I\u2019m going to give you at the end of the case, there was other testimony that Mr. Der-Ye-ghiayan provided which you may consider during your deliberations and give it the weight that you deem that it deserves. So it\u2019s the suspicions, all right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZH\">Tr. 974. Ulbricht contends on appeal that the district court erred in striking the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We disagree. The district court did not err in concluding that Der-Ye-ghiayan\u2019s prior beliefs about Karpeles as a possible DPR suspect were not relevant to the charges against Ulbricht. In order to elicit testimony implicating an alternative perpetrator, a defendant \u201cmust show that his proffered evidence on the alleged alternative perpetrator is sufficient, on its own or in combination with other evidence in the record, to show a nexus between the crime charged and the asserted alternative perpetrator.\u201d <em>Wade v. Mantello, </em>333 F.3d 51, 61-62 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, to avoid a \u201cgrave risk of jury confusion,\u201d a defendant must offer more than \u201cunsupported speculation that another person may have done the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted). An \u201cagent\u2019s state of mind as the investigation progressed is ordinarily of little or no relevance to the question of the defendant[\u2019s] guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>529 F.3d 493, 501 (2d Cir. 2008). Thus, striking Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s testimony and instructing the jury to disregard his earlier opinions about Karpeles\u2019s possible guilt was not error.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Further, any arguable error that occurred was harmless. Defense counsel continued to cross-examine Der-Yeghiayan and elicited admissible testimony about the earlier investigation into Karpeles; indeed, the district court took over cross-examination at several points to assist the defense in asking proper questions. <em>Cf. Cotto v. Herbert, </em>331 F.3d 217, 254 (2d Cir. 2003) (in considering whether a Confrontation Clause violation is harmless, we consider, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted\u201d). Moreover, Ulbricht discussed the investigation of Karpeles in his summation without objection. What was relevant at trial was any actual evidence pointing to Karpeles as the true Dread Pirate Roberts. The district court did not limit Ulbricht\u2019s cross-examination of Der-Yeghiayan as to his knowledge of such evidence. The district court directed the jury to disregard only testimony as to the agent\u2019s \u201csuspicions,\u201d Tr. 974, a subject of \u201clittle or no relevance to ... the defendants] guilt,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>529 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We similarly reject Ulbricht\u2019s contention that striking Der-Yeghiayan\u2019s testimony concerning Karpeles\u2019s offer to provide information about Silk Road in exchange for immunity was an abuse of discretion. Absent other evidence in the record regarding Karpeles, it was proper to exclude wholly speculative suggestions of an alternative perpetrator defense based on Karpeles\u2019s attorney\u2019s offer of information in exchange for his client\u2019s immunity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>And even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court erred in striking the testimony, any error was harmless. To the extent this testimony was stricken from the trial record, that ruling occurred outside the presence of the jury. All the jury was told was to disregard testimony about \u201cwhat the agent suspected about others,\u201d Tr. 974, a category that hardly would be understood by the jury to encompass testimony about the actions of Karpeles\u2019s attorney. As explained in detail \u25a0 above, moreover, the evidence identifying Ul-bricht as Dread Pirate Roberts was overwhelming and largely unchallenged. That Karpeles may have had information about Silk Road does not imply that he was DPR, only that he had some knowledge of or involvement with the site. Particularly given that Karpeles likely had some knowledge about Silk Road simply because of his operation of Mt. Gox, a prominent Bitcoin exchanger, any marginal probative value in the fact that he claimed to have such knowledge, and offered to provide it to the government, could not have meaningfully affected the balance of evidence available to the jury regarding the identity of DPR.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">2. Agent Kiernan</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Defense counsel cross-examined Kiernan extensively, and Ulbricht contends on \u00e1ppeal that the district court erred in preventing him from exploring certain topics during that cross-examination. Those excluded topics include: the meaning of various acronyms, the significance of a certain line of PHP code,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> whether the FBI allowed Kiernan to run BitTorrent on his work computer despite its lack of security, and whether the Linux kernel<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> that Kiernan used on his work computer was the same as the one that Ulbricht installed on his laptop. Ulbricht explains that he was attempting to show that Kiernan\u2019s conclusions about Ulbrieht\u2019s laptop were inaccurate because they were based on unreliable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The district court sustained objections to those questions because, in its view, they were outside the scope of Kiernan\u2019s direct testimony. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Evid. 611(b) (\u201cCross-examination should not go beyond the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d); <em>Baker v. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., </em>669 F.3d 105, 110 (2d Cir. 2012) (\u201cOnce any direct examination is concluded, cross-examination within the scope of the direct follows.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">On appeal, Ulbricht claims that, because Kiernan testified about the operation of Tor Chat and other forensic computer issues during his direct testimony, the precluded questions were within that testimony\u2019s scope and should have been allowed. Even assuming that Ulbricht is correct, any error is harmless. Ulbricht was permitted to question Kiernan about whether Linux was customizable, and Kiernan admitted during cross that he did not know whether he used the same version of Tor Chat that Ulbricht had installed on his laptop. Ulbricht\u2019s counsel also asked several questions about the security vulnerabilities of BitTorrent, conveying to the jury that using BitTorrent might have rendered Ulbricht\u2019s computer susceptible to hacking. Thus, Ulbricht was able to elicit testimony supporting his proposed inference that Kiernan\u2019s conclusions based on the Tor Chat evidence were flawed. Ulbricht does not explain how he was prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>when the district court prohibited him from asking Kiernan certain other questions. We therefore identify no reversible error in the district court\u2019s limitations on Kiernan\u2019s cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">D. Andrew Jones Hearsay Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The district court excluded a statement allegedly made by Andrew Jones, who was a Silk Road administrator under the user-name Inigo. Jones cooperated with the government and was on the government\u2019s witness list until the middle of trial, when the government decided not to call him. Defense counsel explored the possibility of calling Jones as a witness, but Jones\u2019s attorney advised Ulbricht that Jones would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify if compelled to appear. In light of Jones\u2019s unavailability, Ulbricht sought to admit a December 29, 2014 letter from the government to defense counsel that described a statement that Jones made during one of his interviews.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The relevant portion of the government\u2019s letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">At some point in or about August or September 2013, Jones tried to authenticate that the Silk Road user \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d whom he was talking to at the time ... was the same person with whom he had been communicating in the past with this username. Previously, ... Jones and \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d had agreed upon a \u201chandshake\u201d to use for authentication, in which Jones would provide a certain prompt and \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d would provide a certain response. When, during the 2013 chat in question, Jones provided what he believed to be the designated prompt, \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d was unable to provide the response Jones thought they had agreed on. However, later in the chat, Jones asked \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d to validate himself by specifying the first job that \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d assigned to him (running the \u201cDPR Book Club\u201d), which \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d was able to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">App\u2019x 398. Ulbricht argues that the Jones statement<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> supports his theory that more than one person acted as Dread Pirate Roberts, because at one point DPR could authenticate his identity to Jones, but at another time he could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">When it became clear that Jopes was unavailable to testify, Ulbricht asked the government to stipulate that the Jones statement could be read to the jury. The government initially agreed, but then changed its mind and opposed admitting the Jones statement. The defense acknowledged that the statement was hearsay, but claimed that it was admissible under two hearsay exceptions: upder Rule 804(b)(3), Fed. R. Evid., as a statement against interest, and under Rule 807\u2019s residual exception. The district court ruled that the statement was inadmissible, specifically addressing only Rule 804(b)(3). On appeal, Ulbricht continues to argue that the statement was admissible under either exception. Neither of his theories is persuasive.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>A district court\u2019s \u201cultimate decisions as to the admission or exclusion of evidence are reviewed for abuse of discretion, and will not be disturbed unless they are manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>797 F.3d at 201 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To invoke the 804(b)(3) exception for a statement against interest, the proponent of the statement \u201cmust show (1) that the declarant is unavailable as a witness, (2) that the statement is sufficiently reliable to warrant an inference that a reasonable man in [the declarant\u2019s] position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true, and (3) that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>United States v. Wexler, </em>522 F.3d 194, 202 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The exception applies \u201conly if the district court determines that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s shoes would perceive the statement as detrimental to his or her own penal interest.\u201d <em>United States v. Saget, </em>377 F.3d 223, 231 (2d Cir. 2004). The key to this inquiry is whether the statement is sufficiently \u201cself-inculpatory,\u201d which the district court must evaluate on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>506 F.3d 151, 155 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The district court did not err in concluding that the Jones statement did not fall within Rule 804(b)(3)\u2019s hearsay exception. There is no dispute that Jones was unavailable to testify because he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. The court ruled that the Rule 804(b)(3) exception did not apply because Jones was under a cooperation agreement at the time that he made the relevant statement to the government and the chat did not have any particular impact on Jones\u2019s penal interests. On appeal, Ulbricht claims that the extent of Jones\u2019s criminal liability was unknown when he made the statement because he could still be vulnerable to prosecution in other jurisdictions, and he had not yet been sentenced when he made the statement to the government. <em>See Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 326, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999) (in the Fifth Amendment context, there can be a \u201clegitimate fear of adverse consequences from further testimony\u201d where a sentence has not yet been imposed).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">We are not persuaded that Jones\u2019s statement was against his penal interests. Given the cooperation agreement, the government\u2019s role at Jones\u2019s future sentencing, and the penalties for lying to the government, it is far from clear that it was against Jones\u2019s interest to disclose details of his criminal activities at the time the statement in question was made. Moreover, even to the extent that Jones\u2019s disclosures taken as a whole constituted inculpatory admissions, the particular statement in question had little adverse effect on Jones. Jones\u2019s inculpatory admissions to the government concern whether he committed crimes connected to Silk Road. His description of his \u201chandshake\u201d with DPR presupposes that he had already discussed his own crimes with the government. Whether DPR did or did not recognize Jones\u2019s identifying prompt does not bear on Jones\u2019s guilt of any crime associated with the site, since he had already confirmed his role working for DPR. The details of this conversation with DPR thus do not inculpate <em>Jones-, </em>instead, they either help or hurt Ulbricht. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Rule 804(b)(3) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Rule 807 provides for a limited, residual exception to the rule against hearsay where no other exception applies. A hearsay statement may be admissible under Rule 807 if: \u201c(i) it is particularly trustworthy; (ii) it bears on a material fact; (iii) it is the most probative evidence addressing that fact; (iv) its admission is consistent with the rules of evidence and advances the interests of justice; and (v) its proffer follows adequate notice to the adverse party.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>385 F.3d 196, 208 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cresidual hearsay exception[ ] will be used very rarely, and only in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>929 F.2d 901, 907 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The district court did not specifically address Ulbricht\u2019s request to admit the statement under Rule 807, but we conclude that the limited residual exception does not assist Ulbricht. We are loath to assume that a statement made by a criminal in debriefings to the government pursuant to a cooperation agreement is categorically \u201cparticularly trustworthy,\u201d as Rule 807 requires. But even if Jones\u2019s statement meets that criterion, and was offered \u201cas evidence of a material fact,\u201d we cannot say that it is \u201cmore probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 807(a)(2)-(3). Ulbricht has not attempted to explain how the Jones statement satisfies this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Finally, even if the district court erred in excluding the statement under either hearsay exception, any error was certainly harmless. The conversation between Jones and DPR in its totality was not actually helpful to Ulbricht. As explained, during the chat in question, DPR was at one point unable to provide the designated response, but later he identified himself to Jones\u2019s satisfaction. The statement thus contains the seeds of its own refutation. Since DPR\u2019s alleged failure to verify his identity and his subsequent remedy of that failure occurred during the same online chat, the interaction provides little dr no support for the defense theory that different individuals acted as DPR at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">E. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Ulbricht argues that the cumulative effect of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings deprived him of a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Al-Moayad, </em>545 F.3d 139, 178 (2d Cir. 2008). We have exhaustively reviewed his contentions of trial error and have concluded that none of those contentions has merit. The challenged trial rulings were well within the district court\u2019s discretion, and the various exclusions did not prevent the defense from offering evidence probative of innocence. At the trial in this case, the government presented overwhelming evidence that Ulbricht was indeed Dread Pirate Roberts. The evidence that the defense was precluded from offering to refute that proof was excluded because it was speculative, unreliable, offered in contravention of the Federal Rules of Evidence or of Criminal Procedure, or otherwise inadmissible. The few instances in which the district court\u2019s rulings may be questioned, where we noted the relevance of the harmless error rule, involved minor and marginal points. Accordingly, whether considered separately or cumulatively, none of Ulbricht\u2019s evidentiary arguments lead us to doubt that he was found guilty after a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">\u201c[A] district court has broad latitude to impose either a Guidelines sentence or a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Ri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>gas, </em>583 F.3d at 114 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAccordingly, the role of the Court of Appeals is limited to examining a sentence for reasonableness, which is akin to review under an \u2018abuse-of-discretion\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis standard applies both to the [substantive reasonableness of the] sentence itself and to the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Ulbricht and amici<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> challenge his life sentence as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">A. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u201cA sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jesurum, </em>819 F.3d 667, 670 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted). To \u201chold that a factual finding is \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 we must be left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. DeSilva, </em>613 F.3d 352, 356 (2d Cir. 2010). Where \u201cthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Norman, </em>776 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). In general, a \u201csentencing court has discretion to consider a wide range of information in arriving at an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>920 F.2d 139, 143 (2d Cir. 1990). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing need be supported only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Norman, </em>776 F.3d at 76. \u201cWhere we identify procedural error in a sentence, but the record indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event, the error may be deemed harmless, avoiding the need to vacate the sentence and to remand the case for resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Jass, </em>569 F.3d 47, 68 (2d Cir 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 197 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (declining to reach claim that district court erred in relying on vague concern about gun violence because it was clear that the \u201cdistrict court would have imposed the same sentence had it relied solely on\u201d the permissible concern about deterrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">Ulbricht\u2019s only claim of procedural error is that it was improper for the district court to consider six drug-related deaths as relevant to his sentence because there was insufficient information connecting them with drugs purchased on Silk Road. In terms of our sentencing jurisprudence, Ulbricht claims that the district court relied on clearly erroneous facts in imposing sentence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">Ulbricht submitted an expert report in which Dr. Mark Taff wrote that the records associated with the six deaths were substantially incomplete. For example, many did not include full autopsies, rendering it difficult to discern the precise cause of death to a reasonable degree of medical certainty in five of the cases.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Equally importantly, Dr. Taff wrote that he could not conclusively connect the specific drugs that the decedents consumed with Silk Road, because it is impossible to \u201ccorrelate the time of purchase/acquisition from an alleged Silk Road vendor\u201d and the \u201ctime of usage of the alleged Silk road purchase\u201d with the deaths.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> S.A. 446. We assume for purposes of this opinion that Dr. Taffs conclusions are sufficiently sound to raise a genuine question about whether the deaths described in the PSR were caused by drugs purchased on Silk Road. As explained above, however, Ul-bricht was not being prosecuted or punished for homicide on a theory that he personally caused those deaths. Nor did the fact of the deaths increase his offense level under the Guidelines. The question before the district court was whether the sale of large quantities of drugs on Silk Road created a sufficient risk of death to permit the district court to take the deaths into account in assessing the seriousness of Ulbricht\u2019s crimes when it considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As with other facts relevant to sentencing, that question is for the district court to answer, based on the preponderance of the evidence. <em>Norman, </em>776 F.3d at 76. Contrary to Ulbricht\u2019s claims, the district court did not summarily reject Dr. Taffs conclusions. Rather, it addressed his report carefully and acknowledged the evidentiary challenges of connecting the deaths to Silk Road. The court concluded that Dr. Taffs proposed \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d standard was simply too high an evidentiary standard for purposes of including the deaths in the PSR. The court reasoned that it was \u201cnot asking whether the but for cause of death is drugs purchased on Silk Road,\u201d but rather \u201cwhether there is a connection between the purchase of drugs on Silk Road and [the] death\u201d in the sense that the sale of those drugs created a risk of death. App\u2019x 1476.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For those limited purposes and judged by that standard, the circumstantial evidence connecting the drug-related deaths to Silk Road was sufficient to consider them at Ulbricht\u2019s sentencing. To take the strongest example, one decedent was found in his apartment with a package torn open. His computer had the Silk Road site open, with chat messages from the vendor describing the heroin and prescription drug purchase as well as the package tracking information. The tracking number matched the information on the torn package in the apartment. A toxicology report determined that he died of an overdose of heroin combined with other prescription drugs. The facts connecting the other five deaths to Silk Road varied in strength. The available evidence was sufficient, however, to allow the district court find by a preponderance of the evidence that the deaths were connected to Silk Road; therefore, the court could consider the risk of death that the site created. Nothing in the sentencing transcript suggests that the court considered the information for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">We are sensitive to the possibility that the evidence of the six deaths was emo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tionally inflammatory and risked implicitly escalating Ulbricht\u2019s responsibility from facilitating the sale of drugs to causing the deaths of several drug users.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> But there is no indication that the deaths in question played such a role in the district court\u2019s sentencing determination. In urging the court to consider evidence of the deaths, the government explained that the deaths \u201cillustrate the obvious: that drugs can cause serious harm, including death.\u201d App\u2019x 902. <em>See United States v. Pacheco, </em>489 F.3d 40, 48 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007) (observing that a defendant who \u201cengaged in the commercial trade of potent substances ... must have known [that such trade] could have dire consequences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Of course, to the extent that the harms of the drug trade were obvious, there was no need to introduce evidence of these particular incidents, let alone to hammer the point home with unavoidably emotional victim impact statements by parents of two of the decedents.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> No federal judge needs to be reminded of the tragic consequences of the traffic in dangerous substances on the lives of users and addicts, or of the risks of overdose and other ramifications of the most dangerous of illegal drugs. Those consequences are among the reasons why illegal drugs are prohibited and constitute a principal justification advanced for the extremely lengthy sentences provided by federal statutes and sentencing guidelines for trafficking in illicit substances. Absent reason to believe that a drug dealer\u2019s methods were unusually reckless, in that they enhanced the risk of death from drugs he sold beyond those already inherent in the trade, we do not think that the fact that the ever-present risk of tragedy came to fruition in a particular instance should enhance those sentences, or that the inability of the government to link a particular dealer\u2019s product to a specific death should mitigate them. The government\u2019s insistence on proceeding with this evidence generated an appellate issue that has taken on a disproportionate focus in relation to the reasons actually advanced by the district court in its lengthy and careful statement of the reasons for the sentence it imposed. App\u2019x 1509-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We are not persuaded, however, that the introduction of the evidence in this case was error, although it may have been incautious for the government to insist on presenting it to the district court. As already explained, it was certainly appropriate for the district court to consider the risk of death from use of drugs in assessing the seriousness of the offense conduct, one of the factors that a judge must consider in imposing sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). That appears to be the only way the judge in this case used the evidence of the drug-related deaths. Emotionally wrenching as the statements of the decedents\u2019 parents were, we cannot and do not assume that federal judges are unable to put their sympathies for particular victims to one side and assess the evidence for its rational relationship to the sentencing decision. And here, the record makes clear that the district court did not use the evidence of the drug-related deaths to enhance Ulbricht\u2019s sentence, either as a formal matter under the Guidelines or otherwise. For all the extensive litigation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>propriety of including this information in the PSR, in imposing sentence the district court did not refer to the drug-related deaths as an aggravating factor. Indeed, the only mention of that evidence at all was a passing reference to \u201cfacts brought out in connection with [those] death[s]\u201d that \u201cprovide evidence of first-time and expanded [drug] usage.\u201d App\u2019x 1521-22. This reference occurred in the entirely appropriate context of a lengthy discussion of the general social harms of Ulbricht\u2019s massive drug-trading marketplace. <em>Id. </em>at 1522-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">That discussion was particularly germane to this case for several reasons. First, Ulbricht claimed that Silk Road reduced the harms associated with the drug trade in several ways. For example, he argued that trafficking in drugs over the Internet reduced violence associated with hand-to-hand transactions and the societal stigma of drug use, and Silk Road\u2019s vendor rating system ensured that customers had access to better quality drugs and more information about the drugs that they were purchasing. Those arguments prompted the district court to reflect broadly on the costs of the drug trade and discuss Silk Road\u2019s participation in those harms. Reasonable people may and do disagree about the social utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or even of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all. It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">At this point in our history, however, the democratically-elected representatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by severe punishment. That policy results in the routine incarceration of many traffickers for extended periods of time. This case involves a defendant who stood at one remove from the trade, who did not for the most part dirty his hands with the actual possession and sale of drugs and other contraband that his site offered. But he did take a cut of the proceeds, in exchange for making it easier for such drugs to be purchased and sold, in a way that may well have expanded the market by allowing more people access to drugs in greater quantities than might otherwise have been available to them. In the routine instances of sentencing drug sellers, the dangerous aspects of the trade are close to the surface and require little emphasis. In this case, a reminder of the consequences of facilitating such transactions was perhaps more necessary, particularly because Ulbricht claimed that his site actually made the drug trade safer, and he appeared to contest the legitimacy of the laws he violated.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Finally, we need look no further than the district court\u2019s express reasons for imposing sentence to conclude that drug-related deaths played little part in dictating the sentence imposed. As tragic as they are, and as foreseeable in light of the volume of dangerous drugs trafficked through Silk Road, those deaths were accidents. In light of the overwhelming evidence, discussed below, that Ulbricht was prepared, like other drug kingpins, to protect his profits by paying large sums of money to have individuals who threatened his enterprise murdered, it would be plainly wrong to conclude that he was sentenced for accidental deaths that the district court discussed only in passing in imposing sentence. Even were we to conclude that the evidence of the Silk Road-related deaths should not have been received, any error would be harmless, because the record is absolutely clear that the district court, after finding that Ul-bricht commissioned five murders, would have imposed the same sentence if the evidence of the drug-related deaths had been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The sentencing <em>amici </em>advance one additional argument: that the district court\u2019s consideration of the drug-related deaths violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because the fact of those deaths was not charged in the Indictment and proven to the jury. \u201cWhile we are not required to address arguments raised only by an <em>amicus,\u201d Am. Atheists, Inc. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; New Jersey, </em>760 F.3d 227, 237 n.11 (2d Cir. 2014), we do so here in an excess of caution. The argument is without merit under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">A district court may consider as part of its sentencing determination uncharged conduct proven by a preponderance of the evidence as long as that conduct does not increase either the statutory minimum or maximum available punishment. <em>See United States v. Stevenson, </em>834 F.3d 80, 85 (2d Cir. 2016); <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>806 F.3d 691, 693-94 (2d Cir. 2015). The Supreme Court has \u201clong recognized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2163, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). Here, the six drug-related deaths (and more importantly, Ulbricht\u2019s attempted murders for hire) were uncharged facts that did not increase either the statutory twenty-year minimum or the maximum life sentence applicable to the crimes of which he was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the jury. Thus, the district court did not violate the Constitution when it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road and that they were relevant to Ulbricht\u2019s sentence because they were part of the harm that the site caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">In sum, we might not, in the prosecutors\u2019 shoes, have chosen to offer this evidence at sentencing, or have admitted it as district judges. We conclude, however, (1) that the district court did not clearly err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>when it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the six deaths were connected to Silk Road; (2) that it did not abuse its discretion in determining that it was appropriate to consider those acts as bearing on the seriousness of the narcotics offenses of which Ulbricht was convicted, one of many factors the district court was required to consider in exercising its discretion under \u00a7 3553(a); and (3) that the evidence in question in fact played a minimal role, if any, in the actual sentencing, and that in light of the reasons given by the district court for its sentencing decision, we can be absolutely certain that the same sentence would have been imposed if the evidence had not been received. Ul-bricht\u2019s sentence was therefore not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">B. Substantive Unreasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cWe will ... set aside a district court\u2019s substantive [sentencing] determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). Our review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and this Court does \u201cnot consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor.\u201d <em>Higas, </em>583 F.3d at 122. \u201cRather, we consider whether the factor, as explained by the district court, can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of the circumstances in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our role in \u201cpatrolling the boundaries of reasonableness\u201d is modest. <em>United States v. Broxmeyer, </em>699 F.3d 265, 289 (2d Cir. 2012) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we \u201cwill set aside only those outlier sentences that reflect actual abuse of a district court\u2019s considerable sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Messina, </em>806 F.3d 55, 66 (2d Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In light of the deferential standard of review, we cannot say that Ulbricht\u2019s life sentence was substantively unreasonable. The district court identified numerous facts that made Ulbricht\u2019s case extraordinary, in its view rendering a life sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court described the crime as a \u201cplanned, comprehensive, and deliberate scheme ... which posed serious danger to public health and to our communities.\u201d App\u2019x 1511-12. Silk Road was a \u201cworldwide criminal drug enterprise with a massive geographic scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1512. The fact that Ulbricht operated the site from behind a computer, rather than in person like a more prototypical drug kingpin, does not make his crime less serious or less dangerous. Moreover, Silk Road uniquely expanded the drug market by providing an easy avenue for people to become first-time drug users and dealers. Because drugs were shipped to customers in the mail, Silk Road brought \u201cdrugs to communities that previously may have had no access to such drugs ... in such quantities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The quantity and nature of the drugs sold on Silk Road are staggering. According to the PSR, from 2011 through 2013, Silk Road customers transacted in approximately $183 million worth of illegal drugs. At the time the government shut down Silk Road on October 2, 2013, there were approximately 13,802 listings for controlled substances on the website. Of those listings, there were 643 listings for cocaine-based products, 305 for LSD products, and 261 for methamphetamine products. The drugs were sold mostly for individual, personal use, but some drugs such as heroin and cocaine were also available in \u201cmulti-kilogram quantities.\u201d PSR \u00b6 26. The available drugs were not limited to heroin, narcotics, synthetic marijuana, and other dangerous but recreational substances. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>example, after being told that cyanide was \u201cthe most well known assassination suicide [sic] poison out there,\u201d Ulbricht allowed vendors to sell it on Silk Road despite its singular, deadly purpose. App\u2019x 1519. As the district court noted, despite earlier protestations that Silk Road would not allow the sale of products that could be used to inflict deliberate harm on others, it took Ulbricht all of six minutes to decide \u201cthat it is okay to sell cyanide,\u201d <em>id., </em>in exchange for the customary cut of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The drug offenses alone\u2014ignoring all other illicit materials sold on the site<footnotemark>66</footnotemark>\u2014 yielded a calculated offense level of 50. Of that calculation, only two levels are attributable to Ulbricht\u2019s \u201ccredible threats of directed violence\u201d associated with the murders for hire. PSR \u00b6 94. Thus, even without considering that enhancement, the drug convictions yielded an offense level of 48, which is higher than the maximum offense level recognized by the Guidelines, for which a sentence of life imprisonment is recommended even for someone who, like Ulbricht, has no prior criminal convictions. Ulbricht does not challenge the accuracy of the Guidelines calculation or of the fact-findings on which it is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">That the sentence imposed accorded with the Guidelines recommendation does not automatically render it reasonable. <em>See United States v. Dorvee, </em>616 F.3d 174, 182 (2d Cir. 2010). The Guidelines are, however, themselves a factor that Congress has directed district courts to consider. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A). Moreover, as the considered judgment of the United States Sentencing Commission, they bear on the other factors that Congress has required courts to evaluate, including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), to provide adequate deterrence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), and, because they are considered by all judges throughout the federal system, the need to \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Accordingly, while a life sentence for selling drugs alone would give pause, we would be hard put to find such a sentence beyond the bounds of reason for drug crimes of this magnitude.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> But the facts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>this case involve much more than simply facilitating the sale of narcotics. The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Ulbrieht commissioned at least five murders in the course of protecting Silk Road\u2019s anonymity, a finding that Ulbrieht does not challenge in this appeal.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Ulbrieht discussed those anticipated murders callously and casually in his journal and in his communications with the purported assassin Redandwhite. For example, in connection with the first hit, he wrote to Redandwhite that \u201cFriendly-Chemist is a liability and I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was executed.\u201d Tr. 1822. In the course of negotiating the price for the killing, DPR claimed that \u201c[n]ot long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1888, but that he had \u201conly ever commissioned the one other hit, so I\u2019m still learning this market,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1884. He then paid $150,000 in Bitcoins for the murder, and he received what purported to be photographic documentation if its completion. Ulbrieht then wrote in his journal that he \u201c[g]ot word that the blackmailer was executed,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1887, before returning quickly to other tasks associated with running the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In negotiating the other four killings, Ulbrieht initially resisted multiple murders. He instructed Redandwhite to \u201cjust hit Andrew [usernames Tony76 and nipple-suckcanuck] and leave it at that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1897. Redandwhite said he could do it for \u201c150 just like last time,\u201d but that he would not be able to recover any of DPR\u2019s money if he killed only one person because he would have to commit the murder outside of the victim\u2019s home or office where he stored his funds. <em>Id. </em>If Ulbrieht wanted him to recover money, the self-professed assassin claimed, he would have to kill not only Tony76, but also his three associates. DPR responded that he would \u201cdefer to [Redandwhite\u2019s] better judgment and hope[d] [to] recover some assets\u201d from the hit. <em>Id. </em>at 1899. He then sent $500,000 in Bitcoins, the agreed-upon price for four killings, to Redandwhite. As the district court stated in discussing Ulbricht\u2019s journal entries concerning these projected murders, his words are \u201cthe words of a man who is callous as to the consequences or the harm and suffering that [his actions] may cause others.\u201d \u00c1pp\u2019x 1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The record was more than sufficient to support the district court\u2019s reliance on those attempted murders in sentencing Ul-bricht to life in prison. The attempted murders for hire separate this case from that of an ordinary drug dealer, regardless of the quantity of drugs involved in the offense, and lend further support to the district court\u2019s finding that Ulbricht\u2019s conduct and character were exceptionally destructive. That he was able to distance himself from the actual violence he paid for by using a computer to order the killings is not mitigating. Indeed, the cruelty that he displayed in his casual and confident negotiations for the hits is unnerving. We thus cannot say that a life sentence was outside the \u201crange of permissible decisions\u201d under the circumstances. <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Ulbricht\u2019s arguments on appeal have rhetorical power because of the sheer magnitude of his sentence, but they do not provide a legal basis for vacating that sentence as substantively unreasonable. He contends that the district court ignored the letters submitted on his behalf, thus failing to consider his positive contributions to his family and society as well as his potential productivity should he be released from prison. To the contrary, however, the district court \u201cread each and every one of [the letters] with care,\u201d some \u201cmore than once.\u201d App\u2019x 1534. Recognizing that the letters were \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cprofoundly moving,\u201d the district court observed that they reveal Ulbricht\u2019s human complexity. <em>Id. </em>at 1534-35. Nothing in the record supports the claim that the district court failed to recognize the importance of the letters, incorrectly discounted Ulbricht\u2019s more favorable characteristics, or otherwise inappropriately dismissed their role in its sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Similarly, Ulbricht\u2019s argument that the district court ignored his contention that Silk Road reduced the harmful effects of drug crimes must be rejected. The district court thoroughly discussed Doctor X\u2019s role at Silk Road and Ulbricht\u2019s claims that the site reduced violence, overdoses, and other harms associated with drug trafficking, and concluded that they were unpersuasive. We see no error in its analysis, and Ulbricht\u2019s arguments concerning harm reduction do not render his sentence substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Ulbricht also claims that there is an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and the approximately 17-month sentence that Peter Nash, a Silk Road administrator, received. Again, however, the district court considered the arguments concerning Nash\u2019s sentence and found them to be irrelevant to Ulbricht\u2019s crime because Nash was a low-level site administrator who pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government. Along those same lines, Ulbricht notes that Silk Road drug dealers received lower sentences than he did. For example, one such drug dealer received a ten-year sentence. The fact that different people involved with the site received dramatically lower sentences does not mean that Ulbricht\u2019s own sentence was substantively unreasonable on the individual facts of his case.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Ulbricht was the creator and head administrator of the site. That fact alone distinguishes his case from that of any individual seller or employee who used or worked for the site. Ulbricht profited from every sale on Silk Road, and he facilitated the acts of each drug dealer and drug organization that used it. Moreover, he attempted to commission at least five murders to protect his criminal enterprise. Those facts render his case distinguishable from those who committed other crimes using Silk Road or otherwise facilitated its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Ulbricht next reiterates his argument that he was more like someone running a crack house than like a drug kingpin because he created the online platform that <em>others </em>used to sell drugs and was not himself a drug dealer.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> That argument also understates the vast extent of Silk Road\u2019s drug market, which had thousands of customers and trafficked in about $183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>million in illegal drugs. People may differ about whether \u201crespectable\u201d people who, acting as property owners, money launderers, or other facilitators of crime for personal gain are less guilty than those who personally handle the narcotics. We cannot fault the district court for rejecting the argument that Ulbricht\u2019s contribution to the narcotics trade was inherently less culpable than that of the dealers who paid him to use Silk Road to complete their transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Both the sentencing <em>amici </em>and Ulbricht further contend that the district court placed too much weight on the notion of general deterrence in meting out the life sentence. Specifically, Ulbricht fears that resorting to \u201cgeneral deterrence without any confining principles ... guarantees that [the sentence] will create disparity.\u201d Appellant Br. 139. <em>Amici </em>also observe that academic studies counsel against placing too much emphasis on general deterrence in sentencing because severe criminal punishments do not actually decrease either supply or demand for illegal drugs. Further, according to <em>amici, </em>the threat of a long sentence does not deter criminal conduct more effectively than the threat of a shorter sentence. In his reply, Ulbricht identifies several lucrative dark markets that have emerged since Silk Road\u2019s demise in 2013. In his view, the existence of multiple copycat Tor-based illegal marketplaces proves that general deterrence is illusory and that the district court placed too much weight on that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Although those arguments' have some support among scholars and researchers, the ability of a sentence to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d is a factor that district courts are <em>required </em>by Congress to consider in arriving at the appropriate sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); <em>see United States v. Tran, </em>519 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2008). Congress, moreover, has not concluded that the persistence of narcotics crimes is a reason to abandon the efforts to deter them by lengthy sentences. The district court observed that \u201cgeneral deterrence plays a particularly important role\u201d in Ulbricht\u2019s case because Silk Road is \u201cwithout serious precedent\u201d and generated an unusually large amount of public interest. App\u2019x 1532-33. The court thus carefully analyzed the role that general deterrence played in Ulbricht\u2019s individual case. At the same time, it is evident from the sentencing transcript that general deterrence was \u201cjust one element in the [district court\u2019s] analysis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1533, and the district court considered many other factors before sentencing Ulbricht to life in prison. Thus, the factor of general deterrence, \u201cas explained by the district court, can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in this case.\u201d <em>Rigas, </em>583 F.3d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Finally, Ulbricht and <em>amici </em>point out that life sentences are rare in the federal system, typically reserved for egregious violent crimes, thus rendering Ulbricht\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Moreover, according to <em>amici, </em>life sentences are normally imposed in cases where that is the district judge\u2019s only sentencing Option. Thus, they claim that Ul-bricht\u2019s life sentence is substantively unreasonable in the context of the federal system, where life sentences are particularly rare for those with no criminal histo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>ry who are convicted of drug crimes.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We agree with Ulbricht that life sentences are extraordinary and infrequent, which is as it should be. But the rarity of life sentences does not mean that the imposition of such a sentence in this case is substantively unreasonable under our law. Each case must be considered on its own facts and in light of all of the circumstances of a particular offense as well as other relevant conduct, which, in this case, includes five attempted murders for hire. As we have described, the district court carefully considered Ulbricht\u2019s offense, his personal characteristics, and the context for his crimes, recognizing that only exceptional cases justify such a severe sentence. Although we might not have imposed the same sentence ourselves in the first instance, on the facts of this case a life sentence was \u201cwithin the range of permissible decisions\u201d that the district court could have reached. <em>Rigas, </em>583 F.3d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We do not reach our conclusion lightly.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> A life sentence is the second most severe penalty that may be imposed in the federal criminal justice system. \u201cThe size of [Ulbricht\u2019s] sentence alone [therefore] counsels our careful, searching review of it.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Brown, 843 F.3d 74, 85 (2d Cir. 2016) (Sack., J., concurring). Courts have the power to condemn a young man to die in prison, and judges must exercise that power only in a small number of cases after the deepest thought and reflection. Of course, any \u201csentencing proceeding is a solemn occasion at which the judge has the weighty duty of determining the fate of another human being.\u201d <em>United States v. Alcantara, </em>396 F.3d 189, 199 (2d Cir. 2005). We must be especially sensitive to that duty where the most severe sentences are in question. The district court gave Ulbricht\u2019s sentence the thorough consideration that it required, reviewing the voluminous sentencing submissions, analyzing the factors required by law, and carefully weighing Ulbricht\u2019s mitigating arguments. The extraordinarily detailed sentencing transcript shows that the district court appreciated its important responsibility in considering a sentence of such magnitude and carried out that responsibility with care and prudence. Under the law, we cannot say that its decision was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\">.

DPR paid Nob $80,000 to carry out the murder, which Force faked to make Ulbricht believe that the task was complete.

The district court did not specifically address one of the six deaths. That decedent was a frequent Silk Road customer who was found dead in his home with a used syringe and other drug paraphernalia.

Data are transmitted on the Internet via discrete packets, rather than in a continuous stream. TCP is a \"communications protocol used to process such data packets associated with popular Internet applications,\" such as browser and email applications. S.A. 97. Like IP address data, the TCP data that the orders permitted the government to acquire do not include the contents of communications, and Ulbricht has not expressed any independent concern over the government\u2019s collection of TCP connection data.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">. Some of the pen/trap orders phrased the scope of the order slightly differently. For example, one order authorized installing \"a trap and trace device to identify the source [IP] address of any Internet communications directed to, and a pen register to determine the destination IP addresses of any Internet communications originating from,\u201d the relevant devices. S.A. 67. In other words, not every order sought TCP connection data as well as IP address information. Neither party has suggested that the differences among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>pen/trap orders are material to any issue presented by this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. In the district court, Ulbricht made the same arguments concerning his Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the information captured by the pen registers and trap and trace devices. The district court ruled generally that the \"type of information sought [in the orders] was entirely appropriate for that type of order.\u201d App\u2019x 208. The court declined to address Ulbricht's \u201cnovel Fourth Amendment arguments\u201d regarding the pen/ trap devices because he had \u201cnot established the requisite privacy interest ... to\u201d demonstrate his standing to challenge the orders. <em>Id. </em>The government has agreed that Ulbricht has standing to pursue his Fourth Amendment arguments on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b122-5\">. The issue presented in this case is narrowly confined to orders that are limited to the capture of IP addresses, TCP connection data, and similar routing information. Our holding therefore does not address other, more invasive surveillance techniques that capture more information (such as content), which may require a warrant issued on probable cause or an order pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-22. <em>See generally In the Matter of a Wairanl for All Content &amp; Other Info.

Similarly, to the extent that some of the out-of-circuit cases cited in the text also address the Fourth Amendment status of other types of evidence, such as historical cell-site location information, we express no views on such issues, which are not presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">. Ulbricht's alternative argument, that the pen/trap orders violated the Pen/Trap Act and the Stored Communications Act (\"SCA\u201d) because they sought prospective data, is without merit. Ulbricht claims that the orders were obtained both through the Pen/Trap Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3121-27, and the SCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d). To the contrary, each pen/trap order (and the underlying requests for such orders) relied exclusively on the Pen/Trap Act, not the SCA. The fact that one of the government\u2019s goals was to monitor IP address traffic to match Ulbricht\u2019s Internet activity with DPR\u2019s does not undermine the validity of the orders. The orders themselves did not allow the government to track the location of the router and other equipment to which the trap and trace device was attached. Thus, they were not \u201cgeo-locating\u201d devices, as Ulbricht suggests, any more than subpoenas for hotel registers, parking tickets, and credit card receipts, or any other methods by which the government obtains information that can be used to identify a suspect\u2019s location at particular points in time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. In addition to preventing general searches, the particularity requirement serves two other purposes not relevant to this appeal: \"preventing the seizure of objects upon the mistaken assumption that they fall within the magistrate's authorization, and preventing the issuance of warrants without a substantial factual basis.\" <em>United States v. Young, </em>745 F.2d 733, 759 (2d Cir. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b124-6\">. Because the warrant incorporated the affidavit by reference, we refer to the documents together as the Laptop Warrant for the sake of simplicity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">. Ulbricht does not challenge the existence of probable cause to believe both that he committed these offenses and that the laptop would contain evidence of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b125-6\">. The district court ruled that Ulbricht did not have standing to raise his Fourth Amendment challenges because he did not establish that he had a personal expectation of privacy in the laptop or his Facebook and Google accounts. We express no view on that issue, since the district court also reached the merits of the motion to suppress and the government has agreed that Ulbricht has standing to challenge the warrants and accompanying searches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">. It is worth noting that Ulbricht does not challenge the validity of the search warrant covering his home, although that warrant is quite similar to the Laptop Warrant and appears to be just as broad. Specifically, the home search warrant allows the government to search for and seize evidence concerning Ulbricht\u2019s travel or patterns of movement and any of his communications or writings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. We note that Ulbrieht and <em>amicus </em>NACDL somewhat exaggerate the novelty of computer searches in this regard. A traditional physical search for paper \"drug records\u201d or \"tax records\u201d may entail a similar examination of all sorts of files and papers to determine whether such records are hidden in files with innocuous or misleading names or written in coded terms to mask their content. For obvious reasons, search warrants authorizing the seizure of such evidence have not traditionally specified that agents may look only at file folders labeled \"drug records\u201d or may seize only papers containing the word \"cocaine\u201d\u2014the equivalent of the <em>ex ante </em>\"search terms\u201d demanded by Ulbrieht.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">. Evidence revealing a suspect's past movements is often highly relevant to a criminal investigation. Such evidence might be used to establish\u2014or rule out\u2014the suspect's presence at a crime scene or other pertinent location at a particular time. It may also disclose other, unrelated information about the suspect's non-criminal associations, interests, and behavior, and may be drawn from a wide variety of sources. Government efforts to develop such information, including by search warrants authorizing its seizure, are not inherently questionable under the Fourth Amendment. Using piecemeal or laborious investigative techniques, it might take law enforcement officers a great deal of time and effort to compile a comprehensive record of a suspect's travel or other movements. The fact that extensive travel records are stored on a digital device and may be accessed readily via a keystroke or quick search does not immunize those records from seizure. Indeed, the seizure of a paper journal or calendar in a conventional search will often allow officers to map out a defendant\u2019s travel history with similar ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b128-5\">. The government also contends that, even if the warrants were invalid, the good faith exception prevents the application of the exclusionary rule. In general, the \"exclusion of evidence is inappropriate when the government acts in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant, even when the warrant is subsequently invalidated.\u201d <em>Ganias, </em>824 F.3d at 221 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because we conclude that all three of the warrants were valid, we need not address the government\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. The government required such an order because grand jury proceedings are secret and a government attorney \u201cmust not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury,\u201d Rule 6(e)(2)(B)(vi), Fed.

Portions of the district court opinion were redacted because they referenced the defendant\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>submissions explaining how he would use information related to the Force investigation at trial. This Court has reviewed an unredacted version of the district court opinion in connection with this appeal, but not the <em>ex parte </em>letters that the opinion references.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">. As noted, above, <em>see </em>note 5, we have carefully considered to what extent it is appropriate to refer to portions of the record that remain under seal. We have been especially careful in describing the portions of the district court\u2019s opinion that remain redacted and therefore are still not available to the government or to the public. We appreciate that charges against Ulbricht remain pending in Maryland and that the redacted information describes what would have been his trial strategy had he been able to reference Force\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>corruption. We have thus described the defense\u2019s redacted arguments at a fairly high level of generality. We are confident that any experienced prosecutor could anticipate those arguments, and that in any event the information is largely stated or implied in Ulbricht's own publicly filed briefs on appeal. Particularly given that our description relates to how the Force information might have been used at a trial that is now completed, and that we now hold that Ulbricht is not entitled to a new trial, we conclude that the public\u2019s need to understand and evaluate Ulbricht\u2019s arguments that he was unfairly prejudiced by the district court\u2019s rulings, as well as our reasons for rejecting those arguments, outweighs any minimal interest that Ulbricht might have in withholding his contentions from the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. Even on appeal, moreover, after the disclosure of additional information in the prosecutions of Bridges and Force, Ulbricht does not provide any concrete explanation of how the techniques used by the corrupt agents to steal money from Silk Road could have been used, by them or by others, to plant the massive amounts of incriminating information found on Ulbricht\u2019s laptop and in his house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\">. For example, the government declined to present evidence of DPR\u2019s attempt to commission an additional murder because that conduct involved Force acting as Nob.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\">. Moreover, the district court specifically ruled that it would entertain Ulbricht\u2019s applications to rely on specific parts of the letter at trial if doing so would be necessary for effective cross-examination. Thus, Ulbricht was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>given the opportunity to show particularized need in the context of specific trial evidence. Ulbrieht has not identified any point in the trial where he attempted to show that Force\u2019s behavior had become relevant to challenging the credibility of particular aspects of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">. Ulbricht filed his Rule 33 motion on March 6, 2015.

In particular, Ulbricht\u2019s disclosures did not discuss, and he has not described on appeal, how one expert's proposed testimony on \"[g]eneral principles of internet security and vulnerabilities\u201d would have linked to the defense claim that the damning documentary evidence of Ulbricht's guilt found on his laptop was or could have been fabricated or planted. The jury was aware from other evidence, and indeed it is within ordinary lay experience, that various forms of hacking are possible. What was lacking, what the defense expert disclosures did not purport to address, and what Ulbricht still has not provided on appeal, is any explanation, let alone a credible explanation, of how the breadth and variety of information, from the laptop and other sources, could have been planted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b140-4\">.

No evidence about the source of those Bit-coins was in fact presented by Ulbricht, and neither the expert disclosures presented to the district court nor Ulbricht's arguments on appeal suggest that either Bellovin or Antono-poulos would have provided an analysis or explanation of Ulbricht's Bitcoin transactions that would have revealed a non-Silk Road source for Ulbricht\u2019s Bitcoins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">.

Ulbricht also contends on appeal that the government's objection to the testimony, which occurred at a later sidebar, was untimely. He cites no law in support of that argument.

Sentencing <em>amici </em>make a similar argument, claiming that a complex array of causes are responsible for drug-related deaths, including societal failures. Assuming that is correct, the increased availability of drugs is certainly one of the causes of overdose and other drug-related accidental deaths. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Silk Road, which was by all accounts a market-expanding drug enterprise, contributed to the general social costs of drug trafficking. Those harms are numerous and include the risk of death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b150-5\">. Ulbricht does not argue that the evidence related to the accidental overdose deaths should have been excluded due to its emotional nature; his argument is based solely on the claim that the evidence was irrelevant because the deaths were not sufficiently linked to Silk Road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. Ulbricht does not challenge the propriety of those statements apart from his general argument that it was procedurally unreasonable to consider the six deaths as relevant to his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\">. In a footnote in his reply brief, Ulbricht raises for the first time an additional argument: that the district court improperly gave him a life sentence because of the political and philosophical beliefs that led him to start Silk Road in the first instance. Ulbricht argues that reliance on political beliefs at sentencing is prohibited by the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.10, and the First Amendment. The district court reflected on Ulbricht\u2019s philosophy, however, only in the course of discussing his character and his reasons for committing the offense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). That discussion was relevant to sentencing. Ulbricht, as the district court con-eluded, \u201cviewed Silk Road both as above the law and the laws didn't apply.\u201d App\u2019x 1515. He appeared to believe that his personal views about the propriety of the drug laws and the paramount role of individual liberty entitled him to violate democratically-enacted criminal prohibitions. For example, some of his Silk Road posts \"discuss the laws as the oppressor\u201d and proclaim that \"each transaction is a victory over the oppressor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1516. That Ulbricht believes that drug use should be legalized is not relevant to sentencing; that he believes he is entitled to break the laws that prohibit certain substances is rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>vant to his likelihood of recidivism, a mandated sentencing consideration. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). The district court therefore did not sentence Ulbricht based on any prohibited characteristic, nor did the court place more weight on that factor than the facts warranted. <em>Cf. United States v. Jenkins, </em>854 F.3d 181 (2d Cir. 2017) (vacating a sentence as substantively unreasonable where the district court relied exclusively on the defendant\u2019s \"disdain for the law\u201d in \"dramatically increasing\" a defendant\u2019s sentence for child pornography offenses). Ulbricht\u2019s disrespect for the law was simply one factor that the district court considered in imposing sentence, along with many others, and was not accorded undue weight in determining the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\">. As explained, Silk Road also trafficked in illegal goods such as counterfeit identification documents and computer hacking tools and services. When the government shut down Silk Road, there were 156 listings for forged identity documents on the site. The specific computer hacking tools available included software for compromising usernames and passwords of electronic accounts, including email and Facebook; Remote Access Tools (\"RATs\u201d) that allow hackers to obtain remote access to a victim's computer, including turning on and using the computer's webcam; keyloggers, which allow a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim to discern their passwords and other sensitive information; and Distributed Denial of Service (\"DDoS\u201d) tools, which allow hackers to disable websites by flooding networks with malicious Internet traffic. Silk Road also offered money laundering services through vendors who sold U.S. currency and anonymous debit cards. Because the adjusted offense levels for those groups of offenses were substantially lower than the offense level for the drug group, they did not contribute to Ulbricht's overall offense level. In assessing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, however, it is well to remember that the sentence encompassed Ulbricht\u2019s role not only in the distribution of controlled substances, but in a wide variety of other criminal offenses as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\">. Note that such a sentence is <em>mandatory </em>under federal law for selling just five kilograms of cocaine after two prior convictions for <em>any </em>felony narcotics offense, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and the Supreme Court has upheld against constitutional challenge a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for selling 650 grams of cocaine, <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b155-6\">. Ulbrieht does not mention his orders for the commission of those murders until his reply brief. Even there, he does not argue that the district court erred in concluding that he deliberately commissioned those murders; rather, he claims instead only that the murders did not support a life sentence because they did not actually take place. But in evaluating Ulbricht's character and dangerousness, the most relevant points are that he wanted the murders to be committed, he paid for them, and he believed that they had been carried out. The fact that his hired assassin may have defrauded him does not reflect positively on Ulbricht's character. Commissioning the murders significantly justified the life sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\">. In his reply, Ulbricht references other instances in which people involved with Silk Road (and its apparent reincarnation, Silk Road 2.0) received significantly lower sentences. Ulbricht does not provide sufficient detail about those individuals' conduct, however, to permit meaningful comparisons with his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">. Ulbricht did sell drugs on Silk Road for at least some brief period of time, when he grew and sold hallucinogenic mushrooms to drum up interest in the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">. <em>Amici </em>also claim that Ulbricht\u2019s life sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. That argument is plainly incorrect in light of binding Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. <em>See Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. In his reply, Ulbricht raises a distinct but related argument for the first time. He argues that \"concurrences from Supreme Court opinions and dissents from denials of certio-rari suggest[ ] that judicial factfinding violates a defendant's constitutional right to a jury trial where the factfinding renders reasonable an otherwise substantively unreasonable sentence.\u201d Reply Br. 60. For that proposition, he cites <em>United States v. Hebert, </em>813 F.3d 551, 563 (5th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 137 S.Ct. 37, 196 L.Ed.2d 26 (2016), <em>Jones v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 8, 190 L.Ed.2d 279 (2014) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>551 F.3d 381, 386 (6th Cir. 2008) (Merritt, J., dissenting). His argument, however, has no support in existing law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\">. The life sentence is particularly severe because, as in all federal cases, Ulbricht will never be eligible for parole. Unlike state sentences in jurisdictions permitting a sentence of, for example, \"25 years to life,\u201d there is no automatic reconsideration of this sentence, or of whether an offender has reformed, after any lengthy period of incarceration. We note that, particularly in the case of a young offender, the prisoner will all but certainly change (for better or worse) after many years of incarceration. In a system without parole, however, a sentencing court is forced to exercise its best judgment to predict whether a sentence of life imprisonment or one of 25, 30, or 50 years is required to serve the purposes of sentencing, without the option of deferring that judgment to a point at which the effects of incarceration, and the passage of time, will be more apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
