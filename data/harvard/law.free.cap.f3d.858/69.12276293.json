Exec. Law \u00a7 296(6), (15).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-20\">Plaintiffs-appellants Trathony Griffin and Michael Godwin (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are two former employees of Astro Moving and Storage Co. (\u201cAstro\u201d), which provides certain moving and storage services under contract to defendant-appellee Allied Van Lines, Inc. (\u201cAllied\u201d). Griffin and Godwin\u2019s direct employer, Astro, which is not a party to this appeal, terminated Griffin and Godwin after discovering their past criminal convictions through a background check. Because Astro had signed a contract under which Allied prohibited any individuals convicted of certain crimes from working on Allied jobs, Griffin and Godwin allege that Allied and defendant-appellee Sirva, Inc., as Allied\u2019s parent company, can be held liable under the NYSHRL, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 290 et seq., for employment discrimination on the basis of their criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Brodie, <em>J.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and granted Sirva and Allied\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that Section 296(15) applied only to the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>See Griffin v. Sirva, Inc., </em>No. 11-CV-1844, 2014 WL 2434196, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. May 29, 2014). The district court examined a variety of cases discussing how an entity is determined to be an individual\u2019s \u201cemployer.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *11-*13. Because Griffin and Godwin were not employed by either Allied or Sirva, the district court determined that Allied and Sirva could not be held liable under the NYSHRL for Astro\u2019s termination of Griffin and Godwin. <em>Id. </em>at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">On August 30, 2016, this Court entered an order certifying three questions to the New York Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\"><em>First, </em>does Section 296(15) limit liability for unlawful denial of employment only to the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d? <em>Second, </em>if Section 296(15) is limited in that way, how should courts determine whether an entity is the aggrieved party\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d for the purposes of a claim under Section 296(15)? <em>Third, </em>does the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d liability provision of the NYSHRL, Section 296(6), apply to Section 296(15) such that a non-employer may be liable under Section 296(15) as an aider and abettor of an employer\u2019s unlawful denial of employment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\"><em>Griffin v. Sirva Inc., </em>835 F.3d 283, 285 (2d Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On May 4, 2017, the New York Court of Appeals issued its decision in response to this Court\u2019s certified questions. <em>Griffin v. Sirva, Inc., </em>29 N.Y.3d 174, 54 N.Y.S.3d 360, 76 N.E.3d 1063, 2017 WL 1712423 (2017). The New York Court of Appeals answered the first certified question in the affirmative, as the district court had, holding that liability under Section 296(15) is limited to an aggrieved party\u2019s employer. <em>Id., </em>29 N.Y.3d at 181, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 362, 76 N.E.3d 1063; <em>see Griffin, </em>2014 WL 2434196, at *10-*11.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">With respect to the second certified question, the New York Court of Appeals reformulated the question posed as: \u201cif Section 296(15) is limited to an employer, how should courts determine whether an entity is the aggrieved party\u2019s \u2018employer\u2019 for the purposes of a claim under Section 296(15)?\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>29 N.Y.3d at 185, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 365, 76 N.E.3d 1063, (brackets omitted). Based on New York case law, the New York Court of Appeals identified four factors to use in determining whether an entity is an aggrieved party\u2019s employer: \u201c(1) the selection and engagement of the servant; (2) the payment of salary or wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the power of control of the servant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 29 N.Y.3d at 186, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 366, 76 N.E.3d 1063 (citing <em>State Div. of Human Rights v. GTE Corp., </em>109 A.D.2d 1082, 1083, 487 N.Y.S.2d 234 (1985)). The New York Court of Appeals concluded that \u201ccommon-law principles, as discussed in <em>GTE, </em>determine who may be liable as an employer under [S]ection 296(15) of the [New York State] Human Rights Law, with greatest emphasis placed on the alleged employer\u2019s power to order and control the employee in his or her performance of work.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>29 N.Y.3d at 186, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 366, 76 N.E.3d 1063, (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">With respect to the third certified question, the New York Court of Appeals reformulated the question posed as follows: \u201cwhether [Sjection 296(6) extends liability to an out-of-state nonemployer who aids or abets employment discrimination against individuals with a prior criminal convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 29 N.Y.3d at 187, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 366, 76 N.E.3d 1063. The New York Court of Appeals answered this question in the affirmative. <em>Id. </em>The New York Court of Appeals decided that the district court had read Section 296(6) too narrowly, and explained that \u201cSection 296(6) extends liability to persons and entities beyond joint employers,\u201d that \u201cSection 296(6) ... applies to out-of-state defendants,\u201d and that the \u201cprovision should be construed broadly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 15, 29 N.Y.3d. at 187, 188, 54 N.Y.S.3d at 367, 76 N.E.3d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE the order of the district court to the extent that it conflicts with the decision of the New York Court of Appeals and REMAND the case for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
