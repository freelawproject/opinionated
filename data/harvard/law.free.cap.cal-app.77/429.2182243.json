Gripton, mortgagee (or trustee), whose mail address is - as interest may appear. Subject to all the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth in this rider, this insurance, as to the interest of the mortgagee only therein, shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or owner of the within described property, nor by any foreclosure or other proceedings or notice of sale relating to the property, nor by any change in the title or ownership of. the property, nor by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the occupation of the premises for purposes more hazardous than are permitted by this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cCondition One\u2014In case the mortgagor or owner shall neglect to pay any premium due under this policy, the mortgagee (or trustee) shall, on demand, pay the same. <em>. . . \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellant urges as the ground for his appeal that the paragraph of the mortgage clause designated therein as \u201cCondition One,\u201d should not be construed as a covenant on his part to pay the premiums, but as a condition which, if not complied with, would prevent recovery by him under the preceding provisions thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In the few cases wherein similar clauses have been considered the word \u201cprovided\u201d was used where in the instant case the word \u201cCondition\u201d appears, the decisions following the determination from the use of the word in connection with the provision that \u201cin case the mortgagor or owner shall neglect to pay any premium due under this policy the mortgagee (or trustee) shall on demand pay the same\u201d whether a condition or a covenant should be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">In <em>St. Paul Fire etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>2 N. D. 229 [50 N. W. 702], the clause mentioned was construed as an absolute agreement to pay the premiums; while in the later cases of <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>40 R. I. 367 [L. R. A. 1917F, 375, 100 Atl. 1010], and <em>Coykendall </em>v. <em>Blackmer, </em>161 App. Div. 11 [146 N. Y. Supp. 631], the same clause being under consideration, it was held that a .condition and not a covenant was thereby created; and such was the view of the author of the opinion in <em>Johnson, Sansom &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Fort Worth State Bank </em>(Tex. Civ. App.) 244 S. W. 657, the question, however, not being decided in the latter case.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">In <em>Boston Safe Dep. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>59 Kan. 570 [53 Pac. 472], the ease principally relied upon by respondent, and which was distinguished upon its facts in the two cases last cited, the facts were that the agent of the mortgagee negotiated for the insurance and the mortgage clauses were attached at his request, these circumstances being considered by the court in construing the clause in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">In <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra, </em>the court said: \u201cThere is nothing in the context of this instrument which requires a construction of this clause as a covenant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The parties have used the technical word \u2018provided,\u2019 to which the courts in insurance cases have applied a certain well-known construction. The mortgage clause in question is in the standard form, and presumably was carefully worded by experienced lawyers who were familiar with the customary legal construction of the word. Had the intention been that the word \u2018provided\u2019 as used in this clause should not be given its primary legal meaning and effect, but that the clause should be construed as a covenant rather than as a condition, any possible ambiguity could easily have been removed by the addition of a few words such as \u2018and it is agreed\u2019 or any similar phrase.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The language of the clause is to be construed most strongly against the insurers (26 Cor. Jur., Fire Insurance, 72; <em>Welch </em>v. <em>British American Assur. Co., </em>148 Cal. 223 [113 Am. St. Rep. 223, 7 Ann. Cas. 396, 82 Pac. 964]; <em>Pacific Heating etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Williamsburg etc. Ins. Co., </em>158 Cal. 367 [111 Pac. 4]; <em>Greer-Robbins Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania, </em>47 Cal. App. 63 [190 Pac. 187]); and if the word \u201cprovided\u201d as used in the policies considered in <em>St. Paul Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Upton &amp; Boston. Safe Dep. &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>might in the'connection stated be held to be equivocal, and that a condition was <em>not </em>thereby expressed with certainty, the use of the word \u201ccondition\u201d in the same connection fairly removed the ambiguity and clearly expressed the intention that the clause should be construed in the sense which the word implies, namely, as a condition, and not a covenant.  While the court found that the mortgage clauses in the instant case were attached at the request of appellant, the evidence shows that, according to his agreement with the mortgagor, the latter was to procure insurance upon the mortgaged property, the loss to be payable to the former as further security; that the policies were procured through the agency of a broker, who, at the invitation of appellant\u2019s attorney, met at the latter\u2019s of6.ee in San Francisco the manager of the corporation mortgagor, at which conference the attorney was present. The broker was then advised as to the amount of insurance and the form of the policies required. Thereafter the persons mentioned, with an agent for one of the insurers, visited the property, following which the policies were issued to the broker and delivered to the attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Through an oversight on the part of the broker the mortgage clauses were not then attached, but were by him, at the request of the attorney, procured, these with the policies being subsequently delivered to the appellant in accordance with the original agreement with the insured. Had an ambiguity appeared in the expression of the intention of the parties in the mortgage clauses, this evidence, which supports the finding mentioned, would have been relevant for the purpose of ascertaining such intention; but where, as here, the intention is expressed with certainty, the circumstances shown and the finding were immaterial. <em>(Salter </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>171 Cal. 790, 792 [155 Pac. 84].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>16 Colo. App. 271 [64 Pac. 1053], cited and relied upon by respondent, a mortgagee, in consideration of the renewal of certain policies insuring the mortgaged property, agreed unconditionally to pay the premiums. In the instant ease such facts do not appear. There were procured by the broker, as testified by him, two extensions of the time for the payment of the premiums, the first upon his representation that payment would be made (for which no authority from appellant was shown), and the second following the request that appellant make such payment. The latter request followed the voluntary bankruptcy of the insured, at which time appellant had taken possession of the mortgaged property under the terms of his mortgage, the appellant in reply thereto stating that the property might be taken over by others in which event, as testified by the broker, \u201che would try to turn the policies to whatever interests might take over the plant.\u201d No other or further promise was shown, and it is not contended that the extensions were otherwise induced or that appellant failed in any respect to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">It being our conclusion that the clause mentioned should be construed as a condition, and that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the mortgagee, after the issuance of the policies and the attachment thereto of the mortgage clauses, expressly or impliedly promised to pay the premiums, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Tyler, P. J., and Knight, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
