The petitioners recognized the compensability of the injury by furnishing him with medical treatment and compensating him up to April, 1924. In December, 1924, Bohan ascertained for the first time that the injury, which the insurance company\u2019s doctor had previously indicated to him was only of a temporary nature, had developed into one of a permanent character, and on May 12, 1925, after said insurance company had refused to recognize the permanent nature of the disability or to compensate him therefor, filed an application with the respondent Commission for an adjustment of his claim. Petitioners filed no answer to the application, but at the hearing urged the objection that Bohan\u2019s claim was barred by lapse of time. This objection was not sustained, and the Commission held, properly we think, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Bohan\u2019s injury, having changed from a temporary to a permanent disability, constituted a \u201cnew and further disability\u201d within the meaning of subdivision c of section 11 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act [Stats. 1917, p. 841], and therefore entitled him to further compensation. In support of its decision on this latter point the respondent Commission calls attention to the fact that recently the supreme court has denied petitions for writs of review in two cases having for their purpose the annulment of awards made in proceedings involving facts similar to those presented here, that is, where temporary disabilities had afterward become permanent. <em>(Imperial Ice &amp; Development Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>11 Cal. I. A. C. 131; <em>Otis Elevator Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. and M. J. O\u2019Connor, </em>12 I. A. C. 242. See, also, <em>Anaheim Co-operative Orange Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>70 Cal. App. 168 [233 Pac. 1116]; <em>Assurance Corp</em>. v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>57 Cal. App. 257 [207 Pac. 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">The main contention made by petitioners is, however, that under section 11 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act a claim based upon a new and further disability must be filed within a period of six months after the date on which the new and further disability is ascertainable, and that since it appears in the instant case that Bohan knew in July, 1924, that he \u201cwas no better\u201d and could have ascertained then through medical advice the true character of the injury, his failure to file an application within six months thereafter bars his right to have his claim considered. To this contention the respondent Commission replies that subdivision c of section 11 of said act, which confers upon the Commission continuing jurisdiction for a period of 245 weeks to grant additional compensation for a new and further disability contains no requirement that an application for compensation based upon that ground shall be filed within a period of six months after the nature of the disability is ascertainable. The respondent Commission concedes that in a series of causes it .has denied relief where the claim has not been filed within a period of six months after the claimant had become aware of the fact that a new and further disability had developed, but it is pointed out that the enforcement of such rul\u00e9 of limitation was not based upon express statutory enactment, but was grounded upon the doctrine of laches; and that in the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>there is no evidence to establish any of the elements of such doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">We are of the opinion that the position taken by the Commission must be sustained. The statute specifies no such limitation of time for the filing of an application based upon a new and further disability; and as to the matter of laches, the facts revealed by the record, including those set forth in Bohan\u2019s application, are as follows: For a week or two following the happening of the accident Bohan was eared for by petitioners in a hospital in Oroville, and was then sent to San Francisco to the insurance company\u2019s doctor for further treatment, arriving there in November, 1923. He called first at the office of the respondent Commission, but was referred to the representative of the petitioner insurance company, who, after paying Bohan a certain amount of compensation and expenses, told him that he \u201cshould not go further to the Commission,\u201d that the insurance company \u201cwould take complete care of him and pay him everything that was coming to him. \u2019 \u2019 He was thereupon sent by said company to a hospital. On March 12,1924, an operation was performed on his knee, the report of the surgeon showing that the quadriceps extensor to the right leg were sutured about one inch above its insertion at the patella, at which point it had been almost completely ruptured, and that there was only a small portion of the vastus externus which had not been ruptured, and it was through this small portion that the little motion the leg had was carried on. Bohan continued to remain in the hospital until March 26, 1924, on which date he received his last medical and surgical treatment. At that time the doctor supplied him with an elastic bandage, telling him to wear it for two months, and that he \u201cwould be all right.\u201d He was then discharged, the doctor telling him further to write \u201chow he was getting along.\u201d Bohan thereupon went to Sacramento to stay with friends until he was able to go to work. About two weeks later, and on April 8, 1924, his compensation was discontinued, although at that time it was apparent that he would not be able to work for approximately two months. Bohan continued to wear the elastic bandage as instructed for two months, but at the end of that period his knee \u201cdid not feel any better.\u201d The wound caused by the operation had not healed, and, as Bohan expressed it, when he \u201cwould walk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>up\u201d his knee would \u201cnearly fall out,\u201d and going downstairs he could \u201chardly walk.\u201d In July his knee \u201cfelt a little better,\u201d and although it had not healed, he accepted employment with another company, but after working a few hours was forced to quit. Thereupon Bohan wrote to the insurance company\u2019s physician as instructed, stating that he \u201cwas not getting well\u201d and asking for additional compensation. He waited until December of that year for a reply and receiving none returned to San Francisco. He called first upon the insurance company\u2019s doctor, and afterward visited the Commission, whereupon an examination of his knee was made under the direction of the assistant medical director of the Commission. It was then determined that the injury to his knee was permanent, and Bohan was so informed. In fact there had been no improvement in his condition since July, but the advice thus imparted to him by the medical department of the Commission in December was the first information he had received that his disability was permanent. In February, 1925, he was given a new rating by the medical department of the Commission, which the insurance company refused to recognize, and also refused to pay Bohan further compensation. On May 12, 1925, formal application for further compensation was filed with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u25a0 There is no contention made by petitioners that prior to December, 1924, Bohan knew that his injury was permanent; and obviously, in view of the statements made to him in March by the insurance company\u2019s doctor, the only reasonable impression Bohan could have formed in regard to his condition in July was that his injury was still of a temporary nature, requiring only further medical treatment. This he endeavored to obtain by writing as directed to said doctor, but his letter, so far as the evidence discloses, was ignored, and after vainly waiting a reasonable length of time, in the apparent hope that the doctor\u2019s statement to him that he \u201cwould be all right\u201d would prove true, went \u2022 to San Francisco in December, where he was told for the first time the true extent of his disability. The delay thereafter in filing the application was attributed by Bohan to the fact that he still depended upon the insurance company to carry out its promises made to him in November, 1923, that they would take complete care of him and pay him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>everything that was coming to him. Their refusal to do so did not take place until February, 1925, and in any event Bohan\u2019s application for further compensation was filed within six months after he learned of his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In view of the foregoing facts it is our opinion that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the situation presented was not a proper one for the application of the doctrine of laches must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The award is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Tyler, P.
