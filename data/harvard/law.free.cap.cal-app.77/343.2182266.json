J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaI\">This is an action to recover upon a liability insurance policy. Plaintiff is the assignee of the assured. A general demurrer to the complaint was over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ruled. Defendant elected to stand upon its demurrer and declined to answer, whereupon a judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff for $500 and costs. Defendant claims that the complaint does not state a cause of action and that its demurrer was improperly overruled. The sufficiency of the complaint turns upon the construction to be placed upon the word \u201caccident,\u201d as employed in a clause of the policy which limits defendant\u2019s liability to $1,000 for claims arising from \u201cone accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\">The facts alleged in the complaint are substantially these: On July 29, 1920, defendant executed and issued to the assured a policy which insured him for the term of one year against liability to other persons for injury to or destruction of their property resulting from the use of the assured\u2019s automobile, a Harmon touring car. Defendant is referred to in the policy as the \u201cExchange.\u201d The provisions of the instrument which are germane to the present inquiry read: \u201cIn consideration of an additional deposit of $13.95 this policy also covers Assured\u2019s legal liability to other persons for injury to or destruction of the property of such persons . . . resulting solely and directly from the ownership, maintenance and/or use of the automobile herein described . . . , subject, however, to the following limitations and exclusions: (1) the Exchange\u2019s liability for such injury or destruction is limited to the actual value of the property destroyed at the time of its destruction, . . . but in no case shall the Exchange be liable with respect to claims (including claims for loss of use) arising from <em>one accident </em>for more than one thousand dollars.\u201d (Italics ours.) On March 27, 1921, the policy then being in full force and effect, the assured, by and through his chauffeur, was driving his Harmon car in a southerly direction upon a state highway in California. At the same time two other automobiles\u2014one an Overland owned by a man of the name of Chance, and the other a Cadillac owned by the Keck Company, a corporation\u2014were being driven in a northerly direction on the same highway; the Cadillac was traveling about 100 feet to the rear of the Overland; the Harmon car was so negligently operated by the assured\u2019s chauffeur that it collided with the Overland, damaging the latter vehicle in the sum of $500; the force of that collision broke the steering-gear of the Harmon, causing it to become un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>manageable, so that its path of travel could not be controlled, by reason whereof its course was so deflected toward the east side of the highway that it collided with the Cadillac, damaging it in the sum of $1,500 and causing the assured to incur a liability to pay that amount of money to the owner of that <em>ear; </em>defendant already has paid $1,000 to the owner of the Cadillac; that sum is the total amount which has been paid by it on account of these collisions; the owner of the Overland has recovered a judgment against the assured in the sum of $500, which remains unpaid; defendant refuses to pay that judgment or any part of it, and disclaims all further liability under its policy of insurance. The action was brought to recover the amount for which the assured so became liable to the owner of the Overland.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\">| Appellant claims that though there were two \u201cinjuries\u201d\u2014 one to the Overland and the' other to the Cadillac\u2014there was but one \u201caccident,\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and that therefore it complied with its obligations under its contract of insurance when it paid the sum of $1,000 to the owner of the Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">It is only from a liability which grows out of negligence on the part of the assured, his agents or servants, that policies of this character are issued. <em>(Tinline </em>v. <em>White Cross Ins. Assn. </em>[1921], 3 K. B. 327, and notes to that case in 11 B. R. C., p. 265 et seq.) The policy indemnified the assured against sums which he shall become legally liable to pay to any other person as compensation for injury to \u25a0or destruction of the property of such other person. A man does not become liable to pay compensation -for accidental * injury to the property of another unless the accident is due to his wrongful act. As was said in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Stevens Motor Car Co., </em>203 Mo. App. 669 [220 S. W. 980], \u201cSuch so-called liability policies on automobiles, in general, protect the owner, or his agent or servant operating the same, from liability for his own negligence, and unless he, or his said agent or servant, is found to be negligent, there is no liability. This is the very purpose of such policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Here the assured\u2019s liability to the owner of each of the two automobiles damaged in the collisions accrued from one act of negligence on the part of the assured\u2019s servant, namely, the negligent operation of the Marmon car which caused it to collide first with the Overland and then with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Cadillac. This act of negligence, the one cause which set in motion all that followed, was the proximate cause of both collisions. That is to say, the chauffeur\u2019s negligence which caused the injury to the Overland was also the cause which, _ in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produced the injury to the Cadillac. Without the initial act of negligence the injury to the Cadillac would not have occurred. \u201cProximate cause\u201d literally means the cause nearest to the effect produced ; but in legal terminology it is not confined to its literal meaning.  Though a negligent act or omission be removed from the injury by intermediate causes or effects, yet if, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new efficient cause, it produces that injury, and if without it the injury would not' have happened, it is in law the proximate cause of such injury, or the <em>causa causans </em>of the schoolmen. Proximity in point of time or space is no part of the definition. That is of no importance except as it may afford evidence for or against proximity of causation. <em>(Dickson </em>v. <em>Omaha etc. Ry. Co., </em>124 Mo. 140 [46 Am. St. Rep. 429, 25 L. R. A. 320, 27 S. W. 476], quoting 1 Shearman and Redfield on Negligence, 4th ed., sec. 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">Though there was in this case but one proximate cause of the unexpected and untoward occurrence in which the double injury happened, it does not for that reason alone necessarily follow that the injuries resulted from but \u201cone accident,\u201d as that term is used in the policy. For obviously there is a clear distinction between the chauffeur\u2019s want of due care considered as the cause of the accident, and the accident considered as the cause of the resulting injuries. Whether there were two accidents or only one accident presents a question the solution whereof depends upon the meaning to be given to the word \u201caccident,\u201d as used in this contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The terms used in an insurance policy should be given their plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. We should, however, be careful on the one hand not to be over-liberal in our interpretation of the word \u201caccident,\u201d and on the other hand not to be too technical. But whether we give to the word, as used in this policy, a strict interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tation or assign to it a liberal and popular meaning, we think it must be held that there was but one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">The word \u201caccident\u201d probably has been discussed in adjudications as often as any other word in the English language. It is not a technical term, with a clearly defined meaning, and it has been used in more than one sense. In its most commonly accepted meaning it signifies an event which takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation. It was defined by Lord Macnaghten in <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Thorley etc., Ltd. </em>[1903], App. Gas. 443, as an \u201cunlocked for mishap or an untoward event which is not expected or designed.\u201d Its meaning is well stated in Corpus Juris (vol. 1, pp. 394, 395), where it is said: \u201cSpeaking generally, but with reference to legal liabilities, an accident means any unintended and unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss. But it is often used to denote any unintended and unexpected loss or hurt apart form its cause, and if the cause is not known the loss or hurt itself would certainly be called an accident. The word is also often used to denote both the cause and the effect, no attempt being made to discriminate between them.\u201d This definition, originally given by Lord Robertson in <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Thorley, supra, </em>is now generally accepted by the authorities. See <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>264 Fed. 69 [12 A. L. R. 1407].</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">It will be noticed that in Lord Robertson\u2019s definition an accident is an \u201coccurrence.\u201d It is an \u201coccurrence which produces hurt or injury.\u201d It also will be noticed that under this quite generally approved definition the word, as used in some classes of cases, denotes the cause of the hurt or loss; in other classes of cases it denotes the event, i. e., the unintended and unexpected loss or hurt apart from its cause; and in still other instances it may denote both the cause and the event, no attempt being made to discriminate between them. The use of the word to denote the unexpected and unintended result\u2014the loss or hurt\u2014\u25a0 rather than the cause is quite common in cases arising under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, as, for instance, where a workman performing his usual task in his wonted way suffers, by reason of strain, an internal injury that is itself sudden, unusual, and unexpected. <em>(Brown\u2019s Case, </em>123 Me. 424 [123 Atl. 421] ; <em>Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>177, Cal. 614 [L. R. A. 1918F, 856, 171 Pac. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>429]. See, also, <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Industrial Com., </em>69 Colo. 473 [19 A. L. R. 107, 195 Pac. 1097].) In 25 Harvard Law Review, 340, it is said: \u201cSince the case of <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Thorley, </em>nothing more is required [in eases arising under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts] than that the harm that the plaintiff has sustained shall be unexpected.\u201d This latitudinarian use of the word in that class of cases is justifiable for the reason that the phrase \u201cinjuries sustained by accident,\u201d as used in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts [Stats. 1913, p. 279], is to be given a broad interpretation in harmony with the evident purpose of such enactments and with the spirit of liberality in which they were conceived. <em>(Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra.) </em> But as commonly used in liability insurance policies, the word \u201caccident\u201d is predicated of an occurrence which is the <em>cause </em>of the injury. That is to say, as used in liability insurance contracts the word is employed to denote the cause, rather than the effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">In automobile accidents, particularly in such as involve collisions, the injury and its cause may be practically inseparable. They may be, and often are, inseparable in time and space. And yet in such instances the accident is clearly and necessarily the cause from which the resultant injury flows as an accident. In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., </em>142 Md. 472 [28 A. L. R. 1287 [121 Atl. 259], the court, having under consideration a liability insurance policy insuring an automobile owner, employed this language: \u201cThe meaning of the word \u2018loss,\u2019 as used in the clause under construction, is the injury or damage <em>caused </em>by the accident.\u201d (Italics ours.)  In <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual L. Ins. Co., </em>58 Mont. 121 [16 A. L. R. 601, 190 Pac. 993], the court, having under consideration the meaning of the word \u201caccident\u201d as used in an accident insurance policy, says: \u201cA result, though unexpected, is not an accident; the means or cause must be accidental.\u201d This language applies with equal force to such accidents as fall within the purview of liability insurance policies such as the one before us. Liability insurance is but a branch of accident and casualt;-' insurance. <em>(Employers\u2019 Liability Assur. Corp. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>155 Mass. 404 [29 N. E. 529]; <em>Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Basford, </em>31 S. D. 149 [139 N. W. 795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Where, as here, one negligent act or omission is the sole proximate cause, or <em>causa causans,- </em>there is, as a general rule, but one accident, even though there be several resultant injuries or losses. Let us suppose that in the instant case the owner of the Overland car had likewise been the owner of the Cadillac, and that the former vehicle had been towing the latter when the successive but causally' connected collisions occurred\u2014just as each car in a freight train pulls the car which is immediately behind it. Could it correctly be said in the case just supposed that there were two accidents, merely because two automobiles were damaged in sudden and unexpected crashes happening in continuous sequence as a connected chain of events, but springing from a single initial cause ? Clearly not. It would no more be correct to say of such a case that there were two accidents than it would be to predicate two or more accidents of a general freight train wreck, merely because two or more cars in the train might have been demolished in the same catastrophe. If, in our supposititious case, there would be but one accident, though two automobiles belonging to the same person were injured, then how could that accident become two accidents merely because, under the facts of this case, the two injured vehicles were separately operated and owned? To ask the question is to answer it.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">In <em>Allen </em>v. <em>London Guarantee etc. Co., </em>28 Terr. L. Rep. 254, the policy limited the liability of the insurance company to \u00a3300 for all claims arising out of \u201cany accident or occurrence.\u201d Two persons were injured in an accident caused by a cart belonging to the assured. It was held that there\u2019 was only one \u201coccurrence\u201d within the meaning of the policy, and that - therefore the limitation of defendant\u2019s liability to \u00a3300 applied. It is true that in that case the learned justice who rendered the decision was constrained to the view that there were two \u201caccidents,\u201d though only one \u201coccurrence.\u201d He appears to have been guided to this seeming incongruity by the interpretation which he put upon the decision of the court of appeal in <em>South Stafford-shire Tramways Co., Ltd., </em>v. <em>Sickness &amp; Accident Assur. Assn., Ltd. </em>[1891], 1 Q. B. 402\u2014a case presently to be adverted to by us. For our present purpose, however, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>suffices that the Allen case holds that there was but one \u201coccurrence,\u201d even though two persons were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">If it be proper to say that there is but one \u201coccurrence\u201d where two persons are injured in an automobile collision, then it is a mistake to say of such a case that there are two \u201caccidents\u201d; for in a general sense every automobile accident is an occurrence. In <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Ocean Accident </em>&amp; <em>Guarantee Corp., </em>96 Neb. 213 [52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 227, 147 N. W. 465], the court, speaking of an automobile indemnity insurance policy, says: \u201cAs used in an indemnity policy such as this, we are of opinion that the word \u2018 accident\u2019 means an undesigned and unforeseen <em>occurrence </em>of an afflictive or unfortunate character, resulting in bodily injury to a person other than the insured.\u201d (Italics ours.) If, as the Nebraska court says, the word \u201caccident,\u201d as used in an automobile indemnity policy, means an undesigned and unforeseen \u201coccurrence\u201d resulting in loss or injury to a third person, it follows that if the facts shown in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>London Guarantee etc. Co., supra, </em>presented the case of one \u201coccurrence,\u201d as was held by the English court, then they also presented the case of but one\" \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">That part of the continuous sequence of events which embraces the second collision in this case\u2014the collision of the Marmon car with the Cadillac\u2014may well be described in the language of Bailhache, J., in <em>Tinline </em>v. <em>White Cross Ins. Assn., supra, </em>as \u201cthe incident of the accident.\u201d In that case the White Cross Insurance Association insured the plaintiff against legal liability to pay to third persons compensation for \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d caused through the driving of plaintiff\u2019s motor-car. While driving the car at an excessive rate of speed the assured knocked down three persons, injuring two of them and killing the third. The defendants contended that a recovery under the insurance contract would violate public policy, for the reason that the' assured was guilty of a crime, he having pleaded guilty to manslaughter for the killing of one of the persons knocked down by his car. In ruling against this contention Judge Bailhache, before whom the action was tried, said.: \u201cThe fact that one of the three persons was killed is, as I have said, really immaterial for the purposes of this case; it was the <em>incident </em>of the accident, or the accident of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>accident.\u201d (Italics ours.) So here, the collision with the Cadillac, a part of the general catastrophe in which the three automobiles were involved, was but an \u201cincident\u201d of the accident, and not a separate accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\">Thus far in our consideration of the words \u201cone accident,\u201d as used in this policy, we have purposely approached the question from the standpoint of a somewhat philosophical interpretation of the word \u201caccident.\u201d We shall now endeavor to ascertain the ordinary and popular meaning of the word, premising by saying that we are convinced that the ultimate result, so far as this ease is concerned, will be found to be the same whether the word \u201caccident\u201d be taken in a philosophical sense or be given its ordinary and popular meaning\u2014one which it may be assumed any intelligent business man would give it. Fortunately the books afford several instances of the business man\u2019s construction of the word. In <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Liability Assur. Corp., </em>9 Ohio App. 241, the court had before it an automobile indemnity insurance policy which contained a clause to the effect that the insurer\u2019s liability \u201con account of any one accident,\u201d resulting in injuries \u201cto <em>more </em>than one person,\u201d is limited to a named sum of money. A similar provision is found in the policy which was before the court in <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Taximeter Cab Co., </em>25 Pa. Dist. Rep. 583. In <em>Capelle </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>80 N. H. 481 [120 Atl. 556], the policy indemnified the assured from liability resulting from claims upon him for damages on account of bodily injuries or death resulting at any one time and suffered by any person or \u201cpersons\u201d as the result of \u201can accident.\u201d These contracts\u2014and doubtless many other similar instances could be cited\u2014 illustrate the fact that in the realm of business, in contracts presumably entered into between ordinary men of affairs, employing language in a sense which is commonly understood by such men, the term \u201cone accident,\u201d or \u201can accident,\u201d is used to cover cases where two or more persons may suffer loss or injury. In <em>Tinline </em>v. <em>White Cross Ins. Assn., </em>supra\u2014the case where the assured knocked down three persons while driving his automobile, killing one of them\u2014Judge Bailhache commences his opinion thus: \u2018\u2018 In this case plaintiff claims a declaration that he is entitled to be indemnified against the consequences of <em>an </em>accident.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>(Italics ours.)  These few illustrations will suffice to show that when the term \u201cone accident\u201d or \u201can accident\u201d is used in automobile indemnity insurance contracts it is ordinarily and popularly understood to include a ease where two or more persons are injured in person or in property as the result of an undesigned and unforeseen occurrence of an afflictive or unfortunate character, such as happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">There would have been no occasion for an opinion of this length were it not for the decision of the English court in the <em>South Staffordshire Tramways </em>case [1891], 1 Q. B. 402, referred to <em>supra. </em>Without some thoughtful consideration, that case might seem to be at variance with our conclusion. However, a careful analysis of the policy there under consideration will show that case to be <em>sui generis, </em>and that the conflict between it and the views which we entertain is more apparent than real or substantial. There the assured made a mitten application which was recited in the policy. When the insurance clauses in the policy and the written application were read together it was apparent that the words \u201cany one accident,\u201d in the policy, were intended by the parties to mean an accident to each of several persons who might be injured by the vehicles of the assured upon any one occasion. The policy, after reciting that the plaintiffs had applied to defendants \u201cfor an indemnity against all such claims as hereinafter mentioned for compensation for personal injuries, and damage to property, caused by vehicles in their possession,\u201d witnessed that the defendants did thereby agree that \u201cso far as regards claims for personal injury and damage to property made against the assured in respect of <em>accidents </em>caused by vehicles . . . belonging to the assured . . . and for which <em>accidents </em>the assured shall be liable, the association shall pay the assured, the sum of \u00a3250 in respect of any one accident.\u201d It will be noticed that the application was for indemnity against all claims for personal \u201cinjuries,\u201d and damage to property,; caused by plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles. As was pointed out by Bowen, L. J., in his concurring opinion, when the policy! is looked to it appears that it limits the words of the application by adding the words \u201cin respect of accidents.\u201d This word \u201caccidents,\u201d in the plural, occurs twice in the policy preceding the phrase \u201cany one accident,\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>'evidently intended to refer to \u201caccidents\u201d occurring at any one time, and not to independent and wholly disconnected accidents such as might possibly occur at different times during the life of the policy. It is evident, therefore, that by the use of the word \u201caccidents,\u201d in the insurance clause which provides for indemnity against \u201cclaims for personal injury . . . made against the assured in respect of <em>accidents </em>caused by vehicles,\u201d the parties intended to treat as several accidents all such untoward occurrences as might happen to several persons upon any one occasion, i. e., to regard as one accident whatever happened to each of the persons injured. It follows as a corollary to this construction that the words \u201cany one accident,\u201d subsequently appearing in the policy, were intended to mean any one unexpected and untoward event happening to each of several persons who might be injured by plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles at any one time. That is to say, if in the preceding part of the policy the word \u201caccidents\u201d was intended to embrace each separate untoward occurrence happening to each of the several persons who might be injured upon any one occasion, then, as was said by Lord Bowen, the word \u201caccident,\u201d in the phrase \u201cany one accident,\u201d must receive the same construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">The policy under consideration in the instant case differs radically from that which was before the court of appeal in the South Staffordshire Tramways ease. In the insurance contract here in question it is declared that the policy \u201ccovers all the Assured\u2019s legal liability to other persons for the injury to or destruction of the property of such persons . . . resulting solely and directly from the ownership, maintenance and/or use of the automobile\u201d of the assured, but that in no case shall the insurer be liable for more than $1,000 \u201cwith respect to <em>claims </em>. . . arising from one accident.\u201d The use of the word \u201cclaims,\u201d in the plural, in connection with the words \u201cone accident\u201d clearly indicates that the parties understood that there might be several claims arising from one accident\u2014as, for instance, where, as here, the vehicles of two or more persons are injured\u2014but that though, there might be several injuries and therefore several claims, the total liability of the insurer should not exceed $1,000 if the claims all arose from one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Concluding, as .we do, that there was but one accident, and that, therefore, by its payment of $1,000 to the owner of the Cadillac appellant has fully discharged the liability which devolved upon it by reason of the accident, it follows that the demurrer to the complaint was improperly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">The judgment is reversed, with direction to the lower court to sustain the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b383-4\">WORKS, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"AOA\">I concur in the judgment and in everything that is said in the foregoing opinion. I desire, especially, to announce my concurrence in the reasoning whereby the writer of the opinion distinguishes the case of <em>Staffordshire Tramways Co. </em>v. <em>Sickness &amp; Accident Assn., 1 </em>Q. B. 402, from the present one. If, however, that case is not distinguishable from this, I am of the opinion that _ it was wrongly decided. So much, to my mind, is evident from the general reasoning of the above opinion. I think the English case has been given a fictitious importance by the very general application of its doctrine which has been made by annotators, text-writers, and judges.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b383-5\">CRAIG, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ake\">I dissent, because to my mind the word \u201caccident\u201d in the indemnity policy in suit was intended by the parties to be given its ordinary meaning, and this the opinion of my associates holds it should not receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It must be conceded that it is a necessary presumption that the word in question was understood to denote its usual meaning unless some consideration of fact or law appears to the contrary. I find neither. The word \u201caccident\u201d as used in indemnity insurance appears to have a definite meaning. There can be no dispute upon the proposition that all authorities agree that an \u201caccident\u201d means an \u201cunintended and unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss.\u201d It is impossible to read into this language any reference to the cause of the occurrence other than that suggested by the words \u201cunintended and unexpected.\u201d These words merely describe the quality of the event as unforeseen and undesigned. It cannot be doubted that if this generally accepted definition be taken as applicable here, the facts of this case show that separate accidents occurred to the Over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>land and Cadillac cars. But my associates hold that an unusual meaning was intended by the parties, and that the word \u201caccident\u201d had reference to the cause of the events rather than to the events themselves. Of course, if this indemnity policy contemplated that an \u201caccident\u201d referred to a cause, and not to an \u201cevent,\u201d but one accident occurred, for there was but one cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">Two cases are cited in the majority opinion to sustain the statement that in automobile accidents the injury and the cause are often inseparable, and yet, in such instances the accident is the cause from which the resultant injury flows as an incident. I am compelled to acknowledge an entire inability to discover anything in the language contained in either of these cases to sustain this assertion. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., </em>142 Md. 472 [28 A. L. R 1287, 121 Atl. 259], was an action upon an indemnity insurance policy, and in which the contest had been based entirely upon the question of whether or not sufficient notice of loss had been given, or if not given, the requirement thereof had been waived. I find no attempt in the opinion to define the word \u201caccident.\u201d In <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>58 Mont. 121 [16 A. L. R. 601, 190 Pac. 993], the court does use the language quoted: \u201cA result, though unexpected, is not an accident; the means or cause must be accidental.\u201d But the sentence which immediately precedes explains why the language quoted was used and the limitation clearly intended to be placed upon the same. It is said: \u201cThe word \u2018accident/ <em>in accident policies, </em>means <em>an event </em>which takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation. A result, though unexpected, is not an accident, the means or cause must be accidental.\u201d (Italics mine.) Of course, it is true that in accident insurance the means must be accidental, for in such policies the form universally employed insures, against injury sustained by the insured \u201ccaused solely by external, violent, and accidental means.\u201d Such was the language of the policy which the court had before it. It needs no argument to sustain the proposition that where the contract expressly provides that the <em>means </em>must be accidental it is not sufficient that the event only was an accidental one. However, the policy which is the basis of this suit makes no reference to the <em>means. </em>In it we find no provision that the <em>means </em>shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>be accidental. It stipulates to indemnify the assured against loss from legal liability paid to others for injury to or destruction of their property, resulting from an accident, that is, a certain kind of an event.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">No decision has come to my attention in which the definition of an accident is announced which states that the cause of the event must be accidental, except those construing accident and life insurance policies, using the words \u201caccidental means\u201d in specifying and limiting the grounds of liability of the assured. This was true in the ease of <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co., </em>172 Cal. 462 [L. R A. 1916E, 1196, 156 Pac. 1029], and a long list of decisions therein enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Since it is conceded that in cases arising under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, to produce an accident nothing more is required than that the harm which the plaintiff has sustained shall be unexpected and unintended, such decisions need not be cited. But, under them the circumstances of the instant case would necessarily constitute two accidents. However, it is asserted that there are decisions construing accident and life insurance policies which hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">If there be such a distinction (and I have found none) both reason and authority make the conclusion inevitable that the decisions which have arisen under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts are to be classed with those under ordinary indemnity contracts, rather than accident and life insurance policies in so far as the matter under consideration is concerned. The former, like the second class mentioned, provide for the indemnifying of persons from loss or hurt which has resulted to others. In each of the classes last mentioned the loss which the insurer is obligated to make good is not only one which has befallen a third party, but is one which the insured is required by law or agreement to compensate. Under the former the obligation arises from the direct mandate of the statute; under the indemnity contract it comes about through the fact that the insured is responsible for a happening which makes him liable in damages to another. In both instances the law compels the payment by the insured of the loss sustained. This legal compulsion supplies the element of cause in all indemnity liability, and would supplant that element, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>be conceded as ever included within the definition of an \u201caccident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\">If it were true that in certain cases the word \u201caccident\u201d denotes both the cause and its effect, while generally it means the loss or hurt without including in its content any reference to the cause thereof, there is reason for this distinction. This is well exemplified in the considerations which form the foundation for measuring the liability of the insurer in accident insurance policies and indemnity policies, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">There is a clear distinction between an insurance against accidents which may happen to the insured and one indemnifying him against loss for injuries which he may wrongfully cause to others. The former, in so far as fixing liability is concerned, clearly involves an inquiry into the intention, and care exercised by the insured, and his part in producing the event from which the loss occurs. The insurer would not agree to pay the insured for a loss which was intentionally caused by the insured himself. It is understood that the insured in such cases must be free from blame and wrongdoing; but in an indemnity contract the opposite is true. There, the contract contemplates reimbursement of the assured by the insurer of loss sustained as a consequence of the latter being required to pay a third party for injuries inflicted upon said third party or his property. Of course, this necessarily involves a recognition of the fact that the assured was guilty of an act violative of the rights of another, so as to create a liability for damages to that other. In. such a contract the insurer is not concerned with the cause, except as above indicated; and so, when a limit is placed upon his liability for any one accident, the cause is not taken into consideration, but only the event and the loss resulting therefrom to the. assured. Hence, aside from the difference in language to which attention has been called, the definition of an \u201caccident\u201d contained in the ordinary accident insurance policy, and decisions construing it, are not necessarily applicable, but, rather, the more general meaning of the word \u201caccident\u201d is to be accepted, which, as stated in <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Thorley etc., Ltd. </em>[1903], App. Cas. 443, is an unintended and unexpected occurrence which produces hurt or loss apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>its cause. Under this definition it is clear that there were two accidents in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Nor is the application of the ordinarily accepted meaning of the word \u201caccident,\u201d arising under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, due to any peculiar phraseology of such acts. It is true that in construing these statutes the courts have said that their language should be given a broad interpretation, but in so stating no exception is made, but rather the general rule is recognized. Substantially the same thing has been said by the courts of various states in construing indemnity insurance policies founded upon contracts having nothing to do with Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts; that is, in interpreting such indemnity policies it has repeatedly been held that they are to be liberally construed with a view to providing fair protection to the insured, and that in all such instances words are to be given their ordinary and accepted meaning, which is all that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act decisions have done in defining the'word \u201caccident.\u201d <em>(Alabama Fidelity etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Alabama Fenny Sav. Bank, </em>198 Ala. 337 [76 South. 103]; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Kaskaskia Live Stock Ins. Co., </em>204 Ill. App. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">But it would seem that all doubt upon this subject should be removed by the decision of the supreme court of Nebraska in <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guar. Corp., Ltd., </em>96 Neb. 213 [52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 227 [147 N. W. 465], which, like the instant case, involved an indemnity insurance contract, and in which, referring to an accident, it is said: \u201cThe word \u2018accident\u2019 is susceptible of and has received many definitions, varying with the connection in which it is used. It is: \u2018An event that takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation; an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event; chance, contingency; often an undesigned and unforeseen occurrence of an afflictive or unfortunate character; casualty ; mishap; as, to die by an accident.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.) In the Century Dictionary, among the definitions given are: \u20182. Specifically, an undesirable or unfortunate happening; an undesigned harm or injury; a casualty or mishap.\u2019 As used in an indemnity policy such as this, we are of opinion that the word \u2018accident\u2019 means an undesigned and unforeseen occurrence of an afflictive or unfortunate character, resulting in bodily injury to a person other than the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>In an attempt to distinguish the case of <em>Staffordshire Tramways Co., Ltd., </em>v. <em>Sickness &amp; Accident Assur. Assn., Ltd., </em>from the one before us, the foregoing opinion argues that the fact that the indemnity contract sued on used the word \u201caccidents\u201d rather than \u201caccident\u201d in a certain context caused the court to hold that there had been two accidents in that ease. The provision quoted from the Tramways Company case is: \u201cSo far as regards claims for personal injury and damage to property _ made against the assured in respect of accidents caused by vehicles ... belonging to the assured . . . for which accidents the assured shall be liable, the association shall pay the assured the sum of \u00a3250 in respect of any one accident.\u201d The meaning of this statement seems to me to be clearly just this: That as distinguished from the subject matter of the rest of the policy, upon the point of \u201caccidents caused by vehicles belonging to the assured,\u201d the insurer\u2019s liability should be especially limited as therein specified. The quoted language merely designates the subject of this particular clause in the contract. No other intention was indicated as intended to be conveyed, nor does the opinion in the Tramways Company case contain any language signifying that the court rendering it ascribed any different or special meaning to the provision because of the fact that the word \u201caccidents\u201d is used in plural form than would have resulted if the same idea had been expressed by its use in the singular, which of course could just as well have been done. There is nothing in the opinion under discussion, or in the wording of the policy, to even remotely suggest that the word \u201caccidents,\u201d in plural form, preceding \u201caccident\u201d was intended to denote that the accidents in question should occur at any one time rather than upon disconnected occasions. The Tramways Company case is one in which the facts.are squarely on all fours with those of that before this court. In the former it was definitely held that upon such facts two accidents, and not one, had occurred; and in so holding the court doubtless fully appreciated the significance of the words construed, quite possibly the more fully because of the brevity of the opinion, which will be quoted later. Others may disagree with the conclusion reached, but the facts of that case cannot be distinguished from those of the instant one. And this is of double importance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>because, like the' policy being construed here, the other was one in which the insurer bound itself as surety against the results of wrongful acts of the assured causing injuries to other persons. These cases constitute complete parallels in point of fact, and I am convinced that the court\u2019s rulings should be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">Although there appears no ambiguity in either the provision above discussed nor in the opinion of the court in the Tramways Company case, my interpretation of both is strengthened by the opinion in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>London Guarantee etc. Co., Ltd., </em>28 Terr. L. Rep. 254. My learned associates lay great stress upon the fact that in the last-named case it was held that there had been but one occurrence, which to my mind is merely an \u201cincident to\u201d the accidents. They ignore the important part of the decision in so far as the instant case is concerned, namely, that there were two accidents. The facts in the case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>London Guarantee etc. Co., Ltd., supra, </em>were: The defendants assured Allen against accidents caused by his employees when in charge of his horse-drawn vehicles. Two men, Turner and Eidsdale, were injured by a cart driven by one of the assured\u2019s drivers. It was found as a fact that the cart struck Turner, who in turn was thrown against Eidsdale, and both men fell and were injured. Each brought suit against the assured for damages. It was held that, although there were two accidents, there was only one occurrence, within the meaning of the policy, and that therefore the defendants\u2019 limit of \u00a3300 liability applied. The policy provided that the total aggregate liability of the company was to be limited to the sum of \u00a3300 for all claims for compensation, costs, charges, and expenses, paid or payable either to the insured or to any claimant or any number of claimants, in respect of or arising out of any one accident <em>or </em>occurrence. This decision goes so far as to be a precedent for holding that even in the supposititious case of one car being towed by another and both being injured there would be two accidents. It limits the consideration of the question to that of the event of the injury provided such event was unexpected and unforeseen, and it is so decisive and unequivocal as to preclude the idea of harmonizing it with a holding that there was but one accident in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>There appears to be no 'foundation for the idea that the word \u201caccident\u201d is used by business men in a different sense than as defined in the cases whose definitions have been quoted, and others to which reference might be made, containing language of like import. It goes without saying that such cases involved the construction of an insurance contract made in the world of business. In each it was held that the word in question is ordinarily understood to mean an undesigned and unforeseen occurrence resulting in injury. It may well be that in some indemnity contracts the -parties expressly or by necessary inference have stipulated that by their use of the word they intended to denote a general catastrophe which might include injury to more than one person. This affords no proof that the word is generally used in the realm of business in that particular sense. It is a matter so generally known as to justify courts in taking judicial knowledge of it that insurance companies write their policies in a great number of forms with the distinct purpose of satisfying the public who desire insurance against risks of every character. But we need not go beyond cases cited in the opinion of my learned associates for instances where contracts entered into in ordinary transactions between business men were so worded that courts of last resort held that the word \u201caccident\u201d employed therein denoted not a general catastrophe, but a particular event or occurrence. Such were the eases of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>London Guarantee etc. Co., Ltd., </em>28 Terr. L. Rep. 254; <em>Staffordshire Tramways Co., Ltd., </em>v. <em>Sickness &amp; Accident Assur. Assn., Ltd., supra, </em>and <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Ocean Accident &amp; Guaranty Corp., Ltd., supra. </em>The first two of the cases last enumerated contained provisions worded similarly to that under consideration in the instant case, whereas this is not true of the policies which formed the basis of the suits in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Liability Assur. Corp., </em>9 Ohio App. 241, <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Taximeter Cab Co., </em>25 Pa. Dist. Rep. 583, and <em>Chapelle </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>80 N. H, 481 [120 Atl. 556], Our own supreme court has repeatedly stated its view of the meaning popularly assigned to the term \u201caccident\u201d to be the same as that announced in <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Thorley etc., Ltd., supra, </em>in which it is said, \u201cThe expression \u2018accident\u2019 is used in the public and ordinary sense of the word as denoting an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>looked for event which is not expected nor intended.\u201d <em>(Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>177 Cal. 614, 617 [L. R. A. 1918F, 856, 171 Pac. 429], Citing <em>Western Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>170 Cal. 686 [151 Pac. <em>398]; Southwestern Surety Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury, </em>172 Cal. 769 [158 Pac. 762].)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\u25a0 Adverting now particularly to the contention of appellant that the single act or omission of the driver of the Marmon could not cause two simultaneous \u201caccidents,\u201d within the proper interpretation of the phrase limiting liability to $1,000 for loss or injury arising \u201cfrom one accident,\u201d if. there was a causal connection between the two collisions, the question presented is as to whether or not respondent\u2019s assignor was insured against damage to all other persons collectively to the extent of $1,000 only, if damaged by a single mishap, or against each just and valid claim of one or more persons to whose individual property or person separate and distinct accidents might occur as a direct result of the operation of respondent\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">A pertinent illustration of a case which would exclude liability is <em>Kangas </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co., </em>138 Minn. 418 [L. R. A. 1918B, 504, 165 N. W. 268], wherein it was said: \u201cFor instance, if, when the plaintiff was drawn underneath the passing train, a car wheel had passed over his hand thereby severing his four fingers, one at a time, could it be said that the event constituted four accidents and four distinct injuries to his body?\u201d Had the Cadillac machine had four parts broken by this collision and had a separate claim been made for each, the situation presented would have been similar to that in the case last cited. I am in entire accord with the holding of the Minnesota court that the loss of all the fingers of a man\u2019s left hand would in such a ease constitute but one accident within the contemplation of the policy of insurance there under consideration. But in the instant case each of two automobiles, in no way inter- \u2022 related, and owned by different persons, suffered an accident as a consequence of negligence in the management of the Marmon car which was insured against the liability of its owner for injury to another. True, there was but one incident which superinduced the successive impacts; but as a result of the Marmon leaving its proper course, the Overland was damaged \u201cfrom one accident,\u201d and the Cadillac <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>suffered damage \u201cfrom one accident.\u201d The policy did not stipulate a maximum of liability to the extent of $1,000 for all damage resulting from one proximate cause; it limited the liability \u201cwith respect to claims . . . from one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATi0\">Mention has been made of <em>Southern Staffordshire Tramways Co., Ltd., </em>v. <em>Sickness &amp; Accident Assur. Assn., Ltd., </em>60 L. J. Q. B. 47, 63 L. T. 807 (1891), 1 Q. B. 402, 55 J. P. 168, in which the English court of appeal construed a similar policy of insurance. No clearer exposition of the principle involved and which is applicable in the case at \u2022 bar can be made than by recounting in some detail the facts of that case, and quoting from the opinions of the \u00a1justices therein. The tramway company was insured against personal injuries, and damage to property, caused by its vehicles, in the sum of \u00a32'50 \u201cin respect of any one accident.\u201d One of the plaintiff\u2019s tramears overturned, injuring forty persons, as a result of which the tramway company sought to collect insurance under said policy for each of the several casualties up to the full amount for which it was indemnified and \u201cfor which the assured shall be liable.\u201d One of the questions presented at the trial was \u201cwhether the injury caused to each of the said persons constituted a separate accident within the meaning of the policy.\u201d Of the two justices hearing the case, one ruled that \u201cany one accident\u201d should be construed to mean that \u201capart from any question of the number or amount of the claims made in consequence on the insured, as between them and the insurers, such <em>an event </em>as that which happened on November 24, 1888,\u201d constituted ground for liability as to but one claimant. The other justice said: \u201cAs to the second question, the meaning of \u2018accident\u2019 in the phrase \u2018any one accident,\u2019 I regret to say that I differ from him. It is, I think, to be borne in mind that the object of the policy is to provide for the assured an indemnity against claims made upon them for injuries resulting from the negligence of their servants. This being so, I think it more appropriate to hold that the preceding word, \u2018accidents,\u2019 is used from the point of view of the several claimants upon the assured for injuries, each of whom claims in respect of a specific accident to himself, and not from that of the insurers, and that therefore \u2018any one accident\u2019 means any accident to any one claimant upon the insured. \u2018Any claim\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>would have been a less ambiguous expression. I think, therefore, that the defendants are liable in the full amount; but, as my learned brother is not of this opinion, I withdraw my judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">The case was thereupon taken to the court of appeal, wherein Lord Esher, M. E&gt;., said: \u201cI think the construction of the policy tolerably clear. The assurance is expressed to be \u2018as regards claims for personal injury and damage to property made against the assured in respect of accidents caused by vehicles. \u2019 These were claims for personal injury, i. e., injury to the person, and each person injured claimed for injuries in respect of an accident to 'his person caused by a vehicle. If several persons were injured, I think, upon the true construction of this policy, there were several accidents. I agree with the view expressed by Lawrence, J. Por these reasons I think that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the larger amount, and therefore the appeal must be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The other two justices concurred, each writing an individual opinion to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Regarding the matter from the standpoint of the \u2019assured in his relation to a particular damaged car, the injury to the car constituted an accident, and a single one. It makes no difference how many other cars might have been damaged at the time by the same cause, there was one accident which caused the harm to this particular car. Regardless of the number of claims that might exist, all arising from the injury to that car, the greatest amount which the insurance company was obligated to pay for injuries to it would be #1,000. I think the policy is clearly intended to be viewed in this way, and in that light each ear injured in the same general accident would, for the purposes of this contract, be regarded as having been the victim of its own accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on May 5, 1926, and a petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on June 3, 1926.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
