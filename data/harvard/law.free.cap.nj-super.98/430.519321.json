A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad8Q\">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the County Court of entry with intent to commit rape, in violation of <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A:94-1, and rape of a 16-year-old deaf-mute girl, in violation of <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A: 138-1. He was sentenced by the trial judge to State Prison for a term of not less than two nor more than four years for each offense, the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appeals from the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Defendant\u2019s first contention is that the trial court erred in determining in the presence of the jury the victim\u2019s competency to testify. Argument is made that her lack of competency to testify had been determined by the same trial judge at a previous trial of this same indictment. At that time the jury had failed to reach an agreement, thus necessitating the second trial. Defendant maintained at the inception of the later trial that the trial judge should take judicial notice of Ms prior ruling on her lack of competency and avoid prejudice by not having her presented to the jury for a redetermination of her competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>In <em>State v. Butler, </em>27 <em>N. J. </em>560, 603 (1958), it was held that the trial judge has jurisdiction to conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine the competency of a witness to testify.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u201cThe hearing may be conducted in or out of the presence of the jury in the discretion of the court. It may be desirable to take the testimony in the presence of the jury because, assuming a finding of competency to testify, ordinarily the evidence is relevant on the subject of the credibility of the witness.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>604)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In the instant ease the preliminary inquiry resulted in a reaffirmance by the trial judge of this deaf-mute\u2019s lack of competency to testify. Her intelligence was deemed by her teacher to be that of a seven-year-old, first-grade pupil. She was able to communicate in a limited way as to concrete subjects, but not as to abstract ideas. Defendant does not question the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling that she was not competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We find no abuse or mistaken exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in conducting the preliminary inquiry in the presence of the jury in this case. The determination of a lack of competency on a prior occasion does not <em>per se </em>preclude a finding of competency at a later date. Moreover, the same reasons which prompted the inquiry in the jury\u2019s presence at the first trial may properly exist at the second trial. If competency is found, the inquiry in the jury\u2019s presence may aid in assessing credibility. If the victim is not produced, the nonproduction may invite all kinds of speculation. Eor.'these reasons, the law wisely leaves the matter to the discretion of the trial judge. We find no reversible error as to this phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The next argument advanced is that the trial court committed error in permitting testimony of the victim\u2019s out-of-court identification of the defendant. A brief summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the factual background is necessary to put this issue in proper focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The victim of the alleged rape was at the time thereof, December 6, 1965, a 16-year-old deaf-mute. At about 11 o\u2019clock that night this young girl and her younger brother Jerry, six years old, were in bed in their respective bedrooms of the family apartment in Newark. Another brother Larry, 15 years old, was sitting in the living room watching television. Their mother was out at some store.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Larry testified that he heard a noise in the kitchen of the apartment and went to investigate. He saw a man standing in a small hallway of the apartment i\u00a3by the kitchen.\u201d He identified that man in the courtroom at the trial as defendant. Larry testified further that the man told him that \u201cif I hollered he was going to shoot me.\u201d He had a gun, the size of a police gun and with a white pearl handle, and pointed it at Larry. He was close enough for Larry to get a good clear look at his face. Larry was \u201ctoo scared\u201d to do other than what the man ordered him to do. In Larry\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201cHe told me turn around and he put the gun up in my back and told me to get into the front room and sit on the chair and not to move.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Larry knew the man by reason of having seen him on prior occasions \u201changing together\u201d with his uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The intruder, identified by Larry as defendant, then went into his sister\u2019s bedroom, holding the gun in his hand as he did so. Larry heard his sister \u201choller\u201d or \u201cscreech,\u201d something she could do despite her impediment in speaking. Defendant remained in his sister\u2019s bedroom for about ba.lf an hour to an hour. When he came out of the room \u201che ran out the back,\u201d that is, out an open back door which had been locked before this incident. Larry went into his sister\u2019s bedroom. He testified to her state of undress and his sister\u2019s pointing down \u201cto her privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The mother came in shortly thereafter. Larry told her what had happened. The mother instructed him to go downstairs and phone the police. When they came he related the details to the police. Larry did not know the name of the intruder and Larry\u2019s uncle, who did know him, was then in jail for some minor offense. But Larry told the police that one Robert Harris would know the name and residence of the attacker. He went with the police to the home of Harris. When the boy described the man, Harris immediately responded with defendant\u2019s name and furnished the police with his address. Larry and the police then went to defendant\u2019s home and were freely admitted by defendant\u2019s mother. When they entered the house, defendant ran to a back room, as the mother informed them. The police found defendant hiding in a closet. Larry there and then identified him, as he testified at the trial, as the man who had been in his family\u2019s apartment earlier that same evening. Defendant thereupon shook his head and said, \u201cNot me, not me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The police then took Larry and defendant to Newark City Hospital where the victim had meanwhile been taken for examination. Defendant was brought into the room where the girl was sitting. She was asked if this was the man who had come into the house and raped her. As Larry expressed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">\u201cShe pointed down to her privacy and she pointed at the man and she shook her head.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">It is this identification of defendant by the victim at the city hospital, which the trial court permitted her brother Larry and the police then present to testify to, that defendant alleges constituted reversible error. Obviously, the ruling by the trial judge, that the victim was not competent to testify, precluded her personal identification of defendant at trial as the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Defendant argues that permitting others to testify to her out-of-eourt identification was error because: (1) extrajudicial identifications are admissible for the sole limited purpose of corroborating a witness\u2019s identification of defendant at trial; (2) prior identification must be made under circumstances which reasonably preclude suspicion of unfairness or unreliability; (3) the trial court\u2019s finding of the victim\u2019s incompetency precluded the introduction of prior statements by her; (4) the hearsay character of the testimony required rejection thereof, and (5) her nod of the head and gestures were nothing more than \u201csheer speculation\u201d as to what she meant thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The girl did not testify. Obviously, therefore, this is not a situation involving a prior out-of-court identification by a witness to support an in-court identification by that same witness. Rather, the testimony by the police officers as to what the victim did when she was confronted by the alleged ravisher, who had already been identified by her brother as the perpetrator of the crimes, was properly admissible on other broader grounds. It constituted a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence implicating defendant. The police had been summoned and appeared at the scene of the crimes within a matter of minutes after their occurrence. They were relatively in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of the intruder who had ravished a 16-year-old girl. Prompted by the ancient doctrine of \u201cthe hue and the cry,\u201d they proceeded to apprehend defendant hidden in a closet at his home. The confrontation immediately thereafter at the city hospital was but another step in the police routine. Such confrontations are common everyday procedures, not only to lend support to a criminal charge against a suspect but also to avoid an unwarranted accusation, if the victim absolves the person presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The girl\u2019s identification was made in this case under circumstances which reasonably precluded suspicion of unfairness or unreliability. The question was addressed to her by her mother who, presumabl}', had many years of experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ence in making herself understood by her daughter. The mother was deceased at the time of trial. The police understood the mother\u2019s question. The daughter\u2019s nod of the head, her pointing to where she had been violated, and her accusing finger directed toward defendant, fairly indicated her answer. The close proximity in time between the attack and confrontation insures a fresh memory. Under the circumstances, we find no unfairness in the lack of a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The mere fact that the trial judge found this deaf-mute, possessed of the intelligence of a seven-year-old first grader, incompetent <em>to testify </em>because of her inability to express herself as to abstract ideas, does not preclude her pointing an accusatory finger. In <em>State v. </em>Claymonst, 96 <em>N. J. L. </em>1 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1921), defendant was convicted of carnal abuse of a four-year-old girl. The trial court allowed witnesses to testify that defendant was brought to the girl\u2019s bed in the city hospital and there she identified defendant as the man who had attacked her. Even though she was deemed incompetent to testify at the trial because she was too young, her identifying statement was deemed to be of sufficient reliability to warrant testimony thereof, since the statement was made in defendant\u2019s presence. Here, too, the identification was made in defendant\u2019s presence and in response to the mother\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Mere ineompetency <em>to testify </em>does not bar the identifying statement. See, too, <em>State v. Lambertino, </em>13 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>687, 180 <em>A. </em>426 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935), where the police were permitted to testify to an identifying statement by the victim of an atrocious assault and battery, the victim having died before trial and thus unavailable to testify. That case is analogous to the facts herein. After all, defendant does not dispute that the girl made the identification under the circumstances related by those who were present and in his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Defendant argues that the victim\u2019s nod of the head and gestures produced \u201cmere speculation\u201d as to what she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>meant thereby. We do not agree. The probative weight of this testimony was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Defendant next argues that testimony as to his remaining silent in the face of the identifications prejudiced him. Reliance is placed on <em>State v. Ripa, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>199, 204 (1965), wherein the court concluded that when a defendant expressly refuses to answer an accusation made in his presence, \u201cno inference can be drawn against him under the doctrine of acquiescence by silence or any other concept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In the first place, defendant did deny the accusation by declaring \u201cnot me, not me,\u201d when he was first identified. Secondly, the trial judge expressly instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cUnder our law a defendant upon arrest is under no duty to say anything. Moreover, our law gives him an absolute right not to say anything upon his arrest. I therefore instruct you that you are to draw no inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to speak upon his arrest or deny his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">This instruction is in accord with the rule in <em>State v. Ripa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Claim is made that the trial court interfered with the trial of the case to the prejudice of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">We have read the entire transcript of the trial and especially the particular portions of the record referred to by defendant. We are satisfied that there was no undue or improper interference by the trial judge. Where the trial judge did intervene, the interventions were not an abuse or mistaken exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion as defined by our courts. See <em>State v. Ray, </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>19 (1964); <em>State v. Guido, </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>191, 207 (1963); <em>State v. Riley, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>188, 200 (1958). The State\u2019s principal witness was a young boy. Judicial intervention was proper to clarify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>his testimony. The trial judge\u2019s interrogation of the examining physician was necessary for the jury\u2019s understanding of the medical testimony. There was no excessive intervention in this case by the trial judge by extensive questions, as in <em>State v. Ray, supra; </em>nor any untoward judicial conduct, as in <em>State v. Homer, </em>86 <em>N. J. Super. </em>351 <em>(App. Div. </em>1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Defendant maintains that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> On the contrary, there was ample credible evidence from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt, as it did, that defendant committed the crimes charged against him. A verdict of a jury may not be set aside as against the weight of the evidence unless it clearly appears that the verdict was the result of partiality, prejudice, passion or mistake. <em>State v. Garcia, 83 N. J. Super. </em>345, 351 <em>(App. Div. </em>1964). The record does not demonstrate any of such infirmities in this case. No useful purpose would be served by detailing the evidence supportive of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The next point advanced is that the cumulation of errors requires that the judgment of conviction be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">We find no such cumulation of errors in this case to warrant application of the cumulative error rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Defendant\u2019s final claim is that there could not be a conviction on both entry with intent to rape and rape, and, therefore, the consecutive sentences were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\"><em>State v. Byra, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>429 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942), affirmed <em>o. b. </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>384 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943), <em>certiorari </em>denied 324 <em>U. S. </em>884, 65 <em>S. Ct. </em>1025, 89 <em>L. Ed. </em>1434 (1944), is dis-positive of this claim. In that case, convictions for breaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>and entering with intent to commit grand larceny and for the consequential grand larceny were upheld, as were the consecutive sentences imposed. To the same effect, see <em>State v. Quatro, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>120 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), <em>certiorari </em>denied 355 <em>U. S. </em>850, 18 <em>S. Ct. </em>13, 2 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>60 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">This ease is not to be confused with <em>State v. Riley, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>188 (1958), where the crime of assault with intent to commit rape was deemed to be merged in the rape itself, thus requiring only a single punishment. Here, the entry is a separate and distinct offense from the subsequent rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendant cites <em>Prince v. United States, </em>352 <em>U. S. </em>322, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>403, 1 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>310 (1951), but a reading thereof will indicate that the decision is based on an interpretation of the Federal Bank Bobbery Act and, as the court itself states, is \u201cpeculiar to the statute\u201d and must be differentiated from similar problems in this general field raised under other statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Finding no valid basis for reversal in any of the grounds advanced by defendant, the judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
