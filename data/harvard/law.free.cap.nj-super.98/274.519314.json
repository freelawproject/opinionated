J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar8-\">In this declaratory judgment action, the trial court entered judgment that the divorce granted defendant in Florida was \u201cnull and void in the State of New Jersey\u201d and plaintiff was \u201cthe lawful wife \u2022of the defendant * * *.\u201d Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The facts are set forth in the opinion of the trial court reported in 94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>539 and need not be repeated in full here. Suffice it to say that plaintiff sued defendant in New Jersey for separate maintenance; defendant counterclaimed for divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty; on April 5, 1963 judgment was entered granting plaintiff separate maintenance and denying defendant\u2019s counterclaim for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Thereafter defendant moved from New Jersey to Florida. Plaintiff remained in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Plaintiff does not contend that defendant did not establish a <em>bona fide </em>domicile in Florida, and the trial judge found \u201cas a fact that defendant\u2019s residence in that state must be taken as a presumed <em>bona fide </em>one.\u201d On June 12, 1964, while so domiciled, defendant sued plaintiff for a divorce in the courts of Florida on the ground of extreme cruelty. The trial court found, and we accept, that defendant\u2019s Florida complaint was based on substantially the same allegations that were contained in his New Jersey counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Plaintiff was served with process upon the Florida complaint by publication and mailing. The sufficiency of the service is not challenged. Thus Florida had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter. Plaintiff filed no appearance in Florida and did not participate in the proceedings in any way. She did obtain an order from the New Jersey court in the maintenance action forbidding defendant from proceeding with the Florida divorce, but defendant ignored the order and, on July 24, 1965, obtained the Florida decree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Then, after some skirmishing in the New Jersey Chancery Division which does not affect the case at bar, plaintiff instituted the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">At the trial of the present action no testimony was offered by either side. Determination of the issues was based upon stipulated facts and the record. The trial court found that the factual allegations which defendant set forth in his Elorida complaint for divorce were \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to those relied upon in his counterclaim for divorce in New Jersey and that \u201cthe statutory ground of extreme cruelty of the State of Elorida and the degree of proof required in that state to warrant a judgment of divorce is the same as the law and requirements of proof in this state.\u201d The court held that since the New Jersey judgment was <em>res judicata </em>it precluded relitigation of the issue of plaintiff\u2019s extreme cruelty in Florida; defendant \u201chad no legal right to institute an action for divorce in * * * Elorida * * *\u201d; therefore \u201cThe judgment of divorce procured <em>ex parte </em>by the defendant herein in the State of Elorida is not entitled to full faith and credit in this State.\u201d We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> Since defendant\u2019s domicile in Florida is not challenged and plaintiff was constructively served, Elorida had jurisdiction to entertain the action and to grant the divorce. Its judgment is therefore entitled to full faith and credit and may not be collaterally attacked in New Jersey. Had plaintiff appeared in the Elorida proceeding and pleaded her New Jersey judgment, we assume she would have prevailed. Ri<em>ehl v. Riehl, </em>60 <em>So. 2d </em>35 <em>(Fla. Sup. Ct. </em>1952); <em>Irving Trust Co. v. Kaplan, </em>155 <em>Fla. </em>120, 20 <em>So. 2d </em>351 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944). However, she may not now use the New Jersey judgment to nullify the Elorida decree. <em>Restatement, Judgments </em>\u00a7 42 (1942); <em>cf. Zelek v. Brosseau, </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>521, 532 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), affirmed 26 <em>N. J. </em>501 (1958) ; <em>Garrison v. Garrison, </em>253 <em>S. W. 2d </em>626 <em>(Ky. Ct. App. </em>1952).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201cThe basic, controlling principle is that the forum must accord the foreign judgment the same degree of credit, status and immunity from attack which the judgment would be accorded in the state where rendered. <em>Johnson v. Muelberger, </em>340 U. <em>S. </em>581, 584, 71 <em>S. Ct. </em>474, 95 <em>L. Ed. </em>552 (1951) ; <em>Morris v. Jones, </em>329 <em>U. S. </em>545, 67 <em>S. Ct. </em>451, 91 <em>L. Ed. </em>488, 168 <em>A. L. R. </em>656 (1947) ; <em>Roche v. McDonald, </em>275 <em>U. S. </em>449, 48 <em>S. Ct. </em>142, 72 <em>L. </em>Ed. 365, 53 <em>A. L. R. </em>1141 (1927). Thus full faith and credit is not denied where the forum allows defenses to an attempt to enforce the foreign judgment which would be entertained by the courts of the rendering state in a similar proceeding.\u201d <em>Puzio v. Puzio, </em>57 <em>N. J. Super. </em>557, 570 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In Florida, as in Few Jersey, <em>res judicata </em>must be pleaded, else it is waived. <em>Matsis v. </em>Matsis, 155 <em>Fla. </em>786, 21 <em>So. 2d </em>545 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945). Assuming that Few Jersey may allow a person to attack a foreign judgment for certain types of fraud when the foreign state would permit the divorce decree to be assailed on that ground in that state, <em>Zelek v. Brosseau, supra; Puzio v. Puzio, supra; </em>55 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>673 (1957), the question arises whether Florida would consider defendant\u2019s action a fraud which entitled plaintiff to relief from the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In <em>Matsis v. </em>Matsis, supra, the husband instituted a suit for divorce in Florida on the grounds of extreme cruelty and desertion. The wife, a nonresident, was constructively served but did not appear or defend against the suit. A final decree of divorce was entered and the husband remarried. Subsequently, the wife instituted a proceeding in Florida to vacate the decree on the ground of fraud. She alleged that, prior to the Florida proceeding, the husband had instituted a suit for divorce in Few Hampshire on the grounds of extreme cruelty and desertion and the Few Hampshire court had denied him this relief and had granted her a divorce from bed and board. The wife asserted that the prior Few Hampshire decree operated as a bar to the husband\u2019s relitigating the same issues in another forum and that, by omitting any reference to the prior proceeding in his complaint for divorce in Florida, the husband had committed a fraud upon that court. The Florida court dismissed the wife\u2019s suit. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u201cThe allegations of the bill of complaint show not fraud but an attempt by the wife to relitigate issues which should have been presented in the original suit and which have been foreclosed by the entry of the final decree and the lapse of the statutory time within which to take an appeal. If the decree entered in the New Hampshire court did in fact constitute a bar to any subsequent suit by the husband on the same issues, it was Mrs. Matsis\u2019 duty to assert such defense in the original suit in a timely manner, if she cared to avail herself of such defense.\u201d (21 <em>So. 2d, </em>at <em>p. </em>546)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The rule of <em>Matsis v. Matsis, </em>supra\u2014that issues which could have been litigated in the proceedings themselves are not sufficient grounds to attack collaterally a decree which otherwise appears to be valid on its face\u2014has been applied repeatedly in the courts of Florida. See, <em>e. g., Simons v. Miami Beach First National Bank, </em>157 <em>So. 2d </em>199 <em>(Fla. D. Ct. </em>1963), <em>certiorari </em>denied 166 <em>So. 2d </em>151 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1964), affirmed 381 <em>U. S. </em>81, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>1315, 14 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>232 (1965); <em>Macfadden v. Muckerman, </em>116 <em>So. 2d </em>448 <em>(Fla. D. Ct. </em>1959); <em>Masilotti v. Masilotti, </em>158 <em>Fla. </em>663, 29 <em>So. 2d </em>872 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947). Consequently, since Elorida would not allow plaintiff to attack the divorce decree collaterally, it would be a denial of full faith and credit for a court of this State to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Of course, the fact that the Elorida decree is valid and entitled to full faith and credit does not affect plaintiff\u2019s rights to receive support under the New Jersey judgment of separate maintenance. See <em>Estin v. Estin, </em>334 <em>U. S. </em>541, 68 <em>S. Ct. </em>1213, 92 <em>L. Ed. </em>1561 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
