Holt, were tenants by the entirety of the marital residence located in Jamaica, Queens. In 1969, the plaintiff obtained a money judgment solely against James Holt in the sum of $394.90, eventually levied on his interest in the property and, in 1977, conducted an execution sale. The plaintiff was the highest bidder and received a Sheriff\u2019s deed purportedly conveying to her James Holt\u2019s interest in the property. Juanita and James Holt were granted a judgment of divorce in or about January 1983, and Juanita Holt was awarded \"exclusive occupancy of the marital residence\u201d for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">When the Holts were granted a judgment of divorce, the tenancy by the entirety by which they held title to the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>premises was converted by operation of law to a tenancy in common, and a partition action would ordinarily lie <em>(see, Stelz v Shreck, </em>128 NY 263; <em>Yax v Yax, </em>240 NY 590). However, since Juanita Holt was awarded exclusive occupancy, James Holt had no standing to commence a partition action under RPAPL 901 (1) <em>(see, Davies v Davies, </em>65 Misc 2d 480), unless and until Juanita Holt\u2019s right to exclusive occupancy is extinguished <em>(see, Givens v Givens, </em>138 AD2d 348; <em>Ripp v Ripp, </em>38 AD2d 65, <em>affd </em>32 NY2d 755). The plaintiff, having purchased James Holt\u2019s interest at a Sheriff\u2019s sale, albeit before the divorce, can have no rights greater than those enjoyed by James Holt <em>(cf., V.R.W., Inc. v Klein, </em>68 NY2d 560) and therefore cannot maintain a partition proceeding in the face of Juanita Holt\u2019s award of exclusive occupancy <em>(see, Bank of N. Y. v Stauble, </em>84 AD2d 530). Although the plaintiff did not have notice of the divorce proceedings, she is nevertheless bound by the provisions granting Juanita Holt exclusive occupancy <em>(see, Solomon v Barth, </em>135 Misc 2d 574).
