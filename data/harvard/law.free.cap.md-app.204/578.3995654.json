In this case, we consider the classic chicken/egg causality riddle in the legislative/political setting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And, in the context of the petitioning to referendum of a municipal annexation resolution, we conclude that the Legislature has required enactment to precede petitioning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We turn from the abstract to the concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On December 3, 2010, the Circuit Court for Talbot County granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Constantine Koste (\u201cKoste\u201d), a resident and registered voter of the Town of Oxford (\u201cthe Town\u201d), appellant. In so doing, the circuit court ruled that signatures on a referendum petition may be collected before the public hearing and final enactment of an annexation resolution. The Town appeals, and presents one question for our consideration, which we have re-phrased: In determining whether a petition for referendum of a municipal annexation referendum complies with Md.Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.) Art. 23A \u00a7 19(g), may signatures obtained prior to the date of final enactment be properly counted?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer in the negative and reverse the ruling of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">FACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The Town of Oxford is surrounded on three sides by the waters of the Tred Avon River and Town Creek. On July 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>2009, the President of the Commissioners of the Town of Oxford (\u201cthe Commissioners\u201d or \u201cthe Town\u201d) introduced an annexation resolution, Resolution No. 1001, intended to annex 142 acres of submerged lands under public waters adjacent to the current municipal boundary. The purpose of the annexation was to confirm the Town\u2019s jurisdiction over adjacent lands and waters of the Tred Avon River in order to regulate, with the Maryland Department of the Environment, the placement of wharves, piers, mooring piles, mooring buoys, floating docks, and other structures within municipal waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">As required by \u00a7 19(d) of Art. 23A, public notice of this resolution and the area to be annexed by the Town was published in <em>The Star Democrat, </em>a newspaper of general circulation in Oxford, for four consecutive weeks beginning on August 10,2009. The notice read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">Please take notice that the Commissioners of Oxford will conduct a public hearing on Tuesday, September 22, 2009, at 8:00 p.m. on Resolution Number 1001, entitled \u201cA RESOLUTION OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF OXFORD TO ANNEX SUBMERGED LANDS LOCATED UNDER CERTAIN PUBLIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE TOWN BOUNDARIES IN ORDER TO REGULATE PLACEMENT OF WHARVES, PIERS, MOORING PILES, MOORING BUOYS, FLOATING DOCKS AND ASSOCIATED OR RELATED STRUCTURES.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The notice additionally informed the public that \u201c[t]he technical legal description of the land proposed for annexation, together with a plat depicting the area to be annexed, and the proposed new boundary of the Town of Oxford, may be inspected at the Town Office.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">On September 22, 2009, after the fourth and final publication of the notice, the Commissioners held a public hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the resolution as required by \u00a7 19(d) of Art. 23A. The minutes of that hearing reflect that it lasted several hours, with numerous citizens speaking for and against the resolution, taking issue with the resolution\u2019s fiscal impact, necessity, and the purported lack of transparency surrounding the legislative process. Maps of the proposed annexation were displayed, and proponents discussed the safety issues underpinning the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">After the hearing, the Commissioners held the record open to receive written comments for an additional 10 days. On November 10, 2009, the Commissioners unanimously voted to adopt Resolution No. 1001 without alteration, signed the resolution, and specified in a section titled \u201cEffective Date\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">This Resolution shall become effective 45 days after final enactment unless a petition for referendum has been filed prior thereto in accordance with Article 23A Section 19 of The Maryland Annotated Code. This resolution shall be deemed \u201cfinally enacted\u201d on the date on which the Commissioners of Oxford indicate their approval of this Resolution by signing the same.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Forty-two days later, on December 22, 2009, Koste\u2019s attorneys presented the Commissioners and Town Clerk with a petition for referendum (the \u201cPetition\u201d). The Petition, which consisted of 31 pages containing 195 signatures, demanded that the Town suspend the effectiveness of the resolution and hold a referendum election pursuant to Art. 23A \u00a7 19(g).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG4\">The Petition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>We, the undersigned voters of the Town of Oxford, hereby petition to refer Resolution 1001 entitled \u201cA RESOLUTION OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF OXFORD TO ANNEX SUBMERGED LANDS LOCATED UNDER CERTAIN PUBLIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE TOWN BOUNDARIES IN ORDER TO REGULATE PLACEMENT OF WHARVES, PIERS, MOORING PILES, MOORING BUOYS, FLOATING DOCKS AND ASSOCIATED OR RELATED STRUCTURES\u201d to a vote of the registered voters of the Town of Oxford for approval or rejection at an election to be held in accordance with Article 28A, Section 19 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">If the full text of the bill/ordinance or part of the bill/ordinance referred (the \u201cproposal\u201d) does not appear on the back of this signature page or as an attachment, a fair and accurate summary of the substantive provisions of the proposal must appear on the back or be attached, and the full text of the proposal must be immediat\u00e9ly available from the petition circulator.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>NOTICE TO SIGNERS: Sign and print your name (1) as it appears on the voter registration list; OR (2) your surname of registration and at least one full given name AND the initial of any other names. Please print or type all other information other than your signature.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>In addition to providing space for the signer to print his or her full name, registration address, and signature, the Petition also contained an area for the signer to indicate the date of signing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The next day, the Town Clerk submitted the Petition to the Oxford Board of Supervisors of Elections (the \u201cElection Board\u201d) for verification. By tally of the Election Board, there were 616 registered voters in Oxford as of December 25, 2009 and the Petition contained 177 verified and valid signatures. However, the Election Board analysis revealed that, of the 177 signatures, only 62 were obtained after the final enactment of Resolution No. 1001. The remaining 115 signatures were acquired before the November 10, 2009 final enactment, and 83 of those signatures were obtained even before the September 22, 2009 public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Commissioners then requested a legal opinion from the Attorney General to determine whether the signatures obtained before the final enactment of the resolution could be counted toward the threshold necessary to petition for the referendum. Before such an opinion could be prepared, on May 1, 2010, Koste filed in the circuit court a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Writ of Mandamus as well as a Motion for Summary Judgment. Koste sought both a declaration that the 177 signatures were valid and represented at least 20 percent of the registered voters in the Town, and a mandamus requiring the Commissioners to suspend the effectiveness of the resolution, contingent upon the results of a referendum. The Town filed an answer and opposition, requesting an order declaring that the Petition failed to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the applicable legal requirements and thus, Resolution No. 1001 became effective as a matter of law on or before December 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">A hearing on Koste\u2019s motion for summary judgment was held on December 3, 2010. In granting the motion, the circuit judge delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">This is how I see it. First of all, in my view the statute is not ambiguous. In my view the 45 day period in question is a, the primary import of that 45 day period is to limit the time within which a petition can be presented so there is some finality to this process. So that the municipality is not held up <em>ad infinitum, </em>by endless discussions and debate. I believe that the 45 day period is there for the time within which the petition must be presented and I don\u2019t believe it has any bearing on when the signatures are obtained, or whether the signatures are obtained prior to that 45 days____ The plain language of the statute does not expressly require that signatures be obtained during that 45 day period. And I believe ... the primary purpose of the statute is to provide an exit point, and not a beginning point for the process____To me it would defy common sense and the basic democratic notion that we have adopted in our system of laws to say that you can\u2019t start early, you can\u2019t be more thorough, that you cannot start this petition process more than 45 days before it ends. I mean where is the logic in that? If anything they\u2019ve given people more time to think about it and not less. And you know the basic concept here is that we ought to give the people the opportunity to be heard. That\u2019s the democratic process. And so I think that the public policy is very important here that we not deny such a big constituency, such a big percentage, more than 20 percent the opportunity to present this matter for referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Accordingly, in an order dated December 3, 2010, the trial court declared that all 177 signatures on the Petition were valid and that the signatures represented at least 20 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>of the qualified voters of the Town of Oxford.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court ordered the Commissioners to suspend the effectiveness of Resolution No. 1001 contingent upon the results of a referendum election. Finally, the court ordered that within 60 days the Commissioners were to hold the referendum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commissioners noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I. Standard of Review/Tenets of Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s determination of legal questions or conclusions of law <em>de novo. Tribbitt v. State, </em>403 Md. 638, 644, 943 A.2d 1260 (2008); <em>see also Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (noting that when an issue \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review\u201d). Summary judgment is proper \u201conly where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Md. Rule 2-501. Here, the facts are undisputed and this appeal presents a purely legal issue that we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">This case presents an issue of statutory construction, like many, resolvable on the basis of judicial consideration of three general factors: 1) text; 2) purpose; and 3) consequences. Text is the plain language of the relevant provision, typically given its ordinary meaning, <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 286, 26 A.3d 878 (2011), viewed in context, <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628 (1987), considered in light of the whole statute, <em>In re Stephen K, </em>289 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>294, 298, 424 A.2d 153 (1981), and generally evaluated for ambiguity. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d 628. Legislative purpose, either apparent from the text or gathered from external sources, often informs, if not controls, our reading of the statute. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d 628. An examination of interpretive consequences, either as a comparison of the results of each proffered construction, <em>Christian v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 296, 303, 489 A.2d 64 (1985), or as a principle of avoidance of an absurd or unreasonable reading, <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 516, 525 A.2d 628, grounds the court\u2019s interpretation in reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">II. Text</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Our analysis must necessarily begin with a review of the statute in question. Article 23A \u00a7 19, governs the process by which a municipal corporation may annex adjacent land not within its boundaries. Both the circuit court and the parties in this case urge us to parse the language of \u00a7 19(g) of Art. 23A. Among other things, Koste directs our attention to the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\"><em>At any time </em>within the forty-five (45) day period following the final enactment of the resolution, a number of persons equal to not less than twenty per centum (20%) of the qualified voters of the municipal corporation may, in writing, <em>petition the chief executive and administrative officer </em>of the municipal corporation for a referendum on the resolution. <em>Upon the presentation of a petition to the officer, </em>he shall cause to be made a verification of the signatures thereon and shall ascertain that the persons signing the petition represent at least twenty per centum (20%) of the qualified voters of the municipal corporation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">(Emphasis added). The Town\u2019s argument emphasizes in part this reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">At any time <em>within the forty-five (45) day period following the final enactment of the resolution, </em>a number of persons equal <em>to </em>not less than twenty per centum (20%) of the qualified voters of the municipal corporation may, in writing, <em>petition </em>the chief executive and administrative officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>municipal corporation <em>for a referendum on, the resolution. </em>Upon the presentation of a petition to the officer, he shall cause to be made a verification of the signatures thereon and shall ascertain that the persons signing the petition represent at least twenty per centum (20%) of the qualified voters of the municipal corporation. Upon verifying that the requirements of this subsection have been complied with, the officer shall be proclamation suspend the effectiveness of the resolution, contingent upon the results of the referendum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Obviously, the parties are contemplating different definitions of the word, \u201cpetition.\u201d One general definition of \u201cpetition,\u201d which Koste would likely embrace, is \u201ca formal written request presented to a court or other official body.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(8th Ed. 2004) at 1182. On the other hand, a definition more attuned to the referendum context and more supportive of the Town is found in Elec. Art. \u00a7 6\u2014101(i), which states in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Petition\u2019 means all of the associated pages necessary to fulfill the requirement of a process established by the law by which individuals affix their signatures as evidence of support for ... placing ... a question on the ballot at any election.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Koste contends that the term, \u201cpresentation of a petition,\u201d in the second sentence of \u00a7 19(g) of Article 23A equates with the act of \u201cpetitioning\u201d Town officials in the first sentence. A contrary argument would emphasize that \u201cpresentation of a petition\u201d suggests a difference between presentation and petition and that reference to the 45-day period appears only in the first sentence, which uses the term \u201cpetition for a referendum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Thus, Koste reads the 45-day period only as a deadline for <em>presenting </em>to Town officials the necessary signatures, while the Town says that the 45-day window establishes a beginning period as well as an ending for the <em>process of petitioning to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>referendum. </em>Another point in the Town\u2019s favor is that \u00a7 19(g) uses the word \u201cwithin\u201d the 45-day period, more indicative of a beginning and an ending, rather than a fixed deadline, while Koste can point to the words, \u201c[a]t anytime,\u201d as suggesting an open-ended process. To the extent this clash of textual views creates an ambiguity, we consider the purpose of the 45-day period, particularly in light of the remainder of \u00a7 19 of Article 23A.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">III. Purpose and Consequences</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">It is common in referendum and initiative provisions to have \u201ca time limit on circulation of petitions.\u201d David B. Magleby, <em>Ballot Access for Initiatives and Popular Referendums: The Importance of Petition Circulation and Signature Validation Procedures, </em>2 J.L. <em>&amp; </em>Pol. 287, 291-92, 297 (1985).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>McQuillen, <em>The Law of Municipal Corporations </em>(3rd Ed. 2004) at \u00a7 16:60 (\u201cIt generally is required that the signatures all be secured within a certain time, which may be that between certain dates, a prescribed time after publication, or a prescribed time after signature by the mayor or, in event of his or her veto, after final passage by the council____\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The presumed rationale for a limited circulation period is most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>likely the same for any substantial restriction on the referendum or initiative. Because referendum and initiative displace the acts of a representative body, the process \u201cwas not intended to be easy to fulfill.\u201d <em>Woodland v. Mich. Citizens Lobby, </em>423 Mich. 188, 378 N.W.2d 337, 350 (1985). <em>See also Mayor and Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, </em>392 Md. 301, 332, 896 A.2d 1036 (2006) (In a municipal annexation, \u201c[t]he referendum process is not easy. Often it is a very difficult process to obtain the necessary number of signatures during the allotted period of time ....\u201d) (concurring opinion of Judge Cathell); and <em>Tyler v. Secretary of State, </em>229 Md. 397, 402, 184 A.2d 101 (1962) (Those who desire to challenge the decision of the legislative body by referendum must \u201cstrictly comply with the conditions prescribed\u201d). This differs from the rationale for a petition submission deadline. \u201cThese deadlines are motivated by the time constraints of signature validation and ballot preparation.\u201d David B. Magleby, <em>Direct Legislation: Voting and Ballot Propositions in the United States, </em>(1984) at p. 56. If \u00a7 19(g) establishes a 45-day circulation period as a substantial restriction on the referendum process, that purpose would be ill-served by an unlimited signature-gathering period.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Reading \u00a7 19(g) as providing \u201can exit point and not a beginning point for the process,\u201d the circuit judge said that the absence of circulation period promoted the democratic process by \u201cgiving people more time to think about it and not less.\u201d We must necessarily determine whether such a purpose is consistent with the remainder of \u00a7 19 of Art. <em>23A\u2014i.e., </em>the \u201cwhole statute\u201d and \u201cthe context\u201d in which Subsection (g) appears. In addition, we must also consider the consequences of such an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Subsection (d) requires multiple public notices and subsequently a public hearing, \u201cwhich may be continued and rescheduled for a subsequent time not to exceed 30 days from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the day from which the meeting was originally scheduled.\u201d At this hearing, State and regional planning agencies and the county governing body have \u201cthe first right to be heard.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As noted earlier, <em>see </em>n. 4, <em>supra, </em>under \u00a7 19(o), the municipality must adopt an annexation plan open for public review and discussion at the public hearing. Amendments to the plan are not deemed an amendment to the resolution and do not cause a reinitiation of the annexation procedure. Obviously, the public hearing and annexation plan requirements were designed by the Legislature as an efficient mechanism for the municipality to fully inform citizens and other governmental authorities about the impact of the annexation and to address and mollify their concerns after they have been heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The circuit judge\u2019s belief, that the petition\u2019s signers would have \u201cmore time to think about\u201d the resolution before the public education process begins, seems completely unrealistic. Petitions \u201conce signed allow neither for deliberation nor for compromise,\u201d Hans A. Linde, <em>On Reconstituting \u201cRepublican Government,\u201d </em>19 Okla. City U.L.Rev. 193, 205 (1994). <em>See also </em>Magleby, <em>Direct Legislation </em>at 62 (\u201cDo those citizens who sign petitions actually read what it is they are signing? The answer is generally no. Most people trust the petition circulator\u2019s description of the proposition to be accurate, and they desire to comply with the request for assistance\u201d). A likely reading of \u00a7 19(d) and (o) is that these provisions have the purpose of \u201cgiving the voters a chance to study the issue <em>before </em>being approached by circulators.\u201d) (Emphasis added). <em>Ibarra v. City of Carson, </em>214 Cal.App.3d 90, 262 Cal.Rptr. 485, 487 (2nd App. Dist.1989).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is also noteworthy that the county governing body has the same 45-day period under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u00a7 19(h) to vote to petition to referendum the annexation resolution as well as the right under \u00a7 19(o) to be heard first at the public hearing. It seems unlikely that the Legislature intended the petition to precede the county\u2019s right to influence the municipality\u2019s vote on the resolution at the public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Another possible consequence of the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 19(g) permits a frontally open-ended petition circulation period is that voters will sign a petition on a bill that could be amended before final passage, requiring \u201cthe whole effort to be undertaken anew.\u201d <em>Selinger v. Governor, </em>266 Md. 431, 437, 293 A.2d 817 (1972).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In a clever attempt to limit the effect of the circuit court\u2019s ruling, Koste argues that the circulation period is not completely open-ended, but begins when the notice of the proposed resolution is given and that any substantial amendments to the resolution would require the entire process to begin anew with the introduction of a new resolution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, he contends, voters would never be faced with signing a petition for referendum of a resolution that substantially departs from what is finally enacted. However, the text of \u00a7 19 offers scant support for such a reading. The 45-day period is tied to \u201cfinal enactment\u201d not the first notice of the introduction of the resolution. In addition, such a proffered interpretation invites endless debates over whether an amendment is substantive or nonsubstantive with resulting uncertainty for the Town Commissioners and the petition gatherers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Therefore, based on our examination of the text of the entire statute, its purpose and the consequences of Koste\u2019s proffered interpretation, we believe that the General Assembly intended the 45-day period of \u00a7 19(g) to be a restriction on the circulation of petitions that does not permit signatures to be gathered before final enactment of the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">IV. Relevant Caselaw</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Although this statutory analysis does not favor Koste, he seeks to rescue the day on the basis of <em>Mayor &amp; Town Council of Oakland v. Mayor &amp; Town Council of Mountain Lake Park, supra. </em>This case involved warring municipal annexations, one of which was petitioned to referendum and the appropriate method of computing notice requirements. Koste emphasizes a factual statement in the Court\u2019s opinion that several weeks before the public hearing on the Mountain Lake Park resolution, the Town Clerk \u201cprepared a referendum petition that was circulated to ... residents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 306, 896 A.2d 1036; and appears to equate this fact with judicial approval of pre-enactment petition circulation. Even if prepared by the Town Clerk \u201cseveral weeks before the public hearing,\u201d meant that some petitions were in fact circulated before enactment of the resolution, such a factual recital in a case having nothing to do \"with the validity of pre-enactment circulation of referendum petitions is less than <em>dicta </em>and in no way tantamount to a judicial blessing of what happened in this case. Moreover, other statements in the Court\u2019s opinion actually undercut Koste\u2019s position. For example, the Court notes that \u201cthe purpose of the forty-five day period is to provide citizens with sufficient time <em>to circulate and present </em>a referendum petition to the municipality....\u201d 392 Md. at 325, 896 A.2d 1036 (Emphasis added). Again, the Court states: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201cBy operation of Art. 23A, \u00a7 19(f)-(h), each constituency receives a fixed period of time during which to consider the proposed annexation, <em>circulate a petition </em>for referendum, and ultimately, present a petition for referendum to the municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 896 A.2d 1036. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court erred in concluding that under \u00a7 19(g), petition signatures gathered prior to the 45-day period before final enactment of the annexation resolution could be counted toward petitioning the resolution to referendum. Without counting pre-enactment signatures, the referendum effort failed to obtain a sufficient number. The resolution was not suspended and it became effective as enacted. Thus, we reverse the circuit court and remand for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT REVERSED.
