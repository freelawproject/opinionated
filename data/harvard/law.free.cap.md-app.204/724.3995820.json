(\u201cSean\u201d). Appellant William H., Sean\u2019s purported father (\u201cFather\u201d) filed an objection to the stepparent adoption, but did so beyond the time provided by the juvenile court\u2019s show cause order. Appellant Jeffrey K. (\u201cStepfather\u201d) moved to strike the late objection, and the Circuit Court for Queen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Anne\u2019s County granted the motion. Following the order to strike, Father filed motions to alter and amend judgment and to stay adoption proceedings, both of which the circuit court denied. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Father presents two issues for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">I. Whether a natural parent\u2019s failure to file a timely objection to a proposed independent adoption, as directed in a show cause order, constitutes an irrevocable consent to the adoption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">II. Whether the statutory scheme resulting in an irrevocable deemed consent to an independent adoption offends the due process rights of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Sean, the minor child who is the subject of this case, was born on June 16, 2009, to Moira K., his mother (\u201cMother\u201d). Mother and Father, an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Maryland, were in a romantic relationship during April through November of 2008. Shortly after Sean\u2019s birth, on July 14, 2009, Mother filed a custody action against Father in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, alleging that \u201cWilliam [H.] is the natural father of the minor child.\u201d Mother sought sole legal and physical custody of Sean. In his answer to the complaint, Father denied that he was Sean\u2019s natural father, and the custody case was ultimately dismissed by the agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">\u25a0 Since his birth, Sean has resided exclusively with Mother. Since Mother and Stepfather\u2019s marriage on October 16, 2010, Sean has resided with both Mother and Stepfather. Additionally, Stepfather has been involved with Sean\u2019s life on a daily basis since Sean was born. Mother asserts that, as of the time the instant action was filed, Father had not been involved with Sean since his birth, had not attempted to establish paternity, and had not attempted to assert any parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having been involved with Sean since his birth and intending to remain in a parental role, Stepfather filed a Petition for Stepparent Adoption of a Minor on March 30, 2011. Mother consented to Stepfather\u2019s adoption of Sean, and filed a Consent to Adoption without Termination of Parental Rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">The Petition for Stepparent Adoption stated in paragraph 7: That the natural father of the minor child has not been identified; no persons alleging to be the natural father of the minor child have come forward; and no natural father is listed on the minor child\u2019s birth certificate. However, in July, 2009 the natural mother of the minor child, Moira ... filed a Complaint for Custody against William ...; case number C-09-142875 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The Complaint and case was [sic] dismissed by the parties on or about January 21, 2010----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The Petition for Stepparent Adoption also noted that, \u201cthe natural father of the child is not joining in the present petition.\u201d In paragraph 10, the Petition stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">That if William ... is the natural father of the minor child, he has abandoned his parental rights to the minor child, Sean, for the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">I. He denied that he is the natural father of the minor child in his Answer to Complaints which was filed under oath with this Honorable Court....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">II. He has not exercised any parental rights since the minor child\u2019s birth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">III. He has not attempted to make any contact with the minor child, has not contacted the minor child by telephone, letters, cards, gifts, or in any way made an effort to see the minor child since birth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">IV. He has not attempted to contribute financially or otherwise to the support and maintenance of the minor child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The Petition further states, in paragraph 12, that \u201c[i]t is in the best interests of the minor child, Sean, that the parental rights of William ..., or any other person who may allege to be the natural father of the minor child, be terminated.\u201d Along with the Petition, Stepfather, through counsel, filed a Line requesting that the court file \u201ca Show Cause Order and Notice of Objection to William ..., who is the person suspected of being the natural father to the minor child to be adopted in the above captioned matter.\u201d On April 15, 2011, the court issued a show cause order and notice of objection to Father, and Father was properly served by personal service on April 29, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The show cause order stated, in pertinent part (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">RELATIONSHIP TO POTENTIAL ADOPTEE: [Purported] FATHER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">You are hereby notified that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">1. A Petition has been filed for the adoption of Sean ..., who was born on June 19, 2009 in Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">2. If you wish to object to the adoption(s), you must file a notice of objection with the Clerk of the Court at Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County ... within thirty (30) days after this Order is served on you. For your convenience, a form notice of objection is attached to this Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAF\">WHETHER THE PETITION REQUESTS ADOPTION OR GUARDIANSHIP, IF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE STATED ABOVE, YOU HAVE AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The Form Notice of Objection, which was provided to Father along with the show cause order, stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeB\">Instructions to the person served with the show cause order. IF YOU WISH TO OBJECT, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>STATED IN THE SHOW CAUSE ORDER. You may use this form to do so. You need only sign this form, print or type your name, address, and telephone number underneath your signature, and mail or deliver it to the court at the address shown in paragraph 2 of the show cause order. IF THE COURT HAS NOT RECEIVED YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE STATED, YOU HAVE AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Any objection to the show cause order was required to be received by the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County by Tuesday, May 31, 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Father\u2019s objection, however, was not received by the court until Wednesday, June 1, 2011, one day after the thirty-day deadline.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stepfather, through counsel, filed a Motion to Strike Late Notice of Objection on June 13, 2011, arguing that the objection should be stricken as untimely. The parties filed various responses to the Motion to Strike, and the court held a hearing regarding the motion on August 8, 2011. The Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County granted Stepfather\u2019s Motion to Strike Late Notice of Objection and further ordered that the adoption proceed in the normal course, as uncontested. In his order, the circuit judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Title 9 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure applies. Specifically, 9-107(b), applies and it sets forth that any notice of objection to an adoption or guardianship shall be filed within 30 days after the show cause order is served. In this case, the show cause order, which complies with the rules and the forms, was served by personal service. It was served on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>April 29th of 2011. Notice of objection was filed in this court on June 1st 2011. By my calculations and I think its also been stated here today, that is two days late.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">Quite simply, the Court is to determine whether 9-107 is mandatory. I have heard no reason that would create good cause to exceed the rule. There has been no indication of any disability or of any other reason, its just a late filing and because of that, I find that the motion to strike is appropriate and I\u2019ll strike the notice of objection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Thereafter, Father filed a motion to Alter and Amend Judgment on August 18, 2011, and filed an Emergency Motion to Stay Adoption Proceeding on August 24, 2011. The court denied both motions on September 12, 2011. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In child custody and termination of parental rights cases, this court utilizes three interrelated standards of review. <em>In re Adoption of Victor A., </em>386 Md. 288, 297, 872 A.2d 662, 667 (2005) (citing <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003)). The Court of Appeals described the three interrelated standards as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">We point out three distinct aspects of review in child custody disputes. When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(c) ] applies. [Second,] if it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa8\"><em>In re Yve S., supra, </em>373 Md. at 586, 819 A.2d at 1051. We review the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to matters of law <em>de novo. In re Adoption/Guardianship of Audrey B., Adriana H., and Eric H., </em>186 Md.App. 454, 463, 974 A.2d 965, 970 (2009) (quoting <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (\u201c[W]here an order [of the trial court] involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, [the appellate court] must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d)). There is no factual finding at issue involved in this appeal; the issue at stake is an order of the trial court involving the interpretation of Maryland statutory law. Accordingly, we review the trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding the effect of Father\u2019s untimely objection <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Summarizing the contentions of the parties, Father first argues that his failure to file a timely objection to the proposed independent adoption within the required time period does not constitute an irrevocable consent to the adoption. Stepfather responds that Father concedes that he did not timely file a notice of objection, and that under the reasoning of various cases construing the same thirty-day objection period within the context of CINA cases, Father\u2019s deemed consent is irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Second, Father argues that even if his failure to file a timely objection is considered a deemed consent under Maryland law, the deemed consent scheme is unconstitutional because it violates his constitutional right to enjoy the society of his child. Stepfather responds that, under existing law, the Maryland statutory scheme is constitutional and violates no constitutional right of Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We address each of Father\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Father\u2019s first argument is that his failure to file a timely objection to the proposed independent adoption within the required time period is not an irrevocable consent to the adoption. Father argues that the case law construing the thirty-day objection period is within the context of Child in Need of Assistance (\u201cCI\u00d1A\u201d) and guardianship proceedings, and is therefore irrelevant to an independent adoption where the child is not CINA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, Father argues that the trial court should have established his paternity before proceeding with the adoption. We find neither argument persuasive, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">A. Statutory construction and applicability of guardianship-related case law</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Father is correct that we have not previously addressed the issue of deemed consent in the context of independent adoptions. We, however, disagree with Father\u2019s argument that the existing case law is entirely inapplicable. We believe that prior cases construing the same thirty-day objection period in the context of guardianship proceedings are relevant to independent adoptions as well, inasmuch as the language is nearly identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We begin our analysis of the thirty-day objection period by examining the language of the statute and implementing rules. When presented with an issue of statutory construction, we keep in mind the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">Our predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous, our search for legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>tive intent ends and we apply the language as written in a commonsense manner. We do not add words or ignore those that are there. If there is any ambiguity, we may then seek to fathom the legislative intent by looking at legislative history and applying the most relevant of the various canons that courts have created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><em>Audrey B., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 462-63, 974 A.2d at 970 (quoting <em>Downes v. Downes, </em>388 Md. 561, 571-72, 880 A.2d 343 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The procedures governing independent adoptions are found in \u00a7\u00a7 5-3B-01 to 5-3B-32 of the Family Law Article and their implementing rules. Section 5-3B-15 provides that, after a petition to adopt is filed, the court must issue a show cause order \u201con each of the prospective adoptee\u2019s living parents who has not consented to the adoption.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-3B-15 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court may only enter an order for adoption if each of the prospective adoptee\u2019s living parents consents, either in writing or \u201cby failure to timely file notice of objection after being served with a show cause order.... \u201d FL \u00a7 5-3B-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The implementing rules regarding adoptions and guardian-ships are found in Maryland Rules 9-101 through 9-113. Md. Rule 9-105 sets forth the requirements for show cause orders, including when show cause orders are required to be filed and the content of such orders. Md. Rule 9~105(a) states that a show cause order is required in public agency guardianships, public agency adoptions, private agency guardianships, and independent adoptions. There are various requirements concerning the contents of a show cause order, and regardless of the type of proceeding, all show cause orders must include language substantially similar to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201cIF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE STATED DEADLINE, YOU HAVE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Md. Rule 9-105(e). Father does not dispute that he was served with a show cause order and that the show cause order he received is consistent with the requirements of Md. Rule 9-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Md. Rule 9-107 sets forth the time period in which a parent may file a notice of objection to an adoption or guardianship proceeding, and states: \u201cany notice of objection to an adoption or guardianship shall be filed within 30 days after the show cause order is served.\u201d There is no dispute that Father was properly served, or that his notice of objection was not timely filed. The show cause order was personally served on Father on April 29, 2011. Father filed his notice of objection on June 1, 2011, one day beyond the deadline proscribed in Md. Rule 9\u2014107(b)(1). Father does not argue that there was anything unclear about the language of the show cause order, nor does he give any reason why he failed to file a timely objection. The dispute, rather, revolves around the effect, if any, of Father\u2019s untimely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">It is well settled that, in the context of guardianship cases, failure to file a timely objection serves as an irrevocable deemed consent to termination of parental rights. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship of Chaden M., </em>189 Md.App. 411, 984 A.2d 420 (2009) (\u201c[A] failure to timely file a notice of objection amounts to a consent to guardianship ... Moreover, a deemed consent is irrevocable.\u201d) (citing <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Audrey B., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 465-76, 974 A.2d 965); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 486, 687 A.2d 681, 694 (1997) (concluding there was no right to revoke a deemed consent under prior statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The Court of Appeals first addressed this issue in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681. In that case, the Court considered five cases in which the State sought guardianship of a child. <em>Id. </em>The Court considered whether the circuit court had authority to consider an objection filed after the time specified in the show cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>order and, if a parent failed to file a timely objection and was therefore deemed to have consented, whether the parent may thereafter revoke that deemed consent. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 687 A.2d at 684.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the circuit court did not have the authority to entertain untimely objections, and that a deemed consent was irrevocable. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 687 A.2d at 699. The Court noted that a termination of parental rights may be entered upon \u201cthe voluntary, affirmative consent of the natural parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 687 A.2d at 690-91. Alternatively, \u201cin cases in which the parent does not affirmatively consent to the guardianship ... the court, upon the filing of a [guardianship] petition, [must] enter and serve upon the parent a show cause order informing the parent of the petition ... The order explains in plain language that the parents have the right to object to the guardianship but that, if they wish to object, they must file their objection with the court by the date set forth in the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court concluded that a failure to object within the required time period served as a statutory deemed consent. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 687 A.2d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The Court then turned to the issue of revocability of deemed consents, and concluded that deemed consents were irrevocable. In <em>93321055, </em>as in the instant case, the parents had been served with show cause orders but failed to file timely objections. <em>Id. </em>at 466-74, 687 A.2d at 685-89. The circuit court had accepted the late-filed objections. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals found that, although the statute provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>period for parents to revoke their explicitly granted consent, there was no such right to revoke a deemed consent because a deemed consent is \u201ca consent ... arising by operation of law, not by volition, and it is not within the power of the parent to revoke it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 687 A.2d at 694. The Court noted that \u201cthe revocation period allowed under \u00a7 5-317(e) ... is clear, fixed, and easily ascertained. The certainty of the period is essential for DSS and the court to know what, if any, right to notice and participation the parent retains. That certainty would not exist if a right to revoke is attached to the \u2018deemed\u2019 consent under \u00a7 5-322.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 687 A.2d at 694. The Court of Appeals, therefore, concluded that circuit courts do not have authority to entertain late-filed objections and that deemed consents arising as a result of failure to object are irrevocable. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 687 A.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The underlying statute governing the deemed consent process for guardianships has since been amended, but the basis for finding that failure to file a timely objection constitutes an irrevocable deemed consent remains. In <em>In re Audrey B., </em>we found \u201cnothing in the amended statute that causes us to believe that the rationale applied by the Court in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra </em>does not continue to apply with equal force to the 2005 revisions to Maryland\u2019s guardianship and adoption laws.\u201d 186 Md.App. at 476, 974 A.2d at 978. We held, \u201cthere remains no right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent entered by operation of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">As a matter of statutory construction, we see no reason why the rationale of <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681, and <em>In re Audrey B., supra, </em>186 Md.App. 454, 974 A.2d 965, should not apply to independent adoption cases as well. The statutory language regarding failure to object as deemed consent in guardianship proceedings is found in FL \u00a7 5-320, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">(a) <em>Consent and acquiescence or best </em>interests.\u2014A juvenile court may grant guardianship of a child only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>(iii) 1. Each of the child\u2019s living parents consents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-4\">A. in writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">B. knowingly and voluntarily, on the record before the juvenile court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">C. <em>by failure to file a timely notice of objection </em>after being served with a show cause order in accordance with this subtitle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">FL \u00a7 5-320 (emphasis added). Therefore, failure to file a timely notice of objection serves as a statutory deemed consent in guardianship proceedings. <em>See In re Audrey B., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 476, 974 A.2d at 978. Moreover, a statutory deemed consent due to failure to file a timely notice of objection is irrevocable. <em>Id. </em>at 476, 974 A.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Father is correct that we have not yet construed the statute governing failure to object in independent adoption proceedings. The language of the statute, however, is substantially similar to that governing guardianships, and we see no reason why the rationale of <em>Audrey B. </em>should not apply. Section 5-3B-20 of the Family Law Article, governing authority to grant independent adoptions, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">A court may enter an order for adoption only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-9\">(l)(i) 1. Each of the prospective adoptee\u2019s living parents consents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-10\">A. in writing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">B. <em>by failure to timely file notice of objection </em>after being served with a show cause order in accordance with this subtitle....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">FL \u00a7 5-3B-20 (emphasis added). The relevant language here is identical to the language of \u00a7 5-320, and we find no basis to conclude that the legislature intended the language of \u00a7 5-3B-20 be given different effect than the language of \u00a7 5-320.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">Moreover, the committee note to \u00a7 5-3B-19, now renumbered as \u00a7 5-3B-20,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> indicates that the legislature, in its 2005 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>revisions to the adoption and guardianship statutes, intended that a failure to file a timely objection serve as a deemed consent to an independent adoption. The committee note provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\">This section is derived from former FL SECTION 5-317(c)(2), as it related to adoption under this subtitle, and <em>revised to clarify that failure to respond to a show cause order is deemed to be consent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Committee Note, 2005 Md. Laws, ch 464 \u00a7 3, p. 2718 (emphasis added). The committee note applies exclusively to \u00a7 5-3B-20, entitled \u201cAuthority to grant adoption.\u201d This section pertains solely to independent adoption, and the committee note explicitly indicates that the legislature intended that failure to respond to a show cause order serve as a deemed consent in the context of independent adoptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Additionally, the Maryland Rules governing the thirty-day objection period also provide support for the conclusion that failure to respond to a show cause order constitutes a deemed consent in the context of independent adoptions. Md. Rule 9-107 sets out the objection requirements for both adoption and guardianship proceedings, and does not differentiate between the two. Rule 9-107 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">(a) In general. Any person having a right to participate in a proceeding for <em>adoption or guardianship </em>may file a notice of objection to the <em>adoption or guardianship. </em>The notice may include a statement of the reasons for the objection and a request for the appointment of an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">(b) Time for filing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">(1) In general. Except as provided by subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this Rule, <em>any notice of objection to an adoption or guardianship shall be filed within SO days after the show cause order is served.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2f\">Md. Rule 9-107 (emphasis added). The rule does not differentiate between guardianships and adoptions, nor does it set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>forth different time limits for guardianships and adoptions. We see no basis in the rules for interpreting the requirements for filing of objection in independent adoptions differently than for guardianships. Thus, we conclude that failure to timely object to an independent adoption has the same effect as failure to timely object to a guardianship. As a result, the failure to timely object to an independent adoption serves as a statutory deemed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Further, we find no basis to conclude that the legislature intended that a deemed consent be revocable while a deemed consent to a guardianship is irrevocable. \u00a7 5-3B-21(b) governs revocation of consent for independent adoptions, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">(b) <em>Revocation </em>period.\u2014(l)(i) Subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a parent may revoke consent at any time within 30 days after the parent signs the consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">(ii) A parent may not revoke consent for adoption of a prospective adoptee if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">1. In the preceding year, the parent has revoked consent for or filed a notice of objection to adoption of the prospective adoptee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">2. The child is at least 30 days old and consent is given before a judge on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">FL \u00a7 5-3B-21(b). This language is nearly identical to the language regarding revocation of consent in the context of guardianships, which we have held does not provide a right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent. <em>In re Audrey B., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 476, 974 A.2d at 978. The statute governing revocation of consent in guardianship proceedings is found in FL \u00a7 5-321, and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-11\">[A] person may revoke consent to the guardianship at any time within the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">(i) 30 days after the person signs the consent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-13\">(ii) 30 days after the consent is filed as required under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">FL \u00a7 5-321 (c). Both for independent adoptions and for guardianships, the statute allows for revocation of a signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>consent within thirty days after the consent is signed. FL \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014321(c); 5-3B-21(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">It is well established that a deemed consent arising as the result of a failure to object is not revocable in guardianship proceedings. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 486, 687 A.2d at 694 (\u201c[TJhere is no right to revoke a statutory consent arising under \u00a7 5-322(d). That is a consent, as we have said, arising by operation of law, not by volition, and it is not within the power of the parent to revoke it.\u201d) (construing the former statute); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Audrey B. </em>186 Md.App. at 476, 974 A.2d at 978 (\u201cWe hold that ... there remains no right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent entered by operation of law.\u201d). Given that the language regarding revocation of consent is nearly identical for guardianships and independent adoptions, we see no reason to adopt an alternate conclusion here. We conclude that failure to object to an independent adoption constitutes a deemed consent. Accordingly, there is no right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent entered by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">B. Establishment of Paternity</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Father also argues that, before initiating an independent adoption proceeding, the court should have first established Father\u2019s paternity conclusively. Father points to no ease law to support his contention that a putative father can only consent or object to an adoption or guardianship if his paternity has been conclusively established. Existing law and common sense both suggest the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">A court may enter an order for adoption only if each of the prospective adoptee\u2019s living parents consents. FL \u00a7 5-3B-20. \u201c \u2018Parent\u2019 means an individual who, at any time before a court enters an order for adoption under this subtitle: (i) meets a criterion in \u00a7 5-3B-05(a); or (ii) is the mother.\u201d Section 5-3B-05(a) provides that unless a court excludes a man as the father of a child, a man is the father if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">(1) the man was married to the child\u2019s mother at the time of the child\u2019s conception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>(2) the man was married to the child\u2019s mother at the time of the child\u2019s birth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">(3) the man is named as the father on the child\u2019s birth certificate and has not signed a denial of paternity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">(4) the. child\u2019s mother has named the man as the child\u2019s father and the man has not signed a denial of paternity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">(5) the man has been adjudicated to be the child\u2019s father;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">(6) the man has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the child\u2019s biological father;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">(7) on the basis of genetic testing, the man is indicated to be the child\u2019s biological father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">FL \u00a7 5-3B-05. The statute explicitly does not require a potential father be adjudicated the father before being permitted to consent or object to an adoption. Instead, the statute provides various circumstances in which a purported father\u2019s consent is required.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the statute does not contemplate that a father\u2019s paternity be conclusively determined before he has standing to consent or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Moreover, show cause orders are often issued to putative fathers whose paternity has not been conclusively established. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 468, 687 A.2d at 685-86; <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Joshua M., </em>166 Md.App. 341, 344, 888 A.2d 1201, 1202 (2005). In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>the court noted that show cause orders were issued to two men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>who were suspected of being the child\u2019s father. 344 Md. at 468, 687 A.2d at 686. One of the putative fathers filed a timely objection. <em>Id. </em>At no point did the court seek to establish paternity before filing show cause orders and allowing the putative fathers to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Joshua M., </em>two potential fathers were issued show cause orders and informed of the opportunity to object to a guardianship proceeding. 166 Md. App. at 344 n. 2, 888 A.2d at 1202 n. 2. One of the putative fathers, Harry M., denied paternity, and the other putative father, Peter C., never responded to the show cause order. <em>Id. </em>The court found that Peter C. was \u201cdeemed to have consented\u201d to the petition to terminate his parental rights. <em>Id. </em>Peter C. was deemed to have consented even though his paternity had never been conclusively established. Here, Father similarly is deemed to have consented even though his paternity has not been conclusively established.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Adopting Father\u2019s view on this point, which would require paternity to be established before any parent can waive an objection to a guardianship or adoption proceeding, would also be nonsensical from an efficiency standpoint. Had Father objected timely, he would have had the opportunity to establish paternity. Given that putative fathers often consent to a guardianship or adoption, there is no reason to require them to establish paternity simply to relinquish their parental rights. There is simply no rational reason to require paternity determinations prior to the issuance of a show cause order and the opportunity to object. We, therefore, conclude that Father was properly served with a show cause order, and had he timely objected, would have had the opportunity to establish paternity. Accordingly, establishing his paternity at an earlier point in the proceedings was not necessary in order for Father to have standing to file a timely objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Second, Father argues that Maryland\u2019s deemed consent scheme violates his constitutional right to the society <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>of his child, and that his \u201cconstitutional right to enjoy the society of his child should \u2018trump\u2019 any statutory procedural default scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is well established that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in raising their children under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 491, 687 A.2d at 697 (citing <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services, </em>452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981); <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983)). The Court of Appeals articulated three principles regarding parents\u2019 rights in this area:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\"><em>Lassiter, Santosky, </em>and their progeny recognize three basic principles: (1) parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children, (2) when the State moves to abrogate that interest, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures, and (3) the process due to parents in that circumstance turns on a balancing of the three factors specified in <em>Matthews </em>[Mathews] <em>v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319 [96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18] (1976), <em>i.e., </em>the private interests affected by the proceeding, the risk of error created by the State\u2019s chosen procedure, and the countervailing governmental interest supporting the use of the challenged procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>In re 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 491, 687 A.2d at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In <em>In re 93321055, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the deemed consent scheme, in the context of guardianship proceedings, \u201c[did] not facially offend any due process right of the parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 687 A.2d at 698.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>deemed consent scheme, in the context of independent adoptions, is similarly consistent with due process. We further hold that the process provided to natural parents is fundamentally fair and is consistent with the process due under <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>there is a constitutional right at issue here,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we are confident that the procedures provided to natural parents within the context of independent adoption proceedings are fundamentally fair, and that the process afforded to natural parents is consistent with the <em>Mathews </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We hold that the procedures provided to natural parents pursuant to Sections 5-3B-01 through 5-3B-32 of the Family Law Article and Maryland Rules 9-105 and 9-107 are fundamentally fair. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-3B-01 through 5-3B-32; Md. Rules 9-105, 9-107. Parents are required to be notified when an adoption petition is filed, a show cause order must be served on each of the adoptee\u2019s living parents who has not consented to the adoption, and the court may enter an order for adoption only if each of the prospective adoptee\u2019s living parents consents, either in writing or by failure to file timely notice of objection. FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-3B-14, -15, -20. The show cause order must explicitly notify the parent of his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>right to object to the adoption, and the show cause order must include language substantially similar to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201cIF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE STATED DEADLINE, YOU HAVE AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Md. Rule 9-105(e). Where, as here, a father is notified that an adoption petition has been filed, has been afforded the opportunity to object, and had been made aware of the consequences if he does not timely object, we believe that he has been provided with fundamentally fair procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">We also believe that the process afforded to Father is consistent with the <em>Mathews </em>factors. Under <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>the process due to parents turns on a balancing of the following three factors: (1) the private interests affected by the proceeding, (2) the risk of error created by the State\u2019s chosen procedure, and (3) the countervailing governmental interest supporting the use of the challenged procedure. <em>In re 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 491, 687 A.2d at 697 (citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)). Balancing these three factors, the deemed consent scheme does not offend Father\u2019s due process rights. We discuss the first and third <em>Mathews </em>factors, the opposing private and governmental interests, before turning to the second factor, the risk of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">The first factor, the private interest affected by this proceeding, is Father\u2019s interest in parenting Sean, based upon the parent\u2019s due process right to raise his or her children. The Court of Appeals has noted that \u201cthere are few, if any, rights more basic than that one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491-92, 687 A.2d at 697. The third factor, the countervailing governmental interest, is to provide adoptive parents and children permanency and predictability within a fair process. The legislature specifically stated that one purpose of the adoption subtitle was to \u201ctimely provide permanent and safe homes for children consistent with their best interests.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-3B-03(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Father argues that the governmental interest in a private adoption case is not as strong as the governmental interest in a guardianship proceeding. It is true that in <em>In re 93321055, </em>the Court of Appeals stressed that \u201cthe governmental interest in securing permanent homes for children placed into its custody because of an inability or unwillingness of their parents to care for them properly is ... strong and vital.\u201d 344 Md. at 492, 687 A.2d at 697. We believe, however, that the interest set forth by the legislature here\u2014the interest in providing \u201ctimely ... permanent and safe homes for children consistent with their best interests\u201d\u2014is a compelling interest as well. FL \u00a7 5-3B-03(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Finally, we return to the second <em>Mathews </em>factor: the risk of error created by the adoption of a strict, thirty-day objection deadline. We believe that the risk of error presented by the deemed consent scheme is quite limited. In discussing the risk of error created by the deemed consent scheme in the context of guardianship proceedings, the Court of Appeals emphasized the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">We cannot say that there is <em>no </em>risk of error in an absolute deadline, but zero tolerance is not required and is probably not achievable in any procedure. The statutory deemed consent does not exist in a vacuum. It arises only after service on the parent of a show cause order that explains, in plain, simple language, the right to object, how, where, and when to file a notice of objection, and the consequence of not filing one within the time allowed. A form notice of objection is attached to the order, and all the parent need do is sign it, print on it his or her name, address, and telephone number, and mail or deliver it to the address shown in the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-7\"><em>In re 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 493, 687 A.2d at 698. There is no indication that any extreme circumstance interfered with Father\u2019s ability to comply with the thirty-day deadline, and, as in <em>In re 93321055, </em>Father has offered no excuse beyond mere neglect for failing to file a timely objection. We, therefore, find no equitable reasons in the record that justify Father\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>late filing of objection.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Father has not argued that he was confused by the procedure required for objection, and as an attorney, Father should have understood the importance of complying with court-ordered deadlines. We conclude, therefore, that Father\u2019s due process rights were not offended by the statutory deemed consent scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Balancing the factors outlined in <em>Mathews, </em>therefore, we conclude that the statutory scheme regarding the failure to file a timely objection as an irrevocable deemed consent to the independent adoption petition does not offend any due process right of the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR QUEEN ANNE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

It is important to note that in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>the Court of Appeals construed the thirty-day objection period as required under an earlier version of the statute. The statute then in effect, FL \u00a7 5-322(d), provided in relevant part: \"If a person is notified under this section and fails to file notice of objection within the time stated in the show cause order ...

In this case, it is unclear whether Father meets the definition of father set forth in \u00a7 5-3B-05, and therefore it is not obvious whether Father\u2019s consent is even required for the court to enter an order for adoption. Mother and Father were never married; Father is not named as the father on Sean\u2019s birth certificate; Father was not adjudicated to be Sean\u2019s father; Father had not, at the initiation of the adoption proceeding, acknowledged himself to be Sean\u2019s biological father; and Father has not been indicated to be Sean\u2019s father on the basis of biological testing. Shortly after Sean\u2019s birth, Mother named Father as Sean's father in a custody proceeding in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, case number C-09-142875. Father denied paternity in his Answer, and the case was dismissed by agreement of the parties. Inasmuch as Stepfather has not argued that Father\u2019s consent is not required because he does not meet the statutory definition of father under this statute, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b767-8\">. Father does not argue specifically the precise provision of the Constitution he believes is violated by the deemed consent scheme, but his brief includes language regarding a \"fundamental right\u201d and relies upon case law construing the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to any constitutional issues arising under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b767-9\">. The Court of Appeals also determined that the deemed consent scheme did not violate the parents\u2019 equal protection rights in guardian<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ship proceedings. <em>In re 93321055, supra, </em>344 Md. at 495, 687 A.2d at 699.

It is not clear whether Father actually possesses a fundamental right to the society of Sean, given that Father and Mother were not married at the time of Sean\u2019s birth and Father has had no involvement with Sean up to this point. <em>See Lehr v.

But the mere existence of a biological link does not merit equivalent constitutional protection.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We decline to reach the issue of whether or not Father, in the instant case, held a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the society of his child, because we find, even if he had such an interest, the interest was adequately protected by the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">.
