Appellant, Montgomery County, Maryland (the \u201cCounty\u201d) denied the request for a refund and MEDCO appealed to the tax court. The tax court agreed with the County that no exemption applied and affirmed the denial of the refund. MEDCO petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court reversed the tax court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the recordation tax falls within an exemption. The County noted a timely appeal, raising one issue, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">I. Did the tax court properly interpret the law and find that MEDCO was not exempt from paying recordation tax on a deed of trust, where the tax is imposed on the privilege of recording the document and not on a particular party to the transaction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We answer this question in the affirmative and, as such, we reverse and vacate the decision of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with instructions to affirm the judgment of the Maryland Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In 2009, MEDCO entered into a loan agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC Bank\u201d) in which MEDCO borrowed $3,300,000 from PNC Bank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 26, 2009, MEDCO\u2019s Executive Director, Robert Brennan, signed a document titled \u201cLeasehold Deed of Trust,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] Assignment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Security Agreement.\u201d In this document, MEDCO was identified as the grantor, PNC Bank was identified as the bank, as well as the beneficiary of the Deed of Trust, and Richard Woo, who was listed at the same address as PNC Bank, was identified as the trustee. The Leasehold Deed of Trust, Assignment and Security Agreement contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">14. <em>Expenses. </em>The performance of each and every obligation on the Grantor\u2019s part under the Loan Documents shall be at the sole expense of the Grantor, and neither the Bank nor the Trustee shall have any obligation for any such expenses. In addition to any other amounts required to be paid by the Grantor under the Loan Documents or with respect to the Property, the Grantor shall pay the following (collectively called the \u201cExpenses\u201d): (a) all filing, registration and recording costs and fees and all federal, state, county and municipal stamp taxes and other taxes, duties, imposts, assessment and charges in connection with the recordation or filing of any Loan Documents or related instruments, and any documents in connection with any foreclosure____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In April 2009, the Leasehold Deed of Trust, Assignment and Security Agreement, dated March 26, 2009, from MEDCO as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>grantor for the benefit of PNC, was presented to the County Transfer Office for processing, prior to the deed being recorded among the County Land Records. At the time the deed of trust was presented, MEDCO claimed an exemption from the recordation tax pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Economic Development (\u201cEcon.Dev.\u201d) \u00a7 10-129.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Transfer Office denied the exemption and imposed the recordation tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">On April 6, 2009, MEDCO filed a \u201cTransfer/Recordation Tax Refund Claim\u201d with the County Department of Finance and a request for a hearing. In the refund claim, MEDCO alleged it was improperly required to pay $31,450, representing the recordation tax on the deed of trust. MEDCO stated that it was entitled to a refund because the transaction involved the recording of a deed of trust, an act which was exempt from taxation based on MEDCO\u2019s tax-exempt status under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On May 20, 2009, an administrative hearing was held on the refund claim. In a letter dated June 19, 2009, Timothy L. Jones, Tax Operations Manager, Division of Treasury, for the County, denied the request for a refund. The letter contained a section captioned the \u201cBasis of Decision,\u201d which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">Recordation tax is an excise tax computable on the amount of consideration on the privilege of recording a document among the Land Records.... The taxes become due when the instrument of writing is presented for record-ing____State law does not require any particular party to pay the recordation tax. The tax is imposed on the privilege of recording the document among the Land Records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The Tax-Property Article in Section 12-108 also lists several transactions that are exempt from recordation tax. There is an exemption that applies to a transfer to a state entity; however, there is no exemption that applies to a transfer from a state agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">The Claimant has relied on the argument that because MEDCO\u2019s activities are exempt from tax, there is no tax due on this transfer. ([Eco. Dev. \u00a7] 10-129) The reliance on this section is misplaced. The County agrees that MEDCO is exempt from the requirement to pay taxes on its property, activities, or any revenue derived from its property or activities. Because the recordation tax is not a tax on its property, activities or revenues, this general exemption from payment of taxes to MEDCO is not available to prevent imposition of the recordation tax on the recording of the Deed of Trust because the recordation tax is not imposed on a particular party. MEDCO may have contractually agreed to be responsible for the recordation tax, but that contractual commitment to pay a tax cannot create an exemption from recordation tax. Only the General Assembly can create an exemption from recordation tax. In this particular case, there is no exemption from recordation tax for transfers from a state agency to a private commercial lender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">MEDCO appealed to the tax court, and on May 10, 2010, the tax court issued a Memorandum and Order, agreeing with the County and denying the refund. The tax court explained, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">It is [MEDCO\u2019s] contention that when MEDCO borrowed money for this particular project in Montgomery County and those funds were secured by a Deed of Trust to PNC Bank, this action was an activity as referred to in [Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) ]. [MEDCO\u2019s] theory of the case is that the recordation tax generated by recording the Deed of Trust from MEDCO to PNC Bank is exempt pursuant to [Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">It is the [County\u2019s] position that there was no requirement in the statute that the grantor or a Deed of Trust pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the recordation tax, and that the payment of that tax may be negotiated between the parties. That is to say, it is just as likely that PNC Bank could pay the recordation tax without the claim of any exemption. The [County] further argues that Section 12-108 of the Tax-Property Article, exempts from recordation tax, instruments of writing that transfers property to or grants a security interest to an agency of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">Lastly, Tax-Property Section 116, indicates that a governing body of a County may exempt, by law, from recordation tax an instrument of writing that transfers property from or grants a security interest from an agency of the State. Further evidence established by the [County] was that [the County] had not, by law, created an exemption as set forth in Sections 112-116, supra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">The interpretation of tax exemptions are to be strictly construed and resolved and any doubt found in the taxing authority\u2019s favor... .While [MEDCO] claims that the payment of the recordation tax in this matter is exempt under [Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) ], by virtue of the fact that this action was one of the Corporation\u2019s regular activities, strictly construing a tax exemption, this Court cannot find under Tax-Property Section 12-108 where [MEDCO] is specifically exempt from granting a secured interest to a private third party. In Tax-Property Section 12-116, the Legislature recognized that there was not a specific exemption from a recordation tax on an instrument of writing which transfers property or grants a security interest from an agency of the State and enables the governing bodies of the County, as well as the City of Baltimore the opportunity to grant an exemption if they saw fit. In this particular case, Montgomery County did not enact the legislation referred to above. Based on the specific exemptions contained] in the Tax-Property Article and mindful of the law which requires the Court to narrowly construe tax exemptions and to resolve any doubt in the favor of the taxing authority, it is this 10th day of May, 2010, by the Maryland Tax Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ORDERED that the Petition for Appeal is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On June 2, 2010, MEDCO filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the circuit court. On November 30, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing. On December 27, 2010, the circuit court issued an Order reversing and remanding the tax court\u2019s decision. On January 25, 2011, the County noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The County contends that this Court should affirm the tax court\u2019s decision denying MEDCO an exemption from payment of the recordation tax in this case. In support of this contention, the County makes three overarching arguments: (1) \u201cthat MEDCO was not exempt from paying the recordation tax on a deed of trust, because the tax is imposed on the privilege of recording the document and not on a particular party to the transaction\u201d; (2) \u201c[njeither MEDCO\u2019s status as a State agency nor its enabling statute creates an exemption from payment of the recordation tax\u201d; and (3) even if an exemption existed in this case, MEDCO waived its right to claim the exemption by entering into a consensual agreement with PNC Bank to pay the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The County asserts that the Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 exemption \u201capplies only to the requirement to pay taxes or assessments on MEDCO\u2019s \u2018properties or activities\u2019 or the revenue from those properties or activities.\u201d The County points out that State law clearly identifies the activities of MEDCO that are exempt from taxes and \u201c[ajlthough the loan transaction is within MEDCO\u2019s activities, recording the deed of trust is not a required step to effectuate the loan.\u201d The County maintains that the purpose of the recordation tax is for the privilege of recording a document among the land records, and it is not a tax on the property or activities of the borrower. The County points out that, pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Tax-Property Art. (\u201cTax-Prop\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 12-102 and 12-111, the tax is not imposed on a particular party to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The County contends that \u201cinstruments of writing that transfer property or grant a security interest to the State or any agency of the State are exempt from payment of State recordation tax\u201d; however, transfers of interest from the State or from an agency of the State are not exempt. The County contends that Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-116 permits local governments to enact a law providing for an exemption from recordation tax when an interest is transferred from the State or agency. The County points out that it has not enacted such a law, exempting from the recordation tax transfers from the State or from a State agency. The County maintains that in enacting the recordation tax statute, the General Assembly carved out specific exemptions, and, as such, if the General Assembly sought to exempt MEDCO from paying recordation tax when transferring property it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Alternatively, the County argues that if such an exemption exists, MEDCO \u201caffirmatively waived that exemption by entering into a contract with PNC Bank and agreeing to pay the tax.\u201d The County asserts that the waiver occurred when MEDCO \u201cvoluntarily entered into an agreement with the bank to pay the tax when they believed they were otherwise exempt from payment of the tax. The voluntary act relinquishing its right to claim the exemption by contract with the bank created the waiver\u2014not the objection to payment at the County\u2019s transfer office.\u201d The County points out the terms of the loan agreement between MEDCO and PNC Bank demonstrate that MEDCO \u201cagreed that any expense incurred by the bank would be paid by MEDCO, including recording of security interests.\u201d The County contends that \u201c[t]o allow MEDCO to pay the tax and then claim an exemption, however, has the effect of expanding the exemption to private parties engaged in a transaction with MEDCO.\u201d The County argues that the agreement MEDCO signed with PNC Bank \u201cshifted only the economic responsibility for payment of the tax to MEDCO-the agreement did not shift the legal incidence of the tax to MEDCO.\u201d The County contends that the General Assembly \u201cintended to exempt MEDCO only from taxes that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>required to pay by law\u2014not taxes that MEDCO agreed to pay or reimburse by contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">MEDCO responds that the tax court \u201cerred by failing to find that [it] is exempt from payment of the State recordation tax as a matter of law.\u201d MEDCO points out that it was created \u201cfor the purpose of stimulating economic growth, stimulating employment and to engage in the promotion of technological enterprise as enumerated in [Econ. Dev.] Section 10-104\u201d and was empowered \u201cto \u2018lease as lessee ... real property ... necessary to carry out its purpose^]\u2019 \u201d MEDCO asserts that as a result of its purpose, combined with its power to borrow money, and the \u201cunlimited language contained in [Econ. Dev.] Section 10-129(a),\u201d it is exempt from \u201call taxes or assessments on the property or activities of MEDCO, including the state recordation tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">MEDCO argues that Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 \u201cspecifically exempts the property and activities of MEDCO from taxation in any form.\u201d MEDCO argues that the tax court\u2019s strict construction of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 ignores the plain language of the statute and intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">MEDCO argues that the General Assembly is presumed to have full knowledge of existing law. Accordingly, MEDCO contends that \u201cwhen the Legislature enacted subsections 10-117(a)(1) and (2)[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] it was aware that any mortgage or deed of trust securing payment of money borrowed by MEDCO to finance one of its activities would be recorded to achieve and maintain priority and enforceability over subsequent encumbrances ____As a consequence, if the Legislature had intended that the universal exemption from taxation contained in subsection 10-129(a) was not applicable to the state recordation tax, it would have so provided.\u201d MEDCO argues that by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>enacting Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-111\u2014which permits the recordation tax to be paid by any person\u2014the General Assembly \u201cmust have envisioned the possibility that an entity which was by statute exempt from payment of state recordation tax would be contractually obligated to pay all expenses related to a mortgage loan resulting in no tax being paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">MEDCO contends that it \u201cdid not voluntarily waive the statutory exemption absolving it from the payment of the State recording tax.\u201d MEDCO argues that the record demonstrates that it at no point waived the exemption and at all times asserted that it was exempt from paying the recordation tax. MEDCO argues that it involuntarily paid the recordation tax, as the deed of trust would not be recorded in the land records had MEDCO refused, and after paying the tax, MED-CO immediately applied for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">(1) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Maryland Tax Court is an administrative agency, and as such, final orders of the tax court are subject to judicial review. Md.Code Ann., Tax-General Art. \u00a7 3-102; Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t Art. \u00a7 10-222; <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel County v.

Ever mindful of our desire to discern and effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intent, we examine the language of the enactment and give to the language its natural and ordinary import. If the language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, we will, ordinarily, end our inquiry. We are not, however, rigidly bound to the precepts of the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule. Where the General Assembly has chosen not to define a term used in a statute, we will give that term its ordinary and natural meaning and will not resort to subtle or forced interpretations for the purpose of extending or limiting the operation of the statute. Furthermore, we examine the entire statutory scheme and consider the purpose behind the particular statute before us. Cognizant that the language of the statute is the foundation from which our inquiry commences, we also review legislative history and the prior state of law, and contemplate the particular evil, abuse, or defect that the General Assembly wished to remedy with the enactment of the statute at issue. Moreover, the examination of related statutes is not beyond our reach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">In <em>Suburban Propane Gas Corp. v.

The taxing power is never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>presumed to be surrendered. Every assertion that it has been relinquished must, to be effective, be distinctly supported by clear and unambiguous legislative enactment. To doubt an exemption is to deny it.

Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) demonstrates that the General Assembly sought to exempt MEDCO from any requirement to pay taxes or assessments on its properties or activities, or any revenue from its properties or activities. A plain language analysis of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) reveals that MEDCO is exempt from payment of taxes imposed on its real property and activities and taxes imposed on the income from those properties or activities. If MEDCO is required to pay a tax or assessment on its properties or activities or revenue therefrom, then MEDCO is exempt; conversely, if MEDCO is not required to pay the tax, it is not exempt. Nothing in the statute provides that MEDCO is exempt from paying a tax which it was not required to pay but agreed to pay or from paying an excise tax on the transfer of a security interest to a private entity, such as PNC Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">(ii) Tax-Prop. \u00a7\u00a7 12-108(a), 12-116 and 12-111</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-108(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">(a) Transfers to public agency.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an instrument of writing is not subject to recordation tax, if the instrument of writing transfers property to or grants a security interest to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">(i) the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">(ii) the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">(iii) an agency of the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">(iv) a political subdivision in the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>(2) The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City or the governing body of a county may impose, by law, the recor-dation tax uniformly on all instruments of writing that secure repayment of debt created by the sale of bonds authorized under Title 12, Subtitle 1 of the Economic Development Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-116, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City or the governing body of a county may exempt, by law, from the recordation tax an instrument of writing that transfers property from or grants a security interest from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">(1) the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">(2) the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">(3) an agency of the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">(4) a political subdivision in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Through the plain meaning of its terms, Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-108(a) specifically provides that when an instrument of writing transfers property to, or grants a security interest to, a State agency, such as MEDCO, the instrument of writing is exempt from the recordation tax. Conversely, Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-116 specifically addresses instruments of writing which transfer property from a State agency, such as MEDCO. Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-116 permits counties, such as Montgomery County, to enact a law which exempts from the recordation tax an instrument of writing that transfers property from, or grants a security interest from, a State agency. It is undisputed that Montgomery County has not enacted such a provision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As such, there is no law exempting from the recordation tax an instrument of writing that transfers property from or grants a security interest from a State agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-111 provides that: \u201cBy agreement, recordation tax may be paid by any person.\u201d \u201cAgreement\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] mutual understanding between two or more persons about their relative rights and duties regarding past or future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>performances!)]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 74 (8th ed.2004). \u201cAgreement\u201d is also defined as \u201can arrangement as to a course of action[.]\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 26 (11th ed.2003). \u201cMay\u201d is defined as \u201cto be permitted to\u201d or \u201c[t]o be a possibility!)]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1000 (8th ed.2004). \u201cMay\u201d is also defined as \u201c\u2018have power, am able,\u2019 \u2018have the ability to,\u2019 \u2018be free to.\u2019 \u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 767 (11th ed.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In sum, the plain language of Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-111 demonstrates that recordation tax may be paid by either party, and the parties are able to agree as to who will pay the tax. From the language of Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-111, MEDCO is clearly not mandated or required to pay the recordation tax, as the tax \u201cmay be paid by any person.\u201d A plain language review of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129, Tax-Prop. \u00a7\u00a7 12-108(a), 12-116, and 12-111 does not support the conclusion that MEDCO is exempt from paying the recordation tax in this case-a tax which it was not required to pay but voluntarily agreed to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">(B) Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The legislative history of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129, Tax-Prop. \u00a7\u00a7 12-108(a), 12-116, and 12-111 compels the conclusion that MEDCO is not exempt from paying the recordation tax in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">(i) Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 was first enacted in 1984, by Article 41 \u00a7 567, which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">With the exception of the State and local real estate taxes as required below, the Corporation shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon its properties or activities or upon any revenues therefrom; provided however that whenever the Corporation sells or leases land or facilities to any private entity or entities, such land or facilities shall be subject to State and local property taxes from the time of such sale or lease.

The Supreme Court held that under the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, the federal land bank was exempt from paying the recordation tax. <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 43 S.Ct. 385. The Federal Farm Loan Act provided that \u201cfirst mortgages executed to Federal Land Banks shall be deemed \u2018instrumentalities of the Government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from Federal, State, municipal and local taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377, 43 S.Ct. 385. The Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">The tax was sustained by the Supreme Court of [Alabama] and the petition for mandamus was ordered to be dismissed on the ground that the payment was optional; that the Federal Land Bank was not required to put its deed on record, and that if it did it must pay whatever others were required to pay for the registration of its security. But the case is not quite so simple as that. The law of Alabama does make it practically necessary to record such deeds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>because it overrides them if not recorded, in favor of any purchaser without notice. While it does so it cannot say that it leaves the Bank free to record or not. The Bank has a choice it is true, but so has one who acts under duress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhY\"><em>Id. </em>at 377-78, 43 S.Ct. 385. The Court concluded that: \u201cIt is said that the lender may collect the money in advance from the borrower. We do not perceive that this makes any difference. The statute says that the lender must pay the tax, but whoever pays it[,] it is a tax upon the mortgage and that is what is forbidden by the law of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378-79, 43 S.Ct. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Relying on <em>Crosland, </em>the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Pittman v. Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp., </em>175 Md. 512, 2 A.2d 689 (1938), <em>aff'd, </em>308 U.S. 21, 60 S.Ct. 15, 84 L.Ed. 11 (1939), held that a Home Owner\u2019s Loan Corporation was entitled to have a mortgage to it recorded without payment of the recordation tax.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed the Court of Appeals explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Petitioner suggests that the <em>Crosland </em>case may be distinguished; that the Alabama tax was imposed on the lender, whereas the Maryland tax is on the privilege of recording the instrument and the statute is silent as to the one who shall pay the tax; also that the Federal Farm Loan Act expressly declared the mortgages of Federal Land Banks to be instrumentalities of the Federal Government. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of Appeals thought these differences to be immaterial. As to the first, the court rightly observed that in the <em>Crosland </em>case the provision for the payment of tax by the lender was regarded as having no determining significance. We said that \u201cwhoever pays it it is a tax upon the mortgage and that is what is forbidden by the law of the United States.\u201d 261 U.S., [at] pp. 378, 379, [43 S.Ct. 385]. Here, also, the tax is imposed upon the mortgage and is graded according to the amount of the loan, and the condition attached to the registration is a practical method of collection. The recording sought was for the protection of the interest of the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation. In fact, the mortgage in the instant case was offered for record by the Corporation and the tax was demanded from the Corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">308 U.S. at 30-31, 60 S.Ct. 15 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Following these cases, however, in <em>Tawes v. Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp., </em>180 Md. 401, 405, 24 A.2d 781 (1942), the Court of Appeals addressed whether the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation was exempt from paying taxes, when, for the corporation\u2019s own protection, it paid the taxes on deeds to its purchasers, as any other prudent real estate dealer or agent would do. The Court held that the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation was not entitled to a refund of certain recordation taxes and taxes on conveyances the corporation paid. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 406, 24 A.2d 781. The Court distinguished this case from <em>Pittman v. Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation, </em>175 Md. 512, 2 A.2d 689, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">In the <em>Pittman Case, supra, </em>this court followed the decision in <em>Federal Land Bank of New Orleans v. Crosland, </em>261 U.S. 374, 43 S.Ct. 385, 20 [29] A.L.R. 1, [67 L.Ed. 703,] which was an appeal from 207 Ala. 456, 93 So. 7 [ (1922) ]. In that case the State of Alabama had a statute imposing a recordation tax of 15 cents on each $100 of the principal sum secured to be paid for by the lender, with a penalty on any probate judge receiving a mortgage for record without collecting the \u201crecording or registration tax,\u201d and it was there held that the Federal Land Bank of New Orleans was exempt from the payment of the tax. Our statute, Code, 1939, Art. 81, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Sec. 220, imposes a tax on deeds and mortgages, but is silent as to the person who should pay it. It says that the clerks shall collect the tax \u201cfor each instrument offered for record and recorded.\u201d The presentation for record is the act of the grantee, and the tax is based on the actual consideration paid or loaned. Section 220 exempts all purchase-money mortgages, which is meaningless as to the appellee\u2019s mortgages since the decision in the <em>Pittman Cases, </em>by which the appellee is exempt anyhow, and since then, no demand has been made for the payment of the tax on any of its mortgages. The practical reason advanced by the appellee for the avoidance of the tax on deeds made by it is that the properties are frequently sold at a loss. It is conceded that if the consideration for the deeds is paid to the appellee in full that the grantee would be obliged to pay the tax before his deed would be received for record, whether the land be sold at a profit or loss. The appellee may see that both deed and mortgage are presented for record, but in theory, at least, it presents the deed for record as the agent of the grantee. When a deed is presented for record it is the grantee\u2019s deed, not the grantor\u2019s. The latter has parted with it, even if it did take it to the court house for record, and there is no provision in the law that the grantor pay the tax. It is proper to assume that the grantor has added the recording fees and taxes to the expense and collected from the grantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><em>Tawes, </em>180 Md. at 405-06, 24 A.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>180 Md. 457, 459, 25 A.2d 466 (1942), the Court of Appeals addressed whether the Housing Authority of Baltimore City was exempt from the State recordation tax. The Court held that the Housing Authority was not exempt because \u201chere the Legislature has not conferred upon these agencies complete immunity from taxation, but has expressly delegated to the municipal officials the power to determine the sum to be paid by the Housing Authority in respect to any project and to agree to accept such sum in lieu of taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 25 A.2d 466. In <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Housing Authority claimed it was exempt because of a Housing Authority law which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">The Act provides that \u201csuch property and an authority shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessments of the city, the State or any political subdivision thereof,\u201d provided that the authority shall pay to the city in lieu of taxes a sum for each housing project not exceeding an amount equal to \u201cthe regular taxes levied upon similar property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">180 Md. at 459, 25 A.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Discussing tax exemptions, the Court of Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">It is a firmly established principle of law that exemptions from taxation are not favored, but are strictly construed in favor of the State.... Therefore, before any claimant can obtain an exemption, it is incumbent upon him to show affirmatively that the alleged exemption has been clearly allowed by law. If there is a real doubt upon the subject, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the State. It is only where the deliberate purpose of the Legislature to grant an exemption is expressed in clear and unequivocal terms that a claim to an exemption can be maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">But the intention of the Legislature as to the terms of the commutation must be entirely clear. No exemption will be held to result from any language of a statute which does not show an unmistakable intention of the Legislature to make the stipulated payment a substitute for the particular taxes for which the exemption is claimed. On the contrary, in case of doubt as to the legislative intention, the presumption is in favor of the taxing power and the burden is on the claimant to establish clearly his right to exemption by bringing himself clearly within the terms of the conditions imposed by the statute. 61 <em>C.J., Taxation, </em>Secs. 388, 392, 395.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 462, 25 A.2d 466 (internal citation omitted). Holding that the Housing Authority of Baltimore City was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>exempt from the recordation tax, the Court of Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">It is stated as a general rule that exemptions from taxation apply primarily to annual property taxes and ordinarily do not apply to excises or taxes which are imposed not in lieu of property taxes, but upon the enjoyment of a privilege. <em>Knoxville &amp; Ohio R.

A tax imposed upon the recording of a deed, even though computable on the amount of the consideration, is not a tax on property, but a privilege tax imposed upon the privilege of recording the deed. Such a tax does not conflict in any way with the levy of <em>ad valorem </em>taxes upon real estate. <em>Middendorf v. Goodale, </em>202 Ky. 118, 259 S.W. 59 [(1923)]; <em>State v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>139 Tenn. 406, 201 S.W. 738, <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1918D, 749 [ (1918) ]. Even constitutional provisions exempting public property from taxation are held to apply only to <em>ad valorem </em>taxes and not to license, franchise, occupation or excise taxes. <em>City of Birmingham v.

For example, in <em>Vournas v. Montgomery Cty., Md., </em>53 Md. App. 243, 244, 452 A.2d 1263 (1982), <em>aff'd, </em>300 Md. 123, 476 A.2d 705 (1984), this Court held that an individual owner of land that was previously assessed as farmland, was required to pay the County farmland transfer tax upon transfer by condemnation of that land to the United States. We explained that the tax imposed on the transfer of real property is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>excise tax, \u201csimilar to a sales tax in that it is imposed upon the occurrence of an event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249-50, 452 A.2d 1263. Although Vournas argued that the transfer tax was not applicable to federal condemnation proceedings and violated the Constitution, this Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">In this case Vournas is furnishing land needed by the United States. The legal incidence of the transfer tax is upon Vournas, not the United States. Even if the economic burden by contract or otherwise, might somehow fall on the United States, the tax is nevertheless valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">The United States Constitution immunizes the United States and its property from taxation by the States, but it does not forbid a tax whose legal incidence is upon a person doing business with the United States, even though the economic burden of the tax, by contract or otherwise, is ultimately borne by the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 452 A.2d 1263 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">(5) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Based on the plain language, the legislative history of the statutes, and the precedent explained above, we hold that MEDCO is not exempt from paying the recordation tax in this case, and affirm the decision of the tax court. Preliminarily, we note that tax exemption statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority and \u201c[t]o doubt an exemption is to deny it.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>110 Md.App. at 689, 678 A.2d 602 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Pittman v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>180 Md. at 460, 462, 25 A.2d 466, no tax exemption will be held to result from any language of a statute which does not show an unmistakable intention of the General Assembly \u201cto make the stipulated payment a substitute for the particular taxes for which the exemption is claimed.\u201d The plain language and legislative history of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 and Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-108(a) fail to demonstrate any intention of the General Assembly to exempt MEDCO from paying a recordation tax where MEDCO records a deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of trust for the benefit of a private lender, such as PNC Bank. In fact, Tax-Prop. \u00a7 12-116 specifically permits the individual counties to enact their own law regarding recordation tax exemptions for transfers from a State agency, and no such law has been enacted by Montgomery County. This certainly demonstrates that there is no \u201cunmistakable intention\u201d to create a tax exemption for transfers of property from, or grants of security interests from, a State agency, such as the transfer involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The language and legislative intent of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 demonstrates an intent to exempt MEDCO from paying taxes on its property or activities. Although borrowing money is clearly an activity of MEDCO, the recording of the deed for the benefit of a private entity, <em>ie. </em>PNC Bank, is not. Nothing in the plain language or legislative history of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 would permit us to extend MEDCO\u2019s tax exemption status to MEDCO\u2019s agreement to pay the recordation tax, in lieu of PNC Bank agreeing to pay the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>Atlantic Golf, </em>377 Md. at 117-18, 832 A.2d 207, a case in which the Court of Appeals discussed the purpose of MEDCO and the applicability of a tax surrender provision of the Maryland Constitution, is not dispositive of the issue in this case. In <em>Atlantic Golf, </em>377 Md. at 117, 832 A.2d 207, the Court of Appeals addressed the applicability of the tax surrender provision provided in the Maryland Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 48 to a public corporation, such as MEDCO.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Court of Appeals held that the plain language and legislative history of the tax exemption surrender provision demonstrates that the \u201cthe tax exemption surrender provision is inapplicable to public corporations such as MEDCO and that, therefore, MEDCO is not required to relinquish its tax exemption as a result of the alterations to its enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 832 A.2d 207. In <em>Atlantic Golf, </em>377 Md. at 118, 832 A.2d 207, \u201cAnne Arundel County circulated a request for proposals to finance, construct, and operate a public golf course in the Pasadena area of the County.\u201d MEDCO responded to the request and Anne Arundel County selected MEDCO to develop the project. <em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 832 A.2d 207. MEDCO was to issue $17 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds, and use the proceeds to construct a golf course, operate the golf course for the County, and eventually turn the project over to the County when the bonds were paid off. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 832 A.2d 207. Prior to the issuance of the bonds, Atlantic Golf, \u201ca limited partnership and private entity that owned a competing golf course in Anne Arundel County,\u201d challenged the issuance of the bonds \u201cas an <em>ultra vires </em>act that was beyond the scope of MEDCO\u2019s enabling act[,]\u201d claiming that the project</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">exceeded MEDCO\u2019s then-existing statutory authorization on the grounds that: (1) the project was not located in an area of the state that was \u201cexperiencing significant economic dislocation or distress,\u201d as required by Maryland Code (1957, 1998 RepLVol.), Article 83A, \u00a7 5-202(c); (2) the private sector had demonstrated significant interest in the bid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and therefore MEDCO should not have bid on the project, pursuant to \u00a7 5-202(b) (mission of corporation includes developing \u201ceconomic resources in which the private sector has not demonstrated serious and significant interest or development capability [that] would serve the public interest\u201d); and (3) the project was structured under the Golf Course System Agreement to remain permanently as public property, rather than to be turned over to the private sector following its completion as required under \u00a7 5-202(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><em>Id. </em>(alteration in original). As a result, \u201cMEDCO cancelled the issuance of the tax-exempt bonds for the golf course project and requested from the General Assembly relief from the restrictions imposed by law, as well as expanded powers that would permit it to complete the project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The General Assembly responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">On April 20, 2001, ... signed these revisions into law as Ch. 338 of the Acts of 2001.

The Legislature granted MEDCO various powers to carry out its statutory objective, including the power to \u201cborrow money and issue bonds for the purpose of financing or refinancing\u201d the cost of its economic development projects, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Article 41, \u00a7 562(12), and an exemption from state taxation \u201cwith the exception of [certain specified] State and local real estate taxes.\u201d Article 41, \u00a7 567. The Legislature further provided in \u00a7 567 that \u201cthe bonds of the Corporation and the interest thereon are forever exempt from all State, municipal, and local taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 832 A.2d 207 (footnote omitted) (alteration in original) (emphasis added). <em>Atlantic Golf </em>is an opinion regarding MEDCO\u2019s ability to issue $17 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds and use the proceeds to construct and operate a golf course for the County, and the comment regarding MEDCO\u2019s tax exempt status under to Article 41, \u00a7 567 is dicta. The Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Atlantic Golf </em>is not dispositive as to the meaning or legislative intent of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In short, nothing in the Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Atlantic Golf </em>supports the proposition that MEDCO is exempt from paying a recordation tax, for the benefit of a private entity, when MEDCO agrees to pay the tax, but the tax is not required to be paid by MEDCO. Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) leads to precisely the opposite <em>conclusion\u2014i.e. </em>when MEDCO is not required to pay the tax but agrees to do so, it may not then claim an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Similarly, we are not persuaded by MEDCO\u2019s contention that it is exempt from paying all taxes or assessments on its properties or activities, or any revenue from its properties or activities except as provided in Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10\u2014129(b) which states that: \u201cProperty that the Corporation sells or leases to a private entity is subject to State and local real property taxes from the time of the sale or lease.\u201d According to MEDCO, subsection (a) of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 exempts it from paying any tax except that described in subsection (b)\u2014 tax on property sold or leased to a private entity. Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a), by its plain language, however, states, that MED-CO is exempt \u201cfrom any requirement to pay taxes or assessments on its properties or activities, or any revenue from its properties or activities.\u201d Thus, MEDCO must be specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>required to pay the tax, prior to claiming a tax exempt status. The interaction of Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129(a) and (b) is, therefore, not relevant in this case. In light of its plain meaning, the language of subsection (a) does not result in MEDCO being exempt from the payment of tax except that described in subsection (b), where MEDCO was not required to pay the tax but nonetheless agreed to pay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>In this case, MEDCO, by agreement, accepted responsibility to pay: \u201c(a) all filing, registration and recording costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>fees and all federal, state, county and municipal stamp taxes and other taxes, duties, imposts, assessment and charges in connection with the recordation or filing of any Loan Documents or related instruments, and any documents in connection with any foreclosure[.]\u201d MEDCO subsequently recorded a deed of trust for the benefit of PNC Bank, and claimed that it was exempt from payment of the recordation tax, pursuant to Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129. Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 provides tax exemption status to MEDCO for any taxes MEDCO is required to pay on its properties or activities. MEDCO agreed to pay the recordation tax, even though it was not required to do so. The recordation tax is an excise tax, imposed upon the privilege of recording the deed of trust in favor of PNC Bank, and is not a tax on MEDCO\u2019s properties or activities or the revenues therefrom. As stated above, a general rule pertaining to exemptions from taxation is that the exemptions apply primarily to annual property taxes and ordinarily do not apply to excises or taxes which are imposed not in lieu of property taxes, but upon the enjoyment of a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Maryland appellate courts have also previously held that a tax exemption does not apply when the legal incidence of the tax fails to fall on the party who has the tax exempt status.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In this case, the legal incidence of the recordation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tax does not fall on MEDCO. Rather, the purpose of recording the deed of trust was for the benefit of PNC bank, the entity identified as the beneficiary in the Leasehold Deed of Trust, Assignment and Security Agreement. As this Court explained in <em>Voumas, </em>53 Md.App. at 251, 452 A.2d 1263, \u201c[t]he United States Constitution immunizes the United States and its property from taxation by the States, but it does not forbid a tax whose legal incidence is upon a person doing business with the United States, even though the economic burden of the tax, by contract or otherwise, is ultimately borne by the United States.\u201d (Emphasis added) (citation omitted). We see no reason to depart from this rationale-the legal incidence of the recordation tax was borne by PNC bank, an entity provided no tax exempt status under Maryland law. MEDCO contractually agreed to be responsible for the recordation tax, and that contractual commitment to pay the tax did not create a \u201crequirement\u201d under Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129 to pay taxes from which MEDCO is exempt. MEDCO, by agreeing to pay the recordation tax and then claiming tax exempt status, in effect, attempted to convey its tax exempt status to PNC Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED AND VACATED WITH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE MARYLAND TAX COURT.

It is a conveyance made to a person other than the creditor, conditioned to be void if the debt be paid at a certain time, but if not paid that the grantee may sell the land and apply the proceeds to the extinguishment of the debt, paying over the surplus to the grantor. It is in legal effect a mortgage with a power of sale, but the addition of the power of sale does not change the character of the instrument any more than it does when contained in a mortgage. Such a deed has all the essential elements of a mortgage; it is a conveyance of land as security for a debt. It passes the legal title just as a mortgage does, except in those states where the natural effect of a conveyance is controlled by statute; and in states where a mortgage is considered merely as a security, and not a conveyance, a trust deed is apt to be regarded in this respect just like a mortgage. Both instruments convey a defeasible title only; the mortgagee\u2019s or trustee\u2019s title in fee being in the nature of a base or determinable fee; and the right to redeem is the same in one case as it is in the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">(Citations and emphasis omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">.

We are aware of two letters written in 1991, and 2002, by the same Assistant Attorney General stating that a mortgage given by MEDCO to secure bonds, or an indebtedness it has incurred, is not subject to recordation tax. In a letter dated February 6, 1991, the Assistant Attorney General wrote to the Principal Counsel for the Maryland Stadium Authority regarding a \"Deed of Trust given by MEDCO to Trustee for Bondholders Recordation Tax.\u201d This letter provided that a deed of trust given by MEDCO to a bank, as trustee for certain bondholders, would be exempt from the State recordation tax upon being recorded. In the letter, the Assistant Attorney General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANM\">You have requested advice concerning whether a deed of trust given by [MEDCO] to a bank, as trustee for certain bondholders, would be subject to State recordation tax upon being recorded. Please be advised that, for the following reasons, I have concluded that the deed of trust is exempt from recordation tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">There is no applicable exemption in the statutes expressly governing State recordation tax, namely Tax-Property Article, Title 12. Section 12-108(a) of that Article only exempts from recordation tax an instrument transferring property or granting a security interest <em>to, </em>inter alia, a State agency. That exemption does not apply to an instrument given by a State agency to a private party or parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">However, Article 83A, \u00a7 5-110 exempts MEDCO from paying \"any taxes or assessments upon its properties or activities or upon any revenues therefrom\u201d, other than real property taxes on property sold or leased by the Corporation to a private entity or entities. One of the authorized activities of the Corporation is the use of a deed of trust granted to a bank or trust company, as trustee, for the purpose of securing bonds issued by the Corporation. Article 83A, \u00a7 5-106(k). Thus, the recording of the deed of trust referenced in your letter is an activity of the Corporation that is exempt from taxation under Article 83A, \u00a7 5-110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In a letter dated February 6, 2002, written to Hans F. Meyers, the Executive Director of MEDCO, the Assistant Attorney General stated that a mortgage given by MEDCO to secure bonds that MEDCO issues, or an indebtedness it incurs, is not subject to recordation tax. The Assistant Attorney General reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">As you note in your second letter, Article 83A, \u00a7 5-210 exempts from taxes, other than real property taxes, MEDCO and its properties and activities and revenue. Thus, while [Tax-Prop.] \u00a7 12-108(a)(l) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>does not exempt from recordation tax the grant of a security interest by a government unit to a private party, MEDCO is exempt from paying such tax on a mortgage given by it to a third party to the extent that such tax is payable by the mortgagor. In 75 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>451 (1990), this office advised that a mortgage or deed of trust granting a security interest to a federal credit union is not covered by the tax exemption afforded such credit unions under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1768 because the statutory presumption of a 50/50 split of State and local recording taxes under Real Property Article, \u00a7 14\u2014 104 does not apply to mortgages and deeds of trust; traditionally, the tax imposed upon the recording of such instruments is paid by the mortgagor/grantor, not the secured party/lender. Thus, if MEDCO is the mortgagor, MEDCO\u2019s exemption from paying taxes other than real property taxes would apply to the recordation tax, which is an excise tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">(Emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">We are not bound by the formal opinions of the Attorney General and would afford even less weight to an informal letter written by a single Assistant Attorney General. <em>Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 57, n. 18, 882 A.2d 849 (2005) (\u201cAlthough we quote here from the advice letter of the Assistant Attorney General, we afford no enhanced weight to its conclusions and analysis. We have remarked in several instances that, although we may give some consideration to formal opinions of the Attorney General, we are not bound by them.\u201d). In the 1991 letter, the Assistant Attorney General concluded that the recordation of a deed of trust is an activity of MEDCO and, therefore, a deed of trust given by MEDCO to a bank, as trustee for certain bondholders, would not be subject to State recordation tax upon being recorded. Subsequently, in the 2002 letter, however, consistent with the statutory construction and relevant case law discussed above, the Assistant Attorney General in effect concluded that MEDCO is exempt only when it is required to pay the tax. The Assistant Attorney General stated in the 2002 letter that, \"traditionally, the tax imposed upon the recording of such instruments is paid by the mortgagor ... [tjhus, if MEDCO is the mortgagor, <em>[i.e. </em>the tax is imposed on MEDCO], MED-CO\u2019s exemption from paying taxes other than real property taxes would apply to the recordation tax[J\u201d (Emphasis added). There is a stark distinction between the blanket exemption the Assistant Attorney General advocates in the 1991 letter, and the exemption based on the mortgagor's tradition of paying the recordation tax outlined in the 2002 letter. Implicit in the Assistant Attorney General\u2019s reasoning in the 2002 letter is the conclusion that if MEDCO is the mortgagee and agrees to pay the recordation tax, it would not be exempt from paying the recordation tax. In the 2002 letter, the Assistant Attorney General does not opine that Article 83A, \u00a7 5-210, now Econ. Dev. \u00a7 10-129, provides a blanket exemption to MEDCO from payment of recordation t\u00e1x.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b347-5\">.
