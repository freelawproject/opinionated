Joanne was survived by: one son, Steven William Click;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one grandson, Bret William Click (Steven\u2019s son), a minor;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> three granddaughters, Elizabeth Smith,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rebecca Maberry, and Teresa Talley<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Frank\u2019s daughters); and one sibling, Warren Walls. Dated October 25, 1999, Joanne\u2019s Last Will and Testament (the \u201cWill\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">I, JOANNE CLICK, a resident of EDGEWATER, MARYLAND, declare that this is my Last Will and Testament. FIRST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">I hereby revoke all previous Wills and Codicils that I have made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">THIRD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">I am not married and have no spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">I give all my jewelry, clothing, household furniture and furnishings, personal automobiles and other tangible articles of a personal nature, or my interest in any such property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>not otherwise disposed of by this Will or in any other manner together with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">(a) any insurance on the property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">(b) any personal life insurance proceeds,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">(c) any registered retirement savings plans, registered retirement income funds, pension plans and annuities,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">(d) any income tax deferred assets,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">to my one and only child: STEVEN WILLIAM CLICK.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">All references in this Will to \u201cmy child\u201d or \u201cmy children\u201d include any and all children hereinafter born to or adopted by me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">FIFTH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">To BRET WILLIAM CLICK my GRANDSON, I LEAVE THE SUM OF $1000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">To ELIZABETH TENNANT my GRAND[D]AUGHTER, I LEAVE THE SUM OF $1000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">To REBECCA MABERRY my GRAND[D]AUGHTER, I LEAVE THE SUM OF $1000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-15\">To THERESA ARNAUD my GRAND[D]AUGHTER, I LEAVE THE SUM OF $1000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-16\">To WARREN WALLS my BROTHER, I LEAVE THE SUM OF $5000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-17\">No other special gifts are left, any assets not directly disposed of in this Will shall be given to the surviving members in order of succession.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>On December 10, 2009, approximately two and one-half months after Joanne\u2019s death, Steven, died. Steven\u2019s son, Bret, a minor, was Steven\u2019s heir under his Last Will and Testament. On February 19, 2010, Walls, Joanne\u2019s personal representative, filed a Petition for Instructions in the Orphan\u2019s Court for Anne Arundel County. In the Petition, Walls requested that the Court \u201cgive instructions as to the meaning of the Last Will and Testament of Joanne Click dated October 25, 1999 in general\u201d and to the following clause of the fifth paragraph: \u201cNo other special gifts are left, any assets not directly disposed of in this Will shall be given to the surviving members in order of succession.\u201d In addition to requesting that the Court instruct as to the meaning of the fifth paragraph, Walls requested that the court issue instructions as to the distribution of Joanne\u2019s real property, asking, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">10. The Will was prepared by [Joanne] with the use of a computer program that provided a form last will and testament. The said Will does not contain a residuary clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">11. [Joanne] died testate owning real property located at 1745 Tacoma Road, Edgewater, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">12. STEVEN WILLIAM CLICK resided in the aforesaid real property with his mother, Joanne Click, for several years prior to her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">WHEREFORE, your Petitioner prays:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>A. That this Court issue instructions as to the distribution of the real property of [Joanne.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">On March 12, 2010, Walls filed an Amended Petition for Instructions and for Declaratory Judgment in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The amended petition added the following defendants: the Estate of Steven Click, Amy Hardesty as parent and next friend of Bret, and Smith, Maberry, and Talley. The amended petition adopted and incorporated the original petition, and added a count for declaratory judgment, in which Walls alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">4. That the language contained in the Last Will and Testament of Joanne Click may be subject to more than one interpretation regarding the distribution of the testatrix\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">5. That the Defendants are Interested Persons of The Estate of Joanne Click.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">6. That the Defendant, The Estate of Steven Click, has taken a position as to how the testatrix\u2019s property must be distributed pursuant to The Last Will and Testament of Joanne Click, while Defendants, Elizabeth A. Click Smith, Rebecca J. Click Maberry and Teresa Arnauld Talley, have made known a second conflicting position regarding the distribution of the same property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">On April 21, 2010, the Estate of Steven Click filed an answer. On April 30, 2010, Bret filed an answer. In their answers, as to the third paragraph of the Will, the Estate of Steven Click and Bret stated: \u201cThe Will of Joanne Click instructs that property not otherwise disposed of in the Will shall be distributed to Steven Click. The \u2018property not otherwise disposed of includes Joanne Click\u2019s real property. As such, the real property subject to the above[-]captioned action should be distributed to [] Steven Click.\u201d As to the fifth paragraph of the Will, they stated: \u201cJoanne Click had two children, Frank Click, Jr. and Steven Click. Frank Click, Jr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>predeceased his mother, Joanne Click. The only \u2018surviving member[ ] in order of succession\u2019 is Steven Click. Assuming another party to this action contends that Joanne Click\u2019s real property is \u2018not disposed of in the Will,\u2019 this Court should instruct that the real property be distributed to Steven Click.\u201d Both requested that the circuit court order distribution of Joanne\u2019s real property to Steven.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">On June 17, 2010, Smith, Maberry, and Talley filed an answer to the amended petition, arguing that \u201cthe intent of the Will ... is to distribute the rest and residue of this estate equally among the legatees identified therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On September 15, 2010, appellants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Request for Hearing. In the motion, appellants requested that the third paragraph of the Will be read as instructing distribution of Joanne\u2019s real property to Steven and that the fifth paragraph be read as instructing that \u201cJoanne Click\u2019s residuary estate shall be distributed to Joanne Click\u2019s surviving members in order of succession which is declared to mean Joanne Click\u2019s only surviving child at the time of her passing, Steven Click.\u201d In the memorandum in support of the motion, appellants argued that Joanne intended to leave her real property to Steven because Joanne \u201cwas appreciative of the efforts that ... Steven [ ] put toward Joanne Click and her needs[,]\u201d whereas Joanne\u2019s relationships with Smith, Maberry, and Talley were \u201cstrained\u201d and \u201ccaused her great discontent.\u201d Appellants argued that Joanne\u2019s intent was expressed within the Will and, alternatively, by the surrounding circumstances at the time the Will was made. Appellants attached affidavits from various of Joanne\u2019s friends, in which each affiant attested that Joanne intended to leave her house to Steven, and most attested that Joanne\u2019s relationships with Smith, Maberry, and Talley were strained and damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">On October 4, 2010, Smith, Maberry, and Talley filed an answer to appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and filed their own motion for summary judgment. In the answer and motion, Smith, Maberry, and Talley argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>3. This cases presents a strict legal question\u2014to determine the meaning of the will from its four corners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">4. There is no ambiguity in the will, and Defendants Elizabeth Smith, Teresa Talley and Rebecca Maberry are entitled to a declaration of the construction of the will as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">WHEREFORE, Defendants Smith, Talley and Maberry pray this Honorable Court will declare that the meaning of the Will which is the subject of this litigation is to distribute the rest and residue of this estate equally among the legatees identified therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">On October 22, 2010, appellants filed a reply to Smith, Maberry, and Talley\u2019s answer and an opposition to Smith, Maberry, and Talley\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellants argued that Maryland law \u201cdictates that Joanne Click\u2019s will must be construed to reflect her intent.\u201d Appellants contended that the construction of the Will urged by Smith, Maberry, and Talley ignored Joanne\u2019s \u201cintent as expressed in the four corners of the Will and even further ignore[d] the surrounding circumstances that existed at the time that Joanne Click executed her Will.\u201d On October 29, 2010, appellants filed a supplement to their motion for summary judgment. The supplement incorporated the 1988 Will. Appellants argued that \u201c[considering the \u2018surrounding circumstances,\u2019 the two Wills taken together indicate that Joanne Click intended that her granddaughters, Smith, Talley and Maberry, were only ever to receive a specific bequest, that is, $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">On November 29, 2010, the circuit court held a motions hearing. During the hearing, the following exchange occurred between the circuit court and appellants\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">THE COURT: But ... if the words that the testator used were, you know, crystal clear and sufficient at the same time the\u2014or at some subsequent time the testator said something else extrinsic, would we not be bound to basically apply the words if they\u2019re not ambiguous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: If they\u2019re not ambiguous. In this case, [Walls] has filed the petition asking the Court to construe the will suggesting that the will can be\u2014is either ambiguous or can be interpreted in more than one way. So we are stuck in the category of the words in the will being ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">THE COURT: Surviving, members, succession, those are all legal terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">[APPELLANTS\u2019COUNSEL]: Legal terms. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">THE COURT: So why\u2014why would I need extrinsic evidence in order to interpret the meaning of those legal terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: If the Court determines that there\u2019s no ambiguity in the will at all, then we\u2019re not turning to extrinsic evidence. However, in this situation we have a petitioner [Walls] that has indicated that the will can be interpreted in more than one way, meaning we have a will that is ambiguous. So we have to figure out what the testator intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In contrast, counsel for Smith, Maberry, and Talley argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Let me start by saying that just because the Petitioner [Walls] alleged ambiguity does not mean that one exists. Paragraph 3 is not the least little bit ambiguous.... As far as paragraph 5, again, not ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">At the end of the hearing, the circuit court advised counsel, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">I am going to provide a written decision, but I\u2019ll orally advise counsel that I don\u2019t think that the word \u201csuch\u201d\u2014the phrase \u201csuch property\u201d is ambiguous in the earlier paragraph, I guess, Paragraph 3 of the '99 will. I think it\u2014it clearly modifies or refers to the prior recitation of personal property and that means, to me, then, that the only remaining question of interpretation of the will is what does \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d mean. And that is very much a legal phrase. It\u2019s not a\u2014a phrase of plain English usage in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>And, therefore, the Court thinks that its interpretation is very much a matter of law and not a matter of gathering the lay person\u2019s intention from ambiguous phrases in the\u2014in the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">So the Court will, based on the summary judgment, provide the declaratory relief as to the legal meaning of the term \u201csurviving members in order of succession,\u201d and I\u2019ll provide that opinion within a week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On November 30, 2010, the circuit court issued an Order granting appellants\u2019 summary judgment in part and declaratory judgment, with instructions as to Joanne\u2019s real property. The Order stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">ORDERED, that the Motion for Summary Judgment be and is hereby GRANTED in part; and the interested persons\u2019 motion is granted in full as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">ORDERED AND DECREED, that the Last Will and Testament of Joanne Click is hereby declared to be read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">A. Paragraph THIRD instructs that Joanne Click\u2019s specified personal property is to be distributed to Joanne Click\u2019s son, Steven Click.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">B. Paragraph FIFTH instructs that Bret Click, Elizabeth Tennant, Rebecca Maberry and Theresa Arnaud are to receive a specific bequest of $1,000.00 each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">C. Paragraph FIFTH instructs that Warren Walls is to receive a specific bequest of $5,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">D. Paragraph FIFTH includes a residuary clause by stating \u201cany assets not directly disposed of in this Will\u201d. Paragraph FIFTH instructs that Joanne Click\u2019s residuary estate including real property shall be distributed to Joanne Click\u2019s surviving members in order of succession which is hereby declared to mean her surviving issue per stirpes[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">On November 30, 2010, the circuit court issued a written Opinion as to the motions for summary judgment. The Opinion stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Steven Click had resided with his mother for a number of years prior to her death and, in a prior will, had been bequeathed the sole ownership of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In his motion for summary judgment, Steven Click contends that his mother\u2019s 1999 will was ambiguous and, based on circumstantial evidence, that the ambiguity should be resolved with the inference that she intended again to bequeath him sole ownership of the real estate. The other interested parties disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Steven Click\u2019s estate initially contends, as to the THIRD paragraph of the Will, that \u201csuch property\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed to have the word \u201csuch\u201d refer to real estate, rather than personal property. Alternately, they contend that the word \u201csuch\u201d might be construed to mean \u201call,\u201d so as to distribute the entire residuary estate in the third paragraph to Steven Click.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The undersigned finds that this ambiguity argument is mistaken. No citation of legal authority is required for this court to find that \u201csuch property\u201d grammatically refers to the property previously mentioned in the same paragraph\u2014 that is, personal only.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Moreover, in oral argument, Steven Click\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the last sentence in the FIFTH paragraph may be understood to constitute the residuary clause, disposing of real estate. Likewise, the EIGHTH paragraph acknowledges the existence of the residuary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The second ambiguity urged by Steven Click\u2019s estate states the term \u201cany assets not directly disposed of in this Will shall be given to the <em>surviving members in order of succession.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Steven Click\u2019s argument for the ambiguity of the emphasized phrase is based completely on evidence extrinsic to the Will. However, counsel has acknowledged in oral argument that such extrinsic evidence would not be admissible if the Will\u2019s terms are not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>This court finds that the term \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d is not ambiguous, even though it may not be common English currently in plain usage. Steven Click\u2019s estate contends that the term \u201csurviving members\u201d should be construed to mean that the entire estate would go to Steven Click because he was the descendant\u2019s \u201cone and only child.\u201d This, however, disregards the long-standing Maryland rule as to construction of wills and other documents that the court\u2014must give full effect to all \u201ctechnical words [in the document] unless from subsequent inconsistent words it is made perfectly clear that the testator meant otherwise.\u201d <em>Clarke v. Smith, </em>49 Md. 106, at 117 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Examining the will as a whole, this court finds that the testator\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csurviving members\u201d\u2014in the plural\u2014does not refer to a singular family member\u2014that is, Steven Click. Maryland cases make clear that a will\u2019s reference to a group of family \u201cmembers\u201d should be construed as <em>per stirpes, </em>rather than <em>per capita </em>unless a contrary intention is expressed. Similarly, Maryland cases have found that the use of the term \u201cin succession\u201d implies inheritance <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>Here, where the testator used both terms together, this court finds that it is unmistakable that she intended per stirpes distribution to her children or their survivors per stirpes. See <em>Clarke v. Clarke, </em>222 Md. 158, at 157-158 [159 A.2d 362] (1960) which held, after an extensive review of precedents back to the English common law, that Maryland should follow the \u201cRestatement, Property, Future Interests, Sec. 303\u201d, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ax-dedup-0\">\u201cWhen a conveyance creates a class gift by a limitation in favor of a group described as the \u2018issue of B,\u2019 or as the \u2018descendants of B,\u2019 * * * then, unless a contrary intent * * * is found * * * distribution is made to such members of the class as would take, and in such shares as they would receive, under the applicable law of intestate succession if B had died intestate.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Similarly, Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals in <em>Weller v. Sokol, </em>271 Md. 420, at 427 [318 A.2d 193] (1974) held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHQ\">\u201cin the absence of an expression of contrary intent, the direction that a distribution be made <em>per stirpes </em>will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>result in the distribution which would have been made under the statute of distribution, was amplified in <em>Sollers v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>[262 Md. 606, 278 A.2d 581 (1971) ] at 610-11, to the end that descendants will take in the manner provided by the statute of descent and distribution in effect at the death of the testator, just as if the person identified as the stock had died intestate at the time of distribution.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">The <em>Sokol </em>court also found that a testator\u2019s use of the term \u201csuccession\u201d with \u201cdivided ... among the issue and descendants of such of my children as may have died leaving lawful issue him or her surviving per stirpes ... just as if a child had died intestate on the date of termination owning a share of the corpus and leaving descendants surviving.\u201d <em>Sokol </em>at 432 [318 A.2d 193],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">For all of these reasons, the court will grant Steven Click\u2019s motion for summary judgment in part\u2014that is, it will provide the declaratory relief construing the will. But the court will also deny it in part\u2014that is, the court does not adopt the construction urged by Steven Click\u2019s estate. The court will grant the interested persons\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">(Footnote omitted) (alterations, emphasis, and omissions in original).

Paragraph Second of the testator\u2019s will provided: \u201cI bequeath all my personal property to my surviving children to be divided equally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 522 A.2d 377.

The Court, therefore, concluded that \u201cthe language used in Paragraph Second of the will is unambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then examined whether Paragraph Second contained a latent ambiguity. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 522 A.2d 377. The Court discussed the case of <em>Wm. D. Shellady, Inc. v. Herlihy, Ex\u2019r, </em>236 Md. 461, 204 A.2d 504 (1964), where the testator bequeathed shares of Class \u201cB\u201d stock, even though it was discovered that he owned no shares of Class \u201cB\u201d stock, but rather owned shares of Class \u201cA\u201d stock. <em>Emmert, </em>309 Md. at 27, 522 A.2d 377.

In <em>Emmert, </em>309 Md. at 27-28, 522 A.2d 377, however, upon review of the testator\u2019s will and Paragraph Second, the Court held that \u201c[t]here [was] no indication that the property bequeathed ... applies equally to two or more persons or things[,]\u201d and \u201c[e]xtrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent should therefore have been excluded.\u201d As the language of the will was clear and no latent ambiguity existed, the Court held that the phrase \u201call my personal property\u201d included both tangible and intangible personal property. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 522 A.2d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In <em>Darden v.

The Court determined that the language in the will was \u201cplain and precise,\u201d and that the testator, \u201cby express terms[ ] unquestionably eliminated one group of the[ ] remaining nephews and nieces, and equally irrefutably [the] will establishes that his meaning was to give a legacy to every one of one group to the exclusion of all who constituted the other group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 571, 198 A. 431.

As such, the testator\u2019s words indicated that he meant to provide for the children of his living brother, and not the children of his deceased brother. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court held that extrinsic evidence was inadmissible, as \u201c[s]uch declarations are only receivable to assist in interpreting an equivocation which results from the use of a term in the will which, upon application to external objects or subjects, is found to describe two or more external objects or subjects equally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 198 A. 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In <em>Shipley v.

The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">But it must be remembered that in no event can extrinsic evidence be resorted to in construing a will, except where upon reading the words questioned in connection with the entire will, or upon applying them to the facts in the case, there arises in the opinion of the Court, an ambiguity or difficulty of construction, and we cannot perceive that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>such exists here. The words \u201cdower and thirds,\u201d in themselves have each a uniform, established meaning both in law and in common usage .... it is laid down \u201cthat a testator who uses words which have an intelligible, conventional meaning is not to be held as having used the words with any other meaning, unless the context of the instrument shows that he intended to do so.\u201d ...

As such, the circuit court improperly refused to consider the extrinsic evidence of surrounding circumstances offered by appellants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">As to the third paragraph of the Will, the question is whether the phrase \u201cmy interest in any such property not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>otherwise disposed of by this Will\u201d contains a latent ambiguity. We conclude that it does as the phrase, while seemingly \u201cplain and single\u201d on its face, could \u201capply equally to two or more subjects or objects.\u201d <em>Emmert, </em>309 Md. at 26-27, 522 A.2d 377 (citation omitted). The phrase may refer only to \u201ctangible articles of a personal nature\u201d or include all property, real and personal. The issue is whether \u201csuch\u201d relates backward to the preceding clause concerning personal property or forward to the language \u201cproperty not otherwise disposed of by this Will.\u201d It is not possible to conclusively discern the meaning of the phrase by the plain language of the third paragraph or Joanne\u2019s intent as to its meaning from the four corners of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">One interpretation is that the phrase \u201cany such property\u201d refers to personal property. According to the clause preceding the language in question, any tangible articles of a personal nature are to be given to Joanne\u2019s son, Steven. This gives rise to the interpretation that the clause in question, \u201cmy interest in any such property not otherwise disposed of by this Will,\u201d includes personal property in which Joanne may have had an interest, other than property of a personal nature that is described previously. Another, or second, interpretation is that the phrase \u201cany such property\u201d refers to the language contained in the clause with it, and includes any property\u2014 personal and real property\u2014not disposed of by the Will. Under this interpretation, Joanne\u2019s interest in any such property, real and personal, not otherwise disposed of in the Will, shall be given to Steven. The latent ambiguity consists of whether the \u201csuch property\u201d is personal property in which Joanne may have an interest that is not disposed of by the Will, or her interest in \u201csuch property\u201d being any property, real or personal, not disposed of by the Will. Use of the modifier, \u201cany such property,\u201d does not render the phrase unambiguous.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Emmert, </em>309 Md. 19, 522 A.2d 377, and <em>LeRoy, </em>262 Md. 276, 277 A2d 611, are distinguishable. In both of those cases, the Court of Appeals determined whether the use of the words \u201cpersonal property\u201d in a will covered both tangible and intangible personal property or just tangible personal property. <em>Emmert, </em>309 Md. at 20-21, 522 A.2d 377; <em>LeRoy, </em>262 Md. at 281, 277 A.2d 611. In this ease, the question is whether the language \u201cany such property\u201d could reasonably have been intended to include real property in addition to personal property. This opinion does not encroach on the holdings in <em>Emmert </em>and <em>LeRoy, </em>which set forth the definition of the term \u201cpersonal property\u201d in the context of a will. Rather, in this case, we are confronted with ambiguity in the use of the phrase \u201cany such property,\u201d in the context of a will, drafted by the testator, a non-lawyer, that contained specific dispositive provisions as to tangible personal property but did not mention her primary asset, i.e., her residence. Unlike <em>Emmert </em>and <em>LeRoy, </em>we are not tasked with determining the inclusiveness of a bequest of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d or the meaning of \u201cpersonal property,\u201d but rather whether the testator appreciated the legal distinction between real and personal property. As such, given the use of the language in the context of the Will as a whole, we conclude that a latent ambiguity exists and that the circuit court erred in finding that the phrase \u201cany such property\u201d was unambiguous and \u201cgrammatically refers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the property previously mentioned in the same paragraph\u2014 that is, personal only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">As to the fifth paragraph of the Will, the question is whether the phrase \u201csurviving members[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] in order of succession\u201d contains a latent ambiguity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude it does. It is unclear from a reading of the Will itself what the fifth paragraph means or what Joanne intended it to mean. The phrase is susceptible to multiple meanings, including that distribution be made to: (1) Joanne\u2019s surviving son, Steven, and his son, Bret, in that order; (2) to all of Joanne\u2019s surviving family members per stirpes; (3) to the members or people specifically listed in the fifth paragraph; (4) to Joanne\u2019s family by way of royal succession;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or (5) to some other group that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Joanne had in mind when using the phrase. Perhaps Joanne understood and meant \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d to apply only to her surviving son, Steven, and then on to his son, Bret, and like the testator in <em>Darden, </em>173 Md. at 572, 198 A. 431, meant to provide for the children of the living brother rather than for the children of both the living brother and deceased brother. Equally plausible is the interpretation that Joanne meant the assets to be \u201c[proportionately divided between beneficiaries according to their deceased ancestor\u2019s share.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1181 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In finding that the phrase \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d unambiguously meant per stirpes distribution, the circuit court incorrectly relied on the Court of Appeals\u2019s holdings in <em>Clarke, </em>222 Md. 153, 159 A.2d 362, and <em>Weller, </em>271 Md. 420, 318 A.2d 193. Relying on <em>Clarke, </em>222 Md. 153, 159 A.2d 362, the circuit court stated: \u201cSimilarly, Maryland cases have found that the use of the term \u2018in succession\u2019 implies inheritance <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita.\u201d </em>The circuit court stated that the Court of Appeals in <em>Weller, </em>271 Md. 420, 318 A.2d 193, found it important that the testator used the term \u201csuccession\u201d within his will. In <em>Clarke, </em>222 Md. at 155, 159 A.2d 362, the question involved the meaning of the term \u201cissue\u201d as used by the testator in his Will when he stated \u201c \u2018from and after the death of my said son * * * then to his issue, absolutely.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Weller, </em>271 Md. at 432, 318 A.2d 193, the question likewise concerned the meaning of term \u201cissue\u201d as used in the phrase \u201c \u2018divided ... among the issue and descendants of such of my children as may have died leaving lawful issue him or her surviving <em>per stirpes </em>[.]\u2019 \u201d Neither case is dispositive as the Court of Appeals\u2019s analysis in <em>Clarke </em>and <em>Weller </em>concerned the use of the legal term \u201cissue,\u201d rather than the use of the phrase \u201csurviving members in order of succession.\u201d Of note, in <em>Weller, </em>271 Md. at 432, 318 A.2d 193, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>testator used the words \u201cper stirpes,\u201d in addition to the term \u201cissue,\u201d in his will to direct distribution to a specific group.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Smith, Maberry, and Talley have not identified any case law\u2014and this Court has not found any authority\u2014in which a Maryland appellate court has interpreted the meaning of the phrase \u201csurviving members in order of succession.\u201d To conclude that the phrase obviously or unambiguously means per stirpes distribution or that the phrase is somehow implicitly analogous to the word \u201cissue\u201d is unfounded, given the readily apparent ambiguity of the phrase-and as stated above, Maryland appellate courts have not reached such a conclusion. Unlike the phrase \u201cdower and thirds,\u201d \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d does not contain words that \u201cin themselves have each a uniform, established meaning both in law and in common usage[,]\u201d such that \u201cthere can be no doubt that [the testator] used the words ... in their ordinary technical sense.\u201d <em>Shipley, </em>102 Md. at 659-60, 62 A. 814. Indeed, in the written opinion dated November 80, 2010, the circuit court observed that the phrase \u201cmay not be common English currently in plain usage.\u201d We conclude that the phrase \u201csurviving members in order of succession\u201d is ambiguous on its face and that it is not possible to determine from the use of this phrase that Joanne intended per stirpes distribution of her property, which may or may not have included distribution of her real property depending on the interpretation of the third paragraph of the Will. For all of the reasons stated above, the circuit court erred in finding the third and fifth paragraphs of the Will unambiguous and excluding extrinsic evidence as to Joanne\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
