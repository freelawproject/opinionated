Code Ann., Crim. Law Art. (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 3-307(a)(4) (third-degree sexual offense); and C.L. \u00a7 3-324 (sexual solicitation of a minor). On February 8, 2011, the circuit court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>appellant to ten years of imprisonment, with all but one year suspended, and five years of supervised probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Appellant noted an appeal, raising two issues, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">I. Did the trial court err in allowing the State to prove' the appellant\u2019s age, which was a material element of the case, through a detective\u2019s inadmissible hearsay testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">II. Did the trial court err by permitting the State to prove the contents of the appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license through parol testimony instead of through the original copy of the driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">We answer both questions in the negative. We, therefore, affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The acts for which appellant was convicted occurred on January 10, 2010, at a Pacific Sunwear Store where appellant worked. The day before the incident at issue in this case, Detective Klezia and another detective of the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office went to the store to speak with appellant about allegations not connected to this case. During the interview, Detective Klezia asked appellant for identification and appellant responded by giving Detective Klezia his Florida driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">On January 10, 2010, Amanda M. visited the Pacific Sun-wear Store, shopping with her friend Courtney S. Amanda M. and appellant became engaged in a conversation as she shopped. At the time, Amanda M. was fourteen-years-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Amanda M. testified that during her conversation with appellant on January 10, 2010, he told her he was seventeen years old. In an interview on March 31, 2010, Amanda M. advised detectives that appellant told her he was twenty years old. Amanda M. testified that on January 10, 2010, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>purchased perfume from the store but, after leaving the store, discovered the perfume was not in her shopping bag. Amanda M. returned to the store to retrieve the perfume later the same day. Amanda M. testified that she did not see appellant on the second trip, and that she and Courtney S. returned later to the store a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As she was in the store on the third occasion, Amanda M. was trying on pants in a fitting room and asked appellant to bring her a pair in a different size. According to Amanda M., when appellant returned to the fitting room with new pants, he asked to see and touch her breasts and \u201clower areas.\u201d According to Amanda M., appellant then put his hand in her pants and began to \u201cfinger\u201d her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Amanda M. testified that while appellant was \u201cfingering\u201d her, he asked that she give him oral sex. Amanda M. declined, but testified, that she kissed appellant\u2019s penis. Appellant\u2019s counsel contended after trial and before this Court, that prior to trial, the prosecutor had not divulged information concerning Amanda M. allegedly having performed this act.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On January 14, 2010, appellant, accompanied by his fiancee, his fiancee\u2019s mother, and his daughter, was interviewed by Detective Klezia at the Charles County Sheriffs Office. Detective Klezia had telephoned to arrange the interview and appellant volunteered to drive to the station. During the interview, Detective Klezia asked appellant about the same incident that was discussed during his January 9, 2010, visit to the store-an incident unrelated to this case. During the interview, Detective Klezia asked for identification, and appellant again provided the Florida driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">At trial, during direct examination, the prosecutor asked Detective Klezia whether he knew appellant\u2019s age. Detective Klezia responded that he had knowledge of appellant\u2019s date of birth based on having viewed his \u201cidentification.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel objected when the prosecutor asked Detective Klezia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>how old appellant was, and the objection was sustained. The prosecutor again asked the detective for appellant\u2019s age, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And the information that you obtained from [appellant] how old was [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">THE COURT: Detective is\u2014am I correct to assume you never asked him his\u2014his\u2014his birth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[DETECTIVE KLEZIA]\u2014I don\u2019t recall specifically asking him for a date of birth but.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">THE COURT: All Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">And the only information you have is\u2014is what he showed you; some document he showed you, a Driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq\">[DETECTIVE KLEZIA]: Yes. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, may Counsel approach? THE COURT: All right. Counsel please approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">(Counsel approaches the bench)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, the information was provided to him by [appellant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, but if we recall from the Motion Hearing he also had to show that information even to\u2014to abide by the orders of the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">That if you recall the Motion Hearing he had to present an I.D. to get into the headquarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">THE COURT: Well, the basis of the objection is what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac9-dedup-0\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Its hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5-L\">[PROSECUTOR]: And my response is that this would be admission by party (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-17\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It\u2019s not an admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahs\">[PROSECUTOR]: It would be an adoptive admission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: He never\u2014he never\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUX\">[PROSECUTOR]: He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s providing the identification on two separate occasions showing his personal identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: He never was asked to confirm it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">At this point, Detective Klezia and the jury were excused, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... Pm looking at [Maryland Rule] 5-803 and it looks like A(2). That\u2019s a statement by a party opponent\u2014opponent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: \u201cA statement of which the party has manifested an adoption on belief and its truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Detective Klezia asked him for identification. [Appellant] provides this identification on two separate occasions.... The fact that you\u2019re providing it means you\u2019re manifesting a belief that this is a true document. The information is here\u2014in here, is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It\u2019s not a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akm\">[PROSECUTOR]: If it\u2019s not a statement then its not hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">But this is something he\u2019s manifesting a belief in. He\u2019s asking for identification from [appellant]. [Appellant] provides this information to the Detective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">THE COURT: [Appellant\u2019s counsel]\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: There\u2019s better evidence of this. There\u2019s (unintelligible) better evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">THE COURT: Well, there\u2014there may very well be better evidence. The question is, is this admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. This is-he simply-he never adopted this as his Driver\u2019s License. He was asked to show identification and if you believe the witness that this is what he showed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">The circuit court permitted the testimony, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ady\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">I\u2019m going to overrule the objection. I\u2019ve had a chance to look at the Rule which I think is the appropriate Rule, 5-803.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cHearsay Exceptions, Unavailability of Declarant not Required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule even though the declarant is available as a witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">I think this word available\u2014has to be determined in the context of\u2014of Rule\u2014the next Rule, 5-804, \u201cDeclarant Available\u201d which has some circumstances where the declar-ant may be unavailable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">Here this is the\u2014the declarant, if you will, is the Florida Motor Vehicle Administration\u2014which would not be unavailable which would technically be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">But I think that\u2014[the prosecution] is correct in my opinion anyways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">It\u2019s a\u2014statement which the\u2014the Florida Motor Vehicle Administration has made about [appellant] and his age. And the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth and I think that\u2014the party in this case would be [appellant] has manifested by presenting his conduct that\u2014 that he believes it to be true so he\u2019s adopted it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">I\u2014I think that\u2019s what this Rule has to\u2014has to\u2014deal with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">So [appellant\u2019s counsel] I\u2019m gonna overrule your objection. Is there anything else you want to state for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">I think you\u2019ve stated your\u2014your reasons pretty clearly but anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I did, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">Obviously I\u2014if there\u2019s any further questions about his age if the Court would recognize a continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab7\">THE COURT: It will certainly\u2014we\u2019ll note that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">THE COURT: Members of the jury I\u2014I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019m gonna overrule the objection that had been made and [prosecutor] is gonna continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">Go ahead [prosecutor].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: So Detective Klezia, based on the identification provided to you twice by [appellant], what is [appellant\u2019s] date of birth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">[DETECTIVE KLEZIA]: 5/23/1982.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">After the jury was excused for deliberation, the following exchange occurred between the circuit court, the prosecutor, and appellant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">THE COURT: Counsel, Before <em>we\u2014we </em>recess I just have one other observation I want to put on the record and I\u2019ll give you a chance to\u2014to comment on it if you\u2014if you \"wish. You don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">The big\u2014legal issue in this case as\u2014as far as\u2014that I found troubling I guess, is this\u2014the age of the\u2014[appellant] coming in off the\u2014off the Driver\u2019s License and the objection that it\u2019d be hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">I\u2019ve already made a ruling on that. But I\u2014I\u2014but I\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since then and I do feel that\u2014I think it\u2019s appropriate if\u2014if this is ever reviewed and it may or may not be and we just never\u2014never know that\u2014the Court put on that\u2014it\u2014it\u2014from the Court\u2019s observation, the age of [appellant] other than it\u2019s an element that has to be proven but it doesn\u2019t really seem to be something that\u2019s disputed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">And I think that\u2014that that may be something that the Court should really be putting on the record at this point so that\u2014Appellate Court reviewing this has\u2014has full context of what\u2019s going on here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">And it\u2019s almost to the point where the\u2014the\u2014the Court feels that\u2014you could almost take judicial notice of [appellant\u2019s] age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">I know in the Application for Statement of Charges [t]he Date of Birth is listed as May 23rd, '82.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">I note in the Indictment his Date of Birth is listed as May 23rd, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">I note in the\u2014all of the District Court documents I might just sort of refer as to that\u2014and I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s all picked off the same computer once it\u2019s entered. It\u2014it all pops up May 23rd, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>But I also note that in the\u2014the\u2014the bond that was filed here, Affidavit of the Bail Bondsman, it looks like\u2014and I can\u2019t read the signature on\u2014on this affidavit of April 30th, 2010, it\u2019s also handwritten in, May 23rd, '82.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">So I\u2014I\u2014I feel that\u2014some context as to this age\u2014 question is\u2014is appropriate and those are my observations on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">I don\u2019t know if either side wishes to\u2014I think you\u2019re\u2014 you\u2019re positions are clear certainly [appellant\u2019s counsel] and [prosecutor], but I don\u2019t know if anybody else wants to comment further at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, Your Honor, I\u2014I think I should respond somewhat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">THE COURT: Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYp\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Because I chose not to argue the age issue to the jury\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">THE COURT: Yes. Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Doesn\u2019t mean that I waived it. I\u2014I felt sort of\u2014to go back to what I said to the jury, there were bigger fish to fry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">I suppose I could have argued that. I never considered that I waived it. I just chose not to argue it\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">THE COURT: I didn\u2019t meant to imply that\u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aty\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: To the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">THE COURT: But I\u2014But I think it\u2019s good to put that on the record. Pm sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Moreover, none of those documents that Your Honor just mentioned are in the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">THE COURT: No, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Appellant was convicted of a third-degree sexual offense and sexual solicitation of a minor. Following his conviction, appellant filed a motion for new trial alleging that the State failed to disclose the conduct which constituted the basis of the third-degree sexual offense conviction. The court denied the motion. Appellant noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in allowing the State to prove his age, a material element of the case, through Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony. Appellant argues that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding his age was based solely on information the detective observed on appellant\u2019s Florida driver\u2019s license, and as such, constituted inadmissible hearsay. Appellant argues that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony as to his age did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule set forth in Md. Rule 5-803. Specifically, appellant contends that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony did not satisfy Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2), which provides an exception to the hearsay rule for a \u201cstatement that is offered against a party, and is \u2018a statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.\u2019 \u201d Appellant maintains that to satisfy this exception the person making the statement must expressly adopt the statement. Appellant argues he did not expressly, or implicitly, manifest \u201can adoption or belief\u2019 in the truth of the date of birth displayed on the Florida license. Appellant contends that he \u201cmerely presented his license in submission to [an order from a law enforcement officer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The State responds that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding the date of birth on appellant\u2019s Florida driver\u2019s license was properly admitted under the adoptive admission exception to the hearsay rule. The State maintains that by presenting the license to Detective Klezia as evidence of his identity, \u201cincluding [his] name and age,\u201d appellant \u201c\u2018manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of that information.\u201d The State points out that, at trial, appellant failed to dispute the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the license. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">In <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005), the Court of Appeals explained the standard of review for hearsay determinations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard. Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, <em>must </em>be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u201cpermitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">(Emphasis in original) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Hearsay Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Md. Rule 5-801 defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d \u201cA hearsay statement may be admissible, however, under certain recognized exceptions to the rule if circumstances provide the requisite indicia of trustworthiness concerning the truthfulness of the statement.\u201d <em>Parker v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 252, 259, 846 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 347, 855 A.2d 350 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The hearsay exception set forth in Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">(a) Statement by party-opponent. A statement that is offered against a party and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">(2) A statement of which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">\u201cMaryland Rule 5-803(a) permits the introduction of a hearsay statement that is offered against a party and is either the party\u2019s own statement or one in \u2018which the party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstead v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>State, </em>195 Md.App. 599, 631, 7 A.3d 169 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>418 Md. 191, 13 A.3d 798 (2011); <em>see also State v. Brown, </em>327 Md. 81, 88, 607 A.2d 923 (1992) (\u201c[A]n admission is a statement of pertinent facts which, in connection with proof of other facts, tends to prove guilt[.]\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The \u201cexpress\u201d adoption of an admission is not limited to a spoken or written adoption. In <em>Brandon v. Molesworth, </em>104 Md.App. 167, 655 A.2d 1292 (1995), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>341 Md. 621, 672 A.2d 608 (1996), this Court extended the definition to non-spoken forms of communications that manifest a similarly unequivocal intent. In <em>Brandon, </em>104 Md.App. at 176-77, 655 A.2d 1292, a wrongful discharge case, where plaintiff asked a coworker, in the presence of the defendant, employer, if she was being fired because she was a woman, the coworker replied, \u201c[y]es, that\u2019s part of it,\u201d and the defendant did not say anything, but nodded in agreement. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">We cannot see how [co-worker\u2019s] statement could fall outside this definition. Assuming the truth of [plaintiffs] allegations, [defendant\u2019s] nod clearly constituted either a manifestation of adoption or a belief in the truth of [coworker\u2019s] statement. The only way to explain the nod\u2014 which is clearly admissible\u2014is to introduce the statement that prompted it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 198, 655 A.2d 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u201cImplied Assertions\u201d in Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The Court of Appeals discussed the doctrine of \u201cimplied assertions\u201d in hearsay in the twin cases of <em>Bernadyn, </em>390 Md. 1, 887 A.2d 602, and <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>389 Md. 681, 887 A.2d 564 (2005), decided on the same day. In <em>Stoddard, </em>389 Md. at 683, 887 A.2d 564, the Court of Appeals held that an eighteen-month-old child\u2019s question\u2014\u201cIs Erik [the defendant] going to get me?\u201d\u2014was an implied assertion, and thus hearsay. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">Jasmine\u2019s fear of Stoddard is irrelevant unless it stems from a belief that she had seen Stoddard assault [the victim]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Although it is conceivable that Jasmine\u2019s fear, taken together with her presence during the relevant time frame, was circumstantial evidence that Jasmine witnessed Stoddard assault [the victim], this conceptualization is a distinction without a difference. Jasmine\u2019s fear of Stoddard is relevant only if it is rational, <em>i.e., </em>only if it stems from a real-world condition or event. To rationally fear Erik Stoddard is to believe the proposition \u201cI have a reason to fear Erik Stod-dard.\u201d Jasmine\u2019s belief in this proposition is relevant only if the \u201creason\u201d at issue is her having witnessed Erik assaulting [the victim]. Thus, in offering Jasmine\u2019s fear as evidence, the State implicitly would be offering Jasmine\u2019s belief in the proposition \u201cI have a reason to fear Erik Stoddard and that reason is that I saw him assault [the victim].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 690, 887 A.2d 564 (footnote omitted). The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">[W]ith respect to the four testimonial inferences, out-of-court words offered for the truth of unintentional implications are not different substantially from out-of-court words offered for the truth of intentional communications. The declarant\u2019s lack of intent to communicate the implied proposition does not increase the reliability of the declarant\u2019s words in a degree sufficient to justify exemption from the hearsay rule. Said another way, we conclude that a declar-ant\u2019s lack of intent to communicate a belief in the truth of a particular proposition is irrelevant to the determination of whether the words are hearsay when offered to prove the truth of that proposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">We hold that where the probative value of words, as offered, depends on the declarant having communicated a factual proposition, the words constitute an \u201cassertion\u201d of that proposition. The declarant\u2019s intent <em>vel non </em>to communicate the proposition is irrelevant. If the words are uttered out of court, then offered in court to prove the truth of the <em>proposition\u2014i.e. </em>of the \u201cmatter asserted\u201d\u2014they are hearsay under our rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 703-04, 887 A.2d 564 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>Bemadyn, </em>390 Md. at 3, 887 A.2d 602, the Court of Appeals held that a medical bill with the defendant\u2019s name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>address on it was inadmissible hearsay when offered to prove that the defendant lived at that address. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEj\">In order to accept the words \u201cMichael Bernadyn, Jr., 2024 Morgan Street, Edgewood, Maryland 21040\u201d as proof that Bernadyn lived at that address, the jury needed to reach two conclusions. It needed to conclude, first, that Bayview Physicians wrote those words because it believed Bernadyn to live at that address, and second, that Bayview Physicians was accurate in that belief. As used, the probative value of the words depended on Bayview Physicians having communicated the proposition that Michael Bernadyn lived at 2024 Morgan Street. The words therefore constituted a \u201cwritten assertion\u201d\u2014and hence, under Md. Rule 5-801(a), a \u201cstatement\u201d\u2014that Michael Bernadyn lived at 2024 Morgan Street. When used to prove the truth of that assertion, the bill was hearsay under Md. Rule 5-801 (c), because it contained \u201ca statement ... offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 11, 887 A.2d 602 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Returning to the case at hand, assuming Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s age consisted of an implied assertion and was hearsay, the testimony was admissible pursuant to Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2), which provides an exception for a statement in which a party has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth. The Court of Appeals has interpreted Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2) as requiring an express adoption of the statement being offered. <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 326, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008). The express adoption need not be verbal or written, as long as it \u201cclearly constitute[s] either a manifestation of adoption or a belief in the truth of [the] statement.\u201d <em>Brandon, </em>104 Md.App. at 198, 655 A.2d 1292. On January 9, 2010, and January 14, 2010, Detective Klezia asked appellant for \u201cidentification,\u201d and on both occasions, appellant presented the Florida driver\u2019s license to Detective Klezia. By presenting the Florida driver\u2019s license, appellant represented that the document was a form of identification containing information about him, which he sought to have the detective accept as accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contention that he did not expressly, or implicitly, manifest an adoption or belief in the truth of any information contained on the Florida license is unpersuasive. One who presents a driver\u2019s license in response to a request for identification by a law enforcement officer clearly manifests an adoption or belief in the truth of information contained in the license, including the person\u2019s name and date of birth. Appellant presented the driver\u2019s license twice when asked for identification and failed to dispute the validity of the driver\u2019s license prior to trial, at trial, or before this Court. In presenting the license in response to the request for identification, appellant communicated to Detective Klezia that the information applied to him, <em>ie. </em>that he was the person described in the identification, including the name and date of birth. We are not convinced by appellant\u2019s contention that his presentation of the license was limited only to an affirmation that his name was accurately displayed on the license. Appellant obviously sought to convince or advise Detective Klezia that information on the license, including the date of birth, was accurate. Any other conclusion would defy logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bellamy </em>for the proposition that merely submitting the license to the detective was an act insufficient to constitute an adoption of its truthfulness is misplaced. In <em>Bellamy, </em>403 Md. at 320, 941 A.2d 1107, the Court of Appeals addressed whether the State can be considered a party-opponent in a criminal prosecution for evidentia-ry purposes. Bellamy was convicted of first-degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, and sentenced to life in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 318, 941 A.2d 1107. The State reached a plea agreement with Saunders, a co-defendant, which required Saunders to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the murder, contingent on Saunders testifying, if required, at Bellamy\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 941 A.2d 1107. At Saunders\u2019s guilty plea proceeding, the prosecutor stated that Saunders accurately identified Welch, not Bellamy, as the shooter. <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 941 A.2d 1107. At his trial, Bellamy sought to have the prosecutor\u2019s statement from Saunders\u2019s guilty plea proceeding\u2014identifying Welch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the shooter\u2014admitted as evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 318, 941 A.2d 1107. The State objected, arguing that the statement was inadmissible hearsay, and the trial court agreed. <em>Id. </em>Bellamy appealed contending, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe statement should have been admitted as an adoptive admission of a party opponent (the State) under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 941 A.2d 1107. \u201cBellamy\u2019s theory is that the State manifested its \u2018adoption or belief in ... [the] truth\u2019 of Saunders\u2019s statement when the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney stated at the plea hearing, \u2018And it is our belief, based on our investigation and review of everything, is that he\u2019s been truthful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 941 A.2d 1107 (omissions and alterations in original) (footnote omitted). The State, in contrast, argued on appeal that it \u201cshould not be considered a \u2018party-opponent\u2019 in a criminal prosecution for evidentiary purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 941 A.2d 1107. The Court of Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">First, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys unequivocally manifested an adoption of or belief in Saunders\u2019s statement when they said, \u201cAnd it is our belief, based on our investigation and review of everything, is that he\u2019s been truthful,\u201d \u201cWe want him to be truthful and we believe he has been,\u201d and, \u201cBut our understanding is the truth has been reduced to writing and the statement he provided to us.\u201d Without this express, in-court adoption of Saunders\u2019s statement, our view may have been different. Whether lesser actions by a prosecutor manifesting an adoption of a statement, such as merely submitting the statement in support of a court filing or acceptance of a plea, would render the statement admissible against the government in a subsequent proceeding remains to be seen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 326, 941 A.2d 1107. The Court, however, concluded that \u201cthe error in excluding the testimony was harmless, and thus, Bellamy\u2019s conviction must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 941 A.2d 1107 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Although the Court of Appeals stated, in <em>Bellamy, </em>that it remained to be seen whether an action, such as merely submitting a statement in support of a court filing or acceptance of a plea, would render the statement admissible, <em>Bella</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>my </em>is obviously distinguishable. In this case, appellant produced a driver\u2019s license when asked for identification by a law enforcement officer, and in doing so, sought to convince the officer that information on the license pertained to him. In producing the license and giving it to the detective, appellant effectively stated that he was the person described by the information thereon. As such, appellant manifested an adoption or a belief in the truth of the information on the license. For all of the reasons set forth above, we conclude that Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to the exception to the hearsay rule for adoptive admissions set forth in Md. Rule 5-803(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Appellant contends that the State attempted to prove the content of his driver\u2019s license through the testimony of Detective Klezia in violation of the best evidence rule. Appellant argues that the best evidence rule requires the content of a document to be proven \u201cthrough the original, or a duplicate copy of that document if the original is unavailable through no fault of the State.\u201d Appellant contends that the best evidence rule required that the original Florida driver\u2019s license be admitted into evidence at trial to prove its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The State contends that it is unclear whether the best evidence rule applies to the State\u2019s use of Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony to prove appellant\u2019s age as it was not seeking to prove the content of the license but rather an independent fact\u2014appellant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Preliminarily, we conclude the issue is not preserved for review. At trial, when asked the basis for his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question to Detective Klezia regarding appellant\u2019s age, appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hearsay.\u201d Although appellant\u2019s counsel commented, that there is \u201cbetter evidence,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel did not challenge the admission of Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony under the best evidence rule. Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-323(a), we conclude that our scope of review is limited to the basis stated by appellant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>when making a contemporaneous objection. Md. Rule 4-323(a) (\u201cAn objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent. Otherwise, the objection is waived.\u201d); <em>see also, Leuschner v. State, </em>41 Md. App. 423, 436, 397 A.2d 622, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 933, 100 S.Ct. 279, 62 L.Ed.2d 192 (1979) (\u201cWhile it is true that under Maryland Rule [4-323(a)] it is not necessary to state the grounds for an objection to evidence unless requested by the court, if, however, grounds are asked for or volunteered, that party will be limited on appeal to a review of those grounds and will be deemed to have waived any ground not stated.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s oblique reference to \u201cbetter evidence\u201d was an indication that the State might have proven appellant\u2019s date of birth through a different means such as, a birth certificate, testimony of a relative, or asking that the court take judicial notice of appellant\u2019s age. In stating there was \u201cbetter evidence,\u201d appellant\u2019s counsel merely indicated to the circuit court that the State could prove appellant\u2019s date of birth by some other means, other than the Florida license or Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not argue the applicability of the best evidence rule or the absence of any exception to the best evidence rule. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not rely upon any case law related to the best evidence rule. As such, we conclude that appellant did not raise the best evidence rule as the basis for his objection to Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding his age. Clearly, the circuit court did not rule on any issue pertaining to the best evidence rule. Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d). In this case, however, as the State did not raise the issue of waiver on appeal, we will nonetheless address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s contention that the best evidence rule is applicable to Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony. The best evidence rule, as set forth in Md. Rule 5-1002, states: \u201cTo prove the content of a writing, recording, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute.\u201d Maryland appellate courts have \u201clong recognized that the Best Evidence Rule is applicable in criminal cases in Maryland.\u201d <em>State v. Cabral, </em>159 Md.App. 354, 382, 859 A.2d 285 (2004) (citing <em>Carter v. State, </em>367 Md. 447, 469, 788 A.2d 646 (2002) (Raker, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201cThe Best Evidence Rule requires, as an evidentiary matter, that an original writing must be produced to prove its existence and contents[J\u201d <em>Carter, </em>367 Md. at 469, 788 A.2d 646 (Raker, J., dissenting). \u201c[T]he purposes of the best-evidence rule are to ensure that the exact terminology of a writing is presented to the court and to guard against fraud[.]\u201d <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 403, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in, Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>310 Md. 217, 220, 528 A.2d 904 (1987). In <em>Sewell v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 691, 692-93, 368 A.2d 1111, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 734 (1977), this Court discussed the Best Evidence Rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">Under that rule, sometimes referred to as the Original Document Rule, the best evidence of the contents of a writing is deemed to be the writing itself. Oral testimony or other secondary evidence of the terms of the writing may not be offered as a substitute for the original document itself unless the proponent can demonstrate an adequate reason for the non-production of the original. Instructive in this regard is McCormick, <em>Law of Evidence </em>(1st ed., 1954), Ch. 23, \u201cThe Requirement of the Production of the Original Writing as the \u2018Best Evidence,\u201d\u2019 \u00a7 201, \u201cExcuses for Non-production of the Original Writing\u2014(a) Loss or Destruction,\u201d p. 413:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201cThe professed purpose of the production of documents rule being to secure, not the writing at all hazards, but the best <em>obtainable </em>evidence of its contents, if the document cannot as a practical matter be produced, because of its loss or destruction, the production of the original is excused and other evidence of its contents is received____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Loss or destruction may sometimes be provable by direct evidence but more often the only available method is circumstantial, usually by proof of search for the document and inability to secure it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The best evidence rule exists to express a preference for introducing originals over copies of writings. In <em>Cabral, </em>159 Md.App. at 384, 859 A.2d 285, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">As Professor McLain has explained in her treatise, the best evidence rule \u201cis misleadingly named, as it is not a general requirement that each party present only the \u2018best evidence\u2019 available on every point, so as to preclude other probative evidence.\u201d 6A L. McLain, MARYLAND EVIDENCE, \u00a7 1001:1, at 535 (2001). What this Court said in <em>Cooper v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 392, 398, 397 A.2d 245 (1979), is also noteworthy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">The Best Evidence Rule states a <em>preference </em>for original documents, but does not foreclose use of secondary evidence \u201cafter a proper foundation has been laid showing good and sufficient reasons for the failure to produce the primary evidence.\u201d <em>Forrester v. State, </em>224 Md. 337, 349, 167 A.2d 878, 884 (1961). The issue usually arises when the original document has been lost or destroyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afi\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">As a threshold matter, we note that the underpinning of the best evidence rule is that the best evidence of the contents of a writing is deemed to be the writing itself. <em>Sewell, 34 </em>Md.App. at 692, 368 A.2d 1111. In this case, the State did not seek to prove the content of the license itself as it would if it had been attempting to prove the terms of a contract or will. For example, the State did not seek to prove the existence of the Florida license or to resolve a dispute concerning the accuracy of information contained in the license. Instead, the State sought to establish that appellant was over the age of twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Appellant was convicted of third-degree sexual offense and sexual solicitation of a minor. Pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 3-307(a)(4): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cA person may not: ... engage in a sexual act with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old, and the person performing the sexual act is at least 21 years old[.]\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-324(b) provides: \u201cA person may not, with the intent to commit a violation of ... \u00a7 3-307 of this subtitle ... knowingly solicit a minor, or a law enforcement officer posing as a minor, to engage in activities that would be unlawful for the person to engage in under ... \u00a7 3-307[.].\u201d Under the statutes, the State was required to prove that appellant was over the age of twenty-one. The State, through Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony, sought to demonstrate that appellant was over the age of twenty-one. The content of the license was not at issue, and at trial, appellant did not challenge the validity or \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the Florida\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Appellant has failed to identify a single dispute or issue pertaining to the content of the license. Neither in the circuit court nor before this Court has appellant claimed that the license was not accurate, or that the date testified to by Detective Klezia was not his date of birth. Appellant did not contend that Detective Klezia made a mistake about the date of birth on the license, that the license did not exist, or that he did not actually present the license to Detective Klezia. Thus, the case did not involve a dispute about the content or the terms of the license. Rather, the State sought to prove that appellant was over the age of twenty-one through the testimony of a witness who viewed a driver\u2019s license that appellant supplied to him, and the witness was available for cross-examination regarding his interaction with appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the best evidence rule is inapplicable to Detective Klezia\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s date of birth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY AFFIRMED.
