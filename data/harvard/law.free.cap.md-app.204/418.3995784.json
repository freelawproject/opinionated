State, </em>392 Md. 1, 2, 9, 895 A.2d 1024 (2006) (\u201cIncompetence to stand trial is defined in CP \u00a7 3-101(f) as an inability to understand the nature or object of the proceeding or to assist in one\u2019s defense.\u201d). These consolidated appeals arise in the aftermath of <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 978 A.2d 736 (2009), in which the Court of Appeals enforced the mandate in CP section 3-107(a)(2) that felony charges must be dismissed when the defendant remains incompetent after five years. The novel question presented here is whether, following such a dismissal, the State may (a) re-indict the same defendant for the same crimes, even though he remains incompetent; and (b) on the basis of such re-indictment, continue to confine that defendant under a criminal, rather than a civil, commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>In these appeals, John Wesley Ray, appellant, returns and is joined by Michael Lee Adams, appellant, in challenging the State\u2019s actions in response to <em>Ray. </em>Although the original felony indictments against both appellants were dismissed in accordance with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ray </em>and CP section 3-107(a)(2), the State re-indicted both appellants on the same charges even though they were still not competent to stand trial. Based on these re-indictments, moreover, appellants have remained confined, pursuant to CP section 3-106, under criminal commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In their brief, Ray and Adams present a single issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Can the State indefinitely confine a criminal defendant found incompetent to stand trial and who is not likely to regain competency in the foreseeable future, in violation of CP \u00a7 3-107 and due process of law, by simply re-indicting the defendant on the same charges that are required to be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 3-107?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The State moves to dismiss these interlocutory appeals on the ground that they are not permitted by statute, rule, or the collateral order doctrine. On the merits, the State argues that these re-indictments and continued criminal commitments are permitted by language in the <em>Ray </em>opinion stating that, following a dismissal without prejudice under CP section 3-107(a), \u201cthe State may re-institute charges[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 978 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">For the reasons explained below, we conclude that both appeals are properly before this Court under the collateral order doctrine. In addition, we agree with appellants that their re-indictments, as well as their continued confinement under criminal commitments based on such re-indictments, violate CP sections 3-106 and 3-107 and their due process and equal protection rights protected by those sections. Accordingly, we shall reverse the orders denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss their re-indictments and remand for further proceedings, which may include civil commitment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>LEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Maryland\u2019s Statutory Scheme Governing Indictment and Confinement of Incompetent Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">A review of constitutional and statutory principles applicable to incompetent defendants is helpful before considering the posture of the two appeals now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Jackson v. Indiana, </em>406 U.S. 715, 738-39, 92 S.Ct. 1845, 1854, 32 L.Ed.2d 435 (1972), the Supreme Court held that, by subjecting Jackson, an incompetent defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">to a more lenient commitment standard and to a more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable to all others not charged with offenses, and by thus condemning him in effect to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by [statute], Indiana deprived petitioner of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">For reasons closely related to those ..., we also hold that Indiana\u2019s indefinite commitment of a criminal defendant solely on account of his incompetency to stand trial does not square with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">The <em>Jackson </em>Court explained that, \u201c[a]t the least, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">a person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. If it is determined that this is not the case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Although the Supreme Court declined \u201cto prescribe arbitrary time limits,\u201d citing the existence \u201cof differing state facilities and procedures and a lack of evidence in this record,\u201d it did \u201cnote ... that petitioner Jackson has now been confined for three and one-half years on a record that sufficiently establishes the lack of a substantial probability that he will ever be able to participate fully in a trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>406 U.S. at 738-39, 92 S.Ct. at 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Implementing the due process and equal protection principles recognized in <em>Jackson, </em>sections 3-106 and 3-107 of Maryland\u2019s Criminal Procedure Article establish a maximum period for holding an incompetent defendant under indictment and standards for confining such a defendant under a criminal commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Section 3-107 limits the length of time criminal charges may remain pending against incompetent defendants. Although a court has discretionary authority to dismiss charges at any time \u201cif the court considers that resuming the criminal proceeding would be unjust because so much time has passed since the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial,\u201d the General Assembly has set specific times after which the court is required to dismiss charges against an incompetent defendant. Under CP section 3-107(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">[wjhether or not the defendant is confined and unless the State petitions the court for extraordinary cause to extend the time, the court shall dismiss the charge against a defendant found incompetent to stand trial under this subtitle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">(1) when charged with a capital offense, after the expiration of 10 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(2) when charged with a felony or a crime of violence as defined under \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article, after the lesser of the expiration of 5 years or the maximum sentence for the most serious offense charged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(3) when charged with an offense not covered under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, after the lesser of the expiration of 3 years or the maximum sentence for the most serious offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">CP section 3-106(b) authorizes the court to involuntarily conf\u00edne an incompetent defendant against whom criminal charges are pending, under what is known as a criminal commitment. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(1) If, after a hearing, the court finds that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial and, because of mental retardation or a mental disorder, is a danger to self or the person or property of another, the court may order the defendant committed to the facility that the Health Department designates until the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">(1) the defendant no longer is incompetent to stand trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">(ii) the defendant no longer is, because of mental retardation or a mental disorder, a danger to self or the person or property of others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">(iii) there is not a substantial likelihood that the defendant will become competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">(2) If a court commits the defendant because of mental retardation, the Health Department shall require the Developmental Disabilities Administration to provide the care or treatment that the defendant needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Defendants confined under criminal commitments receive at least annual judicial reconsideration of their incompetency, as set forth in CP section S-H^c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>finds that an untried defendant is not likely to become competent in \u201cthe foreseeable future,\u201d and that involuntary confinement is still necessary to protect the defendant and/or public,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> confinement may continue only if the State satisfies the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard required for civil commitment. CP section 3-106(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">At a competency hearing under subsection (c) of this section, if the court finds that the defendant is incompetent and is not likely to become competent in the foreseeable future, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">(1) civilly commit the defendant as an inpatient in a medical facility that the Health Department designates provided the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">(i) the defendant has a mental disorder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">(ii) inpatient care is necessary for the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(in) the defendant presents a danger to the life or safety of self or others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">(iv) the defendant is unable or unwilling to be voluntarily committed to a medical facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">(v) there is no less restrictive form of intervention that is consistent with the welfare and safety of the defendant. (2) order the confinement of the defendant for 21 days as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">a resident in a Developmental Disabilities Administration facility for the initiation of admission proceedings under \u00a7 7-503 of the Health\u2014General Article provided the court finds that the defendant, because of mental retardation, is a danger to self or others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Conversion of an incompetent person\u2019s confinement from a criminal commitment to a civil commitment brings additional substantive and procedural rights. <em>See generally </em>CP \u00a7 3-106(e) (\u201cThe provisions under Title 10 of the Health\u2014 General Article shall apply to the continued retention of a defendant civilly committed under subsection (d) of this section.\u201d); Md.Code, \u00a7 10-701(c) of the Health\u2014General Article (HG) (enumerating rights of individuals in a mental health facility, which include rights to be free from certain types of restraints and to \u201creceive appropriate humane treatment and services in a manner that restricts the individual\u2019s personal liberty within a facility only to the extent necessary and consistent with the individual\u2019s treatment needs and applicable legal requirements\u201d); HG \u00a7 10-706 (enumerating procedural requirements for creating a treatment plan for a civilly committed person, which include establishing treatment goals in consultation with the committed person).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Appeal No. 435: Mr. Ray</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">In February 2001, appellant John Wesley Ray was indicted for attempted first degree murder and lesser included offenses, in the Circuit Court for Harford County. On January 2, 2002, the circuit court found that Ray, a paranoid schizophrenic, was not competent to stand trial. <em>See Ray, </em>410 Md. at 389, 978 A.2d 736. Ray was confined under a criminal commitment to Clifton T. Perkins Hospital (\u201cPerkins\u201d), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>State mental health facility for, <em>inter alia, </em>incompetent defendants who have been ordered to be confined under CP section 3-106(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">More than five years later, Ray, in January 2007, moved to dismiss the charges against him, citing the mandatory dismissal provision in CP section 3-107(a)(2). <em>See id. </em>During his confinement at Perkins, Ray took anti-psychotic medication that resulted in assessments that he could be \u201crestored\u201d to competency, and, for brief periods, he appeared to be competent. Ultimately, however, he remained incompetent for most of those five years. <em>Id. </em>at 389-97, 404, 978 A.2d 736. At the time the circuit court decided the motion to dismiss, Ray was incompetent and considered a danger to others. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 978 A.2d 736. The circuit court denied Ray\u2019s motion, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the charges. <em>See id. </em>at 420, 978 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Reviewing the statutory scheme, the Court noted that \u201cunder Section 3-107 ..., any dismissal is without prejudice to the State reindicting and that civil commitment under Title 10 of the Health General Article ... is always a possibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406 n. 7, 978 A.2d 736. The Court concluded that the General Assembly intended to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jackson </em>when it added dismissal deadlines in CP section 3-107 and when it \u201cmandate[d] civil commitment when a judge determines that the defendant is not restorable to competency\u201d in CP section 3-106. <em>Id. </em>at 415-17, 978 A.2d 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s holding that Ray\u2019s dangerousness and restorability to competency established \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d warranting extension of the five-year dismissal deadline under CP section 3-107(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 419, 978 A.2d 736. The Court rejected that interpretation of the statute because it permitted Ray\u2019s criminal commitment to extend \u201cbeyond the five-year period, conceivably for an indefinite period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 978 A.2d 736. The statutory scheme, the Court pointed out, contemplates that when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>defendant is <em>not </em>restorable to competency within the time frame set in CP section 3-107(a), his commitment must be converted from criminal to civil, in order to avoid the type of unreasonably indefinite criminal commitment prohibited by <em>Jackson. Id. </em>The Court reasoned that the \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d exception must be construed so that a defendant who <em>is </em>restorable to competency cannot be subjected to such an indefinite criminal commitment either. <em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 978 A.2d 736. In the Court\u2019s view, it would be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF7\">anomalous indeed, in light of the mandate for civil commitment of an incompetent defendant who cannot be restored, that Ray, who was identified as restorable, could be held indefinitely without a commitment proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">In this regard, then, extraordinary cause must require more than dangerousness and restorability, in order to avoid the necessity of civil commitment that requires greater procedural protections. Dangerousness, the norm for defendants institutionalized at Perkins, cannot be viewed as extraordinary, especially because it is but one factor for civil commitment. Restorability to competency, similarly, cannot constitute \u201cextraordinary cause,\u201d especially when restorability, a desirable characteristic, could result in indefinite institutionalization, without procedural protection. In holding that dangerousness and restorability cannot constitute \u201cextraordinary cause,\u201d however, we recognize that under the statute the State may re-institute charges and that civil commitment proceedings may be initiated against Ray. Whatever decision is made, if any, the pending charges against Ray must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Six weeks after the <em>Ray </em>opinion was filed, on October 6, 2009, the State, relying on the <em>Ray </em>Court\u2019s statement that \u201cunder the statute the State may re-institute charges,\u201d re-indicted appellant Ray on the same charges, in Case No. 12-K-09-1693. Although the original charges were thereafter dismissed in accordance with the mandate in <em>Ray, </em>the State continued to confine Ray at Perkins, under a criminal commitment based on the second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>On November 18, 2009, Ray moved to dismiss the second indictment, arguing that it \u201cnullifies CP \u00a7 3-107(a)\u201d and that \u201chis continued incarceration at Perkins den[ies] him the right to civil commitment pursuant to CP section 3-106(a)-(e).\u201d While that motion was pending, Ray responded to the second indictment, pleading, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was still not competent to stand trial. Ray was examined and, although there once again was evidence that he might be restored to competency with supervised medication and treatment, he was again found to be incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Thereafter, in a written opinion, the circuit court denied Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss. With respect to the second indictment, the court reasoned that CP section 3-107(a)(2) specifies that the dismissal of criminal charges against an incompetent defendant after five years is \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and that the Court of Appeals had stated that the State could \u201creinstitute charges\u201d against Ray. As for Ray\u2019s right to civil commitment under CP section 3\u2014106(d), the court was \u201cuncertain how the current indictment precludes [Ray] from again averring that he is incompetent to stand trial and thereby availing himself of possible civil commitment pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-106(b).\u201d In the circuit court\u2019s view, the new indictment did \u201cnot prevent [Ray] from being committed\u201d under the civil commitment subsections of CP section 3-106 \u201cafter a trial judge has made the necessary findings of fact.\u201d At the time this appeal was noted on his behalf, Ray was still confined at Perkins under a criminal commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Appeal No. 352: Mr. Adams</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In 1998, appellant Michael Lee Adams was indicted on charges of attempted first degree rape and related offenses, in Case No. 98-CR-3113 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Since Adams was first found incompetent to stand trial due to his limited cognitive ability, he has been continuously confined under a criminal commitment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>After the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ray, </em>Adams moved to dismiss his indictment, citing <em>Ray </em>and CP section 3-107(a)(2). The Circuit Court for Baltimore County dismissed those charges without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Two months earlier, however, on January 19, 2010, the State had re-indicted Adams on the same charges, in Case No. 03-K-10-0353. Adams\u2019 motion to prevent the re-indictment was denied. After Adams pleaded incompetency, he was re-evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Adams then moved to dismiss the second indictment. At the hearing on that motion, the public defender representing Adams argued that \u201cthe net effect\u201d of the State\u2019s re-indictment \u201cis to circumvent <em>Jackson </em>completely\u201d and to distort the decision in <em>Ray. </em>He maintained that under \u201ca fair reading\u201d of <em>Ray </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>\u201cuntil there is reason for the State to conclude that Mr. Adams either is currently competent or that he will become competent in the reasonably foreseeable future, ... it\u2019s not ripe for them to recharge.\u201d The circuit court then pointed out that Adams had \u201cbeen found to be not competent for many, many years now[,]\u201d and the prosecutor acknowledged that, due to \u201corganic difficulties that he has,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s very unlikely that he would ever be[ ] found competent!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Noting the dearth of statutory and appellate authority regarding \u201cthe way that new charges could be filed with the timing,\u201d the court observed that \u201cboth sides agree the State can re [-]indict.\u201d Although the court agreed with the public defender that neither <em>Jackson </em>nor <em>Ray </em>contemplate that the State \u201ccould keep every five years or 10 years re-upping or recharging the [defendant,\u201d it concluded that, \u201cbased on the circumstances of this case and the procedure of this case, I do believe his due process rights have not been violated!)]\u201d The circuit court therefore denied Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Adams noted this appeal, which this Court consolidated for briefing and argument with Ray\u2019s subsequently filed appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The State\u2019s Motion to Dismiss These Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The State moves to dismiss both appeals on the grounds that neither is from a final appealable judgment or \u201cotherwise permitted pursuant to statute, Maryland Rule 2-602, or the collateral order doctrine.\u201d We are persuaded that these interlocutory appeals are appropriate under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The Court of Appeals recently summarized this exception to the general rule that \u201cthe right to seek appellate review ... must await the entry of a final judgment, disposing of all claims against all parties[,]\u201d <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 165, 725 A.2d 549 (1999), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Maryland\u2019s collateral order doctrine has its roots in the important policy underlying the final judgment rule, which is to \u201cprevent piecemeal appeals and ... the interruption of ongoing judicial proceedings.\u201d The doctrine \u201cis very limited,\u201d and permits the immediate appeal of only a \u201cnarrow class of orders\u201d that are \u201coffshoots of the principal litigation in which they are issued\u201d and are considered \u201cfinal judgments without regard to the posture of the case[.]\u201d To come within the collateral order doctrine, the order sought to be reviewed must be one that: \u201c(1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue, (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, and (4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\"><em>Stephens v. State, </em>420 Md. 495, 502, 24 A.3d 105 (2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The State does not argue that the orders denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss their re-indictments are inconclusive as to the disputed question or that they do not resolve an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>important issue. Instead, the State contends that these orders do not satisfy the third and fourth requirements for collateral order review. According to the State, the issue of whether appellants\u2019 re-indictments must be dismissed is \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the merits of whether appellants are guilty of the charges against them because \u201cthe question about their criminal liability will never be reached\u201d if the charges against them are dismissed. Moreover, the State argues, \u201c[t]he rulings at issue would not be \u2018effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment\u201d because \u201c[i]f Adams and Ray are found competent to stand trial, and they are tried and convicted, nothing would prevent them from seeking appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s denial of any motions to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">There is no Maryland precedent addressing the State\u2019s re-indictment of an incompetent defendant after a CP section 3-107(a) dismissal, much less any authority deciding whether an interlocutory appeal lies from an order deciding that the State may do so. However, the Court of Appeals\u2019 seminal decision adopting the collateral order doctrine in <em>Jolley v. State, </em>282 Md. 353, 384 A.2d 91 (1978), where the appellant challenged an order finding him incompetent to stand trial, is instructively analogous. <em>See generally Kurstin v. Bromberg Rosenthal, LLP, </em>191 Md.App. 124, 140, 990 A.2d 594 (2010) (\u201cMaryland first adopted the collateral order doctrine in the opinion of Judge Orth for the Court of Appeals in <em>Jolley v. State\u201d), </em>af<em>f'd, </em>420 Md. 466, 24 A.3d 88 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The <em>Jolley </em>Court concluded that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">decision that an accused is incompetent to stand trial appears to fall in that small class which finally determines claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.... [T]he order here is a final disposition of a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the cause of action and does not require consideration with it; it does not make any step toward final disposition of the merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the case and will not be merged in final judgment---\u201cWhen that time comes, it will be too late effectively to review the present order, and the rights conferred by the [constitutions] ... will have been lost, probably irreparably. We conclude that the matters embraced in the decision appealed from are not of such an interlocutory nature as to affect, or to be affected by, decision on the merits of this case.\u201d We hold that the challenged order is appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">282 Md. at 357, 384 A.2d 91 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">As in <em>Jolley, </em>the incompetency issue presented by these interlocutory appeals is entirely separate from the merits of the underlying criminal charges against appellants. The orders denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss their re-indictments can easily be reviewed without considering whether appellants are guilty of the crimes for which they have been re-indicted. As we shall demonstrate, deciding whether the State may re-indict appellants even though they remain incompetent does not require us to address whether appellants ultimately may be found criminally responsible on the charges in these indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Moreover, the State\u2019s argument that the challenged orders are not \u201ceffectively unreviewable\u201d is premised on a factual scenario that does not exist in either of these appeals, i.e., that appellants have become competent. To the contrary, the question presented by Ray and Adams arises only because appellants still have <em>not </em>become competent to stand trial, so that this issue exists only in cases that cannot proceed to appealable final judgments after trial. As in <em>Jolley, </em>without interlocutory review, \u201c \u2018it will be too late effectively to review the present order[s], and the rights conferred by the [statute and Constitution] ... will have been lost, probably irreparably.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Because the orders denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss their current indictments satisfy all four criteria for collateral orders, we deny the State\u2019s motion to dismiss these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Appellants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss the Re-Indictments</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Citing <em>Jackson, Ray, </em>and CP sections 3-106 and 3-107, appellants Ray and Adams argue that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">the State cannot indefinitely confine a criminal defendant found incompetent to stand trial and who is not likely to regain competency in the foreseeable future, in violation of CP \u00a7 3-107 and due process of law, by simply re-indicting the defendant on the same charges that are required to be dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 3-107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">According to appellants, the new indictments are a \u201csubterfuge\u201d by which the State is impermissibly circumventing the mandates of CP sections 3-106 and 3-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The State takes the position that, following a mandatory dismissal under CP section 3-107(a)(2), it can immediately restart the five-year clock by filing a new indictment on the same criminal charges, even when the defendant remains incompetent. In the State\u2019s view, appellants\u2019 re-indictments, as well as their continued confinements under criminal commitments as a result of those re-indictments, are permissible because a section 3-107(a) dismissal is without prejudice and the <em>Ray </em>Court explicitly \u201crecognized that under the statute, the State may re-institute charges[.]\u201d <em>Ray, </em>410 Md. at 420, 978 A.2d 736. The State maintains that this language is law of the case in Ray\u2019s appeal and mandatory precedent in Adams\u2019 appeal. <em>See generally Scott v. State, </em>379 Md. 170, 183, 840 A.2d 715 (2004) (\u201conce an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be law of the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">We are not persuaded the <em>Ray </em>Court ruled that the State could immediately re-indict Ray regardless of his continuing incompetency. Ray\u2019s appeal from his original indictment did not present that issue, and we do not agree that the Court decided that question prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">To be sure, in holding that dismissal of Ray\u2019s original indictment was mandated by section 3-107(a)(2), the Court of Appeals observed that \u201cthe State may re-institute charges....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 978 A.2d 736. But that phrase was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>only the first part of a sentence that ended by also pointing out \u201cthat civil commitment proceedings may be initiated against Ray.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When this sentence is read in the full context of the Court\u2019s decision and rationale, which rests on the constitutional principles articulated in <em>Jackson, </em>as implemented in CP sections 3-106 and 3-107, we believe the Court of Appeals was simply acknowledging, in dictum, that it would be appropriate for the State to re-indict Ray if and when he becomes competent to stand trial, and that, in the meantime, the State could initiate civil commitment proceedings in order to maintain Ray\u2019s involuntary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As the <em>Ray </em>Court recognized, we must read CP sections 3-106 and 3-107 <em>in pan materia </em>and in light of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to comply with the <em>Jackson </em>Court\u2019s holding that an incompetent defendant may be held only for the period of time reasonably necessary to determine whether he is likely to become competent to stand trial, and thereafter, \u201cthe State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant.\u201d <em>See Jackson, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858. Although the Supreme Court declined to set a time limit on the \u201creasonable period\u201d for making a probable competency determination, the General Assembly has effectively done so in sections 3-106 and 3-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The statutory scheme establishes the maximum period that an indictment may remain pending against an untried but incompetent defendant (section 3-107(a)), authorizes the court to order a criminal commitment only \u201cuntil the court finds that ... there is not a substantial likelihood that the defendant will become competent to stand trial in the foreseeable future\u201d (section 3\u2014106(b)(l)(iii)), mandates regular judicial review of each criminally committed defendant\u2019s competency (section 3-106(c)), and requires the court to convert a commitment from criminal to civil once \u201cthe court finds that the defendant ... is not likely to become competent in the foreseeable future\u201d (section 3\u2014106(d)). The dismissal deadlines in section 3-107(a) provide yardsticks for measuring \u201cthe reasonable period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that [the defendant] will attain [competency] in the foreseeable future.\u201d <em>See Jackson, </em>406 U.S. at 738, 92 S.Ct. at 1858. In the case of felony indictments like those at issue in this appeal, the five-year period in section 3-107(a)(2) reflects the General Assembly\u2019s assessment that, except in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases, this is sufficient time for the court to make the probable competency determination required by <em>Jackson </em>and CP section 3-106. Thus, under the statutory scheme implementing <em>Jackson, </em>when a defendant remains incompetent after five years, as in the case of Ray and Adams, the felony indictment must be dismissed and any further confinement must be converted from a criminal to a civil commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Section 3-107(a) expressly provides that such a dismissal is without prejudice, indicating the General Assembly contemplated that, at one point in time, the State could decide to re-indict after such a dismissal. Generally, \u201cwhether the State\u2019s Attorney does or does not institute a particular prosecution is a matter which rests in his discretion[,]\u201d <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 90, 40 A.2d 319 (1944), and the statutory scheme does not limit the State\u2019s authority to re-indict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this, as in the exercise of other prosecutorial powers to charge and try citizens, the State is obligated to act in good faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the circumstances presented here, we agree with appellants that, in order to avoid undermining the statutory scheme designed to protect the constitutional rights of incompetent persons, the State may not re-indict after a section 3-107(a) dismissal until it can articulate a good faith basis to believe that the defendant has become competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Otherwise, the only purpose that can be served by the re-indictment is the constitutionally impermissible purpose of continuing the defendant\u2019s confinement under a criminal commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The State\u2019s interpretation of the statute, premised on the \u201cre-institute\u201d phrase parsed from the final paragraph in <em>Ray, </em>is inconsistent with the <em>Ray </em>Court\u2019s holding that section 3-107(a) cannot be read so broadly that it permits indefinite indictments and criminal commitments of incompetent citizens. We are not persuaded that the Court of Appeals intended to give the State a \u201cgreen light to re-indict\u201d someone in a state of persistent incompetency, because such re-indictment would effectively eviscerate the statutory five-year deadline and run afoul of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Ray, </em>by creating a \u201cback door\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>allows prosecutors, by serial indictments, to maintain incompetent defendants under criminal commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As applied to Adams, for example, the State\u2019s construction of <em>Ray </em>and the statutory scheme could easily circumvent sections 3-106 and 3-107. Because Adams appears unlikely to become competent, he could be held under the second indictment and criminal commitment for another five years, followed by dismissal without prejudice, then re-ir\u00eddictment and continued criminal commitment for five more years, leading to yet another dismissal without prejudice, and so on, <em>ad infini-tum. </em>Adopting the State\u2019s position that prosecutors have carte blanc to re-indict defendants like Adams, who are still incompetent more than five years after indictment, would require us to construe the statutory scheme in a manner that violates the constitutional principles articulated in <em>Jackson, </em>implemented in sections 3-106 and 3-107, and enforced in <em>Ray. Cf, e.g., Connecticut v. Jenkins, </em>288 Conn. 610, 625-26, 954 A.2d 806 (2008) (rejecting government\u2019s argument that statute requiring dismissal of charges after 18 months of incompetency did not apply to defendant who was incompetent over a series of non-consecutive criminal commitments that each lasted less than 18 months but cumulatively exceeded 18 months, because interpreting the statutory scheme to allow such \u201can unlimited number of\u2019 incompetency commitments would place it \u201cin serious constitutional jeopardy, a result that we must seek to avoid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Despite expressing doubt that the State could lawfully engage in serial indictments of an incompetent defendant, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County erroneously concluded that Adams\u2019 second indictment did not violate his due process right to dismissal under CP section 3-107(a)(2). For the reasons explained above, the State could not lawfully re-indict Adams because, as the prosecutor admitted, there was no reason to believe that Adams had become competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Similarly, in Ray\u2019s case, the Circuit Court for Harford County erred in concluding that the Court of Appeals author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ized re-indictment despite Ray\u2019s continuing incompetency, and that Ray\u2019s confinement under a criminal commitment could continue until he requested and established his right to a civil commitment. In these circumstances, denying Ray\u2019s motion to dismiss the second indictment and requiring Ray to establish his right to a civil commitment violated the due process and equal protection rights protected under CP sections 3-106 and 3-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Accordingly, we must reverse the orders denying appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss their current indictments and remand for further proceedings. In each case, the pending indictment must be dismissed. The State may re-indict only if it has a good faith belief that the appellant has become competent to stand trial. As long as each appellant remains incompetent, the State, to continue confinement, may initiate proceedings to convert his commitment from criminal to civil, in accordance with CP section 3-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">IN APPEAL NO. 352, ORDER DENYING APPELLANT ADAMS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT IN CASE NO. 03-K-10-0353, CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY, REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
