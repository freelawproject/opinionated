By its responses to requests for admissions, the City admitted that its driver had \u201ccaused the collision.\u201d As a result, damages were the only issues to be tried. We are informed by appellants that, prior to trial, the City paid them for the damage to their car, so that property damages were not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Trial took place in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In its <em>voir dire </em>examination, the court asked whether any of the prospective jurors knew anything about the accident, knew or had any relationship to the parties, witnesses, or attorneys, had either asserted a claim for personal injury arising from an accident or on-the-job injury, had such a claim asserted against them, or had a \u201cspecial relationship with Baltimore City.\u201d The court defined \u201cspecial relationship\u201d as employment, pending litigation, or \u201cany other relationship, past or present, with the City that would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror.\u201d The court also inquired whether any of the prospective jurors would be prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>simply because the City was a party, whether anyone on the jury had a particular hardship or emergency situation that would prevent them from fulfilling their jury duty, and whether there was any other \u201creason based on any belief, knowledge, information, or experience of any sort whatsoever\u201d that would affect their ability to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The court declined to ask five <em>voir dire </em>questions requested by appellants, who timely excepted to the court\u2019s decision. The questions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201c1. Did any of the members of this panel hear the acceptance speech of President Bush at the Republican Convention in which he contended that trial lawyers and all the suits they file have contributed to the economic problems faced by our Country? If so, would what you heard keep you from fairly and justly deciding the issues in this case, especially as to compensation to be awarded?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">2. Would any of the members of this panel be unable to fairly and justly decide the issues in this case especially as to compensation to be awarded because of all that you have heard and/or read about the effect of large jury awards on your liability insurance premiums?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">3. Would any of the members of this panel be unable to fairly and justly decide the issues in this case especially as to compensation to be awarded because of all that you have heard and/or read about the effect of fraudulent or frivolous law suits for injuries, etc.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">4. Would any of the members of this panel be unable to fairly and justly decide the issues in this case especially as to compensation to be awarded because of all that you have heard and/or read about the high costs of medical care and gauging [sic] or even fraud by doctors in their billing for treatment done or even not done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">5. Would any of the members of this panel be unable to fairly and justly decide the issues in this case especially as to compensation to be awarded because you are a taxpayer in Baltimore City or because you or a close relative or friend works or worked for the City?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>The matter then proceeded to trial, and the jury awarded appellants some medical expenses and lost earnings but virtually no non-economic damages. Appellants moved for a new trial based in part on the court\u2019s refusal to ask the five <em>voir dire </em>questions; the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">On appeal, the single question presented by appellants is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cDid the trial judge abuse his discretion in refusing to ask the voir dire questions proposed by the appellants\u2019 attorney, thereby prejudicing their cases for damages?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Appellants, helpfully, frame the issue clearly for us in their brief: \u201cThe only issue raised has to do with [the trial judge\u2019s] refusal to ask the Voir Dire requested by the Appellants.\u201d In Maryland, a trial court has \u201cwide discretion in determining what questions should be asked on voir dire examination of jurors and the exercise of such discretion will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>Goosman v. A Duie Pyle, Inc., </em>320 F.2d 45, 49-50 (4th Cir.1963) (interpreting Maryland law); <em>see also Casey v. Roman Catholic Arch., </em>217 Md. 595, 605, 143 A.2d 627 (1958); <em>Davis v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 89, 611 A.2d 1008, <em>cert. granted, </em>329 Md. 22, 616 A.2d 1286 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Notwithstanding the very broad scope of the questions, which in their most particular form were addressed to tort litigation in general or any action brought against the City, appellants contend that the proposed questions would \u201cdetermine that a prospective juror has such a bias or prejudice against the kind of claim [brought here].\u201d Maryland courts have considered whether a court must examine jurors as to such attitudes and have responded in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">In <em>Kujawa v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195, 167 A.2d 96 (1961), the plaintiffs attempted to attribute a disappointingly low recovery to the trial court\u2019s refusal to propound the following question on <em>voir dire:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u201cHave you read any article or literature or have you heard any discussion recently on amounts of verdicts in negligence cases, and, if so, have you formed any ideas with reference to amounts of jury verdicts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">They complained on appeal that the question was \u201cmotivated by their desire to counteract what they characterize as a \u2018steady stream of indoctrination\u2019 flowing from the insurance companies to the public generally in such volume as to adversely affect jury verdicts in negligence cases of plaintiffs having honest claims\u201d and that the court erred in refusing to ask the question. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 167 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Court of Appeals found no error. Noting first that the plaintiffs had failed to establish any prejudice, the Court observed that, \u201cthe interrogatory, assuming the subject of the inquiry was proper, was not so framed as to probe for the existence of cause for disqualification which is the sole purpose of the <em>voir dire </em>examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 167 A.2d 96. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">\u201cEven if a juror had formed or expressed an opinion as to the adequacies or inadequacies of jury verdicts in negligence cases, that fact would not have disqualified him. A juror to be competent need not be devoid of all beliefs and convictions. All that may be required of him is that he shall be \u2022without bias or prejudice for or against the parties to the cause and possess an open mind to the end that he may hear and consider the evidence produced and render a fair and impartial verdict thereon. <em>Garlitz v. State, </em>71 Md. 293, 18 Atl. 39 (1880). Moreover, since the question was in the nature of a \u2018fishing\u2019 expedition condemned by us in other cases \u2014 see, for example, <em>Emery v. F.P. Asher, Jr., &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>196 Md. 1, 75 A.2d 333 (1950)\u2014the denial of it by the trial court was clearly not an abuse of its wide discretion in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Jones v. Federal Paper Bd. Co., </em>252 Md. 475, 250 A.2d 653 (1969), the plaintiffs contended that the court had erred in declining to present several <em>voir dire </em>questions to the jury, the fourth of which parallels the questions posed here: \u201cHave any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of you read any articles or advertising in periodical publications which tend to indicate a relationship between the amounts of personal injury verdicts and increases in insurance premiums?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492-93, 250 A.2d 653. The Court of Appeals held that <em>voir dire </em>is within the discretion of the trial court, and that it was not an abuse of that discretion to refuse to ask the questions sought by the plaintiffs there, particularly in light of the fact that the questions would bring into a personal injury trial the issue of insurance coverage. Similar principles have been applied in <em>Cardin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 200, 533 A.2d 928 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 126, 538 A.2d 777, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 827, 109 S.Ct. 78, 102 L.Ed.2d 55, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>488 U.S. 935, 109 S.Ct. 331, 102 L.Ed.2d 348 (1988), and <em>Williams v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 411, 550 A.2d 722 (1988) , <em>aff'd, </em>316 Md. 677, 561 A.2d 216 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The other Maryland cases relied on by appellants are distinguishable. In <em>Morris v. Weddington, </em>320 Md. 674, 579 A.2d 762 (1990), the Court was concerned with the validity of a jury verdict that appeared to have been affected by jurors\u2019 concerns about insurance coverage. That case has nothing to do with the discretion of a court in asking or not asking <em>voir dire </em>questions. <em>Wilson v. Morris, </em>317 Md. 284, 563 A.2d 392 (1989), involved evidence of bias warranting <em>voir dire </em>of a juror after the jury had been empaneled. In <em>Wilson, </em>the plaintiff actually overheard one of the jurors discussing his bias in a hallway before the jury was empaneled but did not report the matter to the court until after opening arguments. The Court held that the trial court erred by not conducting further <em>voir dire </em>of that juror, even though trial had already begun. The key difference is that that case involved actual evidence of juror bias, clearly justifying further investigation of attitudes and ability to be impartial. There was no such evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">A few of our sister States have taken a more liberal approach and allowed questions such as those requested here, at least where (1) a proper foundation has been laid, and (2) the questions relate specifically to an identified advertising campaign conducted by the insurance industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In <em>Borkoski v. Yost, </em>182 Mont. 28, 594 P.2d 688 (1979), the plaintiffs in a medical malpractice action offered pre-trial evidence of a national advertising campaign by certain insurance companies, including the one insuring the defendants. The gist of the advertisements was that large jury awards result in higher insurance premiums and that, when awarding damages in liability cases, a jury should be cautioned that \u201cmoney does not grow on trees\u201d and that awards \u201cmust be paid through insurance premiums from uninvolved parties, such as yourselves.\u201d The advertisements described certain \u201cwindfall\u201d jury verdicts and urged juries to help clean up the \u201cmess.\u201d <em>Id. </em>594 P.2d at 689. The plaintiff sought, on <em>voir dire, </em>to determine whether any of the jurors had been exposed to, or were aware of, this campaign \u201cdirected particularly at prospective jurors\u201d and \u201ccomplained on appeal of the denial of its request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Montana Supreme Court first noted, 594 P.2d at 690, that, in Montana, the purpose of <em>voir dire </em>is to enable counsel to determine the existence of bias and prejudice \u201cand to enable counsel to exercise intelligently his peremptory challenges.\u201d In Maryland, of course, <em>voir dire </em>is directed solely to discovering a basis for challenging jurors for cause and not to assist counsel in the exercise of peremptory challenges. <em>Miles v. State, 88 </em>Md.App. 360, 594 A.2d 1208, <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 94, 599 A.2d 447 (1991); <em>Davis v. State, supra, </em>93 Md.App. 89, 611 A.2d 1008. Notwithstanding this enlarged function of <em>voir dire </em>examination, the Montana Court was concerned about the implicit injection into the case of the existence of insurance coverage and had to balance that against the right under that State\u2019s law to discover a basis for either a peremptory challenge or a challenge for cause. It noted a split of authority among the then-existing cases, some refusing to permit such questions, some expressly allowing them, and some leaving it within the trial court\u2019s discretion. In some of the cases, the Court observed, the allowance of questions of this type depended on whether a preliminary showing had been made of a clear likelihood of prejudice. In that regard, the <em>Borkoski </em>Court quoted from an Oregon case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Johnson v. Hansen, </em>237 Or. 1, 389 P.2d 330 (1964), where such an inquiry was held to be improper. In reaching that conclusion, the Oregon Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\"><em>\u201cIn the case at bar there was no preliminary showing of any fact that might have made relevant an inquiry concerning bias arising out of the relationship of verdicts and insurance premiums. </em>Where a line of questioning obviously is going to open up prejudicial speculation, e.g., of a racial, religious, political or other emotionally charged nature, the exploration of which .will manifestly incite similar speculation upon the part of listening jurors, counsel must be prepared to show the need which might make such inquiry relevant, or run the risk of an immediate mistrial. Insurance matters should be handled with the same safeguards. <em>In the case before us counsel did not advise the court of the existence of recent institutional advertising, or of other current propaganda calculated to produce bias upon the part of jurors in the local court.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>389 P.2d at 331, quoted in <em>Borkoski, </em>594 P.2d at 694 (emphasis in Borkoski).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The <em>Borkoski </em>Court recounted that counsel for Borkoski <em>did </em>present evidence of \u201crecent institutional advertising by the very insurance companies involved in the case; advertising carried in popular national magazines about the time of the drawing of the jury panel; advertising calculated to produce bias upon the part of jurors against awarding large amounts of damages to personal injury plaintiffs such as Borkoski.\u201d <em>Id. </em>594 P.2d at 694. Under that circumstance, the Court held, inquiry to discover bias should be permitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cWhen insurance companies inject the issue of insurance into the consciousness of every potential juror through a high priced advertising campaign, as has been illustrated in this case, they threaten every plaintiffs right to an impartial jury---- In such cases, it is only fair that attorneys have some means to secure this right for their clients. Liberal voir dire is the best means to this end.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Insofar as we can tell, the courts are still somewhat divided with respect to permitting this line of inquiry. Some courts continue to disallow questions of this type or find no abuse of discretion when the trial court does not permit them. <em>See Bohner v. Stine, </em>316 Pa.Super. 426, 463 A.2d 438 (1983); and cases cited in <em>Borkoski, </em>594 P.2d at 692; also <em>Russo v. Birrenkott, </em>770 P.2d 1335 (Colo.Ct.App.1988). Florida leaves it in the discretion of the trial judge, but it is important to note that Florida has abandoned its rule against the jury being informed of insurance coverage. <em>See Purdy v. Gulf Breeze Enterprises, Inc., </em>403 So.2d 1325 (Fla.1981). Other states that have permitted such questions generally follow the <em>Borkoski </em>approach of either allowing <em>voir dire </em>to assist in the exercise of peremptory challenges, or requiring a preliminary showing of recent advertisements by insurance companies directed at potential jurors, or both. <em>See King v. Westlake, </em>264 Ark. 555, 572 S.W.2d 841 (1978); <em>Sutherlin v. Fenenga, </em>111 N.M. 767, 810 P.2d 353 (App.1991); <em>Babcock v. Northwest Memorial Hosp., </em>767 S.W.2d 705 (Tex.1989); <em>Doe v. Hafen, </em>772 P.2d 456 (Utah App.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>800 P.2d 1105 (Utah 1990); <em>Evans by and through Evans v. Doty, </em>824 P.2d 460 (Utah App.1991); <em>McCroskey v. Proctor, </em>175 W.Va. 345, 332 S.E.2d 646 (1985); <em>Wardell v. McMillan, </em>844 P.2d 1052 (Wyo.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Maryland, as we have observed, has, up to this point, regarded the function of <em>voir dire </em>as discovering disqualifying information that would support challenges for cause, and not for assisting in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Additionally, unlike in some other States, the Maryland Court of Appeals has taken a firm stand against a plaintiff injecting into a case the probable existence of insurance coverage. <em>Morris v. Weddington, supra, </em>320 Md. 674, 579 A.2d 762, and cases cited therein. The context in which the issue must be considered is therefore somewhat different in this State than in Montana or some of the other States following a <em>Borkoski </em>analysis. We also have the precedential effect <em>of Kujawa, supra, </em>224 Md. 195, 167 a.2d 96, and <em>Jones, supra, </em>252 Md. 475, 250 A.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>We need not consider here whether, with that background, we would be authorized to adopt the <em>Borkoski </em>approach, for, even if we were, the record in this case would not establish error on the part of the trial court. In <em>Borkoski, </em>the inquiry was allowed with respect to specific articles recently published by insurance companies and aimed at potential jurors. The questions proposed here were, with one exception, far more general. The most narrowly drawn called attention to President Bush\u2019s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, the text of which was not presented to the trial court. This was not something generated by insurance companies; nor was it apparently directed at potential jurors, admonishing them, in their own self-interest, to limit damage awards. These proposed questions, in other words, were not proper even under a <em>Borkoski </em>approach, and were clearly not required under the current state of Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We also see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to permit Question 5, asking whether prospective jurors would be biased \u201cbecause you are a taxpayer in Baltimore City or because you or a close relative or friend works or worked for the City.\u201d This was clearly covered in the questions asked by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
