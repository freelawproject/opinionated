Dudley, appeals from the entry of summary judgment against her and in favor of appellee, Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company (BG &amp; E), by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Ward, J.). Until March 18, 1989, Ms. Dudley resided at 4300 Fairview Avenue in Baltimore City; since 1963, she had purchased gas from BG &amp; E. Ms. Dudley left her home on the afternoon of March 18, 1989. When she returned that evening her home had been totally demolished by fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">On April 4, 1991, Ms. Dudley filed a five-count complaint against BG &amp; E in the circuit court. She alleged that BG &amp; E was negligent in \u201cfailing to properly select, maintain, test and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>inspect its meter box, gas piping and appurtenances ... and in failing to warn [her] of the dangerous condition of same\u201d (Count 1); that BG <em>&amp; </em>E was strictly liable to her because it provided \u201cgas piping, a meter box and natural gas which were defective and in an unreasonably dangerous condition in that the gas was flammable and highly explosive and the pipes, appurtenances and meter box were faulty, deteriorated and subject to leaking (Count 2); that BG &amp; E breached its implied warranty to deliver gas in a safe and effective manner (Count 3); that BG &amp; E breached its contract to supply her with gas in a safe and effective manner (Count 4); and finally that BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s placement \u201cwithin its land, property and piping system highly volatile and explosive natural gas\u201d subjected it to \u201cliability without fault\u201d (Count 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">BG &amp; E answered the complaint and the parties engaged in discovery for a number of months. Ms. Dudley conceded in deposition that prior to March 18, 1989, she never had any problems with natural gas leaks in her home, never smelled the odor of natural gas in or around her house, never notified BG &amp; E of any gas leaks in or around her house, did not know of any neighbors who had notified BG &amp; E of any gas leaks in the area of her house, and did not recall ever observing BG &amp; E employees working in the area around her house. BG &amp; E\u2019s corporate designee testified in his deposition that BG &amp; E records indicated \u201cno calls for gas leaks at any of the homes of the 4300 block of Fairview Avenue were received\u201d at any time during the week before the explosion. Another BG &amp; E official confirmed that BG &amp; E records for a \u201cfive year period\u201d prior to the accident indicate BG &amp; E \u201chas no record of a call for a gas leak at any of the houses in the 4300 block of Fairview Avenue prior to the March 18, 1989 occurrence at issue.\u201d The Baltimore City Fire Department\u2019s fire investigation report stated that the first officer on the scene found \u201cheavy blue flames from the front of the basement and the walls were already down\u201d and that \u201cit is the opinion of this investigator there was a natural gas leak in the area of the gas meter, which over a period of time built up in the basement ceiling and upper <em>regions of </em>the house.\u201d The report of a BG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>&amp; E customer service supervisor stated that after the fire a test \u201con the existing service and metal installation ... indicated a slight gas leak.\u201d Other facts are set forth -within as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">On November 4, 1992, BG &amp; E moved for summary judgment; Ms. Dudley opposed the motion. On December 28, 1992, the circuit court issued an order granting the motion. Ms. Dudley raises five questions on appeal, one paralleling each of the five counts of her complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">1. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiffs claims that BG &amp; E had been negligent when there were sufficient facts presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E failed to properly select, maintain, test and inspect its meter box, gas piping and appurtenances and failed to warn Dudley of the dangerous conditions of these components?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">2. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiffs claims that BG <em>&amp; </em>E should be held strictly liable when there were sufficient facts presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E furnished defective and unreasonably dangerous gas piping, meter box and natural gas which items were defective at the time they left the possession and control of BG &amp; E?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">3. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiffs claims that BG &amp; E breached its warranty when there were sufficient facts presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E failed to deliver gas in a safe and effective manner so as not to damage the plaintiffs property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">4. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiffs claims that BG &amp; E breached its contract when there were sufficient facts presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E failed to supply Dudley with natural gas in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>safe and effective manner so as not to damage her property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">5. Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiffs claims that BG <em>&amp; </em>E should be held liable without regard to fault when there were sufficient facts presented from which the jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E placed within its land, property and piping system highly volatile and explosive natural gas, permitted the artificial accumulation of natural gas within its property which escaped into the plaintiffs property causing an explosion and destroying Dudley\u2019s home and personal property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The circuit court did not issue an oral or written opinion in granting the summary judgment motion. Rather, its order stated in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">Upon consideration of Defendant Baltimore Gas and Electric Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, and any response filed thereto, it is this <em>28 </em>day of <em>December, </em>1992</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">ORDERED, by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, that said Motion for Summary Judgment regarding the Plaintiffs Complaint is hereby GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Costs assessed to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Although it would be preferable to have the benefit of the circuit court\u2019s rationale as to why summary judgment was proper here, in the absence of any such explanation, \u201cwe must assume that the circuit court carefully considered all of the asserted grounds and determined that all or at least enough of them as to merit the grant of summary judgment were meritorious.\u201d <em>Bond v. NIBCO, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 133, 623 A.2d 731 (1993). In reviewing a lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we determine whether the lower court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., </em>320 Md. <em>584, 592, 578 </em>A.2d 1202 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Ms. Dudley\u2019s first and principal contention is that the circuit court \u201cerred in concluding as a matter of law that there was insufficient evidence presented to raise a jury issue on [her] negligence claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">BG &amp; E asserts that because it had no notice of a gas leak in Ms. Dudley\u2019s house, under Maryland law, it has no liability to her for damage caused by the leak. There is no recent Maryland case involving the liability of a utility in a similar situation. Three early Court of Appeals cases, however, assertedly provide the basis for BG &amp; E\u2019s argument. In the first, <em>Consolidated Gas Co. v. Crocker, </em>82 Md. 113, 33 A. 423 (1895), the Court found that a gas company was negligent when it had been given notice of a gas leak and failed to resolve the problem. The <em>Crocker </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaB\">When a gas company is made aware, as in this case, that large quantities of gas are escaping into a building, it becomes its plain duty to use reasonable diligence to discover and to stop the leak. It cannot discharge that duty by assuming without knowing that the leak proceeds from one source, when, in fact, it proceeds from a totally different source which could have been discovered by proper inspection. <em>This rule requires nothing unreasonable </em>\u2014 it <em>does not require that the company shall keep up a constant inspection all along its lines, without reference to the existence or non-existence of aprobable cause for the occurrence of leaks or escapes of gas </em>\u2014 but it does require that when notice of ,the existence of a leak has been given to a company, the company shall use reasonable care to discover the cause of the leak and appropriate means to remedy it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 124, 33 A. 423 (emphasis added). Two years later in <em>Brady v. Consolidated Gas Co., </em>85 Md. 637, 37 A. 263 (1897), the Court used the <em>Crocker </em>dicta as the basis for holding that a gas company was not negligent as a matter of law when it was not given notice of a gas leak.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">It was not negligence on the part of the company to leave its pipes on the premises, nor does the fact that it made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>examination of the pipes raise any presumption of negligence, in the absence of any notice of the existence of any cause for an examination. Had there been such notice its duty would have been to have discovered the cause of the leak, and to have used proper means to remedy it. It was not required to keep up a constant inspection all along its lines, without reference to the existence or non-existence of a probable cause for the occurrence of leaks, or escape of gas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 642, 37 A. 263. <em>See also Consolidated Gas Co. v. Connor, </em>114 Md. 140, 151-52, 78 A 725 (1910) (when gas company was notified of a gas leak three or four days before inhalation of gas injured plaintiffs, sufficient evidence to show negligence on part of gas company).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Contrary to BG &amp; E\u2019s vigorous assertions, we do not believe that under Maryland law a plaintiff can recover against a gas supplier on a negligence theory only if the supplier had actual notice of a leak and failed to remedy the situation. Indeed, the language, if not the holdings, of the very cases upon which BG &amp; E so heavily relies is to the contrary. For example, although the <em>Crocker </em>court held that it was \u201cnot called on to go farther or to lay down a broader rule than this in the pending case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 125, 33 A. 423, it noted that a \u201csystem of inspection should be maintained as would insure reasonable promptness in the detection of all leaks that might occur from the deterioration of the material of the pipes, or from any other cause within the circumspection of men of ordinary skill in the business.\u201d <em>Crocker, </em>82 Md. at 123, 33 A. 423 (quoting <em>Koelsch v. Philadelphia Co., </em>152 Pa. 355, 25 A. 522 (1893)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Similarly, in <em>Connor, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that: The substance which the [gas company] manufactures and delivers to its consumers through its system of mains and connections is highly dangerous to persons and property, and the duty of the company is to use all reasonable precautions to confine this agency within the channels where it may be employed with safety and utility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Connor, </em>114 Md. at 154, 78 A. 725. The <em>Connor </em>court also quoted with approval a case holding that \u201cthe [gas] company ... owed a duty to all persons who might be injured by the gas to use ordinary and adequate care in delivering the substance into the residence in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 78 A. 725 (quoting <em>Richmond Gas Co. v. Baker, </em>146 Ind. 600, 45 N.E. 1049 (1897)). In sum, although the Court of Appeals has to date not directly addressed precisely a claim like that in the case at hand, the language in its cases clearly suggests that a supplier of natural gas has a duty to act reasonably in supplying natural gas to its customers. Therefore, a supplier could be charged with constructive notice if it failed to act reasonably in detecting a leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we note that, although ignored for the most part by the parties, there is a wealth of more recent out-of-state law supplementing the <em>Crocker, Brady, </em>and <em>Connor </em>decisions. Courts across the country impose upon gas companies an obligation to act with reasonable care in the delivery of their services. <em>See, e.g., Auriemme v. Bridgeport Gas. Co., </em>144 A.2d 701, 702, 144 A.2d 701 (Conn.Super.Ct.1958); <em>Pappas v. Peoples Gas Light &amp; Coke Co., </em>350 Ill.App. 541, 113 N.E.2d 585, 589 (1953). Variously articulated as due care, great care, or high degree of care, the standard is that of ordinary care given the dangerous propensities of gas. <em>See, e.g., Herbst v. Northern States Power Co., </em>432 N.W.2d 463, 467 (Minn.Ct.App.1988) (finding that a gas company had \u201ca high duty of care, proportionate to the great danger associated with maintaining a gas transmission pipeline\u201d); <em>Karle v. National Fuel Gas Distrib. Corp., </em>448 F.Supp. 753, 759 (W.D.Pa.1978); <em>Fields v. Western Kentucky Gas Co., </em>478 S.W.2d 20, 22 (Ky.1972); <em>Lewis v. Vermont Gas Corp., </em>121 Vt. 168, 151 A.2d 297, 306 (1959); <em>Everly v. Columbia Gas of West Virginia, </em>171 W.Va. 534, 301 S.E.2d 165, 168 (1982); <em>see also </em>38 C.J.S. <em>Gas </em>\u00a7 42a (1943 &amp; 1993 Cum.Supp.). Certainly once a gas company has notice of defects in gas lines or even in a customer\u2019s appliances, it has a duty to repair the defects or shut off the gas. <em>Reed v. Smith Lumber Co., </em>165 W.Va. 415, 268 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Although actual knowledge of a problem, such as the smell of gas or prior repairs in the same section of pipe, may require a gas company to take additional action in order to act reasonably, the duty to exercise ordinary care exists at all times in the delivery of gas. <em>Karle, </em>448 F.Supp. at 759. Absent actual notice, for example, a gas company must still use reasonable care in the inspection and maintenance of its lines. <em>Id. </em>at 759, 762; <em>Fields, </em>478 S.W.2d at 23 (stating that gas company has \u201cthe duty of reasonable inspection and maintenance according to the circumstances of the particular case\u201d); <em>Pioneer Natural Gas Co. v. K &amp; M Paving Co., </em>374 S.W.2d 214, 218 (Tex.1963); <em>Lewis, </em>151 A.2d at 306. There must, however, be a showing that the gas company knew or should have known that there was a problem with its equipment. <em>Carlile-Doughty Corp. v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>210 Pa.Super. 117, 232 A.2d 631, 633 (1967). <em>See also </em>L.S. Tellier, Annotation, <em>Liability of Gas Company for Injury or Damage Due to Defects in Service Lines on Consumer\u2019s Premises, </em>26 A.L.R.2d 136 (1952); B. Finberg, Annotation, <em>Liability of Gas Company for Personal Injury or Property Damage Caused by Gas Escaping from mains in Street, </em>96 A.L.R.2d 1007 (1964); and 38 C.J.S. <em>Gas </em>\u00a7\u00a7 38, 40-42 (1943 &amp; 1993 Cum.Supp.) for further discussion of gas companies\u2019 liability for harm caused by escaping gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Finally, some courts have held that compliance with relevant State and federal statutes and regulations may be considered in determining whether a gas company has acted reasonably. For example, it has been held that there was sufficient evidence to uphold a jury\u2019s finding that the defendant gas company had made a thorough inspection to discover leaks when it followed federal mandates as to the method of inspection and, in fact, inspected more frequently than required. <em>See Gray v. Enserch, Inc., </em>665 S.W.2d 601, 604 (Tex.Ct.App.1984); <em>see also Kearney v. Kansas Pub. Serv. Co., </em>233 Kan. 492, 665 P.2d 757, 766 (1983) (holding that trial court was correct to exclude evidence of gas company\u2019s compliance with state and federal regulations, including those promulgated under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act, where there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>no showing of which sections were complied with and that they were relevant to the alleged negligence). With these principles in mind, we turn to the specific claims of negligence made by Ms. Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Her first argument is based on alleged violations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The Act authorizes and requires the Secretary of Transportation to \u201cestablish minimum Federal safety standards for the transportation of gas and pipeline facilities. Such standards may apply to the design, installation, inspection, emergency plans and procedures, testing, construction, extension, operation, replacement, and maintenance of pipeline facilities.\u201d 49 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1672(a) (1988). Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary promulgated 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.457, which establishes \u201cexternal corrosion control\u201d standards for pipelines that, like those at issue here, were installed before August 1, 1971. That regulation states, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">(b) Except for cast iron or ductile iron, each of the following buried or submerged pipelines installed before August 1, 1971, must be cathodically protected in accordance with this subpart <em>in areas in which active corrosion is found:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(1) Bare or ineffectively coated transmission lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">(2) Bare or coated pipes at compressor, regulator, and measuring stations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">(3) Bare or coated distribution lines. The operator shall determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where electrical survey is impractical, <em>by the study of corrosion and leak history records, by leak detection survey, </em>or by other means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">(c) For the purpose of this subpart, active corrosion means continuing corrosion which, unless controlled, could result in a condition that is detrimental to public safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.457 (1992) (emphasis added). Ms. Dudley asserts that BG &amp; E was negligent in failing to inspect for areas of \u201cactive corrosion\u201d in order to determine whether cathodically protected piping was required. The federal regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>lation requires that cathodically protected piping be used \u201cin areas in which active corrosion is found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Areas of active corrosion may be detected, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cby the study of corrosion and leak history records, by leak detection survey, or by other means.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In uncontroverted deposition testimony, BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s corporate designees explained the pipeline inspection procedures undertaken by BG &amp; E to ascertain corrosion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">Q. Let\u2019s move on with these enumerated questions so we can follow the script for a while. Number 16, did you make regular inspections of the mains, service pipes, connections, or valves prior to March 18, 1989?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">[A], Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">Q. Can you tell me how frequently you made inspection of the main, service pipes, valves and other connections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">[A]. <em>Our records indicate that leak surveys were conducted on January U, 1977, November 16, 1982, October 26th, 1985, and again on March 22, 1988.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">Q. What was the thrust of these leak surveys, what was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">[A]. The main and services were leak surveyed using hydrogen flame ionization equipment <em>as required by federal law.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">Q. Can you describe that procedure for us ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">[A]. The main is driven over with a very sensitive instrument that will pick up gas in parts per million, the service lines are walked over with a similar hand-held instrument to pick up leaking gas at the rate of 50 parts per million. The mains and services were surveyed in 1988 and no leakage was found. They are surveyed every three years as [required by] DOT standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">Q. Is there \u2014 are you telling me that all of these mains and specifically that the Dudley service pipe was in fact surveyed in 1988?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>[A]. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Thus, it is undisputed that BG &amp; E conducted a \u201cleak detection survey.\u201d It is also, as noted above, undisputed that there was no leak history for the Dudley residence, nor for any buildings in the area of that residence. Accordingly, the uncontroverted testimony is that BG &amp; E' has complied with the federal regulation by determining where active corrosion exists by use of \u201cleak history reports,\u201d and a \u201cleak detection survey.\u201d Of course, as Ms. Dudley asserts, compliance with statutory requirements will not prevent a finding of negligence where a reasonable person would take additional precautions. <em>Leonard v. Sav-A-Stop Servs., </em>289 Md. 204, 212, 424 A.2d 336 (1981). <em>Cf. Honolulu Ltd. v. Cain, </em>244 Md. 590, 598, 224 A.2d 433 (1966) (conformity to industry standards is not conclusive of non-negligence). The uncontroverted evidence here, however, suggests no reason why a reasonable person in BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s position should have taken additional precautions to determine where active corrosion exists. Of course, the whole discussion of underground pipe leak detection is a bit of a red herring. There is no suggestion that the fire/explosion originated with an underground leak \u2014 Ms. Dudley had to rely on a theory that the leak was at the meter \u2014 inside the house \u2014 not in an area of corrosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Ms. Dudley further argues that summary judgment with regard to the negligence count was error because \u201cmaterial facts ... are in dispute [that] relate to BG &amp; E\u2019s policies which required their meters to be replaced every 14 years.\u201d Ms. Dudley, in affidavit, testified that her gas meter was never replaced from 1963 to March 18, 1989. A BG &amp; E employee asserted in affidavit, which was substantiated by attached company records, that the meter in Ms. Dudley\u2019s house at the time of the fire, has been \u201ctaken from 247 St. Helena Avenue to BG &amp; E\u2019s meter shop on December 11, 1967 where it was tested and then installed at [Ms. Dudley\u2019s] address on January 17, 1968.\u201d Ms. Dudley asserts that this factual dispute is a material one precluding summary judgment. A material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>is one that will in some way affect the outcome of the case. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). \u201cA dispute as to a fact \u2018relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a material fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 242-43, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992) (quoting <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 40, 300 A.2d 367 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">There is surely a factual dispute here. It is, however, not material for two reasons. First, the regulation assertedly violated here was designed not to protect consumers but to assure the accuracy of the meters; and second, there is no legal requirement that every gas meter be replaced, or even tested, every 14 years. The regulations on which Ms. Dudley relies provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">.07 Periodic Test Program</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">A. Periodic Test Requirements.

The Commission\u2019s <em>in-service performance test program is designed to automatically adjust the number of meters required to be tested by a utility based solely on the performance of the utility\u2019s meters.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>C. In-Service Performance Test Schedule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(1) Group 1 Meters. The <em>percentage of the total number of in-service Group I meters </em>required to be tested will be determined by the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">M = 2.5 - 0.25 (100-OK) for values of OK between 75 and 100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">M = 0.35 (100-OK) for values of OK below 75.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">Where M = Percentage of meters required to be tested. 20.55.07.08 Public Service Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">OK = Percentage of meters tested during last calendar year with proof between 98 and 102 at check flow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">COMAE 20.55.07.07 and 20.55.07.08 (emphasis added). Thus, the stated purpose of the Periodic Test Program was to \u201cassure\u201d the \u201caccuracy\u201d of the \u201cmeters\u201d and \u201cassociated devices,\u201d not their safety. See COMAE 20.55.07.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Moreover, a BG &amp; E representative provided sworn, uncontroverted, testimony that the company elected to test meters in accordance with the In-Service Performance Test Program. (Contrary to Ms. Dudley\u2019s claims, the BG &amp; E employee who stated that Ms. Dudley\u2019s meter had been replaced in 1968 did not state that BG &amp; E had elected the Periodic Test Program.) The In Service Performance Test Program, unlike the Periodic Test Program, does not require that BG &amp; E replace every meter at least once every 14 years. Eather, the In Service Performance Test Program provides a formula by which BG &amp; E is to determine how many meters within a specified grouping must be tested; those, and only those, meters are then selected at random while in service and tested. COMAE 20.55.07.08. For these reasons then, the question of whether BG &amp; E has replaced Ms. Dudley\u2019s meter in the last 14 years, or ever, is not a dispute that will \u201caffect the outcome of [this] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Ms. Dudley also alleged that BG <em>&amp; </em>E had a \u201cduty to warn her of the dangerous condition\u201d of \u201cits meter box, gas piping and appurtenances.\u201d Ms. Dudley claims,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>[T]he defendant clearly had a continuing legal duty to warn of potential safety hazards which it became aware of after initial installation of the service pipe. <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 446, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). There is no evidence that the defendant ever warned any occupant of the Dudley property about the propensity towards corrosion in uncoated steel pipes....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>Zenobia, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[generally, a manufacturer of a defective product has a duty to warn of product defects which the manufacturer discovers after the time of sale.\u201d <em>Zenobia, </em>325 Md. at 446, 601 A.2d 633. A manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn, however, only arises where there is a \u201creasonable probability of injury unless warning is given.\u201d <em>Katz v. Arundel-Brooks Concrete Corp., </em>220 Md. 200, 204, 151 A.2d 731 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">BG &amp; E is not the manufacturer or even the seller of Ms. Dudley\u2019s \u201cmeter box, gas piping and appurtenances;\u201d thus, no duty to warn was generated with respect to them. Ms. Dudley seems to suggest that, because metal pipes are susceptible to corrosion, this trait alone requires BG <em>&amp; </em>E to warn consumers that the pipes might leak. Ms. Dudley claims that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">[t]he evidence, and the reasonable inferences which might be drawn therefrom, establishes that BG &amp; E was aware at the time it installed the service pipes to 4300 Fairview that the pipes were subject to corrosive forces. It was further aware that over time the corrosive forces can break down the metal pipes which will result in leaking---- The service pipe installed at 4300 Fairview in 1951 was a steel pipe which did not contain any coating which would resist the corrosive forces. Where BG &amp; E knows or should know that the artificial condition created by it involves an unreasonable risk of physical harm to others, then it has a duty to make safe or warn of the dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">(internal citations to record omitted). This might be true had BG &amp; E not taken any steps to determine if the metal pipes were corroded. But, in fact, BG &amp; E conducted leak detection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>surveys and studied leak history reports as required by federal law to determine this. Neither the surveys nor the reports indicated any corrosion or leak in the area around Ms. Dudley\u2019s home. Clearly the duty to warn cannot arise without some knowledge, actual or constructive, of the hazard that allegedly existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Nor do the out-of-state cases on which Ms. Dudley relies provide support for her duty to warn claim. Those cases, <em>Caldecott v. Long Island Lighting Co., </em>417 F.2d 994, 995 (2d Cir.1969), <em>Karle v. National Fuel Gas Distrib. Corp., </em>448 F.Supp. 753, 764 (W.D.Pa.1978), and <em>Daugherty v. Nebraska Natural Gas Co., </em>173 Neb. 30, 112 N.W.2d 790, 792-93 (1961), involve situations where a gas company had actual notice of an earlier leak or odor that indicated a leak, which preceded the later, more serious, leak that formed the basis for the lawsuit. The out-of-state cases all impute a greater duty of care once a gas company has some advance notice that a leak in a specified area has occurred. Of course, BG &amp; E had no similar advance notice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Ms. Dudley also claims that BG &amp; E was negligent because it failed to comply with federal regulations regarding the placement of meters in a ventilated place and in installing its underground service lines. <em>See </em>49 CFR \u00a7 192.353 (1992) (meters \u201cmust be installed in a readily accessible location [,] ... be protected from corrosion [,] ... be located in a ventilated place and not less than 3 feet from any source of ignition or any source of heat which might damage the meter\u201d) and 49 CFR \u00a7 192.361(e)(1992) (each underground service line must \u201c[b]e sealed in the foundation wall to prevent leakage.\u201d). BG <em>&amp; </em>E did not, and does not, assert that violation of these federal regulations does not constitute negligence. That argument was not before the circuit court and is not before us. Rather, what BG &amp; E asserts, and asserted below, is that the meter at Ms. Dudley\u2019s residence was properly installed and the service lines were properly sealed. In support of this argument, BG &amp; E attached to its memorandum in support of summary judgment photographs of the meter assertedly showing the meter\u2019s placement in an open, ventilated space, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and of the service line, assertedly showing that it was properly sealed. Ms. Dudley claims that, \u201c[t]hese photographs, without any amplifying testimony, fail to show as a matter of law that BG &amp; E complied with these regulations. The trial court erred in not permitting these photographs to be considered by the trier of fact since reasonable minds could reach a different conclusion on these issues. <em>McLhinney v. Lansdell Corp. of Md., </em>254 Md. 7, 254 A.2d 177 (1969).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Ms. Dudley is correct. We have carefully examined the original photographs in the record. They were not submitted under oath, or identified, let alone explained, in deposition by any BG &amp; E witness. Nor were these photographs obtained from or vouched for by Ms. Dudley. <em>Compare Bond v. NIBCO, supra, </em>96 Md.App. at 142, 623 A.2d 731 (summary judgment movant relied on document obtained in discovery from opposing party). Moreover, the photographs do not show by themselves the meter and the surrounding area with sufficient clarity to enable a court to determine, as a matter of law, that there was sufficient ventilation. The photographs do not by themselves clearly show to an untrained eye that the pipe was properly sealed as a matter of law. Indeed, all that the photographs show is a pipe leading into a wall. On these limited issues then, we must reverse the grant of summary judgment on the negligence count.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Ms. Dudley next asserts that BG &amp; E should be held strictly liable for the damage to her property, and that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment to BG &amp; E on this claim. The Court of Appeals has held that strict liability, as defined in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A (1965), can be a basis for tort recovery in Maryland. <em>See Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976). Section 402A provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u00a7 402A. Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(1) One who <em>sells </em>any product in a <em>defective condition </em>unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">(emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In order to recover on a strict liability claim, a plaintiff must prove: \u201c(1) the existence of a defect, (2) the attribution of the defect to a \u2018seller\u2019, and (3) a causal relation between the defect and the injury.\u201d <em>Loh v. Safeway Stores, </em>47 Md.App. 110, 121, 422 A.2d 16 (1980) (citation omitted); <em>see also Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 135, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985). In <em>Klein v. Sears Roebuck, </em>92 Md.App. 477, 608 A.2d 1276, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 446, 447, 614 A.2d 973 (1992), we elaborated on the necessity of proving a defect in the product:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Basically, to recover in a strict liability case, a plaintiff need not prove any specific act of negligence; he must merely prove that <em>the product was in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous at the time it was sold. </em>The defect may be one that occurred in the manufacturing process, in which case the product does not conform to the manufacturer\u2019s own standards, or it may be a defect in design, in which case what proves to be a defect was actually intended by the manufacturer. With respect to the former, the focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer; with respect to the latter, the inquiry focuses on the product itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 608 A.2d 1276 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Ms. Dudley alleges that the natural gas supplied by BG &amp; E was \u201cdefective and in an unreasonably dangerous condition in that the gas was flammable and highly explosive.\u201d This claim is meritless. No defect in natural gas caused it to be \u201cflammable and highly explosive.\u201d Flammability and explosiveness are intrinsic to the nature of natural gas. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>claim that the gas supplied by BG &amp; E was defective and unreasonably dangerous because it is flammable and highly explosive is equivalent to asserting that a kitchen knife is defective and unreasonably dangerous because it is sharp and can cut things. This argument is really more properly articulated in Ms. Dudley\u2019s fifth count, which we discuss, <em>infra </em>\u00a7 v, that BG &amp; E should be held liable without fault because the provision of natural gas is an \u201cinherently dangerous activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Ms. Dudley, however, also alleges in her strict liability count that \u201cthe gas piping\u201d and \u201cmeter box\u201d were \u201cdefective ... in that\u201d that were \u201cfaulty, deteriorated and subject to leaking.\u201d She further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">On or about March 18, 1989, <em>the piping and meter box supplied by Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company </em>began to leak natural gas into the Dudley residence in such volume as to cause an explosion demolishing the house and its contents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[BG &amp; E] <em>provided to [Ms. Dud,ley] gas piping, a meter box </em>and natural gas which were defective and in an unreasonably dangerous condition in that the gas was flammable and highly explosive, <em>and the pipes, appurtenances and meter box were faulty, deteriorated and subject to leaking. </em>[Ms. Dudley] was unaware of the defective condition of <em>the items supplied for her use </em>and had no means to inspect or determine that the items were in a dangerous condition. <em>The items supplied for use were defective at the time they left the possession and control of [BG &amp; E].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">(emphasis added). Thus, Ms. Dudley, with carefully chosen words, argues that BG &amp; E is strictly liable for defects in certain \u201citems supplied\u201d to her by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The essential problem with this allegation is that strict liability, as articulated in \u00a7 402A, is applicable only to <em>sellers, i.e., </em>\u201cany person engaged in the business of <em>selling </em>products for use or consumption.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. f (1965) (emphasis added). BG &amp; E is engaged in the business of selling gas to its customers; it is not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>business of selling gas pipes or gas meters to its customers. Natural gas is the product that BG &amp; E sells, and, it must be that product that is defective in order for strict liability to attach here. The defective condition of the \u201citems supplied,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the pipes, meter, lines, etc. is not a basis for strict liability because those products were not <em>sold </em>to Ms. Dudley by BG &amp; E. Strict liability contemplates a \u201csale;\u201d thus, Ms. Dudley cannot recover on a strict liability theory of defective manufacture of these other \u201citems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Accordingly, Ms. Dudley\u2019s strict liability claim was properly disposed of by the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">(in)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Next, Ms. Dudley asserts that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to BG <em>&amp; </em>E on her claim of breach of warranty. In her complaint, Ms. Dudley alleged that BG &amp; E impliedly warranted the delivery of gas in a safe and effective manner so as not to damage [the plaintiffs] property.\u201d The warranty BG <em>&amp; </em>E allegedly breached was an implied warranty of merchantability, provided for in the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) as adopted in Md.Code (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-314 of the Commercial Law Article. That statute provides, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">Unless excluded or modified ... a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to <em>goods of </em>that kind,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqO\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In order to state a cause of action for breach of implied warranty, Ms. Dudley must demonstrate a defect in the product supplied \u2014 here, the natural gas \u2014 such that it was not fit for its usual purpose. <em>See Giant Food, Inc. v. Washington Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>273 Md. 592, 607-609, 332 A.2d 1 (1975). As we have explained above, it is alleged that the natural gas supplied to Ms. Dudley was defective because it was \u201cflammable and highly explosive;\u201d these, however, are not defects of natural gas but qualities intrinsic to non-defective natural gas. No other defect in the gas is alleged. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ingly, Ms. Dudley has not alleged a cause of action for breach of implied warranty; judgment to BG &amp; E on this count was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In her penultimate count, Ms. Dudley alleges that she contracted with BG &amp; E <em>\u201cfor </em>the provision of natural gas to her residence and paid for the services rendered on a monthly basis.\u201d She further alleges that \u201c[i]mplicit in [her] contract [with BG <em>&amp; </em>E] was the understanding and agreement that [BG <em>&amp; </em>E] would supply natural gas to [her] in a safe and effective manner so as not to damage her property.... [that BG <em>&amp; </em>E] breached its contract in that it delivered the gas through defective pipes, meter boxes and other appurtenances.... \u201d BG <em>&amp; </em>E answered the complaint generally denying \u201cany liability for the claims made in the complaint.\u201d Neither in its motion for summary judgment nor in the two memoranda filed in support of that motion, however, did BG &amp; E even address this claim. Moreover, BG <em>&amp; </em>E makes no argument in this Court as to why it should have been granted summary judgment on this claim. Accordingly, the factual allegations set forth in this count of complaint are totally unrebutted. The grant of summary judgment as to it was, thus, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Finally, Ms. Dudley alleges that the circuit court erred in granting BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s motion for summary judgment on her claim that BG <em>&amp; </em>E should be held liable without regard to fault because \u201csufficient facts were presented from which a jury could reasonably conclude that BG &amp; E placed within its land, property and piping system highly volatile and explosive natural gas, permitted the artificial accumulation of natural gas within its property which escaped into the Dudley residence causing an explosion and destroying her home and personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The liability without fault doctrine Ms. Dudley relies upon here is a form of strict liability. This claim is identical to Ms. Dudley\u2019s earlier assertion, considered in part (ii) within, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>BG <em>&amp; </em>E should be held strictly hable for the damage to her property. The former claim involves an allegation that the products sold to Ms. Dudley were unreasonably dangerous because of a defect, either in the manufacture or design of the product; this final claim in contrast, states that the activity of dehvering gas to consumers through a pipe distribution system is inherently dangerous, even without any defects in products, and simply cannot be performed safely. The strict liability doctrine for abnormally dangerous activities is set out in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519 and 520 (1977), which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u00a7 519. General Principle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">(1) One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity, although he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">(2) This strict liability is limited to the kind of harm, the possibility of which makes the activity abnormally dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u00a7 520. Abnormally Dangerous Activities</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">In determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, the following factors are to be considered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-15\">(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">There is, of course, some risk involved in distribution of gas through underground pipes and meters. It is not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>risk of a \u201chigh degree\u201d because federal and state regulations concerning corrosion, testing, gas leakage and inspection keep the possibilities of incidents to a minimum. Thus, the risk can, and has been, greatly eliminated through regulation and inspection. The resultant harm from an accident might be great in certain circumstances; however, in the majority of cases, the leak is detected and corrected before any injuries occur. On the other hand, distribution of gas is entirely appropriate and its value to the community is great. BG &amp; E provides over 550,000 people in the Baltimore area with natural gas as a source of heat and energy in their homes and businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><em>Yommer v. McKenzie, </em>255 Md. 220, 257 A.2d 138 (1969) is instructive. There, a plaintiff, who charged that a gasoline station that had installed a large underground gasoline storage tank in close proximity to his well, allowed gasoline to leak into his well and thereby damaged his property, was held to have stated a cause of action of strict liability. The Court of Appeals held that although the operation of a gas station did not involve a high degree of risk of injury to others, the placement of the tank in such close proximity to the plaintiffs well did involve such a risk. The Court went on to explain, in a footnote specifically adopting \u00a7 520, that \u201c[a]n activity is a matter of common usage if it is customarily carried on by the great mass of mankind, or by many people in the community.... Gas and electricity in household pipes and wires [are examples of common usage], as contrasted with large gas storage tanks or high tension power lines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225 n. 2, 257 A.2d 138 (quoting \u00a7 520 cmt. i). Thus, <em>Yommer, </em>suggests that the distribution and consumption of natural gas, through an underground pipe system, is a common usage. <em>See also, Voelker v. Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co., </em>727 F.Supp. 991 (D.Md.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Moreover, we have uncovered no case, in Maryland or any other jurisdiction, in which a natural gas utility company was held strictly liable for injuries based on the theory that the distribution of natural gas is an abnormally dangerous activity incapable of being carried out without significant risk. Many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cases specifically hold to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Auriemme v. Bridgeport Gas Co., </em>21 Conn.Supp. 66, 144 A.2d 701 (Conn.Super.1958) (distinguishing natural gas distribution from the category of other activities, including natural gas storage that have been held inherently dangerous). <em>See also Zamora v. Mobil Oil Co., </em>104 Wash.2d 199, 704 P.2d 584, 587 (1985) (holding propane gas to be an inherently dangerous product); <em>New Meadows Holding Co. v. Washington Water Power Co., </em>102 Wash.2d 495, 687 P.2d 212, 217 (Wash.App.1984) (transmission of natural gas through underground lines is not an abnormally dangerous activity); <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Colorado, </em>676 P.2d 25, 27 (Colo.App.1983) (the storage of natural gas, as opposed to its distribution, is an inherently dangerous activity); <em>Noack v. B.L. Watters, Inc., </em>410 So.2d 1375, 1376 (Fla.App.1982) (installation of natural gas lines is an inherently dangerous activity). Thus, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to BG &amp; E on Ms. Dudley\u2019s claim of liability without fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In summary, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the fourth count (breach of contract), and that portion of the first count (negligence) in which Ms. Dudley alleged that BG <em>&amp; </em>E was negligent in its placement of the meter in an area that was not properly ventilated and in not fitting and sealing the pipes leading into her house in accordance with pertinent federal regulations. We affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
