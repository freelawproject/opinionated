We shall answer both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Daniel Courtney was an unemployed construction worker. His wife, Joanna, is a nurse, and for some period it was her earnings that helped to support the family, which also included two young children. Regrettably, Mr. Courtney had another source of income; he became involved in the trafficking of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On November 23, 1992, pursuant to a search warrant, the Harford County police seized from the Courtneys\u2019 home 35 pounds of marijuana, bonds and stock certificates (the value of which is not revealed in the record), $21,700 in cash, a handgun, and certain drug paraphernalia. Although the full record in the criminal case is not now before us, it appears that the State initially charged Daniel with a variety of drug offenses, including being a drug kingpin (Md.Code, art. 27, \u00a7 286(g)). Following his arrest, he was taken to the police station where, with the assistance of counsel, he and an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney began negotiating a plea agreement. Such an agreement was eventually arrived at a week later. The core of that agreement, from the State\u2019s point of view, was Daniel\u2019s cooperation in obtaining evidence \u201cagainst other defendants whose culpability is equal to or greater than that of [Daniel].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Undisputed evidence was subsequently presented that, in addition to insisting upon the forfeiture of certain property, the State wanted complete cooperation from Daniel in deciphering cryptic notes in documents seized from his home and with respect to both his suppliers and his customers. Daniel was generally willing to provide the cooperation demanded, including \u201csetting up\u201d drug deals with his suppliers, but he was unwilling to set up drug deals with his customers, whom he regarded as friends. That point was made clear by Daniel\u2019s attorney: \u201cWe indicated that was not on the table.\u201d After many hours of discussion, the parties agreed to specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>language, including that quoted above, which both Daniel and his attorney viewed as not requiring Daniel to set up controlled buys with respect to Daniel\u2019s customers, whose culpability would not be \u201cequal to or greater\u201d than Daniel\u2019s. There is no evidence that, at the time the agreement was signed, the State had any different view on that point. The final written agreement, which was signed on the evening of November 30, set forth Daniel\u2019s obligation to cooperate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">\u201cA. Daniel Courtney shall fully and truthfully respond to all questions put to him by any law enforcement authority. Specifically, he shall fully and truthfidly disclose to the State everything he knows concerning the distribution, sale, transportation and use of controlled dangerous substances, or any other information related to his supplier in Baltimore City and Texas. He will further provide information on individuals he supplied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">B. Daniel Courtney shall testify fully and truthfully before Grand Juries and at all trials or hearings resulting from or related to information provided by Daniel Courtney, or when his testimony may be relevant, in the opinion of the State\u2019s Attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">In return for \u201cthe complete fulfillment by Daniel Courtney of all of his obligations under this agreement,\u201d which included the cooperation described above, the Courtneys\u2019 consent to the forfeiture of the cash found in their home at 1910 Treeline Drive, as well as the home itself, and certain other undertakings not relevant here, the State agreed (1) not to charge Joanna with any offense, and (2) to charge Daniel only with possession with intent to distribute marijuana, accept a plea of guilty to that offense, and recommend a suspended sentence of five years. Additionally, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which was represented in the negotiations, agreed to allow all charges to be prosecuted by the State, and thus to forego Federal prosecution. The Attorney General also agreed not to prosecute Daniel on any criminal charge related to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Paragraph 2.C. of the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cWhether or not Daniel Courtney has completely fulfilled all of his obligations under this agreement shall be determined by the Court in an appropriate proceeding at which his disclosures and evidence shall be admissible and at which the State shall be required to establish a breach by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In \u00b6 3, the Courtneys acknowledged that \u201cany violation of the above stated terms and conditions shall be a violation of this agreement and will result in Daniel Courtney being charged with all criminal offenses which the State, in entering this agreement, waived its right to prosecute against said individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Although she had not, at that point, been charged with any offenses, Joanna signed the plea agreement with her husband (and her husband\u2019s attorney), presumably to make effective their consent to the forfeiture of some of the property specified in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Once the agreement was signed, Joanna and the attorney left the police station, and Daniel underwent an extensive interview by the police. During the course of the conversation, it became clear that the police wanted him to set up controlled buys with one or more of his customers, at which point Daniel balked. He was permitted to stop the interview and call his attorney. The attorney advised him to continue with the \u201cdebriefing\u201d and said that he would contact the prosecutor the next day. That, indeed, he did, informing the prosecutor that setting up customers was not part of the bargain. Although not denying that assertion, the prosecutor was adamant that Daniel would have to do as he was told. When defense counsel suggested that there was a misunderstanding and proposed that \u201cwe see a judge,\u201d which was the remedy provided for in \u00b6 2.C. of the agreement, the prosecutor responded that he was \u201cnot interested in seeing a judge,\u201d and, if Daniel did not agree to set up his customers, the prosecutor was going to have <em>Mrs. </em>Courtney \u201clocked up posthaste.\u201d In a subsequent complaint for injunctive relief, Daniel and Joanna alleged that the prosecutor in fact threatened to \u201crevoke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>agreement in its entirety, immediately arrest both Mr. Courtney and Mrs. Courtney, place the Courtney\u2019s children in foster care and prosecute Mr. Courtney under the Drug Kingpin Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Defense counsel got a reprieve from the prosecutor until 10:30 the next morning so that he could consult with another attorney in his firm. Rather than proceeding immediately to file a motion to have the court determine whether appellant was obliged to make controlled sales to his customers, the attorneys felt constrained to yield to the prosecutor\u2019s demands. They were concerned, as was Daniel, over the \u201ccatastrophic occurrence to Mrs. Courtney\u201d if the State followed through with its threat to have her arrested: she would most likely lose her job as a nurse. Daniel therefore reluctantly agreed to make controlled sales to at least one of his customers. He had already given the police all of the information they asked for about his customers, as well as about his Baltimore supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Daniel contacted one of the customers, Robert Meehan, as directed by the police. Unknown to them, Joanna, and later Daniel, had already tipped off Meehan, and so the sale did not take place. Meehan said that on the Thursday after Thanksgiving, which would have been on December 3, Joanna called to inform him that Daniel had been arrested, that their assets had been seized, and that the police knew who he was and were after him. She also asked for the money Meehan owed to the Courtneys. Joanna subsequently met Meehan, repeated what she had previously said, and added that \u201cDanny was going to try to set [Meehan] up for a deal in the near future that, and [Meehan] needed to, you know, say [he] wasn\u2019t interested, and that [he] would be off the hook, and [he] also gave [Joanna] some money.\u201d The next week, Daniel called and confirmed that Meehan was under surveillance, that Daniel was going to set up a deal, and that Meehan was to decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Notwithstanding Meehan\u2019s refusal to participate in the controlled buy engineered by the police, he was arrested, based, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>in large measure, on the information supplied by Daniel. Nonetheless, when the State learned of the Courtneys\u2019 communications with Meehan, it declared the plea agreement breached and of no effect. A letter to that effect was sent to counsel for the Courtneys on January 8, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The Courtneys succeeded in presenting their opposition to the State\u2019s action to Judge Waldron, of the Circuit Court for Harford County, in early February, 1993. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court, in findings announced from the bench, declared that Daniel had indeed breached the agreement, thereby justifying the State\u2019s response. The court first held that, in fact, Daniel had no obligation under the agreement \u201cto set up the people that he supplied.\u201d His only obligation was to supply information, which he had done. It further declared, however, that, when the dispute erupted as to Daniel\u2019s obligation, he had the \u201cfull opportunity\u201d to seek an interpretation of the agreement from the court \u201cand to stop the State from any action deemed as a bullying.\u201d At that point, the court held, there had been no breach of the agreement: \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the exposure. The issue of getting the wife arrested could have been addressed, also, so they could have come in and seen a judge on an <em>[ex parte </em>] basis, and the judge could have easily interpreted this and shielded the wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Instead of taking that available course, the Courtneys chose to warn the target. As to that, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">\u201cGood faith is an element in every agreement, whether it\u2019s a civil type or plea agreement, and it is particularly an element of plea agreements. What the Defendant did, he tipped off someone who he was supplying, so in two ways frustrating the purpose of the information, and he [e]ffectively denied the consideration to the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The court viewed that transgression as denying to the State information on the \u201cchain\u201d below Daniel: \u201che really ended up only delivering one of the people in the net, and in essence closing down the chain below him.\u201d Thus, it concluded that Daniel did not act in good faith, that he frustrated the reason for the agreement, and that he should therefore lose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>benefits. An order formally declaring the agreement null and void was entered on February 25, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Following that ruling, State and Federal agencies proceeded with a vengeance. Through various motions and other papers filed in this Court, including an undisputed affidavit filed by an attorney for the Courtneys, we were informed that both Mr. and Mrs. Courtney were subsequently arrested and charged with a variety of offenses, including being drug kingpins, that both, at least for a time, were held without bail, that their vehicles were seized, and that Federal marshals seized their home in Harford County (1910 Treeline Drive) and other property in Baltimore City. At some point, the prosecutor offered a new plea agreement far more onerous to the Courtneys than the first. Daniel was to plead guilty to importation of marijuana with a recommended sentence of 25 years, all but five years suspended. Joanna would plead guilty to conspiracy to distribute marijuana with a recommended suspended sentence. There would be no agreement as to forfeitures and no constraints on the U.S. Attorney or the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Multiple litigation has now arisen as a result of these events. The criminal cases against the Courtneys brought by the State\u2019s Attorney and several forfeiture actions are pending, and the threat of additional prosecutions by the U.S. Attorney and the Attorney General remains. The Courtneys noted this appeal from the February 25 order declaring the plea agreement to be null and void, and, at some point, they filed a separate action to restrain the State\u2019s Attorney from prosecuting any civil or criminal action against them until this appeal is resolved. They filed similar motions for injunctive relief in both the criminal cases and in at least one of the forfeiture cases. All of that relief was apparently denied by the circuit court, as it was, preliminarily, by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The State\u2019s initial response to this appeal was a motion to dismiss it on the ground that no final or otherwise appeal-able judgment has yet been entered. The Courtneys contend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that the court\u2019s February 25 order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine, as explicated and applied in <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 406 A.2d 922 (1979). The State, in replication, urges that the collateral order doctrine does not apply because (1) the issue sought to be appealed is not separate from the merits of the criminal case, and (2) it would not be effectively unreviewable following the entry of final judgment in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><em>Clark v. Elza </em>was a civil case \u2014 the Elzas sued Clark for injuries suffered in an automobile accident. On the eve of trial, the parties reached an oral agreement to settle the case for $9,500. The court was notified, the case was removed from the trial docket, and Clark prepared and sent to the Elzas a settlement draft, releases, and an order of satisfaction. The Elzas then repudiated the settlement and returned the papers, whereupon Clark filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The court denied the motion, and this Court dismissed Clark\u2019s appeal on the ground that it was premature in that no final judgment had yet been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the ruling was appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Quoting from <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978) and <em>Peat &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. 86, 394 A.2d 801 (1978), the Court concluded, at 213, that, to be appealable under that doctrine, \u201c \u2018[T|he order must [ (1) ] conclusively determine the disputed question, [ (2) ] resolve an important issue [, (3) be] completely separate from the merits of the action, and [ (4) ] be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The State does not contest that Judge Waldron\u2019s order satisfies the first two of these criteria. It did conclusively determine whether the agreement had any continuing vitality, and that issue is obviously an important one. With respect to the third criterion, the <em>Clark </em>Court found that \u201cthe questions bearing upon the enforceability of the settlement agreement have absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the tort cause of action,\u201d and that those questions were therefore \u201c \u2018com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>pletely separate\u2019 from the principal claim.\u201d <em>Id., 286 Md. </em>at 213, 406 A.2d 922. That is also the case here. Whether Mr. or Mrs. Courtney breached the plea agreement has nothing whatever to do with whether they committed the underlying offenses with which they are now charged. It is a \u201ccompletely separate\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The only criterion in some doubt is the fourth \u2014 whether the issue regarding the plea agreement would be effectively unreviewable following the entry of a final judgment. In one sense, it <em>would </em>be reviewable. If Daniel or Joanna Courtney is convicted and appeals, he or she could raise the issue of whether the State was bound by the plea agreement, and if we were to conclude in that appeal that the State <em>was </em>so bound, we would be obliged to reverse any convictions other than the one bargained for in the plea agreement. <em>See State v. Brockman, </em>277 Md. 687, 357 A.2d 376 (1976). That, indeed, is the basis of the State\u2019s argument. It is too narrow a reading of the fourth criterion, however. As the <em>Clark </em>Court noted, 286 Md. at 213, 406 A.2d 922:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201c[A] final judgment on the merits of the underlying tort claim would render the ruling on the settlement agreement effectively unreviewable. One of the principal considerations in entering a pre-trial settlement agreement is the avoidance of the expense and inconvenience of a trial. If the defendants must proceed to a trial on the merits, this contractual benefit will be irretrievably lost. Regardless of the outcome of the trial or the outcome of an appeal after trial, the defendants will have been forced to go to trial and thus will have been deprived of a right under the contract if the contract should have been enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Although, as noted, <em>Clark v. Elza </em>was a civil case, the collateral order doctrine is by no means limited to civil cases. It applies as well .to criminal actions, <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 483 A.2d 68 (1984), and we see no reason why this aspect of it should not also apply in criminal actions. The motives that impel civil litigants to settle their disputes without trial are equally at work in criminal cases; indeed, for the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>dant, the consequences of eschewing or rejecting a plea agreement may be far more onerous than those faced by a recalcitrant civil litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Those consequences are, in fact, multiplied here. Not only is Daniel Courtney facing a barrage of very serious charges, but Joanna, who was to remain free of prosecution under the agreement, is now charged as a drug kingpin. Several items of property have been seized and are subject to forfeiture. The validity of the plea agreement could thus be an issue in not just one, but several, appeals arising in different contexts and possibly upon different evidence. The effectiveness of any post-final judgment review of Judge Waldron\u2019s decision is especially tenuous. We therefore conclude that the order is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\n<em>The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In <em>State v. Brockman, supra, 277 </em>Md. 687, 357 A.2d 376, the Court summarized the basic ground rules governing the negotiation and enforcement of plea agreements. At 697, 357 A.2d 376, it noted that \u201cthe standard to be applied to plea negotiations is one of fair play and equity under the facts and circumstances of the case, which, although entailing certain contract concepts, is to be distinguished from ... the strict application of the common law principles of contracts.\u201d In furtherance of that concept, the Court held, at 698, 357 A.2d 376, that \u201cwhen a plea bargain has been agreed to by both a proper representative of the State and a defendant, and is not in violation of any law or public policy of this State, it would be a grave error to permit the prosecution to repudiate its promises in a situation in which it would not be fair and equitable to allow the State to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In <em>Brockman, </em>as here, a plea agreement was reached that required the defendant to cooperate with the State in developing a case against other persons. Brockman hesitated for a brief period in identifying a picture of one of the targets, and the State repudiated the agreement. The circuit court denied Brockman\u2019s motion for relief, agreeing with the State that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Brockman had breached the agreement. The Court of Appeals reversed. Noting that, prior to the repudiation, Brock-man had given the State a good deal of incriminating information and characterizing Brockman\u2019s hesitation as an inconsequential misstep, the Court declared that it would be inequitable to permit the State to repudiate the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We believe that the same principles apply here. The evidence showed, and the court found, that Daniel Courtney was not obliged by the agreement to set up controlled buys with his customers. That exception from the general obligation to cooperate had been bargained for by Daniel and accepted by the State. When the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney who had negotiated the agreement and who was fully aware of Daniel\u2019s position in the matter nonetheless (1) insisted that he proceed to participate in such controlled buys or face the immediate arrest of his wife and (2) declined defense counsel\u2019s request that the matter be presented to a judge, the State breached the agreement. The effect was to coerce Daniel into performing an act that he was not obliged to perform, which, in our view, was unfair and inequitable and constituted a material violation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">As we have observed, there is not even a pretense in this record that the prosecutor honestly or reasonably believed that the agreement required Daniel to participate in controlled buys with his customers. Had that been the case, he would not have rejected defense counsel\u2019s request to present the matter to a judge. Rather, the record reveals a clear, deliberate, gross repudiation of a bargained-for limitation in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">We disagree -with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the prospect of an <em>ex parte </em>application to a judge meant that \u201c[tjhere had been no breach yet as of that point in time.\u201d The breach occurred when the prosecutor threatened to have Joanna arrested if Daniel did not participate in a controlled buy with his customers. The possibility that a judge, if available on such short notice, might then have construed the agreement favorably to the Courtneys, as Judge Waldron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ultimately did, provided a possible remedy for the breach, but it did not erase or excuse the breach. We also disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the tip-off of Meehan denied the State the bargained-for consideration. Before that occurred, Daniel gave all of the information requested by the State, including sufficient information to justify Meehan\u2019s arrest. Daniel, in other words, gave the State all of the cooperation it was entitled to under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">We do not condone the subsequent conduct of the Courtneys, although that conduct does have to be viewed in the light of their reasonable belief that they were under no obligation to proceed with the controlled buy in the first instance. The fact is that the agreement was breached by the State before any of that conduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">We are not unmindful that, in order to combat this awful drug epidemic, there must be vigorous prosecution of offenders and that it is not inappropriate for the Government, when it arrests one, to put pressure on him to assist in developing cases against other offenders. But, when entering into plea agreements, the State, as well as the defendant, must play by the rules. Prosecutors cannot expect the law to hold defendants to their agreements if it does not also hold prosecutors equally accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We shall reverse the order of February 25 declaring the plea agreement null and void and remand the case for such further proceedings as may be necessary to implement that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">ORDER OF FEBRUARY 25, 1992 REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; HARFORD COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
