The Tax Court had affirmed appellee\u2019s assessment of recordation and transfer taxes on property received by appellant as a distribution upon dissolution of the Manhattan Park Apartments Holding Corporation (the Holding Corporation), its wholly owned subsidiary. Appellee is State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT). In affirming the decision of the Tax Court, the circuit court agreed with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that to be considered an \u201coriginal stockholder,\u201d one must have held stock continuously from when it was first issued. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">For reasons we shall explain, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">On September 7, 1988, The Parkman Corporation (Parkman) entered into a contract with New Parkman for the sale of the Manhattan Park Apartments (Manhattan Park) in Baltimore City. Parkman was the sole owner of Manhattan Park. To accomplish this transfer, yet avoid recordation and transfer taxes, the Holding Corporation was created on October 5, 1988. Parkman received 99 shares of the Holding Corporation\u2019s stock, and New Parkman received the remaining share. On December 30, 1988, New Parkman assigned its share to Parkman,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after which Parkman by deed transferred Manhattan Park to the Holding Corporation. Because Parkman now owned all of the stock in the Holding Corporation, this transfer from a parent corporation to its wholly owned subsidiary was exempt from recordation and transfer taxes. Maryland Code, Tax-Property Article<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 12-108(p)(l) (1986 &amp; Supp.1992). Parkman then assigned its 100 shares of stock in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the Holding Corporation to New Parkman, and the Holding Corporation was dissolved and Manhattan Park transferred in liquidation to New Parkman.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">As required by Maryland Code, Corporations and Associations Article \u00a7 3-107, Articles of Transfer were filed with the SDAT recording the transfer of the assets of the Holding Corporation to New Parkman. In conjunction with filing the articles of transfer, a Certificate of Conveyance, designed by the SDAT to determine whether a transfer of real property between business entities is subject to recordation and transfer taxes, was completed. The Certificate of Conveyance is simply a checklist, presenting the statutory requirements for exemption in question form. The question \u201cIs this real property being transferred to a person who was an original shareholder of the corporation?\u201d was answered \u201cyes,\u201d and no recordation or transfer taxes were paid at the time of transfer. The SDAT apparently later became aware of the circumstances of the transfer, and assessed New Parkman for taxes in November of 1991:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">Recordation Tax $11,088.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">Transfer Tax- State 16,797.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">- Baltimore City 50,393.25</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">$78,279.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The imposition of these taxes was affirmed by the Maryland Tax Court. On appeal, the judgment of the Tax Court was affirmed by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">When we are called upon to review an issue of statutory interpretation, we are not bound by the decision of the agency, but may substitute our interpretation of the statute for that of the agency. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., </em>58 Md.App. 327, 338, 473 A.2d 469 (1984) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985). Our goal when interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the legislature. In doing so, our focus is upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the purpose or policy of the statute. <em>Ayres v. Townsend, </em>324 Md. 666, 672, 598 A.2d 470 (1991). Although where the language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, words will be accorded their ordinary meaning, <em>id.; </em>words of the statute must be read so as to advance the legislative policy involved. <em>Baltimore County Coalition Against Unfair Taxes v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 184, 203, 582 A.2d 510 (1990). We may, therefore, in addition to the literal or usual meaning of the words of the statute, consider their meaning and effect in the context they are used and in light of the setting, objectives, and purpose of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The controversy in the case <em>sub judice </em>centers upon the meaning of the word \u201coriginal.\u201d Appellant asserts that the Oxford English Dictionary defines the word \u201coriginal\u201d as \u201cexisting at first, primary, initial, first.\u201d The Tax Court, on the other hand, determined that the legislature intended the word \u201coriginal\u201d to mean \u201cfrom beginning to end, without any intervening period of time.\u201d As appellant sees it, the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation \u201cdisregards the natural meaning of the word \u2018original.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1981) defines \u201coriginal,\u201d when used as an adjective, to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">(1) a: of or relating to, a rise or beginning: <em>existing from the start: </em>initial, primary, pristine; b: constituting a source, beginning, or first reliance; (2) a: taking independent rise: having spontaneous origin: not secondary, derivative, or imitative: fresh, new; b: gifted with powers of independent thought, direct insight, or constructive imagination: CREATIVE, FERTILE, GERMINAL, INVENTIVE; C: Constituting the product or model from which copies are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1952 (emphasis added.) The Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the use of the word \u201coriginal\u201d in \u00a7 12-108(q) is certainly consistent with Webster\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Obviously, resort to dictionaries will not resolve this issue. That being the case, it is particularly important that we look beyond the statute\u2019s language and consider its \u201cpurpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>[and] \u2018other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative goal or purpose,\u2019 and comparte] the results,\u201d <em>State v. Thompson </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731 (1993) (quoting <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628 (1987)), to reach a \u201creasonable interpretation, not one that is illogical or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>332 Md. at 8, 629 A.2d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Section 12-108(q) and related sections of the Tax-Property Article were enacted to close a tax loophole that became apparent following the 1979 transfer of the Baltimore Hilton Hotel. At that time, recordation and transfer taxes, which are imposed when an instrument of conveyance is either recorded in the land records or filed with the SDAT, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-102,13-202, were computed upon the consideration paid for the property. The Attorney General had issued an opinion that, because there was no consideration involved, no liability for recording or transfer tax arose when property was transferred to the partners of a dissolving partnership. 62 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 842 (1977). Relying upon the Attorney General\u2019s Opinion, the sale of the Baltimore Hilton was structured so that, rather than purchasing the hotel outright from the partnership that owned it, the buyer acquired the interests of the partnership, then terminated the partnership. The Attorney General determined that, although the purpose of the transaction was the conveyance of real property for valuable consideration, the form of the conveyance was a deed in distribution pursuant to a bona fide dissolution, and thus no recordation or transfer taxes were due. 64 OpAtt\u2019y Gen. 286 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The General Assembly subsequently amended the recordation tax statute to add what are now \u00a7\u00a7 12-106 and 12-108(q), which provide:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u00a7 12-106. Tax on corporate, limited liability company, and partnership transfers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">Except as provided in 12-108(p), (q), (v), and (w) of this title, the recordation tax applies to instruments of writing that transfer the real property of a corporation to its stockholders, the real property of a limited liability company to its members, or the real property of a partnership to its partners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\u00a7 12-108(q). <em>Corporate, limited liability company, or partnership conveyance. </em>\u2014 An instrument of writing that transfers real property from a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership on its liquidation, dissolution, or termination is not subject to recordation tax, if the transferee is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">(1) an original stockholder of the corporation, an original member of. the limited liability company, or an original partner of the partnership;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(2) a direct descendant or relative within 2 degrees of an original stockholder of the corporation, an original member of the limited liability company, or an original partner of the partnership counting by the civil law method; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(3) a stockholder, member, or partner who became a stockholder, member, or partner through gift or bequest from an original stockholder of the corporation, an original member of the limited liability company, or an original partner of the partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\"><em>See </em>1982 Md.Laws, ch. 813 (the 1982 Amendment). Corresponding changes were made to \u00a7\u00a7 13-206 and 13-207 (state transfer tax), and to \u00a7\u00a7 13-404 and 13-405 (the collection of county transfer tax on instruments filed with the Department).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In 1984, transfer and recordation taxes of approximately $237,000 were avoided on a transfer of a Howard County property valued at over $12 million. The owner of the property, General Election Co., created a subsidiary corporation and transferred the property to the subsidiary. The subsidiary was then merged into Howard Research and Development Corp. As a result of this and similar transactions, the General Assembly again revised the statutes concerning recordation and transfer tax to limit the exemptions for the transfer of corporate property. 1986 Md.Laws, ch. 686 (the 1986 Amendment). Whereas \u00a7 12-108(p)(l) previously exempted any transfer between \u201ca parent corporation and its subsidiary corporation or between 2 or more subsidiary corporations wholly owned by the same parent corporation\u201d for de minimis consideration, it now permits such an exemption only \u201cif the parent corporation is an original stockholder of the subsidiary corporation, or subsidiary corporations, or became a stockholder through gift or bequest from an original stockholder of the subsidiary corporation, or subsidiary corporations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Section 12-108(p)(3) created an additional exemption for a transfer of property for de minimis consideration from a subsidiary to its parent corporation. Section 12-108(p)(3) applies to those instances where the parent corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">(i) previously owned the real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">(ii) owns the stock of the subsidiary and has owned that stock for a period greater than 18 months; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">(iii) acquires the stock of a subsidiary corporation which has been in existence and has owned the real property for a period of 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">A new subsection (v) was added exempting all transfers of property resulting from a merger of a parent corporation into its subsidiary, but exempting transfers resulting from a merger of a subsidiary into its parent only where the same criteria established in \u00a7 12-108(p)(3) for subsidiary-to-parent trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>fers is met. New subsection (w) exempts transfers resulting from consolidations only if recordation tax was paid when the property was acquired by the corporation consolidating to form a new corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In his 1979 Baltimore Hilton opinion, the Attorney General discussed federal treatment of \u201cstep\u201d transactions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">... Admittedly, the substance of the transaction, when considered over its form and reduced to its lowest common denominator, constitutes little more than a conveyance of the Baltimore Hilton Hotel to the Netherland Antilles Corporation for a valuable consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">Were we free to disregard the mechanics of the transaction, we would have little difficulty in imposing the taxes, given the result. The Internal Revenue Service has done so for the purposes of Federal income tax at least since 1950, when the rule now known as the \u201cKimball-Diamond\u201d doctrine was first invoked to look behind a \u201cstep\u201d transaction and impose a tax where the taxpayer who is interested primarily in a corporation\u2019s assets first purchases its stock and then liquidates the corporation, acquiring the assets in the form of a liquidating dividend, or distribution. The doctrine focuses on the transaction as a whole, not on its separate steps, and looks to the end result in determining whether the imposition of income tax is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">64 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. at 288-89 (footnotes omitted). Nonetheless, the Attorney General believed, based upon the unambiguous language of the Maryland recordation and transfer tax statutes then in effect, that the \u201cnature of the instrument necessarily determines whether it gives rise to a tax, without regard to the substance of the transaction from which it originates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Maryland law prevented the tax authority from disregarding the form of the transaction in order to base tax liability on the results of the entire transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The 1982 and 1986 Amendments to the recordation and transfer tax statutes were clearly intended to alter the tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>framework for such a transaction, and impose a tax based upon the substance of the transaction. As a result, unless certain criteria are met, the transaction is now to be a taxable transfer, regardless of the form of the transaction. Recordation and transfer tax is now calculated upon the value of the property rather than the recited consideration. \u00a7 12-105(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"> The legislature thus shifted from a presumption that a transfer of this nature is nontaxable to a presumption that such a transfer is taxable. As was the Attorney General in 1979, when we are construing the <em>applicability </em>of a tax statute, we are to construe it in favor of the citizen rather than the government. <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 539, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979). Where, as here, however, we are construing a tax <em>exemption, </em>we are to construe it strictly in favor of the state. <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City v. Har Sinai West Corp., </em>95 Md.App. 631, 639, 622 A.2d 786 (1993) (citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County v. Bosley Methodist Church Graveyard, </em>293 Md. 208, 212, 443 A.2d 91 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">That being the standard, we agree with the conclusion of the circuit court. Under \u00a7 12-108(q), property may be distributed to a current stockholder who is an original stockholder, a direct descendant or an immediate relative of an original stockholder, or who received his or her stock as a gift or devise from an original stockholder, exempt from recordation and transfer tax. Although, as is too often the case, we have no legislative history explaining the General Assembly\u2019s choice of these particular criteria, these requirements suggest a legislative desire for continuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Appellant contends that the legislature could not have intended that \u201coriginal\u201d encompass \u201ccontinuous\u201d as the 1986 Amendment placed an explicit continuity requirement in \u00a7\u00a7 12-108(p)(3) and 12-108(v). Sections 12-108(p)(3) and 12-108(v) exempt subsidiary-to-parent transfers where the parent previously owned the property, has owned the stock of the subsidiary for more than 18 months, or the parent corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>has acquired as a subsidiary a corporation that has owned the property for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The 1986 Amendment, when first introduced, restricted this subsidiary-to-parent exemption only to those situations where the parent previously owned the property. After the first reading, the exemption took its current form. Although the two additional criteria expand the exemption, the time requirements are formulated so as to not exempt transfers to a parent corporation from a newly acquired subsidiary that has very recently acquired the property. In our view, this subsidiary-to-parent standard is a lesser standard than the original-stockholder standard. Unlike the latter standard, the subsidiary-to-parent standard does not require that the parent be involved at the time of incorporation of the subsidiary. On the other hand, it imposes ownership requirements that, viewed in the context of the objectives of the 1982 and 1986 Amendments, are obviously designed to exclude from exemption those situations where the legislature believed the timing of a subsidiary\u2019s creation or acquisition indicates an attempt to acquire property indirectly in order to avoid recordation and transfer tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Moreover, at the same time the legislature formulated the subsidiary-to-parent requirements, it added the original-stockholder standard to \u00a7 12-108(p)(l). If we consider the original-stockholder standard to look forward from the time of incorporation, and the subsidiary-to-parent standard to look backward from the time of transfer, it is unlikely that, at the same time it was creating backward-looking ownership requirements of 18 and 24 months, the legislature would have intended that its forward-looking requirement allow a subsidiary-to-parent transfer, in which the parent acquires ownership of the subsidiary just days or even hours prior to the transfer, to be exempt from recordation and transfer tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Appellant believes that the Certificate of Conveyance should be considered the SDAT\u2019s written interpretation of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ute, and contends that if the SDAT interprets \u201coriginal\u201d to encompass \u201ccontinuous,\u201d that should have been embodied in the Certificate of Conveyance. Had the Certificate strayed from the language of the statute and evidenced an attempt by the SDAT to assist the taxpayer in determining how the questions presented should be answered, appellant\u2019s contention might have merit. The Certificate of Conveyance, however, mirrors the language of the statute with respect to each exemption. Thus, the word \u201coriginal\u201d in the questionnaire will necessarily have the same connotation it has in the statute. The Certificate of Conveyance simply cannot be viewed as interpreting \u00a7 12-108(q).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Over time, the amendments to the recordation tax statute evince a clear legislative intent not to exempt \u201cstep\u201dtype transactions which, through the formation and dissolution of business entities, manipulate property ownership for the sole purpose of avoiding recordation and transfer taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If we were to adopt appellant\u2019s construction of the word \u201coriginal,\u201d we would frustrate the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\">.
