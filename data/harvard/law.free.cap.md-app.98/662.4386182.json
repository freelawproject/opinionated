(\u201cFruitrade\u201d), filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellant, Van Wyk, Inc. (\u201cVan Wyk\u201d), Hoover Trucking Service, Inc. (\u201cHoover\u201d), and James J. Maloney trading as Coastal Transportation Co., for damages to a shipment of raspberries. Van Wyk filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging that Fruitrade violated the statutory time period set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(c)(2). The chambers judge dismissed Fruitrade\u2019s complaint with prejudice, whereupon, Fruitrade requested an en banc review of the dismissal. The en banc panel vacated the order granting Van Wyk\u2019s motion to dismiss. The case was tried without a jury, and the trial judge found Van Wyk liable to Fruitrade in the amount of $23,807.65. Van Wyk filed a timely notice of appeal to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Court. Neither Hoover nor Maloney are parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Van Wyk raises several issues, which we rephrase and reorder as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">1. Whether the en banc panel erred when it ruled that Fruitrade\u2019s complaint was not time barred under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707(e). (An appeal from a decision of an en banc panel is permitted pursuant to Md.Rule 2-551 (h)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">2. Whether the trial court erred when it found Van Wyk liable under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707 for the damage to Fruitrade\u2019s cargo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">3. Whether the trial court erred in its application of the legal and factual burdens set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">4. Whether the factual findings made by the trial court were arbitrary, capricious, and clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">5. Whether the trial court erred when it premised liability against Van Wyk upon a factual basis which Fruitrade did not plead and that had no causal relation to the alleged damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Fruitrade, a Canadian trading company that buys and sells frozen fruits, frozen vegetables, and juice concentrates, arranged for the shipment and sale of two containers of individually quick frozen (\u201cIQF\u201d) raspberries from a supplier in Chile to Big Valley Marketing, a purchaser in Decatur, Michigan. The raspberries were transported from Valparaiso, Chile, on a Chilean steamship and, on June 15, 1988, at approximately 5:30 p.m., arrived at Hoover, a trucking terminal/warehouse located in Baltimore, Maryland. Fruitrade hired Hoover to transload the shipment of raspberries from the Chilean steamship to Van Wyk\u2019s refrigerated trailer. Two Hoover employees began unloading the raspberries at 7:00 p.m. and completed the transfer of the cargo at approximately 11:00 p.m. Van Wyk\u2019s driver, Robert Hamilton, was present at the terminal and observed the transfer. The shipment ultimately was received by the purchaser in Decatur, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Mr. Hamilton testified that the Hoover employees backed the Van Wyk trailer into an unsealed dry dock and up against one of the shipment containers. One employee hand stacked the cartons of raspberries onto pallets and another employee loaded the pallets into the trailer. Mr. Hamilton also testified that, when he closed the trailer doors, he noticed that the boxes in the rear of the trailer had started to accumulate \u201ca dew like it was starting to melt\u201d and that the \u201ccardboard [was] starting to collapse from the moisture.\u201d Hoover was responsible for loading the shipment into Van Wyk\u2019s trailer; Mr. Hamilton was responsible only for closing the doors of the trailer. Before departing the terminal that evening, Mr. Hamilton signed the bill of lading for the delivery of the raspberries. The bill of lading indicated that Mr. Hamilton received the cargo in \u201cgood order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Emma Jean Stambek, a general manager for Big Valley Storage Company, Inc., a public freezer warehouse in Decatur, Michigan, testified that, on June 17, 1988, she went to the loading dock and received the shipment of raspberries. Ms. Stambek checked the cargo and noted on the bill of lading: \u201cProduct shows thaw. Juice in bottom of bags. Boxes crushed on bottom. Condition of berries unknown. Plus 30 degrees [Fahrenheit]. Plus 20 degrees [Fahrenheit] inside to the front.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">When Ms. Stambek notified Big Valley Marketing and Fruitrade of the condition of the raspberries, Fruitrade sent Kenneth Wojcik, a surveyor, to the cold storage warehouse. In his report, Mr. Wojcik recorded:</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">[ 6 ](b) Condition of interior and exterior packing (b) Lower palletized boxes collapsing, evidence of wetting from defrosting, refrozen at time of survey.</p>\n<p id=\"AoVI\">[ 7 ](a) Description of loss/damage. [7](a) Thawing.</p>\n<p id=\"Alh\">(b) After examination, cause attributed by surveyor[.] (b) Unloading of ocean container and transference to standard trailer in hot humid weather conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Wojcik also stated in his report that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">[Mr. Hamilton] left the warehouse and then returned at about 7:00 p.m. Only one skid had been loaded, and the doors of both the container and trailer were open. The load was transferred one pallet at a time. Two men in the container hand palletized the load. The driver estimated the outside temperature 85 degrees, and stated that the temperature inside the trailer was at least 55 degrees. The transference was not completed until about midnight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">When the driver left Hoover Transportation warehouse, he stopped at a truck stop to weigh the truck. At this time he took a temperature reading in the trailer with a probe meter. The meter registered between 28 and 32 degrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">We further inquired of Van Wyk as to why the driver had signed the bill of lading without taking exceptions, as the conditions under which the load was transferred were less than advantageous, and the driver knew the load was perishable. Van Wyk\u2019s response was that this was an error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">As a result of the damage to the shipment, Fruitrade was unable to sell the raspberries as IQF, and instead, sold them as \u201cblock frozen,\u201d a considerably less valuable form of the product. Fruitrade claimed a loss of nearly $24,000, and sent a letter to Van Wyk claiming that Van Wyk was responsible for the damage to the raspberries. On February 1, 1989, Van Wyk denied Fruitrade\u2019s claim, and Fruitrade subsequently filed suit against Van Wyk in January 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">I. Statutory Time Period</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">We shall address first Van Wyk\u2019s contention that Fruitrade\u2019s complaint is time barred under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(c)(2) (1979 &amp; Supp.1993), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">A person must begin a civil action to recover damages under section 11705(b)(3) of this title within 2 years after the claim accrues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Initially, the trial court found that the statutory time period barred Fruitrade\u2019s claim against Van Wyk and granted Van Wyk\u2019s motion to dismiss. The en banc panel, however, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">[I]t seems clear that the basis for the Chambers Judge\u2019s ruling as to both defendants was his erroneous conclusion that the statute of limitations in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(c)(2) applied to plaintiffs claim against these defendants. Section 11706(c)(2) provides for a two-year period of limitations from date of delivery or tender of delivery by the carrier for actions \u201cfor damages resulting from the imposition of rates for transportation or service....\u201d See 49 U.S.C. 11705(b)(3). Plaintiffs claims are for damage to cargo and are not in any way related to \u201crates for transportation or service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">We agree with the en banc panel that the chambers judge improvidently granted Van Wyk\u2019s motion to dismiss. Section 11706(c)(2) clearly states that \u201ca person must begin a civil action to recover damages under \u00a7 11705(b)(3) of this title within 2 years after the claim accrues.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11705(b)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">A common carrier providing transportation or service ... is liable for damages resulting from the <em>imposition of rates for transportation or service </em>the Commission finds to be in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">(Emphasis added). Fruitrade\u2019s claim arises from damage to its cargo and not from damages resulting from the imposition of illegal transportation or service rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Section 11707 of Title 49 U.S.C. generally covers \u201cliability for actual loss or injury to the property.\u201d Subsection (e) of that section specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">\u201cA carrier ... may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than ... 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier ... gives a person written notice that the carrier ... has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Although 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707(e) does not constitute a statute of limitations, it does limit the ability of a carrier to reduce, by contract or otherwise, the time for a shipper to commence an action against the carrier. This section clearly states that, at the very least, a shipper has two years within which to bring a civil action against a carrier. Van Wyk, a common carrier subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707, denied Fruitrade\u2019s claim for damage to the raspberries on February 1, 1989. Fruitrade filed suit against Van Wyk in January 1991, within two years from the date of Van Wyk\u2019s notice denying Fruitrade\u2019s claim; therefore, Fruitrade\u2019s complaint against Van Wyk is not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">II-IV. Application of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Van Wyk next contends that the trial court erred in its application of the legal and factual burdens in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707 (1979 &amp; Supp.1993), and that its factual findings were clearly erroneous. Van Wyk maintains that the trial court (a) erroneously held Van Wyk liable for damage to the raspberries that existed at the time Hoover tendered the shipment, (b) incorrectly assessed Van Wyk\u2019s duties and obligations to Fruitrade at the time Hoover tendered the shipment, and (c) erroneously relied on the bill of lading signed by Mr. Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We shall review first the standard of appellate review for actions tried without a jury and provide an overview of the law governing the liability of a carrier for damage to an interstate shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Al1\">Rule 8-131(e) provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>The appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Clemson v. Butler Aviation-Friendship, Inc., </em>266 Md. 666, 671, 296 A.2d 419 (1972) (citations omitted). \u201cIt is thus plain that the appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on its findings of fact but will only determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous in light of the total evidence.\u201d <em>$3,417.16 U.S. Money v. Kinnamon, </em>326 Md. 141, 149, 604 A.2d 64 (1992). \u201c[I]f substantial evidence is presented to support the trial court\u2019s determination, it is not clearly erroneous and hence will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Maryland Metals, Inc. v. Metzner, </em>282 Md. 31, 41, 382 A.2d 564 (1978). The clearly erroneous portion of section (c), however, does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or to the legal conclusions it draws from its factual findings. <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 124, 372 A.2d 231, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Action tried without a Jury. \u2014 When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>An appellate court will affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment on any ground adequately shown by the record, even a ground not relied upon by the trial court. <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979). Therefore, although the trial judge\u2019s basis for the judgment may be incorrect, an appellate court may still examine the record \u201cto determine if the court reached the right result ... albeit for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Faulkner v. American Casualty Co., </em>85 Md.App. 595, 629, 584 A.2d 734 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The liability of a carrier for damage to an interstate shipment is governed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11707, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">[A] carrier or freight forwarder and any other common carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter I, II, or IV are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (1) the receiving carrier,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>(2) the delivering carrier, or (3) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In order to establish a prima facie case under \u00a7 11707(a)(1), the shipper must show \u201c[1] delivery in good condition, [2] arrival in damaged condition, and [3] the amount of damages.\u201d <em>Missouri Pacific R.R. v. Elmore &amp; Stahl, </em>377 U.S. 134, 138, 84 S.Ct. 1142, 1145, 12 L.Ed.2d 194 (1964). Once the shipper establishes a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the carrier, who must show \u201c[1] that it was free from negligence and [2] that the damage to the cargo was due to [an exceptional circumstance, such as an act of God, the public enemy, the act of the shipper, public authority, or the inherent vice or nature of the goods themselves].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The liability of a carrier changes somewhat when the shipper sends the cargo \u201cunder seal.\u201d Shipping goods under seal is a method used by the shipper to give the consignee a guarantee that no one has tampered with the goods. \u201cWhen goods travelling under seal are delivered to the consignee in imperfect condition, the shipper must submit proof of delivery in good condition other than the mere recital on the bill of lading in order to establish a prima facie case under [\u00a7 11707].\u201d <em>Ed Miniat, Inc. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., </em>587 F.2d 1277, 1280 (D.C.Cir.1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">If a shipper chooses to avail himself of the benefits of a seal, it is eminently fair, if he is to prevail on a claim for in transit damage to that shipment, that he supply the court with persuasive proof, not merely evidence of the possibility, that the goods shipped were in good condition when entrusted to the carrier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">In an action for damage to goods shipped under seal, \u201cit is inappropriate for the [trial] judge to rely on the bill of lading, claiming the \u2018property described was in apparent good order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Offshore Aviation v. Transcon Lines, Inc., </em>831 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>1013, 1014-15 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cFor sealed containers, documentary evidence needs to be supplemented by direct evidence, \u2018such as the testimony of an eyewitness to the loading of the container\u2019....\u201d <em>Id., </em>831 F.2d at 1015 <em>(quoting Blue Bird Prods. Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co., </em>474 F.2d 102, 107 (3d Cir.1973). \u201cThe bill of lading is not proof of the contents and condition of the shipment^] [when] [t]he apparent good condition clause in the bill of lading ... state[s] that the contents and condition of contents [are] unknown.\u201d <em>D.P. Apparel Corp. v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1984). Similarly, \u201c \u2018the bill of lading does not constitute an admission by the carrier that the shipment is in good condition at time of delivery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v. Chief Freight Lines Co., </em>679 F.2d 421, 422 n. 2 (5th Cir.1982) <em>(quoting </em>Robertson, <em>The Prima Facie Loss and Damage Case, </em>1973 Transp.L.J. 73, 81 (footnotes omitted)). This is the rule because the carrier cannot inspect sealed goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In addition, when the shipper itself undertakes to load the shipment on board the freight carrier, \u201c[m]ere knowledge on the part of the local agent of the carrier of the negligent manner in which the shipment [has] been packed [cannot] impose liability for this negligence on the carrier ... [if] the injury sustained was due to negligence in this regard and not to any negligence on the part of the carrier.\u201d <em>South Carolina Asparagus Growers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Southern Ry., </em>46 F.2d 452, 454 (4th Cir.1931). If the shipper improperly packs and loads the shipment and the shipment arrives at its destination damaged, the shipper must show \u201cthat some independent act of negligence on the part of the carrier contributed to cause damage to the shipment, notwithstanding the shipper\u2019s negligence, before the carrier can be held liable.\u201d <em>Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie R.R. v. Metal-Matic, Inc., </em>323 F.2d 903, 906 (8th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\n<em>This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Finding Van Wyk liable, the trial court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"AcU\">Hoover set in motion this series of events that should have not happened, but he caused part of it, and there can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>be joint tortfeasors, and I think, I know that this is not a negligence theory against your client, but he contributed to part of the problem in this case, as I see it.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The door was open. Hamilton knew it. He saw the damage. He was there during the loading process. He saw some of the sweating. He saw some of the sagging cartons. At that point he had an obligation to call, to do something, and he did nothing. The truck was not cool enough when it took off, and I make these as findings of fact. The bill of lading says, really what he says is they were in good order, which means that he was either too lazy, too tired, wanted to get on his way, under the gun, had a point of departure that he had to make, and took off. This was late at night, 11:30 at night. So I find that there is liability on the part of Van Wyk.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Plaintiff has established that they were received in good condition, by Hamilton\u2019s own words in that bill of lading, which, to me, is the best evidence in this case, although he backed away from it at a later time. The Court believes the best evidence is what happened at that time. So they were received in good condition, which is the obligation to prove on the part of the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The carrier delivered the goods in damaged condition at the destination, which has been proven by all evidence, and that there were damages as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The Court also would make a finding of fact that Hoover set in motion this, these events by his handling these items in a day which probably was one of the worst days in June in the history of the city, and that it was done in three and a half hours in a 98 degree, very humid situation, but that your client, his agent, Mr. Hamilton, knew or should have known that these situation\u2019s [sic] going to create this damage, and that, in fact, the damage continued during the course of part of the process between the City of Baltimore at 11:30 when it left and when it arrived at that location. I\u2019m sure that it cooled down, but it took awhile for it to cool down.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The trial court found as a matter of fact that the conditions under which Hoover loaded the raspberries into Van Wyk\u2019s trailer damaged the shipment, but also that Van Wyk received the raspberries from Hoover in good condition. Receiving the shipment in both a damaged condition and good condition is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The trial court found that Van Wyk and Hoover jointly and severally caused the damage to the raspberries. We agree with Van Wyk that Mr. Hamilton\u2019s failure to notify someone at Van Wyk about Hoover\u2019s loading procedures did not proximately cause the damage to the raspberries; however, the trial court also found that Van Wyk\u2019s failure to pre-cool properly the trailer caused damage to the raspberries. Contrary to Van Wyk\u2019s assertion, the trial court did not hold Van Wyk liable for damage to the shipment that existed prior to the time the shipment was loaded into Van Wyk\u2019s trailer; rather, the trial court found that Hoover\u2019s negligence in loading the raspberries and Van Wyk\u2019s negligence in transporting the raspberries to Michigan in an insufficiently cooled trailer operated together and independently of each other to damage Fruitrade\u2019s shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">It is well-established that when the shipper undertakes the responsibility of loading the shipment, and the shipment arrives in an imperfect condition, the carrier may not be held liable for the damage unless \u201csome independent act of negligence on the part of the carrier contributed to cause damage to the shipment, notwithstanding the shipper\u2019s negligence ....\u201d Met<em>al-Matic, Inc., </em>323 F.2d at 906. Mr. Hamilton indicated to Mr. Wojcik, who recorded the statement in his report, that \u201cinside the [Van Wyk] trailer was at least 55 degrees\u201d at the time the raspberries were loaded by Hoover. This supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the trailer was too warm at the time it was loaded and that Van Wyk breached its duty to pre-cool the trailer; a duty that Van Wyk admits \u201cwas the only service requested [by Fruitrade] other than the actual over-the-road transit instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Van Wyk also argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance upon the bill of lading as proof that Van Wyk received the shipment in apparent good order contravenes established case law that, when goods are shipped under seal, declarations on the bill of lading do not prove the contents and condition of the shipment because the seal prevents inspection of the goods. Although we agree with Van Wyk that, ordinarily, when goods are shipped under seal a notation on the bill of lading that the shipment was received in good order does not constitute an admission by the carrier, we recognize that the circumstances in the case <em>sub judice </em>are somewhat unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The bill of lading Mr. Hamilton signed indicates that one container of raspberries was shipped under seal, that the contents and condition of the shipment were unknown, and that Van Wyk received the goods in apparent good order. These representations on the bill of lading, however, were not accurate. Hoover did not load the refrigerated ocean container, which was shipped under seal, onto Van Wyk\u2019s trailer; rather, Hoover broke the seal on the ocean container and loaded the individually sealed cartons of raspberries onto the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Shipping cargo under seal insulates a carrier from liability because the carrier has no means of inspecting the condition of the contents of the cargo. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, Hoover broke the seal and Mr. Hamilton, who was present while Hoover loaded the raspberries onto the trailer, testified that there was not \u201ca lot of cooling going on\u201d and that the cartons were accumulating a dew. Mr. Hamilton also testified, however, that, when he signed the bill of lading with the notation \u201cree\u2019d in good order,\u201d the shipment, to his visual inspection, \u201cwas a frozen load and, yes, you know, from visual inspection, the product was still frozen.\u201d Because Hoover broke the seal, it was not inappropriate for \u201cthe [trial] judge to rely on the bill of lading, claiming the \u2018property described was in apparent good order.\u2019 \u201d The trial court, as the trier of fact, considered Mr. Hamilton\u2019s conflicting deposition statements and found Mr. Hamilton\u2019s signature on the bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>lading, indicating that the goods were received in apparent good order, binding on Van Wyk. Under Rule 8-131(c), an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d We agree with the trial court that, under the circumstances, the notation on the bill of lading, that Mr. Hamilton received the raspberries in good order, controls, and that Van Wyk cannot use the representation on the bill of lading that the raspberries were shipped under seal to shield itself from liability when the seal was broken and the condition of the shipment was obvious to Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton, at the very least, could have noted on the bill of lading his observations that the shipment looked like it \u201cwas starting to melt\u201d and that the \u201ccardboard [was] starting to collapse from the moisture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">To summarize, the evidence sufficiently supports the court\u2019s factual finding that Van Wyk\u2019s trailer was not properly cooled at the time of loading, and that this factual finding supports the court\u2019s legal conclusion that Van Wyk\u2019s negligence, independent of Hoover\u2019s negligence, caused damage to Fruitrade\u2019s shipment of raspberries. Mr. Hamilton testified that he saw the cartons beginning to sweat, and that he saw the cardboard beginning to sag when he left Hoover\u2019s terminal; however, he did nothing to alter the temperature of the trailer and he signed the bill of lading indicating that he received the shipment of raspberries in good condition. Moreover, when the shipment reached its destination in Michigan, two days later, the plastic bags containing the raspberries were ruptured, the cartons were crushed and wet, and there was juice on the floor of the trailer. This evidence supports the court\u2019s conclusion that although the manner in which Hoover loaded the shipment in Baltimore caused damage to the raspberries, damage undoubtedly occurred while the shipment was in transit. We agree with the trial court that, in addition to the manner in which Hoover loaded the raspberries, damage to the shipment also may be logically attributed to the warm condition of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>V. Fruitrade\u2019s Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Van Wyk finally contends that Fruitrade\u2019s complaint fails to allege that Mr. Hamilton breached a duty to notify his supervisor at Van Wyk that Hoover was using improper loading procedures, and that the complaint fails to allege that the breach of that alleged duty proximately caused Fruitrade\u2019s damages. Because we have already determined that the trial court correctly premised Van Wyk\u2019s liability on its failure to pre-cool the trailer sufficiently, we need not address the merits of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">We hold that the en banc panel did not err when it found that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(c)(1) does not bar Fruitrade\u2019s claim against Van Wyk. In addition, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Fruitrade, we hold that the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Van Wyk\u2019s trailer was insufficiently precooled was not clearly erroneous and that it reasonably supports the court\u2019s legal conclusion holding Van Wyk and Hoover jointly and severally liable for the damage to Fruitrade\u2019s shipment of raspberries.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
