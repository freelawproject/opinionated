Stephen Marsh (\u201cappellant\u201d) was convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of attempted murder and related offenses. He now appeals and asks us the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">Was there a proper waiver of Appellant\u2019s right to a jury trial under Maryland Rules 4-246 and 4-314?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We conclude that the waiver was not proper and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Appellant was charged with attempted murder and related offenses. He pleaded not guilty and entered a not criminally responsible (\u201cNCR\u201d) plea based upon alleged steroid intoxication. He also requested a jury trial. A jury trial waiver hearing was conducted wherein appellant chose to proceed with a bench trial. The trial judge found the appellant guilty of attempted first degree murder, use of a handgun and malicious destruction. The court also found appellant criminally responsible. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">On appeal, appellant is challenging the sufficiency of the recitation of his rights given to him by the court during the jury trial waiver hearing. Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by not advising him \u201cof his right to a jury trial on the issue of his criminal responsibility raised by way of a not criminally responsible plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The State contends that such an analysis is flawed because neither the State nor the appellant moved to bifurcate the trial on the issue of criminal responsibility. It is the State\u2019s position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">a defendant pleading not guilty but also pursuing a plea of not criminally responsible ... must elect between two fundamentally different procedural methods by which he may raise his defense. First, he may simply elect to proceed with a unitary trial, as Marsh did in this case, under Maryland Rule 4-314(a). In that event, the defense is entitled to raise the not criminally responsible defense as it would raise any affirmative defense at an ordinary trial on guilt or innocence. Alternatively, the defendant may elect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to go forward in a bifurcated proceeding, by filing a formal written motion seeking bifurcation. The same result is accomplished automatically under the Rule where a defendant pleads guilty on the guilt or innocence issue subject to the not criminally responsible defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 547 A.2d 1054 (1988), the Court of Appeals held that, except in unusual circumstances, it is the defendant\u2019s right to assert a NCR plea. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 547 A.2d 1054. The Court analyzed several cases and observed that \u201c[t]hese cases teach that the defendant ordinarily has the ultimate decision when the issue at hand involves a choice that will inevitably have important personal consequences for [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 547 A.2d 1054. The Court stated that \u201c[s]ection 12 \u2014 109(b) of the Health-General Article places on the defendant the \u2018burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the defense of not criminally responsible.\u2019 This marks an about-face from prior law under which the State had to prove the defendant\u2019s \u2018sanity\u2019 beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 547 A.2d 1054.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The Court also rejected the State\u2019s argument that the NCR defense is an affirmative defense, no different from defenses such as self-defense, coercion, entrapment, or consent. The Court noted that \u201cif we ... assume that a plea <em>of </em>not criminally responsible is indeed an affirmative defense, we believe that defense is inherently different from the other affirmative defenses because of the potentially far-reaching consequences which may result for the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675, 547 A.2d 1054. The Court further explained that a NCR defense differs from the other affirmative defenses (such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>self defense, etc.) because prevailing on the other defenses allows the' defendant to go free. On a successful NCR plea, the court is instructed to immediately \u201ccommit the [criminally not responsible] defendant to the Department [of Health and Mental Hygiene] for institutional, inpatient care or treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676, 536 A.2d 622 (citing Health-General Article, Md.Code Ann., section 12-lll(a) (1990 RepLVol. <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 1993)) (alterations in original). <em>But see </em>\u00a7 12-lll(c) (listing exceptions to automatic commitment). The Court stated that \u201cthe issues of guilt and criminal responsibility are separate. For the criminal responsibility issue, the burdens of pleading, producing evidence, and persuading the fact-finder that criminal punishment should not be imposed are all borne by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684-85, 536 A.2d 622. <em>See also Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 447-48, 583 A.2d 218 (1990) (citing <em>Treece, </em>313 Md. at 665, 547 A.2d 1054) (noting that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence is a determination completely separate from that of criminal responsibility.\u201d) The Court concluded by noting that, because of these differences, when the defendant pleads not criminally responsible by reason of insanity, the guilt or innocence stage of the trial could be bifurcated from the hearing to determine whether the defendant lacked criminal responsibility. <em>Treece, </em>313 Md. at at 686-87, 547 A.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In the instant case, the State contends that the NCR plea is like \u201cany affirmative defense at an ordinary trial on guilt or innocence,\u201d when in fact <em>Treece </em>holds to the contrary. A NCR plea significantly changes the burden borne by the defendant. Section 12-109 of the Health-General Article requires the defendant to \u201cfile a written plea alleging, in substance, that when the alleged crime was committed, the defendant was not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.\u201d Furthermore, it is the defendant who must show by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d that he was not criminally responsible when the alleged crime was committed. <em>Id. </em>at section 12-109(b). Courts are precluded from entering a NCR verdict unless the defendant or defense counsel has entered a written plea. <em>Id. </em>at 12-109(d). Additionally, even in a unitary trial, the court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>granted discretion to allow the defense to go first and last on the issue of criminal responsibility. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-314(c)(4); <em>McCloud v. State, </em>317 Md. 360, 363-65, 564 A.2d 72 (1989). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 4-314(b)(6)(B) (allowing the defense to open and close argument on the criminal responsibility issue in a bifurcated trial); <em>McCloud </em>317 Md. at 364, n. 2, 564 A.2d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">A defendant who pleads not guilty and enters a NCR plea can proceed in two different ways. First, under Md. Rule 4-314(a)(1), if he selects a jury trial, he could petition the court to bifurcate the case. In such an instance, the jury first hears the issue of guilt/innocence, and if the defendant is found guilty, the same jury hears the issue of criminal responsibility. Md. Rule 4-314(b)(5)(A). Second, the defendant can choose not to bifurcate the trial and proceed in a unitary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In the instant case, appellant did not choose the bifurcation option under Md. Rule 4-314. In fact, because he chose to proceed with a bench trial, appellant could not have bifurcated the trial even if he so desired. This is so because bifurcation is only available when a jury trial is chosen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is important to note that under Md. Rule 4-314, if a defendant chooses a jury trial and bifurcates the issues, he can at a later date, if he wishes, have the court hear the issue of criminal responsibility. Md. Rule 4-314(b)(5)(B) The Rule, does not, however, explicitly permit a defendant to bifurcate the trial by allowing a court to determine guilt/innocence and then having a jury hear the criminal responsibility issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant chooses to proceed with a court trial on the guilt/innocence issue, he simultaneously chooses to have the court determine the criminal responsibility issue. Thus, if a defendant waives his right to a jury trial on the guilt/innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>issue, he also <em>effectively </em>waives his right to a jury determination on the criminal responsibility issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">This analysis sets the stage for the question as to whether a defendant who waives his right to a jury trial on the guilt/innocence issue should be advised by the court that he is simultaneously waiving his right to a jury trial on the criminal responsibility issue. This is an issue of first impression. The appellant contends that reversible error was committed because the trial court did not instruct him that he was waiving his right to a jury trial on the criminal responsibility issue when he waived his right to a jury trial on the guilt/innocence issue. Accordingly, he asserts that the waiver was not \u201cknowing or intelligent.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">At the beginning of the trial, the court conducted a jury trial waiver hearing. The following exchange transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">The Court: Okay. Now, my understanding is that Mr. Marsh prays a Court trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">Mr. McCourt [Defense Counsel]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">The Court: But, I presume that he has in the past sought a jury trial, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">Mr. McCourt: Originally prayed a jury trial, that is correct. The Court: All right. Let me advise you, Mr. Marsh, that you do have an absolute right to a jury trial or a Court trial at your request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">Now a jury trial \u2014 a Court trial, of course means that the Judge listens to all the facts and evidence in the case and decides whether you\u2019re guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a jury trial you, Mr. McCourt and Mr. Flannery would choose twelve persons from the now Motor Vehicle Administration registry and those twelve people could be young or old, men or women, black, white, Oriental, native American. In other words, those twelve people could be a cross section of your community, which is Baltimore City, and those twelve people would have to decide <em>your guilt </em>by the same standard a Judge applies and that standard again is <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>The difference is that all twelve would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>have to agree that you are guilty before you could be convicted or all twelve would have to agree, agree you were not guilty before you could be acquitted. If they couldn\u2019t agree and came back nine to three, ten to two, even eleven to one it\u2019s called a hung jury and if there is a hung jury the State\u2019s Attorney has the option to dismiss the charges against you or to try you over and over and over again until a jury agrees that you\u2019re guilty or agrees that you\u2019re not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">The Defendant: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">The Court: Now, understanding that, sir, the Court presumes you\u2019ve had an opportunity to discuss your choice with your attorney, Mr. McCourt, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">The Defendant: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">The Court: All right. Having discussed it and having understood what the Court has said to you is it your wish to pray a jury trial or to give up, that is waive, that right to a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">The Defendant: I would like to waive that right, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATU\">The Court: Very well. And, you choose to have a Court trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">The Defendant: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Under Maryland law, the appellant has a right to a jury trial on the issue of his criminal responsibility. In <em>Breeden v. State </em>87 Md.App. 508, 590 A.2d 560 (1991), we stated that if the defendant pleads guilty and NCR, Maryland Rule 4-314(a)(4) requires that separate instructions be given. We noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-13\">A defendant <em>may </em>waive his right to a jury trial, of course, but such a waiver may not be accepted until the court determines, after an examination of the defendant on the record, that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily. And, although no \u201cfixed incantation\u201d is necessary, \u201ca defendant must have some knowledge of the jury trial right before he is allowed to waive it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 511, 590 A.2d 560 (citations omitted). We held that, in that case, the defendant had not waived his right to a jury trial because the court did not inform him of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Here, our review of the record indicates that the trial court did not inform the appellant of his right to a jury trial on the criminal responsibility issue. The judge merely stated that the appellant had the right to be tried by a jury on the issue of his \u201cguilt.\u201d Therefore, the appellant was never informed that because he was waiving his right to a jury trial on the guiU/innocence issue, he was precluded from having a jury decide the criminal responsibility issue. It is settled law that a waiver is ineffective unless it is voluntary, intelligent and knowledgeable. <em>See Martinez v. State, </em>309 Md. 124, 134, 522 A.2d 950 (1987). Additionally, under Md.Rule 4-246, a court is required to conduct a waiver inquiry \u201con the record in open court\u201d and \u201cexamine the defendant, for only he can waive his right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>309 Md. at 133, 522 A.2d 950. Thus, for a waiver to be valid, \u201cthe court must be satisfied that the defendant\u2019s election was made knowledgeably and voluntarily.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 522 A.2d 950. In other words, \u201cthere has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>321 Md. 178, 182, 582 A.2d 507 (1990) (citing <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1468, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In the instant case, the trial court never informed appellant that by waiving a jury trial on the guilt/innocence issue, he was also waiving his right to have a jury hear the criminal responsibility issue. Thus, appellant\u2019s waiver could not be \u201cintelligent or knowledgeable.\u201d We hold, therefore, that when confronted with facts similar to those in the case at bar, at a minimum, a trial court should ascertain whether the defendant is aware of the fact that by waiving a jury trial on the guilt/innocence issue, a simultaneous waiver of reaching the jury on the criminal responsibility is also being exercised. This is because once the defendant is informed of the simultaneous waiver, he can then, if he chooses, execute a voluntary, intelligent and knowledgeable waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED.
