Morrison, the appellant, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Carroll County of murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, and robbery. He presents four questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">I. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s financial need?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">II. Did the trial court err in admitting hearsay evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">III. Did the trial court err in excluding from evidence appellant\u2019s proposed Exhibit Number One?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">IV. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress a statement to the police?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">On or about August 18, 1991, seventy-four-year-old Margaret Cullen was reported to Baltimore City Police as a missing person. In the course of investigating Mrs. Cullen\u2019s disappearance, the police also discovered that a brown Cadillac belonging to Mrs. Cullen and her husband was missing from the Cullens\u2019 home in Baltimore. Further investigation led police to the home of Troy Shellington.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">At 6:30 on the evening of August 24,1991, the police saw the appellant in the Cullens\u2019 car in front of Troy Shellington\u2019s home. He pulled the car to the curb, turned the ignition off, and got out of the car. He was in the process of walking away from the car when the police approached him. They asked him whose car it was. He said it belonged to a friend of his, Troy Shellington, who was in the house where the car was parked. The police informed the appellant that the car was reported stolen and that he was under arrest for operating a stolen vehicle. He was handcuffed and transported to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">The police also talked with Troy Shellington, who agreed to accompany them to police headquarters. Later that night, Shellington led the police to a cornfield in Carroll County, where the badly decomposed body of Mrs. Cullen was found under a blanket, plastic, and newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">Early the following morning, the police confronted the appellant with what they had found and what Shellington had told them. The appellant made an audiotaped confession concerning the events that led to Mrs. Cullen\u2019s death. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>confession (the transcript of which fills twenty typewritten pages), he told the following story.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">.The appellant, a nursing assistant, met Mrs. Cullen when he went to work for her husband, an elderly dentist, when Dr. Cullen was hospitalized. When Dr. Cullen was released from the hospital in July of 1991, the appellant began working for the Cullens at their home. (Dr. Cullen was later readmitted to the hospital.) Believing that he was \u201cunderpaid and overworked\u201d because Mrs. Cullen was paying him less than they had agreed, the appellant quit the job and stole one of Mrs. Cullen\u2019s blank checks. He wrote himself a check for $2,000.00, forged Mrs. Cullen\u2019s signature, and deposited it in his account. When the forgery was discovered, the appellant was told that criminal charges would be brought against him by the bank if he did not repay the $2,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The appellant tried to convince Mrs. Cullen to persuade the bank to \u201cdrop the charges\u201d against him. He went to her house and knocked on both the front door and the back door, but no one answered. As he was leaving, the police arrived and told him that Mrs. Cullen had reported that he was disturbing her. They told him that if he returned, he would be charged with trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Early the following morning, the appellant and Shellington (who had also worked briefly for Mrs. Cullen) broke into the Cullens\u2019 basement and waited there. When Mrs. Cullen awoke and unlocked the inside door to the basement, the two men grabbed her and tied her to a chair. They had planned to \u201cforce\u201d her to drop the charges by having her call the bank. When the scheme did not work out as planned, they decided to take her \u201cout to the country somewhere and just put her there, and just leave her there and by the time she get back to the city, we would have had gone or would have taken care of the $2,000 or hopefully she would have wandered off and got lost somewhere, that\u2019s what we were sort of hoping and then come back and then by then, money is paid to the bank and there\u2019s pretty much nothing she can say or, or do.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>They waited until dark and drove Mrs. Cullen out Reisterstown Road to Carroll County and tried to abandon her in a cornfield. It was very dark, and when the men began to leave, Mrs. Cullen \u201cran into the knife\u201d that Shellington was holding. They dragged her body back into the field and covered it with a blanket, plastic bags, newspapers, and some brush.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The appellant and Shellington returned to the Cullens\u2019 house and took various items including a television, a computer, and jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Dacia Allmond, the sister of the appellant\u2019s girlfriend, testified for the defense concerning the appellant\u2019s whereabouts and activities during the week of August 13 through 17 of 1991. During the State\u2019s cross-examination of the witness, the following occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Q: Okay. And did you have a \u2014 this week that you\u2019ve been questioned about, did you have discussions with Mr. Morrison during that period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">Q: And do you recall discussions about money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4M\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGp\">[PROSECUTOR]: (Inaudible) certainly test ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll \u2014 I\u2019ll overrule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">BY [PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">Q: Re ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">THE COURT: He\u2019s talking about the period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">BY [PROSECUTOR]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-15\">Q: ... \u2014 recall discussions about money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-17\">Q: And was he having money problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-18\">A: Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-19\">Q: He was \u2014 did you tell the police he was desperate for money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>A: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">Q: Did you tell \u2019em he needed money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Q: Okay. Do you know what for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The appellant contends that the court erred in admitting that testimony. He claims that the evidence was inadmissible for two independent reasons. First, relying on <em>Vitek v. State, </em>295 Md. 35, 453 A.2d 514 (1982), he claims that evidence of his need for money was irrelevant and prejudicial. Second, he claims that the line of cross-examination was well beyond the scope of direct examination of the witness, which was limited to the appellant\u2019s whereabouts at specific times between the victim\u2019s disappearance and the discovery of her body. Assuming, without deciding, that the issue was preserved for our review, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">The appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Vitek </em>is misplaced. As the Court noted in that case, evidence of an accused\u2019s financial situation is admissible under special circumstances that show a nexus between the accused\u2019s financial status and the motive for a particular crime. In the instant case, the State presented evidence tending to show that the appellant committed the crimes at issue because he was unable to repay the $2,000.00 he had stolen and was unable to convince the victim to drop the charges. The testimony that the appellant complains about was merely cumulative to the evidence tending to show that the appellant had a particularized motive to commit the crimes in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">We also reject the appellant\u2019s second claim of error. \u201c[I]n the absence of a showing of prejudice or of abuse, considerable discretion as to whether cross-examination should be permitted to extend beyond the scope of the direct examination is vested in the trial judge.\u201d <em>See Marlow, Infant v. Davis, </em>227 Md. 204, 211, 176 A.2d 215 (1961). <em>See also Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 669, 612 A.2d 258 (1992). We perceive no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The appellant testified in his own defense. During his cross-examination by the State, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Q: And, when you talked about the blanket that you put over this lady, you said, \u201cThe blanket came from out of their car.\u201d It wa \u2014 \u201cIt was, it was already in the car.\u201d [S]o that that blanket that was found wrapped around her came from the trunk of her Cadillac, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">Q: It didn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-10\">Q: Where do you say it came from now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">A: I\u2019d driven Mrs. Cullen\u2019s car before, sometime in July when I was working for her. I remember that because she told me make sure I bring her car back, \u2019cause she \u2014 she got my name and number in her diary, and she would write down everything about me. So, we laughed and I took the car, and the blanket was in the back seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">Q: She wrote down everything about you in the diary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6A\">A: I don\u2019t know if she wrote down everything, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">Q: Well, that what ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">A: ... but I know ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">Q: ... you just said, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">A: I said my name, my number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-17\">Q: Do you recognize this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-18\">A: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-19\">Q: You don\u2019t recognize that as her diary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-20\">A: No, sir.

I never pleaded desperately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">The appellant contends that the court thereby permitted the introduction of inadmissible hearsay. The State counters that the contents of the deceased victim\u2019s diary were admissible under the present sense exception to the hearsay rule. We agree that the court did not err in permitting the cross-examination, but not for the reason advanced by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">In <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 313, 324, 508 A.2d 976 (1986), the Court of Appeals concluded \u201cthat the \u2018present sense impression\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule rests upon a firm foundation of trustworthiness, and we adopt it in the form in which it appears at Fed.R.Evid. 803(1).\u201d The federal rule defines \u201cpresent sense impression\u201d as follows: \u201cA statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately thereafter.\u201d As the Court pointed out in <em>Booth, </em>\u201cHowever, because the presumed reliability of a statement of present sense impression flows from the fact of spontaneity, the time interval between observation and utterance must be very short.\u201d 306 Md. at 324, 508 A.2d 976. <em>See also, United States v. Narciso, </em>446 F.Supp. 252 (1977); <em>Picker X-Ray Corpora</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>tion v. </em>Frerker; 405 F.2d 916 (1969). In the instant case, the record does not reflect how long after the event the victim made the diary entry. Since there was no evidence to show that the diary entry was made contemporaneously with, or even immediately after, the events described therein, it was not admissible as a present sense impression. <em>See United States v. Nanny, </em>745 F.Supp. 475 (1989); <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>765 F.2d 1020 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">We nonetheless reject the appellant\u2019s claim that the court permitted the introduction of inadmissible hearsay. \u201cHearsay may be defined as an out-of-court assertion offered in court for the truth of the matter asserted, resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u201d <em>Ali v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 339, 507 A.2d 648 (1986). A careful review of the cross-examination we have recounted reveals that the victim\u2019s diary was not offered for the truth of the matters asserted therein. Indeed, the diary was not \u201coffered\u201d at all. It was not admitted in evidence, nor did any witness testify as to its contents. The prosecutor did, however, read an excerpt from the diary and ultimately asked the appellant whether that described his presence at the Cullen home on August 12th. There was no direct response and, consequently, the prosecutor abandoned that question and propounded several direct questions to the appellant. The answers to those questions given by the appellant rested upon his credibility, not that of the victim. The questions themselves were not evidence; indeed, the trial judge so instructed the jury. They may, however, have run afoul of the rule prohibiting questions that assume facts not in evidence. <em>See Tirado v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 536, 550, 622 A.2d 187 (1993). Error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 652, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The appellant\u2019s taped confession was entered into evidence in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. The appellant subsequently testified that he was threatened, beaten, and induced into making the statement, and further asserted that his knowl\u2022edge of the crimes came solely from his co-conspirator, Troy Shellington. The appellant testified that Shellington had related to him the story of the victim\u2019s death immediately before the appellant\u2019s arrest, and that the appellant had then instructed Shellington to 'write down everything he knew about the crimes so that the appellant could help Shellington. The appellant also testified that he implicated himself during the taped statement because the police had suggested that only then could he be a State\u2019s witness against Shellington.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On rebuttal, the State called the police officers who testified that the appellant was not threatened, beaten, or induced into making the statement, but rather that it was given freely and voluntarily. Detective Sergeant Nolan testified that he was not aware of any notes recovered from Shellington either at the time of his arrest or at the time of booking.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Following rebuttal, the appellant sought to admit, as surrebuttal evidence, handwritten notes allegedly written by Shellington, although counsel offered the notes, \u201cnot necessarily for the truthfulness of \u2019em, but the fact that they were written by Mr. Shellington....\u201d The State replied that the notes were not in Shellington\u2019s handwriting and were inadmissible hearsay. The trial court ruled that the notes were beyond the scope of rebuttal, and therefore did not rule on their reliability. The appellant contends that the notes should have been admitted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The trial court correctly ruled that the notes were not proper surrebuttal. \u201cSurrebuttal is essentially a rebuttal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to a rebuttal.\u201d <em>Solko v. State Roads Commission, </em>82 Md.App. 137, 149, 570 A.2d 373, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 222, 577 A.2d 50 (1990). Thus, the principles applicable to the admissibility of rebuttal evidence are equally applicable to surrebuttal evidence. The question of what constitutes proper rebuttal evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 592, 602, 531 A.2d 1305 (1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>317 Md. 160, 562 A.2d 1234 (1989). The trial court\u2019s determination will not be reversed on appeal unless the ruling is both \u201cmanifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u201d <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 498, 507, 501 A.2d 111 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 599, 505 A.2d 856 (1986) (quoting <em>Huffington v. State, </em>295 Md. 1, 14, 452 A.2d 1211 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not \u201cmanifestly wrong.\u201d The State\u2019s rebuttal evidence replied to the appellant\u2019s testimony that his taped confession had been involuntary. The proposed surrebuttal, relating to notes that Shellington had allegedly made regarding the crime, would not have replied to the voluntariness issue. Admission of the notes would not have advanced the appellant\u2019s theory of involuntariness; only evidence tending to show that the police unlawfully convinced him to implicate himself would have done so. The court did not err in refusing to admit the statement as surrebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The appellant filed a pretrial motion to suppress the audiotaped confession he made to the police, and a pretrial hearing was held on the motion. The appellant testified at the hearing, as he did later at trial, that he was physically beaten and stabbed with a pencil, that he was threatened in various ways including the possible deportation of his mother, that he was offered various inducements, that he was not afforded an opportunity to drink when he was thirsty or to use the restroom, and that in various other ways, the officers overbore his free will. The officers testified that none of this occurred. The hearing judge believed the officers and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Th\u00e9 appellant contends that the statement should nevertheless have been suppressed. First, he claims that the statement itself shows that it was the product of an improper inducement. (\u201cI was told that it will help ease time on myself and help the court see that it wasn\u2019t something planned or premeditated.\u201d) Second, he claims that the statement was involuntary under the totality of the circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The standard for our review was set forth by Judge Orth in <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990). (Citations omitted.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">When the question is whether a constitutional right, such as the one here, has been violated, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal. We make the appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the peculiar facts of the particular case. When the facts are in dispute, we accept them as found by the trial judge unless he is clearly erroneous in his judgment on the evidence before him. In ascertaining whether he is clearly erroneous, we give \u201cdue regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d as commanded by Md.Rule 8-131(c). When the question of the dishonor of a constitutional right arises by the denial of a motion to suppress, the relevant facts which we consider \u201care limited to those produced at the suppression hearing, which are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asl\">We have reviewed the transcript of the appellant\u2019s audio-taped confession and the transcript of the suppression hearing. We are satisfied from our own independent constitutional appraisal of the totality of the circumstances that the appellant\u2019s confession was not involuntary. The court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-5\">. This case is obviously distinguishable on its facts from <em>Crawford v. State, </em>285 Md. 431, 453, 404 A.2d 244 (1979), wherein the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">In the particular circumstances of this case, we believe that the placing before the jury of challenged portions of the interrogations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>did not meet the \"civilized standards for a fair and impartial trial.\u201d ....
