Rosenberg, executors of M. Reese,\u201d and the city and county taxes mentioned in the complaint were levied thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The same property was assessed to- the executors .for State and county taxes levied thereon in the county of San Mateo for the same fiscal year, which taxes were paid by the executors in pursuance of an order of the Superior Court of the county of San Mateo (where the estate is in process of administration) directing the executors to pay the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The question is whether the' property was assessable in San Mateo or in San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>It is a settled rule that a general deposit is in effect a loan, the relation of the bank and depositor being that of debtor and creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Where, then, should the credits\u2014the amounts due from the banks to the estate\u2014have been assessed?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Constitution (art. xiii. \u00a7 10) provides that all property, except certain railroad property, shall be assessed in the county where it is situated; and section 3629 of the Political Code requires of the assessor to exact \u201cfrom each person\u201d a statement in writing showing all property belonging to, claimed by, or in possession of such person, and \u201c the county in which such property is situated, <em>or in which it is liable to taxation,\u201d </em>etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Neither the Constitution nor the section of the Political Code referred to defines the <em>situs </em>of any property, and that is to be determined by the application of recognized principles of law. In the absence of statutory provisions on the subject, the <em>situs </em>of all personal property would follow the person of the owner. For most judicial purposes a <em>debt </em>or credit has no <em>situs </em>or locality. (Burrill\u2019s L. D. <em>verb, situs; </em>2 Kent\u2019s Com. 458, note.) But when credits are made the subject of taxation, it is appropriate that their locality should be referred to the residence of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Home Insurance Co. </em>29 Cal. 533, it was held that personal property in this State belonging to a non-resident of the State may be assessed to the owner. As the statute required all property within the State to be taxed, it Ayas held that, as to certain bonds Avithin the State, the provisions of the lavv could be given effect only by distinguishing between the actual position of the property and its ordinary legal <em>situs. </em>Mr. Justice Savvyer said: \u201cWe think the bonds, or at least that which is symbolized or represented by them, are \u2018 property Avithin this State,\u2019 within the meaning of the act. And this vievv <em>is not in conflict </em>with that adopted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Park, </em>23 Cal. 139, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>25 Cal. 601. In those cases the owner resided in the State, and there Avas no occasion to consider whether the actual was different from the fictitious legal <em>situs </em>of the \u2018money loaned\u2019 or \u2018solvent debt,\u2019 and the owner being a resident of the State, the proper place to tax this species of property, under the statute, was his place of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holladay, 25 </em>Cal. 306, it was held that, by reason of provisions of the revenue law in force when that case was decided, it was the duty of an assessor to assess <em>eattle </em>which were in his county between the first Mondays of March and August. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ilolladay </em>was decided at the April term, 1864. That the case did not decide that intangible property, as credits, should be assessed in any other county than that of the residence of the creditor is apparent from the fact that, at the July term of the same year, it was adjudged in <em>People </em>v. <em>Eastman, 25 </em>Cal. 601, that an assessment of a debt secured by mortgage should be made where the creditor resides, and not in the county where the mortgaged premises are situated; and. that the debt, <em>when the creditor resides in the State, </em>has no <em>situs </em>for the purpose of taxation apart from the residence of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>35 Cal. 286, it was held that under the revenue law of 1861, a <em>situs </em>was assigned to tangible personal property\u2014a schooner\u2014in the county where it remained permanently, although it was not the county of the owner\u2019s residence. This case and others are commented upon in <em>People </em>v. <em>Whartenby, </em>38 Cal. 466, where it was said: \u201c A debt as such has no <em>situs, </em>but follows the person of the creditor. Indeed it may be stated as a general rule, that all personal property, of whatsoever character (which, in the nature of things, is transitory), is, in law presumed to follow the person of the owner.....In some exceptional cases, however, and for some especial purposes, the. rule has been varied by statute. In this State, for example, visible, tangible property is to be taxed in the county in which it is found at the time of assessment. (Stats. 1861, p. 423.) But there is no provision to the effect that \u2018 money at interest\u2019 or debts due to the person assessed shall be assessed in the county in which the debtor resides; and hence those come under the general rule, that personal property follows the person of the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Park, </em>23 Cal. 139, the Supreme Court said: \u201cWe think the proper construction of the revenue law of 1860 is that all personal property of a tangible character was properly taxable in the county where it was actually situated at the time of the commencement of the assessment; but choses in action and property of an intangible character, such as debts, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>like cannot be said to be \u2018within the district <em>\u2019 </em>of the assessor, and are therefore taxable in the county where the owner resides at the time. They could not properly be assessed where the debtors reside, as they may be non-residents or reside in several <em>counties; </em>nor where the property on which it may be secured is located, for that might be in several counties, and it is the debt, not the security, which is properly taxable.\u201d (16 Cal. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">So far as they may affect the question we have considered there is no substantial difference between the provisions of the Political Code and those of the several revenue acts which existed prior to its adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">If the testator were living and the moneys had been deposited by him, the amount of the debts due by the banks to him would be taxable in San Mateo, the county of his residence. The <em>situs </em>of the property, for taxation purposes, does not change upon the death of the owner. The personal property of decedents is taxed at the former domicil of the decedent. \u201c During the settlement of the estate it must have a <em>situs </em>somewhere, and none so appropriate as where the decedent lived.\u201d (Burroughs on Taxation, 224.) This is true of the property which would be taxable at the residence of the decedent, did he still <em>survive; </em>that is, of credits, which have a <em>situs </em>attributed to them when they are made taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with directions to the court to enter judgment on the findings in favor o'f the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Morrison, C. J., Myrick, J., Sharpstein, J., McKee, J., Boss, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
