W. KIRKHAM, Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b537-12\">Constitutional Law\u2014Assessment fob Local Impbovements\u2014Powebs of the Leoislatube. \u2014 The act of the legislature of April 1, 187G. authorizing the city of Oakland to construct a bridge across the estuary of San Antonio, and declaring that the cost should be assessed upon certain specified lands, therein declared to be benefited, in proportion to such benefits, and providing for a commission to apportion the cost, is constitutional.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b537-13\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-14\">The act of the legislature of April 1, 1876, referred to in the opinion, declared that the cost of the bridge which it authorized to be constructed should be assessed upon certain specified land declared by the act to be benefited thereby, in proportion to such benefits, and commissioners were to be appointed to make the apportionment of the cost to the lots designated by the act. The commissioners found that certain specified lots belonging to defendant were benefited to the extent of $1,950.66, and it was to recover this assessment that the action was instituted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-15\"><em>C.

To this we are unable to assent. Nor can we say that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the findings of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
