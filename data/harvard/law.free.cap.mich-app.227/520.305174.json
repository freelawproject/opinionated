For reasons that will be stated, we hold that despite an arbitration panel\u2019s prior contrary ruling, the MERC properly decided that \u00a7 8.1 of the parties\u2019 July 1, 1988, to June 30, 1991, collective bargaining agreement did not constitute a mandatory bargaining subject. We therefore affirm the merc\u2019s March 20, 1996, decision and order, vacate the arbitration panel\u2019s December 6, 1994, award, and vacate the Jackson Circuit Court\u2019s June 12, 1995, order affirming the arbitration award and its February 2, 1996, injunction requiring the City of Jackson to comply with that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Strikes by public employees are forbidden by \u00a7 2 of the public employment relations act (pera), MCL 423.202; MSA 17.455(2). Section 15 of the PERA, MCL 423.215; MSA 17.455(15), requires a public employer to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees \u201cwith respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. . . .\u201d Issues falling into those categories are deemed to be <em>mandatory </em>subjects of bargaining, while all other matters are considered to be <em>permissive </em>bargaining subjects. <em>Local 1277, Metropolitan Council No 23, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v Center Line, </em>414 Mich 642, 652; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>327 NW2d 822 (1982). Because \u201c[c]ompulsory arbitration in police and fire disputes was seen as a necessary tradeoff for the prohibition against striking,\u201d the Legislature enacted the compulsory arbitration statute, 1969 PA 312, MCL 423.231 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.455(31) <em>et seq. Local 1277, supra </em>at 650-651. Act 312 \u201cis separate and distinct from pera, dealing with the particular problems of labor disputes with policemen and firemen.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Council No 23, Local 1277, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v Center Line, </em>78 Mich App 281, 284; 259 NW2d 460 (1977). \u201cGiven the fact that Act 312 complements pera and that under \u00a7 15 of pera the duty to bargain only extends to mandatory subjects,\u201d it follows that an Act 312 arbitration panel \u201ccan only compel agreement as to mandatory subjects.\u201d <em>Local 1277, supra </em>at 414 Mich 654. When the question whether a matter is mandatorily bargainable arises in an Act 312 arbitration proceeding, the MERC, noting the availability of ultimate judicial review, has recognized that, in the absence of or concurrent with MERC rulings, the arbitration panel has jurisdiction to resolve that question before or as part of the panel\u2019s consideration of disputed contract issues. <em>Detroit v Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n, Local 3344, IAFF, </em>1990 MERC Lab Op 859, 862; <em>Detroit v Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n, Local 344, IAFF, </em>1990 MERC Lab Op 561, 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Applying these principles to the present facts, we note that the crux of these appeals is art 8, \u00a7 8.1 of the July 1, 1988, to June 30, 1991, collective bargaining agreement between the city and the Jackson Fire Fighters Association, Local 1306, IAFF, AFL-CIO (the union), which states, in pertinent part, \u201cThe City shall at all times maintain a minimum complement of fif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>teen (15) 24-hour fire fighters on duty on each shift.\u201d The union demanded the retention of \u00a7 8.1 in the parties\u2019 proposed 1991-94 labor contract, contending that it was a mandatory subject of collective bargaming. The city, wishing to reduce per-shift staffing, objected, maintaining that \u00a7 8.1 was a permissive bargaining subject. When the parties reached an impasse, the issue was submitted to arbitration pursuant to Act 312. The arbitration panel ruled that \u00a7 8.1 constituted a mandatory subject of bargaining within the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, concluded that the city\u2019s proposed reduction in per-shift manning would adversely affect fire fighter safety, and ordered that \u00a7 8.1 be retained unchanged in any 1991-94 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Pursuant to the city\u2019s petition for review and the union\u2019s complaints, the Jackson Circuit Court affirmed the arbitration panel\u2019s award and entered a permanent injunction ordering the city to comply with \u00a7 8.1. This Court denied the city\u2019s applications for leave to appeal these rulings, Docket Nos. 187236 and 187801.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Meanwhile, the city filed an unfair labor practice charge with the merc, accusing the union of unlawfully demanding that the city bargain with respect to \u00a7 8.1. The hearing referee rejected the union\u2019s argument that, because the Act 312 arbitration panel had already held \u00a7 8.1 to be mandatorily bargainable, the MERC was preempted from addressing that issue. The referee stated, \u201cIt is clear . . . that the [MERC] is not bound by the panel\u2019s decision regarding whether the daily staffing provision is a mandatoiy subject of bargaining; just the reverse is true: the arbitration panel is bound by the [merc\u2019s] determinations.\u201d The referee also found \u201cthe daily minimum manning provision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>be a permissive subject of bargaining only,\u201d and ruled that the union had violated its bargaining duty under the PERA by \u201csubmitting this proposal to an Act 312 arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">On March 20, 1996, the MERC issued a unanimous decision and order affirming the decision of the hearing referee, holding that the arbitration panel did not have concurrent jurisdiction with the MERC to decide the \u00a7 8.1 issue, that \u201ccollateral estoppel is not appropriate where, as here, primary jurisdiction has been given by the [Legislature to an administrative agency,\u201d that any conflict between the panel\u2019s and the merc\u2019s rulings could be resolved by judicial review, and that the evidence failed to establish that \u00a7 8.1 adversely affected fire fighter safety. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The merc \u2014 and not an Act 312 arbitration panel\u2014 has authority to implement the pera, <em>AFSCME, Council 25 v Wayne Co, </em>152 Mich App 87, 99; 393 NW2d 889 (1986), and possesses exclusive jurisdiction over unfair labor practice charges, <em>Lamphere Schools v Lamphere Federation of Teachers, </em>400 Mich 104, 118; 252 NW2d 818 (1977); <em>Rockwell v Crestwood School Dist Bd of Ed, </em>393 Mich 616, 630; 227 NW2d 736 (1975). Furthermore, Act 312 was intended to supplement the pera, not control it. MCL 423.244; MSA 17.455(44); <em>Local 1277, supra </em>at 414 Mich 652. The panel itself recognized this when it noted that \u201cwe are not free agents,\u201d but \u201c[function] under merc\u2019s auspices,\u201d and its chairman indicated his agreement with, \u201cthe basic and incontrovertible premise that an Act 312 panel functions under MERC\u2019s auspices and is obliged to follow applicable merc decisions.\u201d Therefore, the union\u2019s argument that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the merc from adjudicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u00a7 8.1 is inappropriate because the Legislature has vested primary jurisdiction in the MERC. The fact that under the unusual circumstances of this case the merc\u2019s ruling followed and conflicted with the panel\u2019s does not warrant the conclusion that the MERC was thereby estopped from proceeding as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The union also contends that the merc\u2019s decision is not supported by the evidence. MCL 423.216(e); MSA 17.455(16)(e) provides that the \u201cfindings of the [MERC] with respect to questions of fact if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.\u201d See also Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. In <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>212 Mich App 383, 388; 538 NW2d 37 (1995), this Court stated, \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla but substantially less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">It is important to note that \u00a7 8.1 governs the number of fire fighters on duty per shift, <em>not </em>the number actually assembled at a fire scene. The number at the scene determines what action may safely be undertaken to combat a blaze and may include not only on-duty personnel but also off-duty fire fighters called in, volunteers, and those responding pursuant to mutual assistance pacts with other fire departments. Consequently, the evidence in this case fails to demonstrate a causal nexus between the city\u2019s proposed reduction in daily staffing and fire fighter safety, and the union\u2019s contention that reducing the number of fire fighters on duty would adversely affect safety is without merit. Even if a reduction in the daily staff would delay response to a fire, that affects the level of fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>protection offered the citizens of Jackson and does not raise a safety issue with respect to fire fighters. Sufficient evidence therefore exists to support the merc\u2019s decision and order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">We affirm the merc\u2019s March 20, 1996, decision and order, vacate the arbitration panel\u2019s December 6, 1994, award, and vacate the Jackson Circuit Court\u2019s June 12, 1995, order affirming the arbitration award and its February 2, 1996, injunction requiring the city to comply with that award.
