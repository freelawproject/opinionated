Mother and Father were awarded joint custody, with Child's primary physical care and residence being with Mother. In response to Father's petition to modify custody and concerned\n   about the detrimental impact of Mother's behavior on Child, the district court granted sole legal and physical custody to Father in 2010 (2010 Order). The district court ordered that Mother's parent-time be supervised until she \"changed her mind set with regard to her own parenting abilities and Father's relationship with the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Blocker I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n    2017 UT App 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n    391 P.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). But concerned that supervised parent-time would be impractical for financial reasons, the court permitted Mother to have unsupervised parent-time provided that she retain a special master and participate in individual therapy by herself and joint therapy with Child.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Until she verified compliance with these conditions, Mother's parent-time remained supervised.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2014, in response to Mother's motion to modify the 2010 Order and based on a home study report, the district court temporarily granted Mother unsupervised parent-time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Nearly one year later, having received no other evidence or testimony, the court decided to make Mother's unsupervised parent-time permanent without entering any findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Father appealed, and we determined that the court had made its order granting unsupervised parent-time to Mother \"permanent without explaining the basis for its decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Because the court modified the parent-time requirements without providing any findings, we concluded that we were unable to review its decision and remanded for more detailed findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Regarding the changed circumstances, on remand the district court made the following findings of fact: (1) Mother had continued professional therapy; (2) Mother and Mother's father were maintaining a relationship with Child by going to Father's house and being allowed to spend time with Child in their car, at the curbside, for about one hour, two to three times a week; (3) Father's brother (Uncle) supervised visits between Mother and Child during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays without problems being noted; (4) Child was allowed to sit and visit with Mother and her family during a church Christmas program without incident; (5) Mother was allowed to speak by phone with Child two to three times per week; (6) Child was older when the district court modified parent-time; and (7) Child had received substantial therapy at the time the district court modified parent-time. The court also identified three circumstances that rendered the 2010 Order unenforceable: (1) the parties were unable to afford the cost of supervised exchanges, supervised visitation, or the services of a special master; (2) the therapist identified in the 2010 Order to oversee therapy of Mother and Child was no longer available; and (3) the agency assigned to supervise Mother's parent-time in the 2010 Order was no longer in business in Mother's geographical area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Regarding Child's best interest, the district court on remand noted that both parties \"wished to reasonably accommodate a relationship between [Child] and [Mother].\" The court explained that \"curbside parent time ... was not in the best interest of [Child]. He needed a more reasonable and less artificial opportunity to know his [Mother] and her family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The district court further described the process by which it granted Mother unsupervised parent-time. Because parent-time supervised by Uncle had been \"successful and without incident,\" the court concluded that Mother should be allowed to exercise unsupervised parent-time on a temporary basis. At the time the district court modified parent-time, Mother had been exercising unsupervised parent-time for nearly one year without any reported incidents. Although Father speculated that Mother was engaging in \"parental alienation\" during her parent-time, the court noted that Father offered no evidence to support this contention. The court concluded by pointing out, \"[Child] was 6 years older and in spite of the curbside restrictions and other difficulties over the years, he and [Mother] had developed and continued to maintain a positive parent/child relationship.\" And with regard to Mother, the court noted that she had \"demonstrated an ability through the evaluation and her practice over several months to maintain a\n   reasonable relationship with [Child].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court concluded that it was appropriate to \"reconcile the now unenforceable 2010 Order and the current state of affairs\" by allowing unsupervised parent-time as the means to \"most effectively foster a continuing relationship\" between Child and Mother. Father appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The first issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it determined that the unenforceability of the conditions for Mother to have unsupervised parent-time with Child constituted a material change in circumstances to support a modification of the parent-time arrangements in the 2010 Order. The second issue is whether the district court erred by not conducting a best interest analysis when it modified the parent-time conditions of the 2010 Order. Both issues share the same standard of review. \"We review a district court's decisions regarding parent-time for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794981\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/45/\">\n    2016 UT App 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794981\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/45/\">\n    374 P.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The district court's proximity to the evidence places it in a better position than an appellate court to choose the best custody arrangement.

The Preclusion of Previously Disposed Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 With regard to the first issue, we note that the scope of our review of the district court's post-remand ruling is limited by the mandate rule. \"The mandate rule, a subset of the law of the case doctrine, binds both the district court and the parties to honor the mandate of the appellate court. Under this rule, the decisions of an appellate court become the law of the case and cannot be reconsidered on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, when this court disposes of an argument as inadequately briefed, \"the law of the case doctrine precludes us from addressing this argument anew.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NPEC LLC v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2085\">\n    2018 UT App 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570512\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/357/\">\n    427 P.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (per curiam) (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Under the mandate rule, Father cannot re-litigate on remand issues we previously determined were inadequately briefed. But this is exactly what he does now. In this post-remand appeal, Father reintroduces a previously disposed issue by presenting two arguments in support of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 First, he argues, \"The district court abused its discretion when it used Mother's inability to comply with the conditions [for unsupervised parent-time] in the initial Parent Time Order as a change in circumstances to justify modification of [Mother's] parent time because those circumstances were not those upon which the earlier decision was based.\" Next, Father argues, \"[T]he district court abused its discretion in finding that [Mother's] unwillingness to comply with a standing court order provided the basis for a change in circumstances sufficient to modify parent time as such rewards a noncompliant parent and incentivizes her to continue her noncompliant behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Similarly, in his previous appeal, Father argued, \"The [district] court erred when it decided that [Mother's] inability to comply with conditions for her unsupervised parent time constituted a material change in circumstances upon which to base a modification of a custody award.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A panel of this court\n   declined to address this issue because it was inadequately briefed.\n   <em>\n    Blocker I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n    2017 UT App 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342573\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1051/\">\n    391 P.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Thus, in this post-remand appeal, Father raises essentially the same issue-namely, that the district court erred in concluding the unenforceability of the original parent-time conditions constituted a material change in circumstances-that he raised in his original appeal. But we have already declined to address this very issue in Father's original appeal due to inadequate briefing. \"In effect, [Father] now attempts to supplement the briefing submitted in his earlier appeal. The mandate rule bars such attempts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. MacNeill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176777\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/60/\">\n    2016 UT App 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176777\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/380/60/\">\n    380 P.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we decline to reconsider this issue in Father's post-remand appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II.

First, it was to enter findings of fact to support its ruling modifying parent-time. Second, based on those findings,\n   the district court needed to explain the process by which it concluded that eliminating supervised parent-time was in the best interest of Child. The district court completed both tasks in its post-remand decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 First, the district court identified changed circumstances that supported its decision to modify parent-time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Most notable among these is that Mother and Child had received substantial therapy at the time of the modification, there had been no problems reported during Mother's supervised parent-time, and Child was older and had grown in maturity. The 2010 Order stated that supervised parent-time was to continue \"until such time that [Mother] demonstrates that she has changed her mind set with regard to her own parenting abilities and [Father's] relationship with [Child].\" Mother's reception of therapy and the absence of reported problems are changed circumstances relative to the condition (that is, Mother's uncooperative mind-set) that originally gave rise to the imposition of supervised parent-time. The court also noted that modification was necessary because the conditions (namely, the prohibitive costs associated with supervised parent-time, the unavailability of a joint therapist, and the demise of the original supervising agency) originally imposed for Mother's unsupervised exercise of parent-time had so substantially changed as to make the 2010 Order unenforceable. By highlighting these changed circumstances, the district court made \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   showing of a change in circumstances\" necessary to modify parent-time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20184\">\n    2018 UT App 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574737\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/437/370/\">\n    437 P.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Second, the district court explained the process by which it concluded a modification in parent-time was needed to serve Child's best interest.

Mother had exercised this parent-time without incident. The court also noted that, given the parties' desire \"to reasonably accommodate a relationship\" between Child and Mother, \"curbside parent time ... was not in the best interest of [Child]\" because \"[Child] needed a more reasonable and less artificial opportunity to know his [Mother] and her family.\" Thus, the court allowed Uncle to continue to supervise Mother's parent-time on a temporary basis. And at the same time, the court ordered a home study. The case was set for further review after completion of the home study and continuation of parent-time supervised by Uncle. Four months later, after receiving the home study and hearing that supervised parent-time had been \"successful and without incident,\" the district court granted Mother unsupervised parent-time on a temporary basis. About a year later, the court determined that Mother had exercised unsupervised, statutory parent-time without incident, and it permanently granted her unsupervised parent-time. The court explained that granting Mother unsupervised parent-time was in Child's best interest because \"it would most effectively foster a continuing relationship\" between Child and Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 \"[District] courts have particularly broad discretion in ordering parent-time, and we will only intervene when the [district] court's action is so flagrantly unjust as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.
