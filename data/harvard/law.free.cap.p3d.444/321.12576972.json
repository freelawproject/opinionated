Plaintiff-Appellant RH (\"Father\") and Defendant-Appellee MH (\"Mother\") were divorced on August 25, 2015. Among other things, the divorce decree awarded Father and Mother with joint legal custody of the parties' two children (\"Son\" and \"Daughter\") born during the marriage, awarded Mother with physical custody of Son, and awarded Father with physical custody of Daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 12, 2015, Father filed a Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause and Relief After Order or Decree (\"Motion\"), asking the Family Court of the Third Circuit (\"Family Court\") to reduce his child support for Son and spousal support for Mother. On April 11, 2016, the Family Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   held a hearing on Father's Motion, took the matter under advisement, and urged the parties to resolve the matter themselves. When the parties did not resolve the matter, the Family Court issued the May 23, 2016 Order Granting In Part and Denying In Part Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause and Relief After Order or Decree Filed November 12, 2015 (\"Order\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which provided the following relevant findings of fact (\"FOF\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. At the hearing on this matter, petitioner testified that he never in fact received a salary of $6,000.00 per month but in fact his salary was $4,800 per month. However, the Business Agreement submitted by petitioner indicates that petitioner had agreed to take a pay cut from a gross of $6,000 to month to $4,000.00 per month \"for the next year.\" This agreement was signed October 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   2015 by the petitioner and October 30, 2015 by Mr. Booku.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4. Petitioner also testified that Hawaiian Walkways pays him $1,200 per month for rent for parking certain vehicles at his home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Order also provided the following relevant conclusions of law (\"COL\"):\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. The evidence on Petitioner's income comes from his testimony and the business agreement with no check stubs, pay slips or other documentation to support the testimony. The testimony itself is highly contradictory. During his divorce he claimed to make, $6,000.00 per month. A[t] the hearing he testified that he never made $6,000 per month but only $4,800 per month. Yet the Business Agreement indicates that his salary was being reduced for $6,000.00 per month to $4,000.00 per month. No explanation was given as to why a writing was needed to reduce Petitioner's salary for $6,000.00 per month to $4,000.00 per month if in fact he was only being paid $4,800 per month, or why the writing did not reduce his salary for $4,800 to $4,000. Even if the original $6,000 per month income was the total of a $4,800 salary and $1,200 rent, the reduction of income to $4,000 does not make sense as Petitioner claims to presently have a $4,000 salary plus a rental income of $1,200. Given the contradictory evidence and the lack of supporting documentation, the court can not find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Petitioner's income has changed. While Respondent's income has changed, some change was contemplated in that alimony was to continue even if Respondent remarried. Given both of these factors, the court does not find a change in circumstances to justify a modification of alimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [3]. Petitioner has a gross income of $6,000.00 per month less $2,284 in alimony leaving $3716. ($6000 - $2284 = $3716.) The court finds respondents gross income to be $1,500 + $2,284 (alimony) = $3,784. Given these figures and each having one child, the child support obligations of each party are the same and neither party will pay child support to the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Father timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, we construe Father's points of error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) The Circuit Court erred in its FOF 3 and COL 1 because it incorrectly found and concluded that Father had not provided enough explanation as to why the claim of $6,000 was reduced to $4,000;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (2) The Circuit Court erred in its COL 1 because it incorrectly concluded that Father provided no check stubs in his evidence at trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) The Circuit Court erred in its FOF 4 because it incorrectly found that Father received a rental income of $1,200; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) The Circuit Court erred in its COL 3 because it incorrectly stated that Father had only one child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Father's points of error as follows and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Father's opening brief fails to adhere to the requirements of Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (\"HRAP\") Rule 28(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The opening brief does not contain the required concise statement of the case, or any references to the record.

We agree with Father that the Family Court erred when it found that Father did not submit \"check stubs, pay slips or other documentation to support the testimony\". Though this statement was included in COL 1, the statement itself was a finding of fact and not a conclusion of law.
