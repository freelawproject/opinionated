He argues the district court erred in applying the doctrine of chances and improperly admitted prejudicial prior act evidence. He also argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request the trial court judge's disqualification based on remarks she made during a pretrial hearing. We reject Lane's ineffective assistance of counsel claim but conclude the prior act evidence should have been excluded and therefore remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Lane lives in Salt Lake City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February 2016, he was in a physical altercation with the victim (Victim) at a homeless shelter. Lane was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person. Trial was held in August 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Victim was the first witness to testify. Victim previously lived at the shelter and returned there that day to pick up mail. After realizing the mailroom was closed, he wandered around talking to people. There were \"50 to 100 people milling around\" the shelter, including Lane. Victim testified that as he was talking, he \"got side blinded, got punched in the face and ... just started swinging back at the direction that it came from.\" Several people broke up the fight. Victim \"took a few steps\" back and \"then it started up again.\" Victim testified he got\n   punched again, \"went down to duck a punch,\" and when he came back up, he \"was bleeding.\" He thought he had just been punched but guessed he \"ended up getting sliced.\" Victim sustained three lacerations to his face as a result of the incident. Lane ended up with a small cut on his finger. Victim denied using a knife in the altercation and denied having one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 The State presented surveillance footage of the incident. At first, Victim could not identify himself on the video recording and testified he was unsure with whom he was fighting. Victim added that it was \"hard to see\" what was going on in the footage. He testified multiple times he did not know who hit him. After the altercation, Victim left the scene to try to catch a train to a hospital. He was bleeding severely and had a towel on his face when he was stopped by a security officer. Police officers arrived and called for an ambulance. Victim was treated at a hospital for his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 A witness (Witness) to the altercation also testified. Witness was a shelter resident who saw Lane and Victim \"get into an altercation\" and then being \"pulled apart.\" He testified he saw Lane \"excuse[ ] himself,\" but then \"they got into [a] second altercation [and he] noticed both of them had blades.\" \"A crowd was following them,\" and \"when [Lane] left and [Victim] pursued,\" the crowd \"let them get into it again.\" Witness saw Lane \"sidestep [Victim] and throw a punch back at him.\" Witness testified that Lane \"clearly took off ... [and] was trying to avoid that whole mess.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 One of the responding officers (Officer) also testified. Officer commonly patrols the shelter and considers it a \"high crime area.\" He investigates \"anywhere from 15 to 30\" incidents a day, ranging from \"drug crimes on up to pretty serious cases.\" He testified that it is \"not uncommon for people to have guns and all sorts of other things down there.\" He arrived on the scene and Victim told him that he challenged Lane first for \"being a big mouth\" and \"acting tough.\" When shown footage of the incident, Officer testified he \"couldn't tell a whole lot from the surveillance video.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 The second day of trial primarily consisted of testimony regarding two prior incidents involving Lane. Before trial, the State filed a motion asking the court to admit evidence of incidents that occurred at the shelter in 2012 (2012 Incident) and 2015 (2015 Incident). The State sought to introduce the evidence under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence or, in the alternative, the doctrine of chances. The State argued that these incidents were offered for a proper non-character purpose under rule 404(b) to show \"intent, plan, absence of mistake, motive, lack of accident, and to rebut [Lane's] self-defense claim.\" Specifically, the State argued that \"the prior bad act evidence will prove [Lane assaulted Victim with unlawful force or violence] by showing that [Lane] knew what he was doing when he assaulted [Victim] with a sharp object, that he had a plan and motive to injure [Victim], and that he was not acting in self-defense.\" The State also argued this evidence was relevant and that the probative value was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 In the alternative, the State argued the evidence should be admitted under the doctrine of chances. The State contended \"the evidence of [Lane's] two prior bad acts [was] offered to counter his claim of self-defense in the current case\" and to \"show that it is unlikely that [he] would be placed in a situation three times in four years that would require cutting the victims' faces in self-defense.\" The State claimed it was not \"assert[ing] that [Lane] has a propensity for cutting faces.\" The State argued that the evidence was relevant, it was being offered for a proper non-character purpose, and its probative value substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b69 The district court ruled that the two prior incidents involving Lane were admissible under the doctrine of chances because the foundational requirements were met (that is, materiality, similarity, independence, and frequency). The court admitted the evidence of the two incidents on this ground but did not evaluate it under rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b610 At trial, the following evidence was presented regarding the 2015 Incident. A woman (2015 Witness) who once lived at the\n   shelter testified first. She testified that the altercation began with Lane arguing with a man and Lane was \"as always ... letting him know who he was.\" 2015 Witness testified that after the two stopped yelling Lane walked away, then returned and \"slashed\" the man in the face. She testified the other man did not have a weapon. After that, 2015 Witness approached the man and put a shirt on his face and waited for medical assistance. After 2015 Witness was excused, the court-without prompting from the parties-reminded the jury that the \"last witness has to do with a separate incident from the one we talked about yesterday. And witnesses from here on out are separate, right? 2015 instead of 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b611 A responding officer (2015 Officer) also testified about the 2015 Incident. He was patrolling the shelter that day and separated Lane from a man with whom Lane was arguing. A few minutes after separating the men, 2015 Officer was called to respond to a \"fight with a knife.\" As 2015 Officer approached, he saw a man \"being attended to by several other individuals ... [and 2015 Officer] could see blood seeping through [a] cloth [held to the man's face]. There was blood on the ground and then also blood on the [man's] shirt.\" The individuals attending to the man told 2015 Officer that Lane cut him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When 2015 Officer encountered Lane after the incident, Lane told 2015 Officer \"it was self-defense.\" Another responding officer testified that officers seized a box cutter from Lane. The other man was transported to the hospital for a \"deep laceration\" on the left side of his face \"starting just above the ear and continuing all the way down to the corner of his mouth.\" Lane was later charged with assault in connection with the 2015 Incident. The case went to trial and a jury found Lane not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b612 The State next introduced evidence from the 2012 Incident. A responding officer (2012 Officer) was called to the shelter on a report of a \"man with a knife.\" 2012 Officer \"noticed [Lane] bleeding from the mouth, [and it] looked like he'd been involved in an altercation.\" 2012 Officer observed a knife approximately seven to eight feet away from Lane that was \"silver in color, had a wooden handle, [and] about a 4-inch blade.\" Lane told 2012 Officer the knife was his. 2012 Officer could not recall whether there was blood on it. He testified Lane was the only individual bleeding. A second officer testified that Lane said the man he was fighting with \"struck him with a head-butt and then punched him and then [Lane] drew a knife.\" Lane claimed he produced the knife in self-defense. He pled guilty to assault for the 2012 Incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b613 At the conclusion of trial, the jury convicted Lane of two felony charges: aggravated assault and possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person. The court sentenced Lane and he appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b614 Lane raises two issues on appeal. First, Lane contends the district court improperly applied the doctrine of chances analysis in admitting evidence of the 2012 and 2015 incidents. \"The appropriate standard of review for a district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence is abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior Act Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Lane argues the district court improperly applied the doctrine of chances in admitting evidence of the 2012 and 2015 incidents. Specifically, Lane contends the court erred in admitting the prior act evidence under rule 404(b) without also weighing it under rule 403. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 It is \"fundamental in our law that a person can be convicted only for acts committed, and not because of general character or a proclivity to commit bad acts.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This concept is articulated in rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence, which provides that \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" Utah R.

The State claimed it was offering the evidence to show Lane's \"non-character purpose of intent, plan, absence of mistake, motive, lack of accident, and to rebut [his] self-defense claim.\" Specifically, the State argued the evidence would prove Lane's unlawful use of force or violence \"by showing that [he] knew what he was doing when he assaulted [Victim] with a sharp object, that he had a plan and motive to injure [Victim], and that he was not acting in self-defense, but that he was, in fact, the actual aggressor.\" The State also argued the evidence should be admitted under the doctrine of chances. It argued that the prior act evidence shows that \"it is unlikely that [Lane] would be placed in a situation three times in four years that would require cutting\n   the victims' faces in self-defense.\" The State claimed it was not asserting that Lane \"has a propensity for cutting faces.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b624 Merely stating that evidence is not being offered for propensity purposes does not mean the evidence does not present an improper propensity inference. First, it is not highly strange or unlikely that Lane would need to defend himself multiple times over years of living in a high crime area. Officer testified at trial that he encounters many individuals carrying weapons in that area and responds to \"15 to 30\" incidents a day ranging from \"drug crimes\" up to \"pretty serious cases.\" Further, the proffered use of the evidence presented by the State is substantially outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial inference that Lane has the character of someone who continuously provokes altercations, cuts the faces of his victims, and then claims self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b625 The way the evidence was presented at trial also supports our conclusion that the prior act evidence in this case presented a prejudicial propensity inference. In opening statements the State told the jury how to view the prior act evidence. \"We're here today on an aggravated assault case so I want to tell you a little bit about that. In [2015], prior to the incident in 2016 that we'll be trying over the next two days, the defendant got into an argument with an individual.\" The State continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Lane] pulled out a box cutter and sliced ... [the individual] across the face, opening his cheek. When [Lane] was arrested ... he said he was only defending himself, it was self-defense. But then he said he would do it again.

The evidence presented at trial for Lane's 2016 charges, standing alone, was weak and based on circumstantial evidence. Victim never identified Lane as his attacker, none of the police officer witnesses saw the incident, and the defense witness testified he saw Lane \"trying to avoid that whole mess\" and that \"both [Lane and Victim] had blades.\" Also, the surveillance footage from 2016 was blurry and it was \"hard to see\" what occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 The prior act evidence also took up a significant portion of the two-day trial. The State finished presenting its evidence of the 2016 charges on the first day and spent most of the second day presenting the prior act evidence. Further, at the beginning of the second day, after the first witness testified regarding the prior act evidence, the court sua sponte addressed the jury to remind it that the State was no longer presenting evidence of Lane's 2016 charges. Based on how the evidence presented at trial, it was possible that Lane's conviction \"reflected the jury's assessment of his character, rather than the evidence of the crime he was charged with.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The stipulated instruction states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   You have heard evidence that [Lane] brandished a knife in a fight and that he cut an individual's face with a box cutter. Both of these acts occurred before the acts charged in this case. You may consider this evidence, if at all, for the limited purpose of self-defense. This evidence was not admitted to prove a character trait of the defendant or to show that he acted in a manner consistent with such a trait. Keep in mind that the defendant is on trial for the crimes charged in this case, and for those crimes only. You may not convict a person simply because you believe he may have committed some other acts at another time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The State argues any improper use of the 2012 and 2015 incidents at trial was cured through this instruction. We disagree that this instruction properly informed the jury on how to use the evidence from the 2012 and 2015 incidents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Imwinkelried at 878 (noting that the risk of unfair prejudice can be minimized by a \"clear [and] forceful limiting instruction\"). The instruction tells the jury it is allowed to consider the 2012 and 2015 incidents for \"self-defense\" but at the same time it is not allowed to \"convict a person simply because you believe he may have committed some other acts at another time.\" This seems to tell the jury it is allowed to consider Lane's propensity for getting in fights and arguing he was acting in \"self-defense\" while simultaneously telling it not to convict Lane because he may have been in fights before and then claimed \"self-defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 We conclude that the prior act evidence should have been excluded before trial under rule 403 and, had it been excluded, there is a \"reasonable likelihood of a more favorable result.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

But the\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   we are less likely to credit the defendant's claim in this context has little to do with probability and a lot to do with the easily drawn inference that the defendant might be the type of person who commits violent acts. The fact that he has been previously involved in violent acts is not usually something that is based on randomness or fortune (like winning the lottery or being struck by lightning). It is based on a whole host of factors, most of which involve non-random, purposeful decisions on the part of the defendant and others. Specifically, becoming involved in violent acts involves human decision-making, and a person's state of mind when he commits those acts-e.g., whether the person acted in self-defense-is also volitional rather than random.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b642 That is, in many instances, the reasons a person is involved in incidents resulting in violent acts, and the reasons a person forms a particular\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   while doing so, are not probability-based, and therefore I wonder about the wisdom of trying to apply a probability-based doctrine in this context. The fact that Person A is much more likely than Person B to be involved in a violent scrape\n   and then claim self-defense would seem to have a lot more to do with propensity or with other non-random environmental factors than it does with simple mathematical probabilities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Paul F.

If it were not for the propensity to repeat, the chances, or the probability, that an innocent person and a guilty person would be charged repeatedly would be identical. Hence, the argument hinges on propensity and runs afoul of the first sentence of Rule 404(b).\"). At a minimum, it seems that the variables involved in running a metaphorical probability calculation in this context may be too numerous to make the calculation meaningful in any given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b643 In my view, even assuming the soundness of\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   's underlying probability logic,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 note 8, and even assuming there may exist scenarios in which that logic could be usefully applied in a self-defense (or other volitional) case, the entire exercise is a nonstarter unless two threshold conditions can be met. First, the party asking the court to admit prior bad acts evidence pursuant to the Doctrine should be able to clearly articulate what the event of \"rare misfortune\" is that triggers the Doctrine's application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where the Doctrine is applied to rebut a claim of mistake or accident, this is usually easily accomplished: the event of rare misfortune is, say, the death of a bride in a bathtub, or the mistaken taking of a horse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. In the self-defense context (as in the fabrication context,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20UT%20App%2064\">\n    2019 UT App 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 57-59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576082\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/787/\">\n    441 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harris, J., concurring)), it is often difficult to articulate what that event is, as illustrated in this case. Is the event of rare misfortune that Lane was previously involved in fights? Is it that Lane was previously involved in fights for which he claimed that he acted in self-defense? Or is it that Lane was previously involved in fights in which he employed a knife? I cannot tell, and (even upon questioning at oral argument) neither can the State. None of these options involve random events of chance. As in this case, if it is difficult to clearly identify the event of \"rare misfortune,\" it raises the likelihood that the evidence of prior acts is not coming in for permissible probability purposes but, instead, is coming in for impermissible propensity purposes. Moreover, without clear identification of the event of \"rare misfortune,\" it becomes difficult to determine whether the \"four foundational requirements,\" which are prerequisites to the application of the Doctrine, have been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 57-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing materiality, similarity, independence, and frequency as the \"four foundational requirements\" of the Doctrine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b644 Second, the party asking the court to admit prior bad acts evidence pursuant to the Doctrine should be able to clearly articulate both (a) the purposes for which the evidence can permissibly be used and (b) the purposes for which the evidence cannot permissibly be used. If these purposes cannot be articulated in a way that a lay juror can readily understand, that is a good clue that the Doctrine is being misapplied. Again, this case is a good example. The jury was instructed that it could \"consider [the prior bad acts] evidence, if at all, for the limited purpose of self-defense,\" but that the \"evidence was not admitted to prove a character trait of the defendant or to show that he acted in a manner consistent with such a trait.\" I confess that I do not know what this instruction means. No mention at all is made of any probability-based inference that might be permissibly drawn with regard to evidence properly admitted pursuant to the Doctrine. No meaningful guidance is given regarding the purposes for which the evidence may, and may not, be used. I cannot imagine lay jurors having any idea what to make of an instruction like this, and if the jury is not clearly instructed, the risk of jurors resorting to impermissible propensity inferences is too great.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b645 All of which leads me not only to conclude that the Doctrine was misapplied in\n   this case, but also to wonder whether the Doctrine could ever be properly applied in a self-defense context. No Utah appellate court has yet held that application of the Doctrine to cases in which the defendant claims self-defense is proper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some other courts have applied the Doctrine to allow prior acts evidence in this context,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

I urge parties in future cases to raise and fully brief this issue, instead of-as the parties did here-simply assuming that the Doctrine applies in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b646 My second set of concerns has to do with the manner in which the Doctrine was specifically applied in this case. That is, assuming that the Doctrine could be meaningfully applied to admit relevant, non-character prior acts evidence in the self-defense context, the Doctrine was misapplied in this case in several material ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b647 First, as the majority ably describes, the district court did not conduct a separate rule 403 analysis, a step that is \" 'essential to preserve the integrity of rule 404(b).' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Even if a court concludes that, under governing case law, the Doctrine can logically apply, and even if it concludes that the Doctrine's \"four foundational requirements\" for application are met,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court still must analyze the evidence under rule 403 to ascertain whether the probative value of the\n   <em>\n    admissible\n   </em>\n   part\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, including the danger of the jury drawing an impermissible propensity inference. The district court failed to take this important step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b648 Second, as I have already mentioned, the instruction given to the jury was inadequate, and did not meaningfully assist the jury in navigating its way through a logical and metaphysical minefield. \"A complete, properly worded limiting instruction has two prongs. The negative prong forbids the jury from using the evidence for the verboten purpose. In contrast, the affirmative prong explains how the jury is permitted to reason about the evidence.\" Edward J.

The instruction given in this case was conclusory, and informed the jury that it could not draw a character inference but could use the evidence for \"self-defense.\" This is precisely the sort of instruction that commentators have rightly criticized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%20851\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Hofstra%20L.%20Rev.%20851\">\n    at 873-74, 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (offering as an example of an \"inadequate\" instruction one where, \"[a]fter stating the negative prong of the instruction, in the affirmative prong the judge ... give[s] the jury only the guidance that they may use the evidence for the purpose of proving 'intent,' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   and noting that this sort of instruction \"can lead the jury into improper character reasoning\"). Assuming that, on the facts of this case, it were possible to articulate purposes for which the evidence could and could not be used, those purposes needed to have been spelled out in much more detail than they were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b649 Third, I am concerned about the manner in which the district court analyzed the \"frequency\" factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The point of this factor is to ensure that the event of \"rare misfortune\" in question has been visited upon the defendant \"more frequently than the typical person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 61 (quotation simplified). Assuming that one can pinpoint what the event of rare misfortune is in this instance, and that one can meaningfully apply probability (rather than propensity) reasoning to a situation involving several levels of human volition, our case law then requires the court to compare this defendant to a \"typical person\" to ascertain whether the event occurred to the defendant with greater frequency. In this case, the court's complete analysis on this point was as follows: \"Here, Defendant has been involved with three serious assaults in four years. Even given his chronic homelessness and the higher frequency of assault surrounding shelters, the rate of Defendant's involvement in these assaults is not mere accident.\" I find this analysis lacking. The court did not take any evidence to establish the profile of a \"typical\" resident of that part of Salt Lake City, or any evidence intended to establish a baseline regarding the number of physical altercations per year in which such a resident might typically be involved. Under these circumstances, I see no reasoned basis for the court's intuition-level conclusion that a person living in that part of the city becoming involved in one fight every fifteen months is necessarily \"frequent.\" Bound up in that analysis are various assumptions by the court-arrived at without evidence-of what living conditions are like for homeless citizens of Salt Lake City. This is an instance where the court, in my view, needed to take additional evidence-from experts, if necessary-to arrive at a sound conclusion about whether the number of assaults in which Lane was involved was atypical for a resident of that part of town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b650 But I question whether our courts should even be asked to engage in inquiries like that, given the bigger problems I see with the application of the Doctrine to admit prior acts evidence in cases in which a defendant claims that he acted in self-defense. Because of my various concerns about the district court's admission, pursuant to the Doctrine, of Lane's prior assaults, I share the majority's view that Lane was not afforded a fair trial, and therefore I concur in the majority's disposition. I also urge litigants in future cases to raise and brief issues they might see with application of the Doctrine, in this or other contexts, in order to enable the Doctrine's application in Utah to be reexamined in an appropriate case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The defense of mistake or accident can be raised with regard to either\n    <em>\n     actus reus\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     mens rea\n    </em>\n    .
