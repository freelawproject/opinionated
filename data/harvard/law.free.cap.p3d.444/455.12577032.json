Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Gloria Sturman, Judge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Respondent Oella Ridge Trust purchased the subject property at the HOA's lien foreclosure sale and then filed the underlying quiet title action. Appellant Silver State Schools Credit Union (SSCU) opposed the action and asserted counterclaims for wrongful foreclosure and quiet title. Following a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Oella Ridge. In so doing, the district court found that in the 9 months preceding the HOA's notice of lien, the homeowners had paid an amount equal to 12 months of common assessments, and the HOA's lien notice consisted of interest, late and collection fees, and CC&amp;R fines, only. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Shadow Wood Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. N.Y. Community. Bancorp, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Nev.%2049\">\n    132 Nev. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=366%20P.3d%201105\">\n    366 P.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), the court nevertheless concluded that the foreclosure sale extinguished SSCU's deed of trust because, by the time the HOA recorded a notice of default and election sell, the homeowners had fallen behind on assessments, such that the lien foreclosed upon contained a superpriority component. SSCU appeals from that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having considered the parties' arguments and the record, we conclude that the district court's determination that the HOA foreclosure sale extinguished the first deed of trust was legally erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weddell v.

In particular, substantial evidence in the record supports the district court's finding that the HOA's notice of delinquent assessments was for interest, late and collection fees, and fines, only, and the homeowners owed no past-due assessments at that time. Pursuant to controlling statutes and case law, the HOA's lien therefore lacked a superpriority component such that the district court erred by concluding that the ensuing foreclosure sale extinguished SSCU's deed of trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NRS 116.3116(2) (2009) (describing the superpriority component of an HOA's lien as \"the assessments for common expenses ... which would have become due ... during the 9 months immediately\n   <em>\n    preceding\n   </em>\n   institution of an action to enforce the lien\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    Saticoy Bay LLC Series 2021 Gray Eagle Way u.
