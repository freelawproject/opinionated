Having considered petitioner's and real parties in interest's argument and the supporting documents, we conclude that our extraordinary and discretionary intervention is not warranted because an appeal from a final judgment provides an adequate remedy. <em>See</em> NRS 34.160 ; NRS 34.170 ; <em>Pan v.
