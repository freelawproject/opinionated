The complaint alleges three claims against Ford: strict liability for design defects; strict liability for failure to warn; and negligence. The estate seeks compensatory and punitive damages against Ford. Additionally, the complaint alleges strict liability for design defects and failure to warn, and negligence against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Kelly-Springfield Tire Corporation, and Lloyd's Tire Service, and negligence against Tires Plus, Inc. (Tires Plus).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On July 6, 2018, Ford filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, or, in the alternative, a motion for change of venue pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-201(1) and (3), MCA. On August 31, 2018, Tires Plus joined Ford's motion to change venue. Ford requested that venue be changed to Mineral or Missoula County, Montana. Tires Plus requested that venue be changed to Mineral or Sanders County, Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On October 10, 2018, the District Court denied Ford's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and denied\n   Ford's motion to change venue. Ford petitioned this Court for a writ of supervisory control to determine whether Montana has specific personal jurisdiction over Ford, and filed an interlocutory appeal asking this Court to determine whether Cascade County is a proper venue under Montana law. On May 21, 2019, this Court accepted supervisory control and concluded that Montana has specific personal jurisdiction over Ford in this case.\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co. v. Mont.

The venue statute applicable to tort claims is \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA. Section 25-2-122(2), MCA, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [I]f the defendant is a corporation incorporated in a state other than Montana, the proper place of trial for a tort action is:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (a) the county in which the tort was committed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (b) the county in which the plaintiff resides; or\n   (c) the county in which the corporation's resident agent is located, as required by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"[A]n action brought in any such county is brought in a proper county.\" Section 25-2-115, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 In an action involving multiple defendants, \"a county that is a proper place of trial for any defendant is proper for all defendants.\" Section 25-2-117, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Farmers Union Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. A defendant in an action involving multiple defendants may file a motion to change venue only when the venue \"is not a proper place of trial for any of the defendants.\" Section 25-2-117, MCA. \"The right to move for a change of venue under \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA, applies only if the action is filed in a county that is a proper place of trial for none of the defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers Union Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. Therefore, a district court may not grant a motion to change venue pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA, where any\n   defendant is an out-of-state corporation, the action arises in tort, and the action is brought in a proper county pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(a)-(c), MCA. Sections 25-2-115, -117, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 The parties do not dispute that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, governs this case. Ford is a corporation incorporated in a state other than Montana and Lucero brought survival and wrongful death claims against Ford, which sound in tort. Likewise, neither party disputes that Lucero, as the Decedent's personal representative, is the named plaintiff in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 \"An action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.\" M. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(1). In an action for wrongful death, \"the personal representative of the decedent's estate may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death.\" Section 27-1-513, MCA. The personal representative is the proper party to maintain a wrongful death action. M. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(1)(A) expressly states that executors \"may sue in their own names\" without joining decedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 Ford argues that \"the county in which the plaintiff resides\" means the county in which the Decedent resided before her death. Section 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, unambiguously employs the terms \"plaintiff\" and \"resides\" in the present tense. The Decedent can no longer bring these claims on her own behalf, nor does she reside anywhere in the present tense. Had the Legislature intended to relate venue to the county where a deceased tort victim resided prior to death, it could have inserted the term decedent into the statutory language. It did not. This Court will \"not insert omitted terms into a statute.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montco v.

The District Court may not grant Ford's motion to change venue pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA, because Ford is an out-of-state corporation, Lucero brought a tort action against Ford, and Cascade County is a proper venue pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-115, -117, MCA.

Therefore, any \"county that is a proper place of trial for\" Ford is a proper place of trial for Tires Plus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 25-2-117, MCA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-41\">\n   Justice Laurie McKinnon, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b619 I easily track the Court's plain-language approach: in a wrongful death action, a decedent's personal representative \"may maintain an action for damages\" against the defendant, \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA ; the personal representative may sue in his or her \"own name,\" M. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(1)(A) ; and venue is proper in \"the county in which the plaintiff resides,\" \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA. Because the personal representative is the lawsuit's named plaintiff, his residential county is a proper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b620 However, this Court cannot read statutes in a vacuum; we must read them in relationship to one another. \"In the construction of a statute, ... [w]here there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\" Section 1-2-101, MCA. After considering other statutes involving wrongful death actions and personal representatives, I find the Court's approach overly simplistic and ultimately disagree with its conclusion that a personal representative's residential county is an appropriate venue option under \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA. I, accordingly, dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b621 Section 72-3-604, MCA, provides that \"a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this state at death has the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this state and the courts of any other jurisdiction as the decedent had\n   <em>\n    immediately prior to death\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The plain language of \u00a7 72-3-604, MCA, confines the personal representative's lawful authority to file suits only in the courts where the decedent could have filed \"immediately prior to death.\" There is no statute, court precedent, or other mechanism that\n   <em>\n    expands\n   </em>\n   the personal representative's authority or capacity to file suits on behalf of a decedent and that includes circumstances both unrelated to the decedent or the underlying facts which have arisen\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   her death. A personal representative is not the real party in interest; his \"[c]apacity to sue ... is determined by appropriate statutory provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M. R. Civ. P. 17(b). As it applies to a wrongful death action, \u00a7 72-3-604, MCA, provides a personal representative with the capacity to sue and limits his authority under \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, to bringing the lawsuit in a venue where the decedent could have immediately prior to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b622 A personal representative stands in the decedent's shoes.\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Kindsfather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143566\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/192/\">\n    2005 MT 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143566\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/192/\">\n    326 Mont. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1143566\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/326/192/\">\n    108 P.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9279038\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/804/1176/#p1181\">\n    804 N.E.2d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1181 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) ). To further emphasize the limited scope of the personal representative's authority, \u00a7 72-3-604, MCA, particularizes that a personal representative simply \"has the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   standing\" as the decedent; he does not have greater or different rights than those the decedent would have had. Section 72-3-604, MCA (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    dck Worldwide Holdings, Inc. v.

However, as the majority points out, \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, uses the present-tense terms \"plaintiff\" and \"resides.\" Such language is not practically applied in a wrongful death action,\n   where a decedent can no longer bring her own claims as the \"plaintiff\" and where a decedent no longer \"resides\" anywhere. Because the personal representative has the same standing to sue as the decedent and because the personal representative cannot have different rights than the decedent would have had, I would conclude that \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, does not confer venue in wrongful death cases. Such an interpretation of \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, ensures that the personal\n   representative does not have rights the decedent would not have had.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 72-3-604, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b624 Further, the question of proper venue is, most fundamentally, guided by fairness to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

Concluding that venue is not proper under \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, based on the personal representative's residential county is fairest to out-of-state defendants because, otherwise, a decedent's estate could manipulate venue and shop for a preferred forum by choosing a specific personal representative because he resides in a selected county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b625 Montana law provides Lucero with the authority to bring a wrongful death claim on Gullett's behalf, but it does not bestow upon Lucero greater or different rights that Gullett did not have herself. In this wrongful death action, \u00a7 25-2-122(2)(b), MCA, cannot be utilized to confer proper venue-venue may be found proper under the other subsections of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA.
