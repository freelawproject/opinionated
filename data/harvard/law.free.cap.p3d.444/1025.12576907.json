We address the following issue on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court erred when it denied the Estate's Petition for Release of Confidential Criminal Justice Information without conducting an\n   </em>\n   in camera\n   <em>\n    review.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In late May 2011, John Michael Crites was sued by his neighbors Dennis Shaw, John Mehan, and Katy Wessel. Shaw, Mehan, and Wessel sought compensatory and punitive damages after Crites allegedly threatened and accosted his neighbors in their neighborhood\n   in Lewis and Clark County (County).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On June 28, 2011, Crites was reported missing. On October 8, 2011, Crites's dismembered remains were found in black plastic trash bags near MacDonald Pass. Crites's skull was later found on the west side of MacDonald Pass. To date, nobody has been charged with Crites's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On March 27, 2012, the County issued a death certificate for Crites. On April 19,\n   2012, Crites's sister, Connie Crites, was appointed personal representative of his Estate. On January 9, 2018, the Estate requested that the County release Crites's investigative file for the purposes of defending itself in the ongoing lawsuit and to pursue a civil wrongful death action. On January 19, 2018, the County responded to the Estate's request with a letter from County Attorney Leo Gallagher that it could not release Crites's investigative file because release \"would jeopardize the State's ability to prosecute someone for the homicide and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On March 9, 2018, the Estate filed a Petition in District Court, seeking release of the investigative file. The Estate requested, pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, and Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution that the District Court conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the CCJI associated with Crites's file and to release information under seal that is relevant to the Estate's claims and defenses in the ongoing lawsuit. The County opposed the Estate's request and argued that releasing CCJI to the Estate would compromise its investigation. In its response, the County submitted an affidavit from Detective Dan O'Malley that stated the Crites homicide investigation was active and ongoing. The affidavit further specified that the investigative file contained: ninety-five reports regarding Crites's homicide investigation, totaling over 1000 pages of documents; at least twenty search warrants; thousands of phone records; multiple reports from the Montana State Crime Lab; digital evidence, including audio recordings and photographs; and interviews of dozens of people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 On June 19, 2018, the District Court denied the Estate's Petition. The District Court determined that \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, does not allow for the release of CCJI if the prosecutor determines dissemination would jeopardize an active investigation. Consequently, the District Court declined to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the CCJI contained in Crites's investigative file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 We review a district court's conclusions of law to determine\n   whether the district court's interpretation of the law is correct.\n   <em>\n    Billings Gazette v.

After conducting an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the CCJI sought, the district court may authorize release of appropriate portions of the requested CCJI. Section 44-5-303(1), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    Bozeman Daily Chronicle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4590340\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/260/218/#p229\">\n    260 Mont. at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4590340\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/260/218/#p229\">\n    859 P.2d at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 The Estate filed a petition arguing it was entitled to the CCJI in Crites's investigative file under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution and as a person seeking dissemination pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA. The County responded to the Estate's request with a letter indicating that the County believed release of CCJI related to the Crites investigation would jeopardize its investigation. The County submitted an affidavit in its response to the Estate's Petition that demonstrated Crites's investigative file was extensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Based on the County's assertion that release of the information would jeopardize an ongoing investigation, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA, did not allow the Court to release the information. In its Order on Release of Confidential Criminal Justice Information, the District Court interpreted \u00a7 44-5-303(2), MCA, to provide that \"[i]f\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the Court's analysis favors privacy\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   if the prosecutor determines that the dissemination would jeopardize the investigation, the statute does not allow the information to be released.\" (Emphasis in original.) The District Court thus concluded that since the prosecutor had determined that release of the information would jeopardize the investigation, it \"need not reach the analysis of balancing the merits of privacy and disclosure ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 The District Court's conclusion that \u00a7 44-5-303(2), MCA, prohibited it from releasing CCJI over a prosecutor's determination that dissemination would jeopardize an ongoing investigation is incorrect. Section 44-5-303(2), MCA, allows a prosecutor to disseminate CCJI to the victim of an offense without obtaining the district court authorization that would otherwise be required by \u00a7 44-5-303(1), MCA, if the prosecutor determines that dissemination would not jeopardize a pending investigation or other criminal proceeding. Section 44-5-303(2), MCA, acts as an exception to the restrictions regarding the dissemination of CCJI set forth at \u00a7 44-5-303(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 44-5-303(2), MCA, does not allow the prosecutor to supersede the district court's decision to allow for CCJI dissemination when the requesting party is a victim. Such an interpretation of the statute would lead to the incongruous result in which any person or organization could conceivably obtain CCJI via district court order pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303(1), MCA, but \u00a7 44-5-303(2), MCA, could deprive a crime victim of the same right, if the prosecutor asserted that dissemination would jeopardize a pending investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 Although the District Court incorrectly concluded that \u00a7 44-5-303(2), MCA, prohibited it from releasing CCJI over the prosecutor's determination that dissemination would jeopardize an ongoing investigation, our analysis does not end there. We have not previously considered whether the presence of an active criminal investigation negates the requirement of an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, or the need to conduct the balancing test between the \"right to know\" and the \"right to privacy,\" called for in\n   \u00a7 44-5-303, MCA. Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution provides: \"No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents ... of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\" However, the \"right to know\" is not an absolute right, and it must be weighed against the demands of individual privacy.\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Cty.

Section 44-5-303(5), MCA, is the only subsection that expressly provides for a district court to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review after a request has been made for CCJI. The Estate acknowledges that \u00a7 44-5-303(5), MCA, is inapplicable here because it applies only to a request \"relating to a criminal investigation that has been terminated by declination of prosecution or relating to a criminal prosecution that has been completed by entry of judgment, dismissal, or acquittal ....\" Although the Estate has expressed understandable frustration that charges have not been filed against anyone for Crites's murder, it does not contend that the criminal investigation has been terminated. The Estate requests release of the CCJI pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, and contends that \"when a private citizen or an entity files a petition under \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, a district court is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the information ....\" (Emphasis added.) We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 An\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of CCJI sought pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, may often be appropriate; however, neither the plain language of \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, nor our interpretation of it, has ever \"required\" an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. While \u00a7 44-5-303(5), MCA, expressly provides for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review for CCJI relating to a criminal investigation that has been terminated, \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, provides an\n   <em>\n    alternative\n   </em>\n   to the procedures set forth in \u00a7 44-5-303(5), MCA. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, suggests that courts superimpose the procedures of \u00a7 44-5-303(5), MCA, upon a request made pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, and we decline to do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 By the same token, \u00a7 44-5-303(6), MCA, does not prohibit an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review and, indeed, such a review may well be indicated given the circumstances of a particular case. Thus, the issue here is whether the circumstances of this particular case warranted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review before the District Court declined to order production of the requested CCJI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 Although the District Court in this case incorrectly relied upon \u00a7 44-5-303(2), MCA, for its conclusion that it was prohibited from releasing the CCJI over the prosecutor's determination that dissemination would jeopardize the ongoing investigation, it was entirely correct, and indeed necessary, for the District Court to consider the prosecutor's assertion to that effect, which was supported by an affidavit from the detective assigned to the case. Such consideration is consistent with both the Framers' intent that \"all rights have to be balanced against a police power,\"\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19, and our concern that \"public exposure of law enforcement files relating to ongoing criminal investigations would have a disastrous effect upon law enforcement agencies in the performance of their duty,\"\n   <em>\n    Bozeman Daily Chronicle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4590340\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/260/218/#p229\">\n    260 Mont. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4590340\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/260/218/#p229\">\n    859 P.2d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 The circumstances of the present case do not demonstrate that the District Court erred in declining the Estate's request for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review before denying its application for the CCJI. The record before us supports the County's determination in its letter to the Estate, and in Detective O'Malley's affidavit, that dissemination of the CCJI contained in Crites's investigative file would jeopardize its murder investigation.
