The Estate argued that it was entitled to stack the coverage of each aircraft's per-passenger limit, for a total of $300,000. USSIC filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana, seeking a declaration that it was under no duty or obligation to pay more than $100,000 to Ward's Estate under the terms of the policy and that USSIC's aircraft policy coverage for passengers cannot be stacked. The Estate and USSIC submitted cross-motions for summary judgment.

The limit of liability for each aircraft is $100,000 for each passenger, up to a combined limit of $1,000,000 for each occurrence. An occurrence is a \"sudden event ...\n   <em>\n    involving\n   </em>\n   the\n   <strong>\n    aircraft\n   </strong>\n   ... that causes\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Bold emphasis in original; italicized emphasis added).

There is no Montana\n   statute that applies specifically to aviation policies. Section 33-23-203(1), MCA, pertains to the stacking of coverage limits on \"motor vehicle liability policies.\" Montana law defines both motor vehicle and aircraft. \" 'Motor vehicle' means a vehicle propelled by its own power and designed primarily to transport persons or property on the highways of the state.\" Section 33-23-204(1)(a), MCA. \" 'Aircraft' means a contrivance used or designed for navigation of or flight in the air.\" Section 67-1-101(4), MCA. Section 33-23-203, MCA, by its terms does not apply to aircraft liability policies. Indeed, Montana does not statutorily regulate aviation insurance in any manner.\n   <em>\n    Compare with, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Haw. Admin. R. \u00a7 19-17.1-8 (Hawaii law requires those persons renting hangar space at public airports to maintain general liability insurance);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Trans.%20%C2%A7%205-1002\">\n    Md.

Enactments of the Montana Legislature and Congress offer no guidance setting forth public policy regarding stacking of general aviation policies because neither has a statute governing the issue.

In\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , the insured purchased a motor vehicle policy that provided $50,000 per person in underinsured motorist coverage for three separate vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. Due to an offset in the contract and Montana's minimum mandatory coverage requirements, the insured's\n   coverage would be offset by at least $25,000 in practically all circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. Thus, in nearly all conceivable situations the insurer's promise to pay up $50,000 would not be honored.\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. This Court held that since the insurer would hardly, if ever, provide the insured with the amount of coverage she thought that she purchased, the coverage was illusory.\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 The policy at issue here does not fall under either of these situations. There is no subrogation clause at issue, nor is the coverage illusory, because the Estate received the maximum benefits of the applicable coverage for the involved aircraft. Melotz paid a premium to cover each aircraft, with benefits limited to $100,000 per passenger and $1,000,000 per occurrence. The policy allowed simultaneous coverage for pilots other than Melotz if they met the Open Pilot Warranty for the named aircraft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The occurrence at issue involved only one insured aircraft. The Estate received the full per-passenger benefit from the involved aircraft's policy. Not allowing the three coverages to be stacked therefore does not render the coverage illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b613 The Estate argues that the reasonable expectations doctrine requires that USSIC honor the combined coverages Melotz purchased because it charged multiple premiums for multiple coverages. Melotz adds that he had an expectation that the liability coverage purchased for N9936T would be commensurate with all premiums he paid, and because he paid multiple premiums the coverages therefore should be stacked. The \" 'reasonable expectations doctrine' mandates that, unless the terms of an insurance policy 'clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage,' an insurance buyer's 'objectively reasonable expectations' regarding the nature of the policy 'should be honored notwithstanding the fact that a painstaking study of the policy would have negated those expectations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lenz v.

Despite the apparent inapplicability of the reasonable expectations doctrine, we applied the public policy considerations set forth in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   to permit the claimant to stack the underinsured motorist coverages because he was an \"insured\" as defined in the policy.\n   <em>\n    Holeman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b618 The Estate argues that liability coverage under the aircraft policy is, for \"all intents and purposes, 'personal and portable,' \" and stacking should be allowed.

This is the principle we applied in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   to extend coverages to the insured pedestrian. The liability benefits at issue here, in contrast, require a connection with the \"involved\" aircraft listed on the policy. USSIC's policy provides that liability coverage extends only to damage or injury sustained when an aircraft is involved in an occurrence. Although the insured Melotz would have coverage for an occurrence when piloting some other aircraft, the policy would cover bodily injury to a third party only when that aircraft was involved in an occurrence. The policy requires a connection between an occurrence and the involved aircraft\n   to cover bodily injury. Because the liability coverage is tied to the involvement of a particular aircraft, it is not reasonable to expect that the policy would pay more than the limits provided for that aircraft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b619 The plain language of the USSIC policy and the Estate's status do not entitle it to a reasonable expectation of stacked liability coverage. The policy defines passenger as \"any person who is in the\n   <strong>\n    aircraft\n   </strong>\n   or getting in or out of it.\" Coverage is limited to the aircraft involved in the crash. As a passenger in N9936T, Ward was an insured under that policy only. Ward did not have a connection to the other two aircraft because he was not a passenger in either of those aircraft and he was not an insured. The policy states that \"the most\" USSIC will pay per passenger is $100,000 for each occurrence. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Lierboe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chilberg\n   </em>\n   , the plain language of the policy makes clear that the aircraft not involved in an accident are not part of the occurrence and coverage for those aircraft is not available for that accident. Ward was not an insured and did not have a reasonable expectation of benefits for additional aircraft owned by Melotz that were not \"involved\" in the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b620 Finally, the Estate of Melotz does not have a reasonable expectation under the plain language of the policy that Ward is entitled to stack the coverages. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Holeman\n   </em>\n   , although Melotz paid premiums for three separate polices, Ward was not an \"insured\" under Melotz's policies for the uninvolved aircraft. And Melotz did not seek benefits under the policy's \"liability to others\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   coverage. Melotz did not have a reasonable expectation that a third party would be entitled to stack coverages for which that party was not an insured. Melotz paid for coverage that would pay liability damages for bodily injury caused by an occurrence with a separate coverage limit for each aircraft. Any expectation that a passenger would recover more than the $100,000 limit for the aircraft involved in a crash is not objectively reasonable under a common-sense reading of the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b621 The plain, unambiguous language of the contract limits the coverage to the aircraft that is involved in an accident. There is no statute or public policy that mandates payment of the cumulative coverage for separate aircraft in an aviation liability insurance policy that does not provide for such payment.

There being no legislatively determined public policy relating to aviation insurance, the Court turns to its precedent prohibiting anti-stacking of first-party motor vehicle coverages to explain why there is no stacking of aviation third-party liability coverage. Assuming our precedent declaring the public policy in the context of motor vehicle insurance is likewise appropriate to determine public policy for aviation insurance, the Court nonetheless fails to clearly ground its rationale on the fundamental distinction between first-party insurance coverage and third-party liability coverage.

The Court has never stacked third-party liability coverage because, unlike first-party coverages, third-party liability coverage is not \"personal and portable.\" Importantly, the Court permits first-party coverages to be stacked based on the rationale that insurers may not defeat coverage that first-party insureds paid valuable consideration for and reasonably expect. On the other hand, third parties who are not named insureds have not paid for coverage and have no reasonable expectation that they should be able to stack various coverages paid for by the first party. Accordingly, this Court has never allowed stacking of third-party liability coverages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lierboe\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Chilberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4576496\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/273/414/#p419\">\n    273 Mont. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4576496\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/273/414/#p419\">\n    903 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1380 ;\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22.

There is no illusory coverage when a third party is prohibited from stacking liability coverages because a third party has no reasonable expectation that he will be able to stack liability coverages of other vehicles not involved in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b624 In my opinion, the Court does not sufficiently address this fundamental distinction between first-party insurance coverage and third-party liability coverage. The distinction, together with a consideration of the policy's language, permits us to easily answer the certified question as presented. An insurer may not prohibit stacking when doing so would defeat coverage for which an insured paid valuable consideration. Here, the Estate of Darrell L. Ward, a third-party claimant, seeks to stack liability coverages that Melotz purchased for aircraft not involved in the accident. Because the Estate is a third-party claimant, not a named insured under the policy, it is not entitled to stack liability coverages Melotz, the first-party insured, purchased for other aircraft not involved in the accident at issue. Additionally, to the extent The Estate of Melotz, as a first party, asserts that liability coverage for aircraft not involved in the accident should be stacked with coverage purchased for N9936T, the clear language of the policy defeats any reasonable expectation that Melotz is entitled to stack coverages. The policy clearly states that liability coverage is connected only to the named aircraft. I would have determined that the certified question presented by the United States District Court does not need reformulating, as it correctly identifies the third-party nature of the Estate's claim. I otherwise concur with the Court's analysis and its ultimate holding.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
