The superior court found that Milton failed to establish adequate cause for a hearing on the petition. RCW 26.10.190 applies the adequate cause standard of RCW 26.09.260(1) to modifications of nonparental custody orders. Milton argues that the adequate cause standard is unconstitutional as applied to nonparental custody proceedings. We agree. That standard does not provide a parent a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he or she has remedied the unfitness or detriment to the child that was the basis for the nonparental custody order. We reverse and remand for a new adequate cause hearing consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 S.M. and A.M. are the children of Carey Milton\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and John McCulla, Jr. Both Milton and McCulla, Jr. have a\n   history of substance abuse, and Milton has struggled with bipolar disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 On March 21, 2016, the children's paternal grandparents, John McCulla, Sr. and Annacarin McCulla, filed a petition for nonparental custody, asserting that neither Milton nor McCulla, Jr. was a suitable custodian. A court appointed special advocate (CASA) conducted an investigation and recommended that the petition be granted. At the time, S.M. was seven years old and A.M. was three years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 McCulla, Jr. joined in the petition and Milton opposed it. Trial on the petition was held on March 20, 2017. Milton did not appear. According to Milton, she did appear but had a panic attack, threw up, and had to leave the courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 On April 14, 2017, the trial court entered a final nonparental custody order placing S.M. and A.M. with the paternal grandparents. It made accompanying findings of fact that Milton was unfit, that the children would suffer actual detriment if living with her, and that placement of S.M. and A.M. with the grandparents was in the children's best interests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Regarding the respondent mother, she suffers from suicidal ideations, is medically diagnosed as bipolar, and has admitted to methamphetamine use in previous court proceedings and reported the same to CASA. The mother has also been committed to a psychiatric institution for psychiatric treatment several times over the past few years. The mother has a history of domestic violence and threats of harm against the respondent father, the petitioners, and even the maternal grandparents. The mother has exhibited her physical and aggressive behavior in front of the children as evidenced by police reports. It is not in the best interest of the minor children to reside with the respondent mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The children are thriving in the care of the petitioners. The children are excited to be in their current school district. [T]hey regularly attend their medical and dental appointments, and\n   have sufficient space in the new home that they reside in with the petitioners and the paternal great grandmother. The children are well-adjusted and cheerful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Mother is unfit and an actual detriment to children would occur if children placed with her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 The trial court entered an order limiting Milton's contact with the children to three hours of supervised visitation on Saturday or Sunday. Milton was ordered to complete domestic violence treatment, undergo a substance abuse evaluation and participate mental health counseling and medication management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 Approximately seven months later, on November 29, 2017, Milton filed a petition to modify the nonparental custody order. The petition alleged as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Mother is currently complying with court requirements, has adequate housing, and the ability to meet her children's needs. It is no longer necessary for the children to reside with their paternal grandparents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In support of her petition, Milton provided a declaration in which she stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2017, it was confirmed that I am bi-polar, after two hospitalizations. In my manic phases, I have damaged relationships, lost jobs, and lost my children. Since my medication has stabilized through a mood stabilizer, injected once a month at Valley Cities, I have been able to finish an associate degree, maintain employment for over six months, get my own apartment and regain control of my life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Milton also provided documentation showing that she complied with the substance abuse evaluation. But, Milton did not complete the domestic violence portion of the trial court's order and instead disputed the domestic violence allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b68 On January 26, 2018, a superior court commissioner found that Milton failed to establish adequate cause to modify the nonparental custody order. The commissioner noted that Milton did not meet the criteria for modification stated in the nonparental custody order.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   So I am denying the request for adequate cause. I read these orders to be very specific about what Ms. Milton is expected to do. And that includes domestic violence treatment that happens after entry of the order on April 10, 2017. Also with proof that that provider is given a copy of all of the CASA reports.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The commissioner also found that the modification statute, RCW 26.09.260(1), precluded Milton from seeking to modify a nonparental custody order based on a change in her own circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I think it is wonderful what I read about the new medication helping and being given in a more reliable type of way. And so that is great and I don't want to undermine that at all. But I do not find that when there are constitutionally sufficient findings of unfitness that a parent can come back to court within a year of entry of those orders after trial and say I am substantially better now, and so let's do away with those orders. I don't think that is what the statute says, and I don't think that is what the case law says.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The commissioner's written order states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Respondent, Carey Milton has not provided proof of compliance with all requirements in the 4/10/17 orders Judge McCullough entered after trial. That court's constitutionally sufficient findings after trial mean Ms. Milton must meet the major modification standard as she requests a major mod[ification] less than a year after trial. She has not met her legal burden, has not proven substantial change in circumstances and detriment to the children under RCW 26.09.260.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b69 Milton sought revision of the commissioner's ruling from a superior court judge. That judge denied the motion for revision on the grounds that Milton was precluded from seeking modification based on a change in her own circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court cannot find adequate cause exists to modify the April 10, 2017 Order for Non-parental Custody. Respondent Carey Milton[,] under current case law and the wording of the statute[,] does demonstrate affirmative steps have been taken to remedy\n   the court's concerns regarding her fitness as a parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Milton appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b610 Chapter 26.10 RCW sets forth the procedure for nonparental custody actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   RCW 26.10.030(1) provides that a party may file a nonparental custody petition \"if the child is not in the physical custody of one of its parents or if the petitioner alleges that neither parent is a suitable custodian.\" The court must make a threshold determination that the petition and supporting affidavits establish adequate cause for a hearing.

Since RCW 26.10.190 clearly contemplates that a parent may seek to modify a\n   nonparental custody order, due process requires that he or she be given a meaningful opportunity to do so. The factual basis for a nonparental custody order is a finding that the parent is\n   unfit or a detriment to the child. A parent has no meaningful opportunity to regain custody of his or her child if that parent is precluded from showing there is no longer a factual basis for the order. We conclude that RCW 26.10.190, which applies the requirements of RCW 26.09.260(1) to modification of nonparental custody proceedings, violates due process in so far as it limits the change in circumstances to that of the child or the nonmoving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b623 Consistent with this conclusion, we also hold unconstitutional the requirement of RCW 26.10.190 that the modification be in the best interests of the child. The law presumes that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    530 U.S. at 68-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, just as\n   <em>\n    Shields\n   </em>\n   held that it is unconstitutional for a court to infringe on the parent-child relationship by making an initial custody determination based on a best interests analysis, it is similarly unconstitutional for a court to deny a modification on that basis. It may, however, provide grounds to impose conditions on the transition process by which the parent shall regain custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b624 On remand, the superior court shall determine if Milton has established adequate cause for a hearing on the modification, consistent with this opinion. To establish adequate cause, Milton must present \"new or previously unknown facts\" showing a change in circumstances such that the factual basis for the order no longer exists. A nonparental custody order must be based on one of two factors: that the parent is unfit or that placement with an otherwise fit parent would cause actual detriment to the child's growth and development. These factors are mutually exclusive alternatives. Nonetheless, the trial court based its custody order on both factors. Milton did not appeal the original factual basis for the order. The dual basis is now the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seattle Police Officers Guild v. City of Seattle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428168\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/151/823/\">\n    151 Wash.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 n.21,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20P.3d%20243\">\n    92 P.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Thus, Milton bears the burden of establishing that she is a fit parent. She must also show that placement with her even if fit would not result in actual detriment to the children's growth and development. The grandparents may present affidavits or evidence in opposition to Milton's claims. If the court finds there is no longer a factual basis for the nonparental custody order, it shall vacate the order and impose conditions as appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b625 Milton requests attorney fees on appeal, based on RAP 18.1 and RCW 26.10.080, which provides that upon any appeal, \"the appellate court may, in its discretion, order a party to pay for the cost to the other party of maintaining the appeal and attorney's fees in addition to statutory costs.\" RCW 26.10.080 requires that the court \"balance the needs of the party requesting fees against the other parties' ability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Custody of Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875599\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/153/646/#p656\">\n    153 Wash.2d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20P.3d%20991\">\n    105 P.3d 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).
