He arrived at the address at about four in the afternoon and found Ms. Sorensen in a dispute with another resident. While at the residence, Deputy Yocum learned Ms. Sorensen had an outstanding arrest warrant from Carbon County and placed her under arrest. During a cursory search for weapons, Deputy Yocum asked Ms. Sorensen about a tassel hanging off her belt line. Ms. Sorensen explained it was part of her belt. Nothing was said about the pants she wore. Deputy Yocum then delivered Ms. Sorensen to the jail's detention staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] Ms. Sorensen had admitted to using marijuana that day. Consequently, Sergeant Jennifer Stephens conducted a strip search before booking. Sergeant Stephens told Ms. Sorensen to disclose possession of any contraband. Although Ms. Sorensen said she had no contraband, she appeared to be looking for something while she removed her clothing. When Sergeant Stephens asked her if she was looking for something, Ms. Sorensen replied she thought she had twenty dollars somewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Sergeant Stephens found a small baggie in the front coin pocket of Ms. Sorensen's jeans. Ms. Sorensen immediately claimed neither the jeans nor the baggie were hers. Sergeant Stephens delivered the baggie to Deputy Yocum for further processing, including analysis by the Wyoming State Crime Laboratory (Crime Lab). The Crime Lab report identified the substance in the baggie as methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] At trial, defense counsel outlined the defendant's theory of the case in the opening statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The issue is not whether or not there was methamphetamine and whether or not it was on her person. The issue is about whether or not [Ms. Sorensen] was knowingly in possession of it. As the State already alluded, the baggy [sic] with the methamphetamine was found in the right front coin pocket of a pair of jeans. That little pocket, you can maybe get one or two fingers in when you put fingers in there. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Miss Sorensen was living in a house with a whole bunch of people that would come and go. ... [S]he [will] say that those weren't her jeans, that she didn't know that there was meth in the jeans. That's all there is to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It is not about whether or not there was drugs, not about whether or not it was on her person. It was about whether or not she knew it was there, whether she knew she had it in her possession when she was booked into the jail. That's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b66] Deputy Yocum, the State's first witness, detailed the circumstances and events surrounding Ms. Sorensen's arrest, including his observation that the only other female present in the house was smaller than Ms. Sorensen. He testified that after he received the baggie from Sergeant Stephens, he sent it to the Crime Lab. The prosecution had Deputy Yocum review the Crime Lab report and then offered it into evidence. It was received without objection and exhibited to the jury. The prosecution then introduced the baggie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b67] After Deputy Yocum identified the baggie found in Ms. Sorensen's pocket, the prosecution requested a sidebar. The prosecutor asked the judge if there was a problem passing the evidence to the jury in the same manner as the report. The judge stated the jurors may have a problem because they may want gloves to handle the evidence. The judge suggested the prosecutor move for admission and then \"just hold it and parade [the baggie] up and down before the jury as a way to properly publish it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b68] The baggie was admitted without objection. Prior to publishing this evidence, the court addressed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Ladies and gentlemen, I would tell you that I usually don't feel comfortable having jurors actually handle a substance like methamphetamine without any gloves. So you will have an opportunity in this case to inspect that in more detail if you would like during deliberations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   What we will probably do if you wish to do that is have you come into the courtroom and have you put on gloves if you want to do that during your deliberations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defense raised no objection to the trial judge's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b69] The prosecution also called Douglas Kelly, a forensic latent fingerprint expert, who testified Ms. Sorensen's fingerprints were not found on the baggie. Following Mr. Kelly's testimony and while the jury was out of the courtroom, the trial judge noted the defense did not object to the chain of custody and the contents of the lab reports. Defense counsel responded, \"Correct, Your Honor. And prior to starting the case [the prosecutor] and I did discuss the case, that we were not going to challenge chain of custody. We were going to stipulate to it as well as the contents of the report [sic] were going to come in.\" After this short conference, Sergeant Stephens, the last witness for the prosecution, recounted the events during her search of Ms. Sorensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b610] The defense called two witnesses. The first testified he was the owner of the house where Ms. Sorensen resided at the time of her arrest. On direct examination, he was asked whose pants Ms. Sorensen \"ended up wearing on October 15th.\" He stated he did not know but he \"noticed [the pants] were in the bathroom for maybe five days in a row\" prior to October 15. On cross-examination, however, he said he could not remember if he saw Ms. Sorensen that day and did not know if the pants in the bathroom were the pants she was wearing when she was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b611] Ms. Sorensen then took the stand. She testified she had put on a skirt the morning of her arrest because she was going to church. However, before breakfast, a guest in the house went to visit the horses and was kicked in the head. During this same time, Ms. Sorensen received a telephone call informing her that her uncle was in the intensive care unit at the hospital. She said, \"[S]o at that point with all of the chaos going on, I just wanted to get my things, put it [sic] in a room that locked, and I was going to then go up to the hospital and be with my family.\" She explained that after she took a shower, she did not put her skirt back on:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Well, because this girl was screaming through the house, arguing with [another resident]. And she was in [Mr. Andreas']\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   room. And they're telling her to get out. And I had to get out of the shower and assess the situation. And I figured I should probably have some pants on instead of my skirt. I didn't know exactly what was going to happen. She had kind of threatened me earlier in the day. So I just kind of wanted to be prepared if I needed to have pants on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Sorensen stated the pants were not hers and \"were kind of big\" so she \"used the belt that goes to [her] skirt on the pants.\" She testified she did not know the methamphetamine was in the pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b612] The prosecution called Deputy Yocum in rebuttal. The jury was shown a portion of the booking video in which Ms. Sorensen was wearing the pants. Deputy Yocum testified he did not think the pants were ill-fitting and that Ms. Sorensen never said the pants were not hers until after the drugs were found in the pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b613] The jury found Ms. Sorensen guilty of possession of methamphetamine and the district court sentenced her to three to five years in prison. She timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b614] In most cases, in the absence of a proper objection at trial, we review a claim of error using the plain error standard.\n   <em>\n    Granzer v.

Under this standard, Ms. Sorensen \"must show a clear and unequivocal rule of law was violated, the violation clearly appears in the record, and it resulted in denial of a substantial right to her material prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8202221\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/193/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b615] Ms. Sorensen contends the trial court's comment regarding the existence of methamphetamine in the baggie was an improper opinion that went to the weight and quality of the evidence. The comment invaded the province of the jury as factfinders and improperly influenced the verdict. She argues this is error per se, requiring a presumption of prejudice under our holdings in\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10448675\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/597/456/#p458\">\n    597 P.2d 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (Wyo. 1979), and\n   <em>\n    Sheeley v.

Error Per Se\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b616] Error per se assumes prejudice to the defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   , we held the prejudicial effect of the trial court's comments denigrating the relevance of the defendant's testimony was not cured by subsequent instruction. \"[T]he damage [that has] already [been] done is not capable of being cured.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10448675\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/597/456/#p458\">\n    597 P.2d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Twenty years later, in\n   <em>\n    Sheeley\n   </em>\n   , we considered a prosecutor's question prompting testimony about an earlier proceeding presided over by a different judge where that judge warned a witness about perjury. We determined the question not only injected that judge's judicial bias into the current proceedings, but also \"required an answer that seemed to address [that] judge's opinion of the credibility of the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheeley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11488259\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/991/136/#p139\">\n    991 P.2d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We applied an \"error per se\" analysis and stated, \"[a]ny expression of opinion on the evidence indicating possible bias on the part of the trial judge is prejudicial, as infringing upon the jury's duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 139-40. Ms. Sorensen claims the judge's comments in this case, essentially, told the jury that the baggie found on Ms. Sorensen contained methamphetamine-a fact to be resolved by the jury. She contends the district court's comments \"indicated a bias in the State's favor\" proving the substance was methamphetamine. As a result, she argues the \"per se prejudice analysis\" from\n   <em>\n    Sheeley\n   </em>\n   should apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b617] We have retreated from an \"error per se\" analysis for errors based on judicial and prosecutorial comments in front of the jury. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Large v.

Previously, we had stated \"testimony offering an opinion as to the guilt of the defendant, when elicited by a prosecuting attorney, should be perceived as error per se.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8392135\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/177/807/\">\n    177 P.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stephens v.

The question here is whether the district court violated this particular rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b626] The district court's comment to the jury pertained to a fact already referenced by both the defense and the prosecution. The defense, in its opening statement, told the jury methamphetamine was found at the jail in the front pocket of the jeans Ms. Sorensen was wearing. According to the defense, the only question was whether Ms. Sorensen knew the methamphetamine was there. Prior to the district court's comments, Deputy Yocum had identified the baggie and testified on the Crime Lab reports stating the baggie contained methamphetamine. The Crime Lab report was admitted without objection. By the time the district court referred to the substance in the baggie as methamphetamine, rather than \"alleged\" methamphetamine, it was an acknowledged fact which had been submitted to the jury by both parties. The district court's comment did not violate a clear rule of law because no fact was at issue for the jury to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b627] However, even if we find the judge's comments were error when made, there is no prejudice here. Ms. Sorensen argues defense counsel's statements in opening argument are irrelevant as there had been no stipulation regarding the nature of the substance in the baggie prior to trial or prior to the district court's remarks that the baggie contained methamphetamine. Therefore, this element of the crime remained a question for the jury to decide. We recognize the argument of counsel is not evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Tanner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308554\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1242/\">\n    2002 WY 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9308554\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1242/\">\n    57 P.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1246 (Wyo. 2002). Here, in addition to defense counsel's opening statement, the defense formally stipulated to the Crime Lab report identifying the contents of the baggie as methamphetamine. This stipulation occurred shortly after the judge recommended the jurors use gloves to inspect the evidence. Moreover, Ms. Sorensen testified a baggie of methamphetamine was found in the pocket of the jeans she was wearing. Any possible prejudice caused by the judge's remark regarding the substance in the baggie was vitiated by Ms. Sorensen's later testimony admitting the baggie found on her person contained methamphetamine. No fact was at issue such that the district court's comments could indicate a bias. The district court's remarks do not constitute plain error which materially prejudiced Ms. Sorensen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Here, the jury heard testimony that the pants appeared to fit Ms. Sorensen, and the other female residents of the house were not the same size as Ms. Sorensen. When Ms. Sorensen told Deputy Yocum the belt was hers, she said nothing about the pants belonging to someone else. Sergeant Stephens said Ms. Sorensen appeared to be looking for something during the search and did not say the pants were not hers until after the baggie was found. Ms. Sorensen testified she was anxious to get to the hospital to be with her family that morning, but the arrest did not occur until approximately four in the afternoon.
