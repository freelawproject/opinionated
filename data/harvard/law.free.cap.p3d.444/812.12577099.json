We affirm the portion of the order retroactively establishing a child support order, reverse the portion of the order determining mother's income, and remand the case for further proceedings. In so doing, we interpret a 2013 amendment to the child support statute that resolved conflicting decisions from divisions of our court concerning parents' responsibilities\n   to pay child support when a voluntary change in parenting time occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Relevant Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Mother and father, the parents of two children, were divorced in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2014, both parents moved to modify parenting time. In February 2015, the district court entered a week on/week off parenting time schedule and modified child support accordingly. The parents then agreed in June 2015 to modify the week on/week off parenting time schedule such that father would be the primary residential parent and mother would have parenting time every other weekend and one evening per week. Based on the revised parenting time schedule, father began paying mother a reduced amount of child support. Father then moved to modify child support in July 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 The parties again agreed to change parenting time in February 2017. Mother became the primary residential parent of one child while father remained the primary residential parent of the other child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 After a March 2017 hearing, the district court made the following findings with respect to the parties' incomes for child support purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 father was capable of earning $20,000 per month;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 mother was doing contract work and earning $2000 to $4000 per month;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 mother had an extensive background in public relations, marketing, and communications and had historically earned at least $6000 per month until she lost her job in 2016;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 mother believed that the job market was saturated and that going forward she would not be able to earn the equivalent of her prior salary; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 the court \"was not provided with credible evidence\" that mother was incapable of reaching her income potential if employed full time in her field.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 Based on these findings, the court calculated child support using $6000 per month as mother's income. The court further determined that because of the substantial changes in parenting time beginning in June 2015, mother should have been paying child support to father and therefore owed him $21,389 in arrearages. Offsetting mother's arrearages against father's current child support obligation, the court ordered father to pay mother $225.58 per month for twenty-four months and then $1116.79 per month thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. Income Imputation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mother contends that the district court erred when it imputed $6000 per month in income to her without finding she was voluntarily underemployed.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Mother presented evidence at the hearing about her work in marketing and public relations and about her earnings. Her tax returns, admitted as exhibits during the hearing, reflected that her annual income from her business was $26,946 in 2014 and $23,533 in 2015 and that she earned $52,042 in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 13 Mother testified that two months after losing her job in November 2016, she accepted a lower-paying position in the design field, earning $500 per week for eight weeks and then commissions at a rate of three to five percent per sale. Additionally, she accepted a short-term contract position with a digital marketing company where she had the potential to earn between $2000 and $4000 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 Mother further testified about her efforts to secure a higher-paying position in her field. She consulted online resources, sent out 150 resumes, and had many interviews, yet had not secured a position because, in her opinion, the public relations market was saturated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 The district court made findings regarding mother's income potential, and some of those findings appear to touch on the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9117801\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/474/#p480\">\n    70 P.3d at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, the court considered mother's prior employment experience and history as well as her testimony that the market for public relations positions was saturated.

It observed that under those procedures and considerations, only the noncustodial parent qualified as the obligor under an existing child support order, and the statute gave the obligor the choice, on assuming primary physical care of a child, of whether and when to file a motion requiring the other parent to begin paying child support.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 The division also disagreed with the\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   division's conclusion that a narrow interpretation of the statute would cause a lapse in support during a child's minority.\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n    240 P.3d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   division noted that even though the existing support order did not obligate the former custodial parent to make child support payments, the retroactive modification as of the change in physical care did not terminate that parent's child support obligation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It further noted that section 14-10-122(5) \"permits the court to retroactively modify the provisions for the child support of the obligor in the existing order as of the date of the change of custody to ensure that the parent who gives up custody,\" and no longer incurs the associated expenses, \"does not receive a windfall.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990721\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/534/\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28 In 2013, the legislature amended section 14-10-122(5) in two ways. First, it clarified that a district court can modify or terminate the obligor's child support obligation as of the date physical care changed.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, when a court-ordered, voluntary, or mutually agreed upon change of physical care occurs, the provisions for child support of the obligor under the existing child support order, if modified pursuant to this section, will be\n   <em>\n    modified or terminated\n   </em>\n   as of the date when physical care was changed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ch. 103, sec. 3, \u00a7 14-10-122(5),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%20354\">\n    2013 Colo. Sess. Laws 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Second, it added the following language: \"The provisions for the establishment of a child support order based on a court-ordered, voluntary, or mutually agreed upon change of physical care may also be entered retroactively to the date when the physical care was changed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%20354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We conclude that these modifications, when read together, still do not resolve the statute's ambiguity recognized in\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   . In our view, the statute remains susceptible of multiple interpretations-one, that a court may modify or terminate only the obligor's child support obligation as of the date physical care changed, or two, that a court may establish a new child support obligation against either parent as of the date physical care changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 In light of this ambiguity, we attempt to discern whether the legislature intended the amendments to address the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   conflict and, if so, whether it intended the amendments to validate the\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   division's interpretation and application of the statute. We must engage in this examination of legislative intent because the statute is ambiguous. Thus, we look to the legislative history of the 2013 amendments to section 14-10-122(5), and we conclude that the General Assembly intended to change the statute in favor of the\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   division's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 30 The amendments to section 14-10-122(5) were proposed in the House of Representatives in February 2013. When introducing the bill, the bill's sponsor indicated that the proposed amendments were based on recommendations from the Child Support Commission. Hearings on H.B. 13-1209 before the H. Pub. Health Care &amp; Human Servs. Comm., 69th Gen. Assemb., 1st Sess. (Feb. 19, 2013) (statement of Representative May). The Child Support Commission is charged with reviewing the child support guidelines and recommending statutory amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-10-115(16). The Commission's 2011 report is the genesis of the legislature's 2013 amendments to section 14-10-122(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 31 In its report, the Commission explicitly recognized the conflict between\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   and recommended the statutory amendments \"to empower a court\n   <em>\n    with discretion\n   </em>\n   to retroactively establish a\n   child support obligation back to the date of the mutually agreed upon change of physical care.\" State of Colorado Child Support Commission, Final Report, at 41 (2011), https://perma.cc/2XB5-7LDR (emphasis added). The Commission provided three reasons in support of its amendments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Parents owe a continuous duty to provide financial support for their child until emancipation, regardless of the location of the child's residence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   2. The duty to provide support should not lapse, during a child's minority, just because of a change in the residence of the child; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   3. The child is the person for whom support is due and a child should not be penalized because the new custodial party fails to promptly act to seek a modification of the existing order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20Colo.%20Sess.%20Laws%20354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because these reasons mirror those set forth in\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the General Assembly's 2013 amendments to section 14-10-122(5) legislatively overrule\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we further conclude that the statute allows a court to retroactively enter a child support order against either parent, as of the date of a change in physical care of a child, regardless of the parent's status as an obligor or obligee under the existing child support order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D. Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 32 In this case, mother was the obligee under the existing child support order. In June 2015, when the parties agreed that their children would live with father, they also agreed that father's child support obligation would be reduced. Father then moved to modify child support, asking the court to retroactively establish a child support order from June 2015 forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 33 Even though mother was the obligee under the existing child support order, the court, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Emerson\n   </em>\n   and as permitted by the 2013 amendments to section 14-10-122(5), retroactively established a child support order obligating mother to pay support as of the date the children began living with father. We therefore conclude that the court did not err by imposing a child support obligation on mother beginning in June 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 34 However, because we cannot discern whether the district court imposed the retroactive child support obligation as an act of discretion or imposed it under the mistaken view that it was required to do so, on remand, the district court must set forth the factors it considers in determining whether to impose such an obligation. Because we have remanded the case for the court to reconsider mother's income and redetermine child support accordingly, the court must also recalculate the parties' arrearages under subsections 14-10-122(1)(d) and (5). Because of this disposition, we do not address mother's additional argument that the court erred in assuming the parties' incomes remained unchanged for purposes of retroactive child support calculation. In its discretion, the district court may consider additional evidence from the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 35 Mother also argues that the court erred in awarding retroactive child support because doing so created an undue hardship and resulted in a substantial injustice for her, because she and father had an oral contract as to the modified child support, and because the doctrine of equitable estoppel relieved her of her obligation to pay retroactive child support. Because mother did not raise these arguments in the district court, however, we may not address them here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melat, Pressman &amp; Higbie, L.L.P. v.
