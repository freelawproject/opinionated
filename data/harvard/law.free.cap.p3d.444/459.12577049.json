Ninth Judicial District Court, Douglas County; Thomas W.

After respondent Fidelity National Title Insurance Company denied Schiller's claim for his property's reduced value, Schiller sued Fidelity, alleging breach-of-contract and bad-faith claims based on his contention that his title insurance policy covered lakefront property.

The location of the meander line relative to Schiller's land is significant: \"It has frequently been held, both by the federal and state courts, that such meander lines are intended for the purpose of bounding and abutting the lands granted upon the waters whose margins are thus meandered, and that the waters themselves constitute the real boundary.\"\n   <em>\n    Hardin v.

Because the plat indicates that Schiller's land is not bounded by the meander line, but rather by a line 18 feet landward of the meander line, Schiller's insured interest is not waterfront.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen v.

L. \u00a7 7:8 (West 2018 ed.) (\"Title insurers have no duty to obtain a survey in connection with the issuance of a title insurance policy.\"). Schiller did not elect to commission or record any survey before purchasing the property. The 1921 plat therefore controls the policy's definition of insured interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kepler-Fleenor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6950475\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/152/207/#p1163\">\n    268 P.3d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a plat [is] unambiguous[ ] ..., the plain language of the instrument controls [,]\" and \"extrinsic evidence ...

Schiller's reliance on policy exceptions to create an ambiguity as to the policy's coverage is unconvincing and unreasonable. We also reject any argument that the challenged strip of land constituted an easement-the record does not support such an interpretation. It is also of no avail that Fidelity provided a different map than the 1921 plat with Schiller's policy. The policy's reference to and incorporation of the plat is plain, and the plat is a publicly-available record. Finally, a title insurance policy does not insure against losses due to a seller's misrepresentations or a buyer's failed expectations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barlow Burke,\n   <em>\n    Title Insurance Defined,\n   </em>\n   L.

As plainly stated in the description of the insured interest, Schiller's policy covered no more than title to lots 2 and 3 as they were represented on the 1921 plat. And as plainly represented on the controlling 1921 plat, lots 2 and 3 did not have a water boundary. Schiller's insured interest was therefore not waterfront.
