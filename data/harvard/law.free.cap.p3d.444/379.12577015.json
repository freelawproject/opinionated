Ford makes several constitutional arguments, all of which are raised for the first time on appeal. First, Ford contends the district court violated his due process rights when it required him to register as a violent offender without notice or an opportunity to be heard. Second, Ford claims KORA unconstitutionally violates offenders' due process rights by failing to establish the State's burden of proof or a process by which to contest the district court's factual findings creating a duty to register. And third, Ford alleges the district court unlawfully increased his punishment based on improper judicial fact-finding in violation of his constitutional rights as recognized in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.

After carefully considering Ford's arguments, we are unpersuaded by them and affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 11, 2017, Ford robbed a convenience store. Ford entered the convenience store, pointed a handgun at the store clerk, and demanded money. The store clerk gave Ford about $132, which included a marked $2 bill. After receiving information concerning Ford's involvement with the robbery, officers obtained a warrant to search Ford's residence. While searching Ford's residence, officers found a loaded handgun and the marked $2 bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ford was arrested and subsequently charged with aggravated robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. As part of a plea agreement with the State, Ford waived his preliminary hearing and pled guilty to an amended charge of simple robbery, a severity level 5 person felony. The amended complaint did not state that Ford used a gun or another deadly weapon during the commission of the robbery. When giving the factual basis for the plea, the State explained that Ford pointed a black semiautomatic handgun at the store clerk and demanded money. The State also noted that officers located a .22-caliber black Ruger handgun with a loaded magazine in Ford's residence. The district court determined a factual basis existed for the plea and found Ford guilty of robbery. The district court did not inform Ford of his duty to register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to sentencing, a presentence investigation (PSI) report revealed that Ford's criminal history included four convictions of automotive burglary and a conviction of aggravated battery. The PSI also indicated that a special sentencing rule applied because Ford's crime of conviction was a \"person felony committed with a firearm.\" When a firearm is used to commit a person felony, the sentence is presumptive imprisonment. K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 21-6804(h). The PSI noted that offender registration was required under K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-4902. Ford filed a motion for a departure from his presumed sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At sentencing, the State opposed the departure motion, arguing Ford had committed armed robbery and pointed a gun at the clerk's head. The district court denied Ford's departure motion, reasoning: \"Not only was this an armed robbery of a Kwik Shop with a gun used, and\n   <em>\n    the court will make the finding of a weapon\n   </em>\n   , you had just got out of prison.\" (Emphasis added.) The district court sentenced Ford to 57 months in prison with 24 months of postrelease supervision. Again, the district court did not mention registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequent to sentencing, a disagreement arose concerning whether the journal entry should reflect that Ford must register as a violent offender because the crime was committed with a deadly weapon. At the hearing to resolve the journal entry, the State argued registration was required because the case involved an armed robbery and the district court \"made a specific finding that a dangerous weapon had been involved.\" Ford's counsel responded: \"What I have in my notes, judge, is that the court said the words [']that a gun was used in the commission of the crime,['] but there was no finding that it was a dangerous weapon and there was no finding that it was a registration order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court determined that Ford must register as a violent offender, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The court specifically found a firearm was used in the commission of the offense. That requires registration....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"... [I]f there's any question whether a gun or a firearm is a dangerous weapon I will say that it is. And under Kansas law registration is required and it's the responsibility of the Department of Corrections to see that that is done.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court filed a journal entry which required Ford to register as a violent offender under KORA for 15 years after his release from prison because he committed a person felony with a deadly weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ford timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I. DID THE DISTRICT COURT VIOLATE FORD'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS BY REQUIRING HIM TO REGISTER AS A VIOLENT OFFENDER ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ford complains his due process rights were violated when the district court required him to register as a violent offender because he \"had no notice nor meaningful opportunity to be heard on the court's discretionary finding that he register as a violent offender for 15 years for his conviction of robbery, which does not have a weapon as an element of the crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Should we consider this issue raised for the first time on appeal\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ford acknowledges that he raises this due process claim for the first time on appeal. Generally, an issue not raised before the district court-even a constitutional claim-may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A violent offender includes any person convicted of a person felony after July 1, 2006, when \"the court makes a finding on the record that a deadly weapon was used in the commission of such person felony.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-4902(e)(2). And, generally, an offender must register for 15 years if the offender is convicted of a person felony and \"the court makes a finding on the record that a deadly weapon was used in the commission of such person felony.\" K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-4906(a)(1)(N).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At Ford's plea hearing, the State provided a factual basis for the plea and explained that Ford used a gun in the commission of the crime. Ford never objected to the State's factual basis. Given the factual basis that a gun (which we agree is a deadly weapon) was used by Ford to commit the robbery, Ford was put on notice at this point that he could be subject to a registration requirement. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith-Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417628\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/132/#p154\">\n    301 Kan. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417628\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/132/#p154\">\n    340 P.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"A gun is unquestionably a deadly weapon.\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1909 (11th ed. 2019) (term \"deadly weapon\" includes \"[a]ny firearm or other device ... calculated or likely to produce death\"). But Ford argues the district court improperly failed to inform him about his registration obligations at the plea hearing as required by KORA. See K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-4904(a)(1)(A). However, this failure does not affect Ford's violent offender status or otherwise excuse his registration obligations. See 307 Kan. at 790-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to our Supreme Court, \"[n]o provision in KORA creates a consequence for the [district court's] failure to inform a defendant [of his or her duty to register] at the appropriate time.... [T]he Act itself imposes the duty to register upon [the defendant], rather than the court's order.\" 307 Kan. at 790. The purposes of the notice requirement are ensuring offenders know their registration obligations and preventing lack of knowledge from being raised as a defense to a later charge of failing to register. 307 Kan. at 790. But \"neither the fact of notice or its timing are dispositive to whether a person is an 'offender' and, therefore, subject to registration requirements.\" 307 Kan. at 791. As a result, the district court's failure to satisfy K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 22-4904(a)(1)(A) does not entitle Ford to any relief at this stage of the proceedings. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Wren\n   </em>\n   , No. 118,046,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203077193\">\n    2018 WL 3077193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Kan. App. 2018) (unpublished opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to the record, notice was provided to Ford in multiple ways. First, in addition to the notice provided by the factual basis at the plea hearing, the PSI prepared prior to sentencing put Ford specifically on notice that he was subject to a registration requirement. The PSI specifically stated that a special sentencing rule applied because Ford had committed a person felony with a firearm and that registration was required. Second, during sentencing, the district court found that Ford used a gun in the commission of the robbery, a person felony, and specifically noted that \"the court will make the finding of a weapon.\" Ford did not object to this finding, nor did Ford object to the PSI. Although the district court did not use the words \"deadly\" or \"dangerous\" from the bench, it noted a gun was used and made the specific \"finding of a weapon.\" Third, the completed sentencing journal entry indicated that Ford had committed the crime of conviction with a deadly weapon. In the journal entry, the district court checked a box labeled \"Yes\" next to the question asking whether the offender committed the current crime with a deadly weapon. As a result of this finding, an offender registration supplement was attached to the journal entry, showing Ford's duty to register as a violent offender for 15 years because he was convicted \"of a person felony with court finding on the record that such felony was committed with a DEADLY WEAPON.\" Our Supreme Court has found such findings made in the sentencing journal entry to be sufficient to require registration.\n   <em>\n    Marinelli\n   </em>\n   , 307 Kan. at 788-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ford was also given the opportunity to be heard. As we have already noted, after sentencing the State and Ford disputed whether the journal entry should include a registration requirement. At a special hearing to resolve the journal entry, Ford was given the opportunity to argue that, although the district court found a gun was used, \"there was no finding that it was a dangerous weapon and there was no finding that it was a registration order.\" In response, the district court then clarified that the gun was a dangerous weapon that was used in the commission of the offense. Ford did not object to this finding nor did he ask the court to reconsider its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude the district court properly found on the record that Ford used a deadly weapon, and it did not violate Ford's due process rights when it required him to register as a violent offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II. DOES KORA VIOLATE OFFENDERS ' DUE PROCESS RIGHTS ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ford next contends that KORA is unconstitutional on its face because (1) the Act fails to specify the burden of proof required to find that an offender used a deadly weapon when committing a person felony and (2) the Act does not give offenders an opportunity to contest the district court's exercise of a discretionary finding. Ford asserts these failures violate defendants' procedural due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Again, Ford acknowledges he did not challenge the constitutionality of KORA before the district court. But Kansas courts have considered the constitutionality of KORA for the first time on appeal to serve the ends of justice and prevent the denial of fundamental rights. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ford was considered a violent offender after the district court found that he used a deadly weapon in the commission of the crime. And like the requested preregistration hearing in\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   , there is no risk that a defendant's lack of opportunity to contest the district court's exercise of its discretionary consideration would lead to an erroneous application of KORA's mandatory requirements.

In contrast, \"[t]he legislature intended KORA to be civil and nonpunitive for all classes of offenders currently subject to its provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Huey\n   </em>\n   , 306 Kan. at 1009. In fact, our Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that offender registration under KORA is punishment. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , 306 Kan. at 1095 ;\n   <em>\n    Huey\n   </em>\n   , 306 Kan. at 1009-10 ;\n   <em>\n    Petersen-Beard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415971\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/192/#p194\">\n    304 Kan. at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Huey\n   </em>\n   , the Kansas Supreme Court reviewed procedural facts and arguments identical to Ford's arguments here. Huey claimed the district court's deadly weapon finding and resulting registration order violated his constitutional rights under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   . However, Huey brought his claim for the first time on appeal, so he had not presented facts to the district court attempting to show that the registration's effects on him were punitive. The Kansas Supreme Court found that because the Kansas Legislature intended KORA to be a civil regulatory scheme-not punishment-a defendant must present \"the clearest proof\" that registration was punitive before the court would consider registration a criminal penalty and that Huey had not shown, as he must, that his registration requirements constituted punishment. 306 Kan. at 1010. \"Because the registration requirements did not increase Huey's punishment ..., it was not necessary that Huey's use of a deadly weapon be found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury.\" 306 Kan. at 1010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Like Huey, Ford did not raise an\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   claim before the district court and has provided no fact-based record for this court to evaluate KORA's alleged punitive effects on him or any other violent offender. Thus, Ford has not shown that his registration requirements as a violent offender are punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Ford asserts\n   <em>\n    Huey\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, \"[t]his court is duty bound to follow Kansas Supreme Court precedent absent some indication that the court is departing from its previous position.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416963\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/51/1066/#p1072\">\n    51 Kan.

Because the registration order did not increase Ford's punishment, it was unnecessary that Ford's use of a deadly weapon be found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury.
