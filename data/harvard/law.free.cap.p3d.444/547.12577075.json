A-Fab Engineering (A-Fab) challenges two property tax assessments levied in 2012 and 2013 by the Utah State Tax Commission (Commission). The Commission dismissed A-Fab's administrative appeal as untimely. A-Fab then petitioned the district court for review of the Commission's decision. The district court summarily dismissed the petition because (1) A-Fab did not timely exhaust its administrative remedies; and therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) A-Fab was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline to file an administrative appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 A-Fab is a Utah corporation that fabricates, refurbishes, and sells equipment. In or before 2007, A-Fab acquired and rebuilt a\n   \"long-wall mining system\" (Property). In September 2007, A-Fab sold the Property to C.W. Mining (CW). The sale was financed through a capital lease. In January 2008, however, CW involuntarily entered into bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court asserted jurisdiction over the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In December 2008, A-Fab filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, asserting that it owned the Property, and sought \"substantial amounts for lease rejection damages.\" The trustee of the bankruptcy estate responded by filing a complaint against A-Fab that included, among eleven claims for relief, a claim of ownership over the Property. In 2010, while the Property dispute was still pending, the bankruptcy court ordered that A-Fab could take possession of the Property, but that the Property would still be subject to the bankruptcy trustee's authority before it could be sold or transferred in any way. A-Fab took possession of the Property shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 A-Fab regained full ownership rights to the Property in 2014 when it entered into a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy estate. Under the terms of the settlement, the bankruptcy estate relinquished any and all claims to the Property in return for a $ 225,000 payment from A-Fab. The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement in November 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the motion to approve the settlement agreement, the bankruptcy trustee noted that \"A-Fab asserted that it owned the [Property] and was leasing it to [CW] under a purported September 1, 2007 lease\" and \"A-Fab has asserted that it incurred substantial removal, storage and preservation costs, including\n   <em>\n    the payment of personal property taxes\n   </em>\n   , in connection with ... the [Property].\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    The Property Tax Assessments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 As required by Utah Code sections 59-2-201 and 59-2-202(1), A-Fab completed and filed its 2012 annual return for assessment of personal property (Return) with the Commission on March 1, 2012. A-Fab's 2012 Return listed the Property as being \"subject to assessment by the State Tax Commission.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the 2012 Return, the Commission prepared a notice of assessment and mailed it-to the address provided by A-Fab on its 2012 Return-on May 1, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 On February 27, 2013, A-Fab filed its 2013 Return and again listed the Property as being \"subject to Assessment by the State Tax Commission.\" A-Fab attached to the 2013 Return a letter requesting that the Commission reconsider the value of the Property. In this letter, A-Fab included an independent appraisal of the Property and \"urge[d] the Tax Commission to reconsider its 2013 assessment of the value of [the Property].\" The Commission prepared a notice of assessment and mailed it on May 1, 2013, to the address provided by A-Fab on the 2013 Return. A-Fab did not appeal or pay the 2012 and 2013 assessments (Assessments) within the prescribed tax years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 A-Fab appealed the Assessments in December 2016. Earlier that year, A-Fab had \"inquired of Carbon County whether there were any taxes owed [on the Property] before\n   2014\"-when A-Fab's ownership rights to the Property were restored-and Carbon County responded that there were not. On June 15, 2016, however, Carbon County mailed a delinquent tax notice, based on the Assessments, to the address provided by A-Fab on its Returns. A-Fab initially raised a challenge to the delinquent tax notice with Carbon County, but the county instructed A-Fab that a formal appeal would need to be taken up with the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 On December 6, 2016, A-Fab filed an administrative appeal with the Commission challenging the Assessments. The Commission issued an order to show cause directing A-Fab to explain why its appeal should not be dismissed for failure to timely file.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its answer, A-Fab argued that equitable tolling should extend the deadline to appeal because the Property was subject to CW's bankruptcy proceedings until October 2014. The Commission rejected A-Fab's argument concluding that A-Fab failed to timely appeal the Assessments and further failed to \"demonstrate extraordinary circumstances or due diligence sufficient\" to toll the deadline to appeal. Specifically, the Commission concluded that A-Fab knew that it included the Property on its 2012 Return and 2013 Return and therefore knew the Property would be assessed for those years. The Commission also decided that A-Fab was not excused from missing the deadline to appeal because it had regained full ownership rights to the Property in October 2014 and \"yet it still did not file this appeal until December 6, 2016.\" A-Fab then petitioned the district court for review of the Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the district court. The Commission argued that \"A-Fab's petition should be dismissed because it did not exhaust its administrative remedies by filing a timely appeal to the Commission\" and that \"equitable tolling would be inappropriate because A-Fab waited until December 2016-more than two years after it settled with the bankruptcy trustee-to appeal the [Assessments].\" A-Fab argued that the Commission lacked the authority to assess the Property and that the untimely administrative appeal was therefore inconsequential. In the alternative, A-Fab argued that equitable tolling should apply and extend the deadline to appeal because: although the Commission had mailed the Assessments, A-Fab never actually received the Assessments because they were mailed to A-Fab's old address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The district court granted the Commission's motion. In the court's ruling and order, it found that \"A-Fab did not file its appeals for the 2012 and 2013 tax years until December 6, 2016, well after the deadlines of June 1, 2012, and June 1, 2013, respectively,\" and thus concluded that \"A-Fab did not exhaust its administrative remedies and therefore the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court also concluded that equitable tolling did not extend the deadline to file an appeal because A-Fab \"was given clear ownership of the Property in 2014\"-and therefore, \"[e]ven if equitable tolling were applicable, ... A-Fab's appeal would still be untimely.\" The court reasoned that even if \"A-Fab was uncertain regarding its obligations to pay taxes on the Property, A-Fab clearly knew that the Tax Commission believed the tax payments on the Property were A-Fab's responsibility\" because \"an attorney for A-Fab sent a letter to the [Commission] disputing the valuation of the Property.\" Finally, \"A-Fab asserted that it owned the property and was leasing it to [CW],\" and therefore, \"because A-Fab was asserting an ownership interest in the Property and had been provided [the Assessments], equitable tolling is inapplicable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 A-Fab appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The first issue raised is whether the district court erred by dismissing A-Fab's\n   petition for judicial review and finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to A-Fab's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. A district court's order dismissing a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the failure to exhaust administrative remedies is reviewed for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Nebeker v.

The crux of A-Fab's challenge is that the Commission lacked authority to assess and tax the Property. A-Fab argues that the Assessments are \"illegal and void\" because A-Fab is not a mining company, (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2-201\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 59-2-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(vi) (LexisNexis 2018)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (authorizing the Commission to assess and tax \"all machinery used in mining ... that [is] primarily used by the owner of a mine ... regardless of actual location\")); and that in 2012 and 2013 the Property was \"inventory held for sale in the ordinary course of business and thus was exempt from taxation,\" (citing\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2-201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 59-2-1114(1) (providing an exemption for property \"held for sale in the ordinary course of business\")). These arguments fall short of demonstrating that exhaustion would serve no useful purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 As the Commission points out, A-Fab could have timely appealed the Assessments and argued that it was not a mine owner and that the Property was merely inventory. And if it had, the Commission might have agreed and there would be no need for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Further, the record does not indicate that the Commission lacked authority \"on its face\" to assess the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Tax Comm'n v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Nebeker\n   </em>\n   elaborated that deciding constitutional issues is \"not within the [Commission's] jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9458402\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/34/180/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 Here, like in\n   <em>\n    J. &amp; W. Auto Service\n   </em>\n   , the Commission did not lack authority on its face to tax the Property. First, the Commission reasonably believed it had the authority to assess the Property because A-Fab identified the Property as \"subject to assessment by the State Tax Commission\" on its 2012 and 2013 Returns. Second, but for the allegation that the Property was being held as inventory, the Property would have been subject to assessment by the Commission because it is mining equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2-201\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 59-2-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (authorizing the Commission to assess and tax \"all machinery used in mining ... that [is] primarily used by the owner of a mine ... regardless of actual location\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 Whether the Commission should have taxed the Property is precisely the type of issue that could have, and should have, been brought before the Commission. Thus, A-Fab has failed to demonstrate that it was justified in bypassing the administrative appeal process-and\n   therefore, the district court properly dismissed A-Fab's petition on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. Equitable Tolling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 Alternatively, A-Fab contends that the district court erred in concluding that equitable tolling did not apply as a matter of law. A-Fab raises a single argument in support of its contention: whether it received the Assessments is disputed, and therefore summary judgment should not have been granted. A-Fab argues that the Commission mailed the Assessments to its old address; and consequently A-Fab did not learn about the Assessments until 2016, when Carbon County mailed the delinquent tax notice. We find this argument unpersuasive for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b626 First, as the Commission points out, this disputed fact is immaterial because the time to appeal is triggered by the mailing of the assessment, not whether the assessment is received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2059-2-1007\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 59-2-1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) (LexisNexis 2008). And even if this fact was material, A-Fab did not create a genuine dispute of this fact. The record indicates that A-Fab presented an affidavit claiming \"it did not have any record of receiving\" the Assessments. This affidavit only avers that A-Fab did not have a record of receipt, not that A-Fab did not indeed receive the Assessments. A-Fab has declined to address these points anywhere in the record or on appeal, and therefore, A-Fab's notice argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Second, it is undisputed that the Assessments were mailed to the address provided by A-Fab itself. The Returns filed in 2012 and 2013-which were prepared, signed, and dated by A-Fab-both list A-Fab's old address. The certified mail receipts for those Returns also list A-Fab's old address. In other words, any mistake in the mailing address to which the Assessments were sent was invited by A-Fab. Accordingly, A-Fab is not excused from its alleged ignorance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 Finally, the record indicates that A-Fab was on notice of the Assessments. Attached to A-Fab's 2013 Return is a letter requesting that the Commission reconsider the value of the Property. This letter included an independent appraisal of the Property and urged the Tax Commission to reconsider its 2013 assessment of the value of the Property. Simply put, A-Fab could not ask for reconsideration of something it was not aware of. Thus, A-Fab has not demonstrated a dispute of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment, and therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 A-Fab failed to timely appeal the Assessments and therefore the district court properly dismissed A-Fab's petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. A-Fab also failed to demonstrate a dispute of material fact that would preclude summary judgment on the issue of whether the deadline to appeal should have been equitably tolled.

First, the record demonstrates that the settlement was executed in October 2014 and the bankruptcy court approved the settlement in November 2014. Second, A-Fab stated in its petition for review to the district court, \"On October 29, 2014, A-Fab entered into a settlement agreement with the Trustee of the CW estate, in which the Trustee relinquished his claim on the Property.\" Third, in its opposition to the Commission's motion for summary judgment, A-Fab did not dispute the terms of the settlement agreement and affirmatively alleged that upon the agreement's approval in November 2014, it \"essentially purchased the [P]roperty\" back from the bankruptcy estate.
