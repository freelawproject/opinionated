Taylor also claims that the sentence does not meet the goal of deterrence because an offender's criminal history already serves to deter him or her from committing additional crimes. Taylor further claims that incapacitation does not justify lifetime postrelease supervision because by the time an offender is subject to postrelease supervision, he or she has already served the prison term, and because it applies too broadly to all sexual offenders without determining the risk that the offender will reoffend. Finally, Taylor claims that the sentence does not meet the goal of rehabilitation because postrelease supervision here continues for the offender's lifetime regardless of how much he or she ages or improves his or her moral character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Kansas courts have previously considered whether lifetime postrelease supervision for sex offenders serves legitimate penological goals.

Here, Taylor claims defense counsel was deficient in failing to argue that his two prior convictions in Texas for assault on a public servant (listed as prior conviction numbers 39 and 40 in the presentence investigation report) did not have comparable offenses in Kansas and, therefore, should not have been classified as felonies for purposes of criminal history. Notwithstanding his claim, Taylor readily acknowledges defense counsel lodged an objection to his criminal history score at the sentencing hearing. Taylor does not dispute that counsel adamantly advised him not to waive the challenge but that Taylor ignored that advice. Taylor also does not dispute that defense counsel requested a continuance but he opposed it and insisted on proceeding with sentencing that day. Based on these undisputed facts, we find no deficiency in counsel's performance and no merit to Taylor's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
