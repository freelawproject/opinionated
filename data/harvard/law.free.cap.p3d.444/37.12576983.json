Cell phone data, for example, represents\n  a new frontier in police investigative tactics. Cell-site location information (CSLI) is highly detailed data, which can create a historical map of where a particular cell phone traveled during a set period of time. Based on this technology, police are able to look back in time and find out precisely where anyone was at a given time, buttressed only by the retention policy of the individual's wireless provider.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  \u00b62 The protection against abuse of this highly detailed and personal information is through a familiar mechanism: the constitutional requirements of a warrant. A warrant, supported by probable cause and meeting the particularity requirement, provides an individual with the constitutionally required protections against privacy invasions by the state.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  \u00b63 William Phillip sought discretionary review of a trial court order approving a subpoena issued to Phillip's wireless provider requiring the provider to release Phillip's CSLI records. Because the State failed to seek issuance of a warrant, and State and trial court failed to recognize Phillip's privacy interest in the CSLI records, we reverse, vacate the subpoena, and remand for further proceedings.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

Frankel's girlfriend, Bonnie Johnson, lived part-time with Frankel in Auburn and part-time in Portland where she worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On May 21, 2010, Johnson became concerned when she was unable to reach Frankel by phone. Johnson contacted Frankel's neighbor, who went to Frankel's house and observed a body lying on the floor. The Auburn police department responded and discovered Frankel was dead due to a knife wound to his throat. An 18-inch black zip tie was attached to one of Frankel's wrists and another zip tie was found near his body. Frankel's house was locked and appeared orderly other than the area immediately surrounding Frankel's body. A medical examiner estimated Frankel's time of death as between 8:00 p.m. May 21 and 4:30 a.m. May 22, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Over the next few days, Auburn police interviewed Johnson multiple times. During these interviews and a consensual search of Johnson's cell phone, police discovered that Johnson had been in frequent contact by telephone with Phillip and another man from Sacramento, California. Text messages between Johnson and Phillip appeared flirtatious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 On May 25, 2010, at the request of the Auburn police, a Portland police Officer visited Phillip. Without telling him that Johnson was dead or that he was investigating a murder, the officer asked if Phillip knew Johnson. Phillip stated that Johnson was a friend. When asked if he had been to Auburn recently, Phillip responded that he wanted to exercise his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Over the course of their investigation, the Auburn police obtained a total of five warrants. First, on May 27, 2010, the Auburn Police obtained a warrant requiring AT &amp; T to provide them with Phillip's CSLI records. The affidavit for the May 2010 warrant described the crime scene, that Johnson and Frankel were in a relationship, and that Johnson continued to speak to her previous boyfriend, Phillip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 On June 9, 2010, the police visited the convention center where Phillip worked. Phillip's supervisor explained that Phillip commonly used zip ties in his job. The zip ties used at Phillip's work were identical to the zip ties found in Frankel's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 The police received Phillip's CSLI records from AT &amp; T on June 20, 2010. The records revealed that on the day of Frankel's murder Phillip traveled from Portland, Oregon\n   to Auburn, Washington. Phillip remained in Auburn-at times within blocks of Frankel's home-until approximately 9:00 p.m., and then traveled back to Portland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 On June 22, 2010, the police obtained a warrant to search Phillip's apartment, vehicle, and person. While executing that warrant, the police seized Phillip's cell phone and journal. In his journal, Phillip expressed that he was obsessed with Johnson and that Frankel was not good enough for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Auburn police then spoke with Katy Sanguino, Phillip's mother. She explained that Phillip, who only owned a motorcycle, had borrowed her car from May 21 to May 22, 2010. Sanguino gave the police consent to search her vehicle, where police found traces of blood on the inside driver's door handle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 In August of 2010, the Washington State Patrol Seattle Crime Laboratory determined that a bloodstained towel from the crime scene revealed two different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) types. The first type was from Frankel, the second was from an unknown male. On November 5, 2010, the police obtained a warrant for Phillip's DNA. That DNA sample revealed that Phillip was a possible contributor of the second DNA sample and only about 1 in 2.2 million individuals could have contributed the sample. After the DNA results came in, police arrested Phillip and charged him with first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 The police's fourth warrant came on January 25, 2012, and allowed the police to search the physical contents of Phillip's cell phone. In March 2012, Wyman Yip, the King County Prosecutor assigned to Phillip's case, asked the Auburn police to seek a more thorough warrant for Phillip's CSLI records. Yip stated that the May 2010 warrant was defensible, but the affidavit could have included other facts that were known at the time. Police prepared a new affidavit that incorporated the affidavit used to obtain the May 2010 warrant and provided further details about the crime scene and Johnson's relationship with Phillip. The trial court issued the warrant for Phillip's CSLI records on March 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 Pre-trial, Phillip moved to suppress all evidence obtained during the execution of the search warrants. The trial court denied the motion. Although the court found that the May 2010 warrant was not supported by probable cause, it determined that the March 2012 warrant was supported by probable cause and met the requirements of the independent source doctrine. The trial court also determined that the remaining warrants were valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b616 Phillip was tried for first degree murder. After his first trial ended in a hung jury, a second jury convicted Phillip of Frankel's murder. Phillip appealed his conviction to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 On appeal, we concluded that the facts in the affidavits used to obtain the May 2010 and March 2012 warrants for Phillip's CSLI records failed to provide a sufficient factual basis from which to infer that evidence of the crime would likely be found on Phillip's CSLI records. As we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The March 2012 affidavit incorporates the May 2010 affidavit and thus includes the earlier affidavit's brief description of the crime scene, identification of Johnson as Frankel's girlfriend, information that Johnson asked the neighbor to check on Frankel, and description of Phillip as a man with whom Johnson had a close relationship. The March 2012 affidavit provides further details about the crime scene, including the fact that doors were locked and that, except for the area immediately surrounding the body, the apartment appeared untouched. It also includes Johnson's statements that Phillip had served in the military, he was the only person she knew who had ever spoken ill of Frankel, he was the only person she could think of who would want to hurt Frankel, and he was extremely upset when she broke up with him. The affidavit reports Phillip's statement to the Portland police that Johnson was \"just a friend\" and his invocation of the right to counsel when asked if he had ever been in Auburn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The affidavit includes copies of text messages between Johnson and Phillip in the week of Frankel's death. The text messages appear flirtatious. In one message, Phillip refers to Frankel as an \"unhot old man.\" In Johnson's reply, she tells Phillip\n   not to speak about Frankel like that. The text messages do not express any intent to harm Frankel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The facts in the affidavit indicate that Phillip had a close relationship with Johnson and frequently communicated with her by telephone. Johnson said that Phillip was the only person she could think of who had spoken ill of Frankel and who might want to harm Frankel. But the only evidence supporting these assertions was Phillip's text referring to Frankel as an \"unhot old man\" and Johnson's claim that Phillip was very upset when she broke up with him. These facts at most suggest that Phillip may have been jealous of Frankel's relationship with Johnson. But they do not create a reasonable inference that Phillip was involved in Frankel's death or that evidence relating to Frankel's death would likely be found in Phillip's cell phone records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The affidavit also establishes that Phillip did not want to discuss with police whether he had traveled to Auburn. This fact may have indicated to police that further investigation was warranted, but it does not establish a connection sufficient to infer that evidence of the crime would likely be found in Phillip's cell phone records. \"Absent a sufficient basis in fact from which to conclude evidence of illegal activity will likely be found at the place to be searched, a reasonable nexus is not established as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Thein\n   </em>\n   , 138 Wn.2d at 147 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20P.2d%20582\">\n    977 P.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State argued below that Phillip's relationship with Johnson gave him a motive to harm Frankel, Phillip could have obtained a key to the apartment from Johnson, and Phillip thus may have had access to Frankel. The State further argued that Johnson and Phillip may have been jointly involved in the crime and that if either of them was the killer, evidence of the crime would likely be found in Phillip's phone records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   These are mere speculations. The facts in the affidavit provide no basis for inferring that Johnson and Phillip conspired to harm Frankel and that evidence of this Conspiracy would be found in Phillip's phone records.

Rather than offering a new affidavit in support of the subpoena, the State filed a memorandum that attached six previously filed affidavits including: (1) the December 8, 2010, certification for determination of probable cause\n   <em>\n    that included information from the tainted May 2010 CSLI records\n   </em>\n   , (2) the affidavit for the May 22, 2010, search warrant for the CSLI records\n   <em>\n    that the trial court held insufficient\n   </em>\n   , (3) an unsworn June 22, 2010, affidavit for the warrant to search Phillip's apartment, vehicle, and person,\n   <em>\n    that included information from the tainted May 2010 CSLI records\n   </em>\n   , (4) the affidavit for the November 5, 2010 warrant for Phillip's DNA, (5) the affidavit for the January 25, 2012 warrant for Phillip's cell phone\n   <em>\n    that included information from the tainted May 2010 CSLI record\n   </em>\n   , and (6) the affidavit for the March 22, 2012, renewed warrant for Phillip's CSLI records\n   <em>\n    that included information from the tainted\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSLI record AND that this court held insufficient\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 In its accompanying legal memorandum, the State recited the evidence contained in the attached affidavits, including a recitation of the information contained in the tainted CSLI records. While the State's memorandum urged the trial court to apply a probable cause standard for issuance of the subpoena, the memorandum also incorrectly asserted that our decision in\n   <em>\n    Phillip\n   </em>\n   \"noted that the facts established that the State would have sought the cell phone usage records via the second warrant even without knowledge of what the [tainted CSLI] records showed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State's memorandum further argued that, while it was requesting a subpoena, it should not need either a subpoena or probable cause because Phillip did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the cell phone records. Finally, the State argued that the independent source doctrine applied. The State asserted that\n   <em>\n    Phillip\n   </em>\n   \"implicitly held that the [cell phone] records would have been admissible under the independent source rule if there had been sufficient probable cause set forth in the affidavit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 The trial court granted the subpoena for Phillip's CSLI records on July 24, 2017. In doing so, the court determined that Phillip had a lower expectation of privacy in the historic cell tower records than he did in his personal cell phone and apartment. The trial court subsequently granted Phillip's motion to stay the execution of the subpoena, and certified its decision for interlocutory appeal. RAP 2.3(b).

Cell phones perform their wide and growing variety of functions by connecting to a set of radio antennas called \"cell sites.\" Although cell sites are usually mounted on a tower, they can also be found on light posts, flagpoles, church steeples, or the sides of buildings. Cell sites typically have several directional antennas that divide the covered area into sectors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Cell phones continuously scan their environment looking for the best signal, which generally comes from the closest cell site. Most modern devices, such as smartphones, tap into the wireless network several times a minute whenever their signal is on, even if the owner is not using one of the phone's features. Each time the phone connects to a cell site, it generates a time-stamped record known as cell-site location information (CSLI) ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Wireless carriers collect and store CSLI for their own business purposes, including finding weak spots in their network and applying \"roaming\" charges when another carrier routes data through their cell sites. In addition, wireless carriers often sell aggregated location records to data brokers, without individual identifying information of the sort at issue here. While carriers have long retained CSLI for the start and end of incoming calls, in recent years phone companies have also collected location information from the transmission of text messages and routine data connections. Accordingly, modern cell phones generate increasingly vast amounts of increasingly precise CSLI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b627 In\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , the State sought and obtained court orders compelling two wireless carriers to disclose CSLI records for Carpenter's cell phone covering a time period where Carpenter was suspected of committing multiple robberies.
