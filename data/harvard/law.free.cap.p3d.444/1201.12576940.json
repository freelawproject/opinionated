The trial court ruled that respondent Burbank Properties satisfied this condition and allowed the option to be exercised a mere eight days late. We disagree and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Burbank farmed approximately 164 acres it owned in Walla Walla County adjacent to orchards owned by appellant Borton &amp; Sons. Burbank, whose sole owner is Eric Rogers, purchased the property in 2012 after having leased the land for farming since 2000. Burbank used the land to grow early season potatoes. Potatoes deplete the soil of nutrients and are subject to diseases that require strict crop rotation. Potatoes are grown one year and then the land is given over to other crops for at least one to two years. Historically, Burbank had followed one year of potato planting with two years of grass or hay planting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 After years of depressed potato prices, Burbank faced financial difficulties that threatened its operation. A settlement with one of its lenders required Burbank to sell the potato farm land. However, Burbank's early season potato contracts were a significant component of its operations. Accordingly, it settled on a plan to sell the land at a reduced rate, farm the land on lease terms during the interim, and repurchase the property at a reasonable sum. In essence, the land was being used to secure a short-term loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 An appraisal valued the land at $1,875,000 and Burbank offered the land for sale for $300,000 less. The following day, desiring to purchase the land that bordered its apple orchards, Borton offered $1,550,000 for the land. The parties rapidly reached an agreement that included the following terms relevant to this appeal: Burbank could repurchase the land for $1,800,000 by December 31, 2018; Burbank had to exercise its repurchase option prior to December 31, 2017, by sending notice to Borton by certified or registered mail; Burbank would lease and farm the land during 2016, 2017, and 2018 at an annual rent of $78,775. Borton required the one year notice because it needed to order trees for its orchard one year in advance of its need for the trees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 In 2017, Burbank harvested a potato crop and thereafter planted Timothy hay that it expected to harvest in 2018 and 2019. At least twice during 2017, Burbank advised Borton representatives that it intended to exercise the repurchase option. On December 28, 2017, Eric Rogers prepared a written notice to Borton that Burbank would exercise its offer to repurchase the land. However, he did not mail the notice until January 4, 2018, and sent it by regular mail instead of by registered mail. Borton received the notice January 8, 2018. Believing the notice ineffectual, Borton wrote Burbank and demanded that it sign a notice that the option was\n   terminated. Burbank responded that it had exercised the option and was planning to close on the property by December 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Borton initiated a declaratory judgment action to determine the status of the purchase option. Burbank answered and counterclaimed for its own declaratory judgment, arguing both that it properly exercised its option and that it was entitled to an equitable grace period to do so. Discovery was rapidly conducted and both parties soon sought summary judgment. The competing motions then were argued to the trial court. Burbank contended that it would lose the value of the Timothy hay and the equity it would obtain by repurchasing the property. Borton argued that Burbank had failed to timely or properly give notice, was unable to perform the purchase, and had not made any improvements justifying equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b67 The trial court concluded that an equitable grace period was called for due to the potential loss of hay and equity. Report of Proceedings at 16. An order was entered granting summary judgment for Burbank and authorizing it to close on the property by December 31, 2018. Burbank was also awarded its attorney fees based on the lease agreement. Borton's motion for summary judgment was denied, as was its subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b68 Borton then timely appealed to this court. A panel heard oral argument of this case at Whitman College in Walla Walla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 The dispositive issue is whether the trial court erred in its respective summary judgment rulings by awarding equitable relief.

It cites first to the fact that the land was sold for $300,000 below its market value and that it could have realized that sum if it had sold the land for fair market value in 2016. Even assuming that it could have realized full value from a forced sale in 2016, Burbank has not argued, and has not demonstrated, that it could have sold the land for any greater sum and still obtained an option to repurchase.

While the potential $300,000 discount here is a significant figure, it was the cost of enticing a fellow farmer to become an investor.

The discounted sale price was not a forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b626 The remaining possibility is the value of the second year of the hay crop. No evidence was produced suggesting the potential value of this crop in 2019 despite the fact that Burbank had planted hay on the property in earlier years and should have had records from which to suggest a value. Whether there was any profit to be had from the hay is simply unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b627 Burbank did not establish that it suffered an inequitable forfeiture.

This court noted that, due to the discretionary nature of decisions issued in equity, granting equitable relief on summary judgment may be inappropriate in many cases. The\n   <em>\n    Cornish College\n   </em>\n   court, nonetheless, affirmed the summary judgment order while characterizing the evidence as strongly supporting an equitable grace period. Like the lead opinion, I question the suitability of granting summary judgment in an equity case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b644 Despite the anomalous manner in which the parties and the respective courts have handled this suit in equity, I would not remand for trial since both parties waived the right to demand a trial.

To the contrary, at page three of its opening summary judgment motion memorandum, Borton wrote: \"In the present case, there are no disputed material facts, and both parties simply disagree on the legal effect of Burbank's admitted late exercise of its option to purchase.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 59.

I disagree, however, that, based on reference to Professor Corbin and the presence of improvements in the Washington decisions, Washington law always demands valuable permanent improvements as a precondition to an equitable grace period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b657 I note that the five factors adopted in\n   <em>\n    Wharf Restaurant, Inc. v. Port of Seattle\n   </em>\n   do not include the optionee adding significant improvements to the property. Some of the Washington courts discuss the addition of improvements to the land or building when analyzing whether the optionee fulfills element two of the test, an inequitable forfeiture resulting if equity does not intervene. Nevertheless, inequity may result regardless of whether the optionee improves the real property. Also, if my predecessors on this court deemed an improvement as a necessary factor, the prior decisions could have and should have expressly placed the element in the list of factors. If earlier courts deemed valuable improvements to be a qualifier outside the five element factors, the courts would not have discussed improvements within the context of element two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b658 No Washington court has specifically held that substantial permanent improvements to the property is essential to a grace period. Instead Washington courts observe that all five circumstances need not be present in every case in which an equitable grace period is granted.\n   <em>\n    Cornish College of the Arts v. 1000 Virginia Ltd. Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007506\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/158/203/#p215\">\n    158 Wash. App. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20P.3d%201\">\n    242 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, element two, which sometimes includes substantial improvements, cannot be an indispensable circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b659 Applying a rigid rule that precludes a grace period under one particular circumstance is anathema to equity. To repeat, whether a grace period is warranted depends on the equities in each particular case.\n   <em>\n    Moeller v. Good Hope Farms, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4921935\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/35/777/#p783\">\n    35 Wash.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=215%20P.2d%20425\">\n    215 P.2d 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1950). Whether or not an equitable grace period is appropriate depends on the facts and circumstances of a case and is largely within the discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Pardee v. Jolly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5682165\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/163/558/#p572\">\n    163 Wash.2d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=182%20P.3d%20967\">\n    182 P.3d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). An inflexible approach would be inconsistent with the trial court's broad discretion to fashion equitable remedies.\n   <em>\n    Cornish College of the Arts v. 1000 Virginia Ltd. Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007506\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/158/203/#p215\">\n    158 Wash. App. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20P.3d%201\">\n    242 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court must review all relevant circumstances, not simply whether the optionee improved the real property. If one factor controlled, the law would hamstring the trial court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b660 No case announces any reason behind adopting a rule necessitating an improvement to the land for a grace period. Presumably, such a rule deems expenditures as the only acceptable form of prejudice to the optionee, and the rule does not wish the optionor to receive a windfall by gaining possession of the improvements. But the opposite side of the prejudice coin is lack of prejudice to the optionor. No decision explains why prejudice to the optionee is more important than lack of prejudice to the optionor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b661 A contractual deadline for the exercise of the option allows the optionor to plan and act based on a firm understanding of whether the optionee will buy the land. Burbank Properties' delay was so short that Borton\n   changed no plans. Instead, Borton wants the rigid application of a rule in order to gain a windfall. Since the common era, grace has superseded the application of rigid rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b662 Part performance, an equitable doctrine, includes three elements: (1) delivery and assumption of actual and exclusive possession, (2) payment or tender of consideration, and (3) the making of permanent, substantial and valuable improvements, referable to the contract.\n   <em>\n    Berg v. Ting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437068\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/544/#p556\">\n    125 Wash.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20564\">\n    886 P.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Despite improvements constituting an element, equity does not deem improvements to be a necessary element, if a party fulfills the other two elements.\n   <em>\n    Berg v. Ting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437068\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/544/#p556\">\n    125 Wash.2d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20564\">\n    886 P.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (involving consideration as the missing element). In the context of part performance, equity also wishes the trial court to weigh the particular facts and circumstances of each discrete case rather than apply a rigid, formulaic rules.\n   <em>\n    Berg v. Ting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437068\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/544/#p556\">\n    125 Wash.2d at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=886%20P.2d%20564\">\n    886 P.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b663 Now the facts. One might ponder if exercising the option was so important to Burbank Properties, why Eric Rogers failed to plant in advance numerous prompts and reminders to insure timely exercise of the option. An astute and cautious businessperson would forgo other tasks, mail several notices by certified mail a week or more in advance, and personally deliver the notice days before the option expired on December 31. But people make mistakes and equity sometimes aids the forgetful when the forgetfulness does not harm another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b664 I agree with Borton that Burbank Properties installed no substantial improvements. Still it planted a hay crop and would not benefit from the crop's presence in 2019 if it could not exercise the option. More importantly, Burbank Properties suffers other inequities as a result of forfeiture of the option. Burbank Properties loses equity of $75,000 in the land. It loses land it has farmed since 2000. At the same time, Borton reaps a profit of at least $250,000 if Burbank Properties buys the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b665 The other four factors weigh heavily in favor of Burbank Properties. Burbank Properties had a long term lease with Borton. Eric Rogers, or Burbank Properties, repeatedly told Borton that Burbank Properties intended to exercise the option. The failure to send notice by December 31 was inadvertent. Eric Rogers prepared the notice on December 28 and then left it on his desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b666 Burbank Properties exercised the option only four days late. It mailed the notice on January 4, rather than December 31. Borton took no steps between December 31 and January 4 as a result of an untimely exercise of the option. Borton did not even take any steps by January 8, the day of receipt of the notice. Borton suffered no iota, scintilla, mite, or tittle of prejudice from the late exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b667 I note that the option paragraph in the Borton-Burbank Properties lease does not indicate whether Burbank Properties needed to mail the notice by December 31 or whether Borton needed to receive the notice by December 31. Generally, notice by mail is considered complete on mailing, not on receipt. 58 AM. JUR. 2D\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 29 (2012). Let us assume that Burbank Properties mailed the notice of exercise on December 31, but, because of delays in the mail, Borton did not receive the notice until January 8. Borton would have been in no different position than that which actually occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b668 This appeal also holds a unique factor. Closing of the sale was not to occur until December 2018. A delayed closing bolsters the lack of any prejudice to Borton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b669 On appeal, Borton also argues that Burbank Properties provided no evidence that it could pay the purchase price at closing. Nevertheless, closing would occur one year later. Borton provided no evidence or analysis as to Burbank Properties being unable to purchase at that later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b670 I DISSENT:\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
