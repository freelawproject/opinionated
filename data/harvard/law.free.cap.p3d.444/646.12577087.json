David G. Essig stopped working for Michael Lai when Lai failed to pay him as required in their employment contract. Because the WRA is construed liberally to protect workers, the pay to which Essig was entitled under the contract constituted wages. We hold Essig is entitled to exemplary damages. Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 David Essig began working for the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund (CDF) in 2006. Essig managed the real estate investment portion of the fund to create\n   revolving loans and attract development and funds to the Rainier Valley. Through his work with the CDF, Essig met Michael Lai. Lai managed a real estate brokerage. Essig worked with Lai's firm on two successful loan transactions. From the first time they met, Lai periodically approached Essig about working for him. Initially, Lai spoke to Essig about becoming a real estate agent, but Essig was not interested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In the fall of 2014, Essig and Lai began to talk about Essig working for Lai in a development capacity. Lai wanted to know if Essig would be willing to partner with him on the developments, but Essig did not have the financial capacity to partner on large scale developments. Lai then asked Essig to consider working as a consultant or independent contractor, but Essig was not interested in working as an independent contractor. Essig stated that his interest was in working as a key employee to build the development organization. Lai asked Essig to draft a proposal for Essig to begin working for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On May 29, 2015, Essig entered into an employment agreement with Lai and a number of business entities under Lai's control. Lai agreed to employ Essig for a minimum of two years, with an annual salary of $114,000, health and dental benefits for Essig and his spouse, an expense account, office space, office support, and a $5,000 signing bonus. Lai gave Essig a $5,000 check, which Essig successfully deposited. Essig was to start work on July 13, 2015. He resigned from the Rainier Valley Community Development Fund in reliance on the employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Essig began performing his duties under the employment agreement on July 13, 2015. Over several weeks, he worked in the field reviewing projects, attending meetings and site visits with Lai, meeting with Lai, and engaging in phone, email, and text message communication with Lai regarding the business. At no point did Lai indicate that Essig was not employed by Lai.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 On July 30, Essig emailed Lai requesting medical insurance and benefits for Essig and his wife, as provided in the employment agreement. On August 18, Essig sent Lai a letter demanding payment of his wages and benefits to that date. Essig continued to work for Lai until August 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Throughout August, Lai suggested changes to the employment agreement, but did not deny the existence of the employment agreement or employment relationship. Lai continued to involve Essig in meetings, phone calls, and communications regarding the business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 On August 27, Essig notified Lai that he considered Lai in breach, he was stopping work on Lai's behalf, and would seek other employment. Lai sent the following text message on August 28: \"I can take care $120,000,000 per year next 12 months. Then become employees after that.\" Essig interpreted that message as an offer to work as an independent contractor. Essig engaged in efforts to find comparable replacement employment, searching in Seattle, Oklahoma City, and other locations nationwide. Essig filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The court found Lai in breach of contract, and awarded Essig lost wages of $228,000, exemplary damages of $228,000 under the WRA, $13,263 in medical benefits, attorney fees of $85,890, and $708.28 in costs. Lai appeals the award of exemplary damages and the court's finding that Essig reasonably mitigated his damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.

But\n   <em>\n    LaCoursiere\n   </em>\n   did not consider that question, and Lai's reading contradicts the \"by reason of employment\" language used to describe wages in\n   <em>\n    LaCoursiere\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 742,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=339%20P.3d%20963\">\n    339 P.3d 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the trial court does not explicitly find that Lai lacked a subjective belief in the dispute, the court found Lai failed to meet his burden of proof and lacked credibility. Lai understood that the contract obligated him to pay Essig wages. While Lai testified that he signed the contract under the influence of alcohol and under pressure from Essig, the trial court did not find him credible.

Essig testified that on August 28, 2015, Lai offered for him to work for Lai as an independent contractor for one year at a salary of $120,000. Lai argues that Essig was obligated to accept his offer and because Essig did not accept that offer, Essig failed to mitigate his damages by $120,000. The actual text of the message from Lai read \"I can take care $120,000,000 per year next 12 months. Then become employees after that.\" The trial court did not find Lai credible at trial, and the oral ruling suggests that the court did not find his offer to be credible, either. The trial court found Essig was not offered employment between August 27, 2015 and June 30, 2017. To the extent that Lai's message constituted an offer, we do not find it comparable to the position described in the contract, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 This court may affirm the judgment of the trial court on any theory established by the pleadings and supported by the proof.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, substantial evidence shows that the new position was not equivalent to the position Lai and Essig agreed to in the previous contract. While Lai argues that $120,000 per year is roughly equivalent to $114,000 per year plus benefits, he ignores the difference between status as an independent contractor and status as an employee. We can see how important that distinction was to Essig, because significant testimony shows that he bargained for employee status, even though Lai attempted multiple times to hire him as an independent contractor. It also ignores factors like providing Essig with office space, office support, expenses, vacation, or an opportunity for bonuses, all of which were present in the original agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Because substantial evidence shows the offer was not a similar position, Lai did not demonstrate that Essig failed to mitigate his damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Smith, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Leach, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Chapter 49.52 RCW\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Chapter 49.46 RCW\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
