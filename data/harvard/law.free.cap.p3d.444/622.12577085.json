Ecology's primary basis for establishing a minimum instream flow was to protect and preserve fish habitat within the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 The Center for Environmental Law &amp; Policy (Center),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Sierra Club,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and American Whitewater (collectively CELP) challenge the validity of this Rule, arguing that it exceeds Ecology's statutory authority and is arbitrary and capricious. Specifically, CELP relies on a provision of the Water Resources Act of 1971 (WRA) to argue that Ecology was required to establish a minimum instream flow that protects multiple enumerated instream values, not just fish. CELP also argues that the Rule violates the public trust doctrine and challenges Ecology's exclusion of certain documents containing instream flow recommendations from its rule-making file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 We hold that the Rule is not reasonably consistent with the WRA, and therefore, it exceeds Ecology's rule-making authority. We also hold that the Rule was adopted without regard to the attending facts and circumstances, and is therefore arbitrary and capricious. However, we reject CELP's challenges based on the public trust doctrine and adequacy of Ecology's rule-making file. Accordingly, we hold that the Rule is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A. THE SPOKANE RIVER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The Spokane River is a shared resource between Washington and Idaho. It begins in northwestern Idaho, flows west through the City of Spokane, and eventually connects to the Columbia River in eastern Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Spokane River is an important economic, recreational, and cultural attraction in the Spokane area. Spokane residents regularly use the river for boating, tubing, swimming, and fishing. The river also draws regional visitors when its flows are sufficient to support boating opportunities. A number of small businesses depend on the river to provide recreation-based activities, including river rafting, kayaking, tubing, and guided fishing trips. The river is a central feature of the region's identity, and Spokane residents view the river as an integral part of their community.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The legally recognized unit of measurement for flowing water is one cubic foot of water per second of time. RCW 90.03.020.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The Center is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect and promote stewardship of Washington's freshwater resources through public education, advocacy, policy reform, and public interest litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Sierra Club is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect, explore, and enjoy the planet.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    B. AVISTA CORPORATION'S DAMS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    \u00b66 Stream flow\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    on the Spokane River is controlled by a series of dams owned and operated by Avista Corporation. Avista operates its dams under a license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 2009. The license requires Avista to maintain specific minimum stream flows in the Spokane River throughout the year. Between June 16 and September 30, Avista must operate its Upper Falls and Monroe Street dams to provide minimum stream flows of 850 cfs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b67 As part of the relicensing process, Avista conducted several studies to evaluate the potential influence of its operations on the natural resources in its hydroelectric project area. Some of these studies examined the general habitat characteristics and spawning activity of trout and mountain whitefish in\n    the Spokane River. Two studies evaluated the relationship between effective fish spawning and stream flows in various reaches of the river. Avista also conducted a whitewater paddling instream flow assessment study, which assessed whitewater boating opportunities on the Spokane River at different stream flows. Nearly all whitewater survey participants preferred flows higher than 1,353 cfs to support boating on the lower reach of the river (downstream of the Upper Falls and Monroe Street dams).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    C. ECOLOGY RULEMAKING\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    1. The Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer and Municipal Water Supply\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    \u00b68 The Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer underlies the Spokane River. It is the sole source of municipal water supply for the area. The aquifer and the river are highly interactive. Any withdrawal of water from the aquifer has a direct and immediate impact on river flows. Increased groundwater use from the aquifer has led to a decrease in river flows. In the early 1990s, Ecology determined that the river's low flows in late summer were continuing to decline. This prompted Ecology to stop issuing new groundwater rights allowing withdrawals from in the aquifer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    2. Instream Flow Rulemaking\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    \u00b69 The state Water Code, chapter 90.03 RCW, authorizes Ecology to set minimum stream flows for a river or stream through a collaborative process with watershed planning groups.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    RCW 90.03.247(2) ;\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    RCW 90.82.080(1)(a)(ii). Ecology began working with watershed planning groups in 1998 to develop instream flow protection for the Spokane River. The watershed planning groups were unable to achieve consensus regarding the minimum instream flows that should be adopted for the Spokane River. Because the members of the watershed planning unit were unable to reach consensus, Ecology initiated rulemaking under the Washington Administrative Procedures Act (APA) to establish minimum instream flows. RCW 90.82.080(1)(a)(ii), (c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b610 Ecology commenced formal rulemaking in January 2014. Ecology's draft Rule proposed a minimum instream flow of 850 cfs for the downriver reach of the Spokane River between June 16 and September 30, as measured at the Spokane gage,\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    which is located downstream of the Monroe Street dam. Ecology based this instream flow on the recommendation of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's (WDFW) instream flow biologist Hal Beecher. Beecher initially recommended a minimum instream flow between 900 and 1,050 cfs from July 1 to September 30, as measured at the Spokane gage. Several years later, in May 2012, Beecher recommended minimum instream flow of 850 cfs between June 16 and September 30, as measured at the Spokane gage. Beecher's 2012 instream flow recommendation was based on the above discussed trout and whitefish spawning studies, which were conducted as part of Avista's dam relicensing process in 2009. Beecher later qualified this recommendation and emphasized that the proposed summer flows were \"not perceived by [him] as enhancement, rather as a floor.\" Administrative Record (AR) at 14233.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b611 During the rulemaking comment period, Ecology received hundreds of public comments critical of the 850 cfs minimum instream flow in its proposed Rule. Many of\n    these comments asked Ecology to conduct additional studies on how the proposed 850 cfs minimum instream flow at the lower reach of the river would impact recreation, aesthetics, navigation, water quality, temperature, and broader ecosystem values. Other commenters asked Ecology to assess climate change and interstate implications of the proposed Rule. Small recreational business owners commented that they would be unable to provide recreational river activities, such as float and canoe trips, at the proposed 850 cfs summer flows.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b612 The Center and the Sierra Club sent Ecology a combined comment letter criticizing the proposed Rule, along with 43 electronic documents covering a range of topics, including the return of anadromous fish to the Columbia River, scenic and aesthetic flows in the Spokane River, climate change, fish studies, interstate water issues, and recreational use of the river. The Center and the Sierra Club also provided Ecology with a photographic inventory of 37 key observational points located on the downriver reach of the Spokane River, obtained at five different summer flows. One of these photos showed researchers floating the river in a hard shell kayak in July 2015 at about 770 cfs. Another photo showed people floating down the river in tubes at 770 cfs. And another photo showed a boat navigating the river at 770 cfs. However, the Center and the Sierra Club cautioned that this 770 cfs flow would be unsuitable for larger commercial rafts. American Whitewater, a nonprofit river conservation organization, also sent Ecology a letter in which it claimed, based on surveys it conducted, that acceptable flows for kayaking, canoeing, and rafting the Spokane River were between 1,500 cfs and 15,000 cfs, with 5,000 cfs as an optimal flow.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b613 Ecology claimed that it considered all of these comments and materials it received during the rulemaking process. Specifically, Ecology stated that it \"considered the recreational, aesthetic, and navigational values at multiple stages throughout the process of establishing these instream flows for the river.\" AR at 3283. However, Ecology rejected the recreational flow criteria of the river in establishing instream flows. Ecology \"chose[ ] not to establish instream flow values based on those recreational needs expressed during the FERC process or any other process including this comment period.\" AR at 2985.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b614 Instead, Ecology \"chose to rely on studies of fish habitat to establish instream flow levels.\" AR at 3283. Ecology made clear throughout rulemaking that its proposed minimum instream flows were \"based upon fish habitat studies,\" and were \"needed for fish survival, including both whitefish and redband trout.\" AR at 79, 66. Ecology summarily concluded that instream flows that protect fish habitat would also protect the recreational and aesthetic values of the river.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b615 Ecology adopted the Rule in January 2015, and it became effective in February 2015. The Rule establishes minimum instream flows of 850 cfs on the lower reach of the Spokane River, as measured at the Spokane gage downstream of the Monroe Street dam.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    WAC 173-557-050.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b616 A minimum instream flow established by administrative rule, including Ecology's 2015 Rule, is an appropriation of water with a priority date of the rule's effective date. RCW 90.03.345. Water appropriated prior to adoption of the Rule are senior water rights and are not affected by the Rule. However, appropriations after the Rule is established are junior water rights and are interruptible if flow on the Spokane River decreases below the minimum instream flows specified in the Rule. Ecology plans to use the minimum instream flows established by the Rule to manage future water withdrawals from the Spokane River and the aquifer that underlies it. The Rule also establishes Washington's legal interests in the water of the\n    river and aquifer in the event of interstate conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    D. PETITION TO AMEND THE RULE\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b617 In February 2016, CELP submitted a joint petition asking Ecology to amend the Rule and increase the 850 cfs summer minimum instream flows as measured at the Spokane gage.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Ecology denied the petition in April.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b618 In May, CELP brought suit against Ecology, challenging the validity of the instream flow Rule under the APACELP claimed that the portion of the Rule setting minimum summer instream flows at 850 cfs exceeded Ecology's statutory authority and was arbitrary and capricious. CELP also argued that Ecology had failed to fulfill its responsibilities under the Public Trust Doctrine in adopting the Rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b619 CELP also filed a motion to supplement the record before the superior court with three documents related to the Avista dam relicensing process and watershed resource planning processes for the region. The specific documents CELP requested be added to the rule-making file were: (1) Ecology's comments to FERC during Avista's dam relicensing, (2) an April 23, 2007, memo in which Beecher noted that habitat rearing at the Spokane gage peaks at 1040 cfs, and (3) a June 30, 2004, document in which Beecher recommended a minimum discharge of 700 cfs at the Post Falls dam. Ecology opposed the motion and submitted declarations in opposition. Three of the agency's rule writers submitted declarations, stating that the documents were not in their custody during the rulemaking process and that they did not consider them when making decisions to set summer minimum instream flows at 850 cfs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b620 The superior court denied CELP's motion to supplement the record with these three documents. The superior court later denied CELP's petition challenging the validity of the Rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b621 CELP petitioned for direct review at the Washington Supreme Court. After briefing was complete, the Supreme Court transferred the case to this court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    A. VALIDITY OF THE RULE\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \u00b622 CELP argues that the 850 cfs summer minimum instream flow established in Ecology's Rule is invalid because it exceeds Ecology's statutory authority and is arbitrary and capricious. We agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    1.

The language CELP relies upon is one of several enumerated general fundamentals meant to guide water resource use and management. RCW 90.54.020. The WRA's stated purpose is to develop a comprehensive planning process that ensures better water management practices and alleviates conflict among competing water users. RCW 90.54.010(1)(b). It is intended to \"ensure that available water supplies are managed to best meet both instream and offstream needs.\" RCW 90.54.010(1)(b). Consistent with the WRA's overall goals of safeguarding public health and economic well-being, and preserving the state's natural resources and aesthetic values, the WRA authorizes Ecology to develop a \"comprehensive state water resources program\" that \"provide[s] a process for making decisions on future water resource allocation and use.\" RCW 90.54.040(1). The WRA's \"[g]eneral declaration of fundamentals\" are meant to guide Ecology in the exercise of its water management duties. RCW 90.54.020. They do not impose a list of mandatory requirements for every agency rule that Ecology adopts in the exercise of those duties. The use of the word \"shall\" directs Ecology what values it must consider.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bassett v. Dep't of Ecology\n    </em>\n    , 8 Wash. App.2d 284,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575063\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/563/\">\n     438 P.3d 563\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2019) (holding that the legislature's use of the word \"shall\" in RCW 90.54.020 did not impose a formal test on Ecology to secure maximum net benefits before it allocated water).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    \u00b641 However, Ecology's argument is equally unpersuasive. Ecology argues that the WRA's general declaration of fundamentals has no application when Ecology exercises its rulemaking authority under the MWFLA. But the MWFLA does not operate in a vacuum. As discussed above, Ecology's exclusive authority to establish minimum instream flows stems from several statutory provisions within the Water Code. In enacting the WRA, the legislature recognized that the proper utilization of the state's water resources was \"necessary to the promotion of public health and the economic well-being of the state and the preservation of its natural resources and aesthetic values.\" RCW 90.54.010(1)(a). The WRA prioritizes comprehensive water resource planning as a way to resolve conflict among competing water users and interests. RCW 90.54.010(1)(b). It balances the water needs of the state's growing population with the objective of preserving instream resources so that future generations can continue to enjoy them. RCW 90.54.010(1)(b).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b642 Under the WRA, Ecology may set aside water for beneficial use \"whenever it appears necessary to the director in carrying out the [WRA's] policy.\" RCW 90.54.050. One way for Ecology to do so is by establishing minimum instream flows and levels, which are treated as any other appropriative water right. In the exercise of that authority, Ecology must meaningfully consider the instream values enumerated in RCW 90.54.020(3)(a), and attempt to preserve them to the fullest extent possible. This gives effect to the legislative intent of the WRA to ensure that water within the state is protected and \"fully utilized for the greatest benefit to the people of the state of Washington.\" RCW 90.54.010(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b643 Ecology's interpretation of its rulemaking authority under the MWFLA is inconsistent with the emphasis the legislature has placed on fully utilizing water for its maximum benefit and ensuring that water supplies are managed to best meet both instream\n    and offstream needs. When read together with the WRA, the MWFLA does not grant Ecology the authority to establish a minimum instream flow for the purpose of narrowly protecting only one instream value that Ecology deems \"best.\" Br. of Resp't at 18. Instead, it directs Ecology to meaningfully consider a range of instream values and to consider how an instream flow that protects one value might impact the others.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    \u00b644 This is not to say that a rule is invalid simply\n    <em>\n     because\n    </em>\n    it fails to preserve and protect each enumerated instream value. The legislature recognized the near impossibility of appropriating water in a way that satisfies every one of its beneficial uses. RCW 90.54.010. Water is an increasingly scarce resource and putting it to one beneficial use necessarily limits its availability for a competing use. Ecology's role in water resource management is to balance the competing beneficial uses of water and ensure that water is fully utilized to the greatest benefit possible. If the minimum instream flow necessary to protect one value is detrimental to another, the legislature has made the choice clear-the one that protects fish prevails.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RCW 90.22.060 ; RCW 90.54.005(2) ; RCW 90.82.070. However, the high value that the legislature placed on maintaining instream flows supportive of fish does not mean that Ecology can simply disregard other instream values and narrowly focus only on fish.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    \u00b645 When viewed under this framework and policy, the Rule challenged here is not reasonably consistent with the statutes it implements. Ecology made clear throughout rulemaking that its proposed minimum instream flows were only \"based upon fish habitat studies\" and focused only on \"fish survival, including both whitefish and redband trout.\" AR at 79, 66.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    \u00b646 Ecology responded to public concern over the proposed minimum instream flow by asserting its position that it may establish a minimum instream flow for the purpose of protecting only one instream value. In its concise explanatory statement, Ecology explained that it had discretion to choose one value for which to set a minimum instream flow. As explained above, this interpretation of Ecology's rule making authority is inconsistent with the framework of the WRA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    \u00b647 Ecology argues that it nonetheless operated within framework of the controlling statutes because it \"fully considered\" other instream values during multiple stages of its rule making process. Br. of Resp't at 19. However, the record shows that Ecology's consideration involved merely collecting public comments and studies that showed 850 cfs was not sufficient to preserve the recreational and aesthetic values of the river, and then summarily \"reject[ing]\" these higher instream values. AR at 3283. Such cursory treatment of these other values does not comport with the emphasis the legislature placed on effectively managing water resources to ensure that water is fully utilized to the greatest benefit of the people.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    \u00b648 The record does not support Ecology's repeated claim that a minimum instream flow protective of fish would necessarily preserve other instream values. And contrary to Ecology's argument, three photographs showing a boat has not grounded at flows below 850 cfs does not \"plainly show[ ]\" that recreational and navigational uses are \"plentiful\" at these levels. Br. of Resp't at 24.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    \u00b649 Ecology's reliance on Avista's federal license requirements is equally misplaced. Ecology argues that the Rule protects all enumerated instream values because it is \"identical\" to Avista's federally required flows and \"Avista's federal license requires Avista to release flows for recreation.\" Br. of Resp't at 25. This argument oversimplifies the nature and scope of Avista's license.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    \u00b650 Avista's federal license governs the operation and maintenance of five hydroelectric project developments located along the Spokane River. The project area spans several counties in Washington and Idaho, and the license dictates flows on the Spokane River from Coeur d'Alene Lake in Idaho through the city and suburbs of Spokane. The FERC license only requires Avista to operate certain hydroelectric developments on the river in a way that enhances recreation at distinct reaches of the river. Notably, the license does not require Avista to operate its Monroe Street and Upper Falls dams (the hydroelectric dams located just upstream of the river\n    reach at issue here) in a way that supports recreation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    \u00b651 Instead, the FERC license requires Avista to operate the Monroe Street and Upper Falls dams to provide minimum summer flows of 850 cfs from June 16 to September 30 in order to \"enhance aquatic habitat for rainbow trout and mountain whitefish in the Spokane River.\" AR at 8074. And it requires Avista to analyze the spawning habitat in response to flow alterations in the Spokane River below the Monroe Street and Upper Falls dams. Thus, Ecology's argument that its summer instream flows preserve recreation simply because they are identical to the summer flows required by Avista's license is unavailing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    \u00b652 Ecology's attempt to bootstrap consideration of other instream values through its review of Avista's studies is also unpersuasive. Cursory review of certain studies Avista conducted as part of its relicensing process does not constitute meaningful review of the instream values enumerated in RCW 90.54.020(3)(a). And this argument ignores Ecology's own statement that it \"chose[ ] not to establish instream flow values based on those recreational needs expressed during the FERC process.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    AR at 2985.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    \u00b653 The record shows that Ecology based the 850 cfs flow on fish habitat studies because it believed it had discretion to establish a minimum instream flow for the purpose of protecting only one instream use. This narrow focus on preserving one instream value is not reasonably consistent with the WRA's purpose of ensuring \"that waters of the state are protected and fully utilized for the greatest benefit to the people of the state of Washington.\" RCW 90.54.010(2). Because the Rule was not written within the framework and policy of the applicable statutes, it exceeds Ecology's authority and is invalid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    3.

Nothing in the record supports this conclusion. And the evidence before Ecology showed that the proposed flow would not be adequate to support rafting, kayaking, and other recreational uses of the river.

But RCW 34.05.370(2)(f) only requires Ecology to include in its rulemaking file the data, factual information, studies, or reports it relied upon in adopting the Rule.
