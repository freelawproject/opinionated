To the extent that petitioner argues that this petition presents an opportunity to clarify whether punitive damages may be awarded for tort claims sounding in negligence, that issue will be better presented for this court's consideration after development of the factual record in the district court. Insofar as petitioner seeks a writ of prohibition, petitioner provides no cogent argument regarding that relief, and we need not consider it.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Edwards v.
