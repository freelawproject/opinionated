Eighth Judicial Dist. Court</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409997\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/120/222/#p224\">120 Nev. 222</extracted-citation>, 224, 228, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409997\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/120/222/#p224\">88 P.3d 840</extracted-citation>, 841, 844 (2004) (stating that an appeal is generally an adequate legal remedy precluding writ relief and recognizing that petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that writ relief is warranted); <em>Smith v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11790348\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/1343/#p1344\">113 Nev. 1343</extracted-citation>, 1344-45, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11790348\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/113/1343/#p1344\">950 P.2d 280</extracted-citation>, 281 (1997) (observing that this court generally will not consider writ petitions challenging orders denying motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); <em>Smith v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558342\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/674/#p677\">107 Nev. 674</extracted-citation>, 677, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8558342\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/674/#p677\">818 P.2d. 849</extracted-citation>, 851 (1991) (observing that issuance of the writ is subject to this court's discretion). To the extent that petitioner argues that this petition presents an opportunity to clarify whether punitive damages may be awarded for tort claims sounding in negligence, that issue will be better presented for this court's consideration after development of the factual record in the district court. Insofar as petitioner seeks a writ of prohibition, petitioner provides no cogent argument regarding that relief, and we need not consider it. <em>See</em> <em>Edwards v. Emperor's Garden Rest.,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8203539\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/317/\">122 Nev. 317</extracted-citation>, 330 n.38, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8203539\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/122/317/\">130 P.3d 1280</extracted-citation>, 1288 n.38 (2006).
