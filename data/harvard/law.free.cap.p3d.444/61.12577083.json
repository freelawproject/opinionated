Mother, MonteReye Ianelli (n/k/a MonteReye Josephson), opposed a change in custody, but counterclaimed to modify Father's visitation schedule. After a one-day trial, the district court found that Mother's move constituted a material change in circumstances, and that it was in BDC's best interests to grant Father primary physical custody. Mother appealed and we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] We reframe Mother's issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1.

Did the district court abuse its discretion when it determined that transferring custody to Father was in BDC's best interests?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b63] Father raises a threshold jurisdictional issue asserting that Mother failed to timely file her notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Mother and Father were never married, but had a child together, BDC, who was born in February 2013. Shortly after BDC's birth, Father filed a petition to establish paternity, custody, visitation, and support. The parties reached an agreement a few months later and the district court entered a stipulated order on August 13, 2013. The district court ordered joint legal custody and named Mother as BDC's primary physical custodian. The district court also ordered a graduated visitation schedule for Father, which began with supervised visits. Although both parties resided in Buffalo, Wyoming, the order included an alternative visitation schedule in the event either party relocated more than 250 miles from Buffalo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Following entry of the custody order, BDC lived in Buffalo with Mother and his older half-sister, K. Mother owned her home and continued to work as a waitress for a local restaurant, as she had for approximately 16 years. Her mother also lived in Buffalo and provided childcare while Mother worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] Father initially worked as a fencer and lived just outside of Buffalo. He later married. His wife has a daughter from another relationship, R, who is six months older than BDC. In 2014, Father moved his family into their own home on his mother's ranch near Clearmont, Wyoming-roughly thirty minutes from Buffalo. Father switched employment a year later and worked in water management until his brother-in-law offered him a job with a cattle operation in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] The parties largely adhered to the visitation schedule set forth in the custody order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father regularly exercised his visitation and the parties worked together to accommodate occasional schedule changes. During Father's visitation, BDC went to work with Father while Father did ranch\n   work. In the summer months, BDC participated in rodeos and in the Johnson County Fair with his cousins. He rode horses, fished, hunted, and spent time with his large extended family during his visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] In August 2016, Mother decided to move to Montana in early 2017 to be with her fianc\u00e9. She informed Father of her relocation plans and the parties discussed adjusting Father's visitation schedule. Father did not approve of the move because BDC had lots of friends and family in Buffalo. A few weeks later, Mother filed a notice of her intent to relocate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father retained an attorney in November and, on January 26, 2017, he filed a petition to modify custody and a motion for an ex-parte temporary restraining order. The district court did not enter a restraining order and Mother moved to Montana on February 1, 2017, as planned. Mother answered the petition and counterclaimed to modify visitation and child support. The district court set trial for August.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] After Mother relocated to Montana, she obtained employment as a waitress at a local resort; she worked Thursday through Sunday evenings from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. While Mother worked, her husband or their eighteen-year-old niece provided childcare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother also enrolled BDC in preschool on Mondays and Wednesdays from 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b610] The parties attempted to adhere to the alternative visitation schedule, but both parents were concerned about the amount of time BDC spent traveling between the households.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties tried to negotiate a new schedule. Father proposed that BDC stay for \"four days instead of just like the weekend, or maybe every other week[,]\" but Mother declined due to BDC's preschool schedule. Mother filed a motion to modify visitation in March requesting the court set a new visitation schedule pending trial. The district court held a hearing on the motion in May and issued a temporary order granting Father summer visitation from May 26, 2017, until three days before school commenced, subject to Mother's visitation on June 8-11, July 1-4, and August 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b611] By the time Father's summer visitation commenced, Mother was pregnant and developed complications with her pregnancy. Due to her condition and her husband's busy work schedule, Mother went to Buffalo on June 1, 2017, to stay with her mother for the summer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother resumed her former waitressing job, but planned to return to the resort in Montana after her maternity leave expired. Her mother also planned to move to Montana to be with Mother and her family. While in Buffalo, Mother exercised her four days a month summer visitation and watched BDC participate in his weekly rodeo activities. She requested three additional visits. Father denied her requests, except he allowed Mother to take BDC to see a movie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b612] The district court held a one-day trial on August 2, 2017. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law shortly thereafter. Several months later, on January 8, 2018, the district court entered its\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order\n   </em>\n   . The district court granted Father primary physical custody of BDC commencing February 1, 2018. The court granted Mother visitation the last full week of every month, but did not provide any additional visitation for holidays or extended time in the summer until BDC enters kindergarten. Father testified that if granted custody, he would not enroll BDC in kindergarten until he is six years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b613] Mother filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion for New Trial or, in the Alternative, Motion to Alter or Amend Judgement\n   </em>\n   (Rule 59 motion) on February 5, 2018 and requested a hearing. The\n   district court did not schedule a hearing or enter an order on Mother's post-judgment motion. Mother filed a notice of appeal on June 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b614] We first determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

The primary custodian will, likely, have responsibility for the child a greater amount of time than the other parent. However, during their respective periods of custody, each parent will be primarily responsible for the child. This is different from an initial custody determination where the court may determine that one parent has taken on a larger share of the responsibility for caring for the child throughout his or her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b644] The primary caregiver discussion in each of the cases cited in the majority opinion was in the context of an initial custody determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruegman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567210\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/157/\">\n    417 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   159 ;\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Given this distinction, many of the strong statements from those cases recited in Paragraph 32 of the majority opinion are not particularly relevant to modification of child custody. In fact, in custody modification actions, the primary caregiver determination mimics our concern with undermining the child's stability, which is always taken into account in custody modifications: \"When one parent has primary custody, a change of custody raises a significant concern about relationship stability and security for the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Clifford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WY%2059\">\n    2018 WY 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567663\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/819/#p822\">\n    418 P.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (Wyo. 2018) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gurney v.

Thus, in the context of child custody modification, it seems particularly important to focus not so much on who the primary caregiver is, but on the relationship each parent has with the child in accordance with \u00a7 20-2-201(a)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b645] Finally, I believe we should provide greater direction to the district court upon remand. Our remand should direct the district court to make specific findings with respect to sibling relationships and separation and to the quality of relationship/primary caregiver status/child stability, based on Mother's Rule 52 demand. Then, the district court should re-evaluate the best interests of BDC giving consideration to those additional findings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    BDC was now three years old and Father's graduated visitation consisted of every other weekend, alternating every two weeks in the summer months, and holiday visitation. While Father was also entitled to visitation every Wednesday evening, he instead kept BDC a few hours longer during his weekend visits.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Mother filed a second notice of her intent to move on September 9, 2016, which changed her new address from Missoula to Plains.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Mother married her fianc\u00e9 on March 1, 2017.

Father testified he received all of his visitation except one weekend when Mother attended a family funeral.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Mother did not notify Father of her plan to stay in Buffalo for the summer until just prior to her scheduled visit with BDC on June 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Arnott\n    </em>\n    , we explained that new issues created by a parent's relocation may preclude application of res judicata, including when there is a change in the ability of the parties to maintain the existing parenting agreement and a change in the ability of the children to maintain a close relationship with the remaining parent,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Arnott v. Arnott\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977346\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/440/\">\n     2012 WY 167\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 39,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977346\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/440/\">\n     293 P.3d 440\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 457-58 (Wyo. 2012). The evidence demonstrates that the geographic distance between the parties' residences after Mother relocated rendered the current parenting agreement unworkable and her move necessarily affected BDC's relationship with his Father due to the increase in time between visits. These factors support the district court's determination that Mother's relocation to Montana created a material change in circumstances and precluded application of res judicata with respect to the prior custody and visitation order.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Cook v.
