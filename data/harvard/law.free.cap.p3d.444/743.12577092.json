As discussed below, because medpay coverage is not health insurance for purposes of the lien statute, those payments are subject to the health care provider lien. Accordingly, the grant of defendant Farmers Insurance Company of Arizona's motion to dismiss is vacated and this matter is remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Farmers issued an automobile insurance policy to Bethanie Elliott that included optional medpay coverage. Plaintiff Dignity Health, doing business as Mercy Gilbert Medical Center, provided Elliott medical services after she was injured in a car accident. The usual and customary charges for those services exceeded $ 160,000. Dignity perfected and recorded a health care provider lien for more than $ 140,000 to secure payment for those services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7 33-931 (2019).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding that lien, Farmers directly paid Elliott $ 99,000 in medpay benefits under her automobile insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Dignity timely filed this lien enforcement action, claiming Farmers' payment to Elliott violated the lien. Farmers successfully moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing its payment was not subject to the lien. Dignity timely appealed from the resulting final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(c). This court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and - 2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Under A.R.S. \u00a7 33-931, a health care provider may obtain a lien to secure payment of customary charges for services provided to an injured person, with certain express exceptions to the scope of such a lien:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A lien pursuant to this section extends to all claims of liability or indemnity,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     except health insurance and underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01\n    </em>\n    ,\n   </strong>\n   for damages accruing to the person to whom the services are rendered ... on account of the injuries that gave rise to the claims and that required the services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 33-931(A) (emphasis added). Thus, if Farmers' payment of medpay benefits to Elliott was a health insurance benefit, it was exempt from Dignity's lien. But if the payment was not a health insurance benefit, it violated the lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Determining whether medpay is health insurance is complicated by the record and arguments on appeal. The insurance policy containing the medpay coverage is not included in the record. Moreover, the parties cite no statutory definition of \"health insurance\" or \"medpay coverage,\" and this court has found no such definitions applicable to Section 33-931(A).

To the extent any ambiguity exists, changes to Section 33-931 over the years refute Farmers' argument and compel a reading of Section 33-931 excepting health insurance without reference to Section 20-259.01.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrow Co. v.

A.R.S. \u00a7 33-931(A) (1988). In 1988, the Legislature amended Section 33-931 to except health insurance from the coverage of such a lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1988 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 298, \u00a7 2 (2d Reg. Sess.).

Laws, ch. 154, \u00a7 1 (2d Reg. Sess.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Contrary to Farmers' argument, there is no suggestion that the 2004 amendment to Section 33-931, which first added the reference to Section 20-259.01, was designed to modify the health insurance exemption added in 1988. Indeed, Legislative materials show the 2004 amendment was made solely to exempt \"underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01,\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to alter the health insurance exemption in Section 33-931.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   House Bill Summary, H.B. 2681 (Apr. 20, 2004) (stating 2004 amendment prohibits certain \"health care institutions from recovering an injured person's uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage when enforcing a lien to recover hospital charges for medical care\"); Senate Fact Sheet, H.B. 2681 (Mar. 30, 2004) (similar). This history of Section 33-931 undercuts Farmers' argument that the statute should\n   be read to exempt from a lien \"[h]ealth insurance motorist coverage as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Apart from this history, the term \"health insurance\" is not defined in Section 20-259.01. Thus, it would be illogical to read Section 33-931 to mean \"health insurance as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01.\" Section 20-259.01 is titled \"Motor vehicle liability policy; uninsured optional; underinsured optional; subrogation; medical payments liens; definitions.\" The section contains three definitions: \"[u]ninsured motor vehicles;\" \"[u]ninsured motorist coverage\" and \"[u]nderinsured motorist coverage.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 20-259.01(D), (E) &amp; (G). The fact that \"health insurance\" is not used, much less defined, in Section 20-259.01 negates any suggestion that Section 33-931 should be read such that \"motorist coverage as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01\" modifies the phrase \"health insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callen v.

It did neither. Based on this history of Section 33-931, and the text the Legislature chose to use (and not use) in that statute and in Section 20-259.01, \"motorist coverage as defined in \u00a7 20-259.01,\" as used in Section 33-931, does not modify \"health insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Dignity argues Farmers failed to raise this argument on appeal, which it claims should be treated as a confession of error. Farmers did not raise this argument on appeal, arguing instead that medpay is \"health insurance motorist coverage,\" meaning it is waived\n   <em>\n    . See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Loan v. Van Loan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592014\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/272/#p274\">\n    116 Ariz. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1592014\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/116/272/#p274\">\n    569 P.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (1977). Even absent waiver, Farmers' argument would fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 An argument that \"health insurance\" (a phrase not used in Section 20-259.01 ) is the same as medpay coverage would run counter to the directive that different statutory terms or phrases are not to be treated as synonymous unless context permits no other alternative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.F.

Although not defined in Sections 33-931 or 20-259.01, the A.R.S. Insurance Title (Title 20) defines \"health insurance\" in the context of a \"[p]remium tax credit for health insurance certificates submitted by qualified persons,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 20-224.05(H)(3), to mean a \"a licensed health care plan or arrangement that pays for or furnishes medical or health care services and that is issued by a health care insurer.\" This statute directs that \"[h]ealth insurance does not include limited benefit coverage,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"720079\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/139/31/#p34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , defined as \"an insurance policy that is designed, advertised and marketed to supplement major medical insurance and that includes accident only\" and other types of coverage, A.R.S. \u00a7 20-1137(B). This definition would exclude from health insurance the medpay coverage at issue here. And although this definition is limited to the premium tax credit context, Farmers has not shown that the Legislature defined \"health insurance\" to mean two irreconcilably different things depending upon whether the phrase was used in Section 33-931 or Section 20-224.05.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyatt v.

A qualified insurer providing medpay coverage benefits (\"medical payments coverage of a motor vehicle\n   insurance policy\") may obtain an insurer's lien for any medpay coverage payment exceeding $ 5,000 \"that is paid to or on behalf of that insured.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 20-259.01(J). Farmers did not obtain such a lien and this statute is not applicable to Dignity's lien. This insurer's lien statute, however, is evidence that the Legislature treats health insurance and medpay coverage as two different things. A similar distinction comes from the one other reference to \"[m]edical payments coverage\" in Title 20 as being one of seven types of \"basic coverage\" within motor vehicle insurance policies subject to renewal limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 20-1631(K)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Apart from these statutory differences, in a different context, this court has recognized the difference between health insurance and medpay coverage.

For these reasons, Farmers has not shown that its medpay coverage payment was included in the health insurance exception to Dignity's health care provider lien under Section 33-931. Accordingly, it was error to dismiss Dignity's complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Dignity requests an award of attorneys' fees incurred both on appeal and in the superior court pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 33-934. In the exercise of the court's discretion, Dignity is awarded an amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred on appeal, as well as its taxable costs on appeal, contingent upon its compliance with Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 21. This court leaves to the superior court's discretion on remand any award of attorneys' fees resulting from proceedings before that court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 The dismissal of Dignity's complaint is vacated, and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, this court assumes the truth of all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint.\n    <em>\n     Fid.
