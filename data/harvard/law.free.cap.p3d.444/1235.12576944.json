For decades, scholars have debated whether an income tax is a property tax, an excise tax, or its own separate category of tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a series of decisions dating back to 1933, the Washington Supreme Court has unequivocally held income is property, a tax on income is a tax on property, taxes on property must be uniformly levied, and a graduated income tax is not uniform. Therefore, the Washington Constitution bars any graduated income tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b62 Here, the superior court ruled Seattle did not have statutory authority to enact its graduated income tax. Seattle and the Economic Opportunity Institute (EOI) initially sought review in our Supreme Court, arguing in part that the Supreme Court should reconsider the precise nature of an income tax. The Supreme Court transferred the appeal to this court. We are constrained by stare decisis to follow our Supreme Court's existing decisions that an income tax is a property tax. We have no authority to overrule, revise, or abrogate a decision by our Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b63 We conclude Seattle has the statutory authority to adopt a property tax on income, but our state constitution's uniformity requirement bars Seattle's graduated income tax. Therefore, the Seattle income tax ordinance is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b64 Seattle enacted an ordinance in July of 2017 imposing an income tax on high-income\n   residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seattle \"imposed a tax on the total income of every resident taxpayer in the amount of their total income multiplied by\" 2.25 percent for all income above a certain threshold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ordinance defines \"total income\" as \"the amount reported as income before any adjustments, deductions, or credits on a resident taxpayer's United States individual income tax return for the tax year, listed as 'total income' on line 22 of Internal Revenue Service Form 1040.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b65 The tax creates two classes of taxpayers: individuals filing singly and married taxpayers filing jointly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tax subdivides each class based on income. Individual taxpayers earning more than $250,000 and married taxpayers earning more than $500,000 must pay 2.25 percent of all income over those thresholds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To illustrate, a family earning $600,000 would pay $2,250 in taxes, which is 2.25 percent of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b66 The Dana Levine group of plaintiffs, the Suzie Burke group, the Scott Shock group, and individual Michael Kunath (tax opponents)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed four separate lawsuits to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted EOI's motion to intervene as a defendant and consolidated the lawsuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b67 The superior court granted summary judgment for the tax opponents, concluding no statute gave Seattle the authority to levy an income tax and, even if Seattle otherwise had the authority, RCW 36.65.030 prohibited it from levying a net income tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also denied EOI's constitutional challenges to RCW 36.65.030. Having resolved the case on statutory grounds, the court declined to rule on Shock's remaining equal protection challenges to the ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kunath then moved to sanction Seattle and EOI under Civil Rule 11 and for an award of attorney fees under the common fund doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court denied both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b68 Seattle and EOI appeal the court's grant of summary judgment, and Kunath cross appeals the court's denial of his motions for sanctions and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b69 After 1930, article VII, section 1 of our state constitution has required that \"[a]ll taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax and shall be levied and collected for public purposes only. The word 'property' as used herein shall mean and include everything, whether tangible or intangible, subject to ownership.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b610 Our Supreme Court's first opportunity to interpret this language came in the 1933 case of\n   <em>\n    Culliton v. Chase\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   That year, voters passed a statewide initiative levying a graduated tax on net income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers challenged\n   the initiative, arguing the graduated income tax was unconstitutional because it taxed property and therefore violated the recently-enacted uniformity clause in article VII, section 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In declaring the tax unconstitutional, the\n   <em>\n    Culliton\n   </em>\n   court first distinguished income taxes from excise taxes, reasoning that excise taxes are levied on an activity-such as the sale, consumption, or manufacture of goods-or upon a privilege or license granted by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also distinguished income taxes from estate taxes, reasoning that an estate tax \"is not really a tax at all\" because \"[i]t is an impost laid but one time\" on the state-granted right of heirs \"to take\" from an estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b611 Turning to the \"comprehensive definition of 'property' \" in the constitution, the court classified income as intangible property, stating, \"Income is either property under [article VII, section 1], or no one owns it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The overwhelming weight of judicial authority is that 'income' is property and a tax upon income is a tax upon property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because any income tax in Washington had to be uniform or be unconstitutional,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   the graduated income tax was unconstitutional under article VII, section 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b612 Three years later, the court again considered a net income tax in\n   <em>\n    Jensen v. Henneford\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State levied a graduated income tax on \" 'every resident of [Washington] for the privilege of receiving income therein while enjoying protections of its laws.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on that language, the State argued it levied an excise tax not subject to the constitution's uniformity clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"[t]he character of a tax is determined by its incidents, not by its name.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Culliton\n   </em>\n   established that the broad definition of property in article VII, section 1 encompassed income, the\n   <em>\n    Jensen\n   </em>\n   court held the purported excise tax was an income tax subject to the uniformity clause in article VII, section 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the taxing scheme taxed income below $4,000 at three percent and income above $4,000 at four percent, it was an unconstitutional nonuniform tax on property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b613 In 1951,\n   <em>\n    Power, Inc. v. Huntley\n   </em>\n   evaluated a statewide \"corporation excise tax\" that levied a four percent tax on a corporation's net income \"for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchise in this state or for the privilege of doing business in this state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tax did not apply to sole proprietorships or partnerships.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The central question before the court was whether the tax fell on income rather than being a true excise. If a tax on income, then it violated the uniformity clause of article VII, section 1 by only affecting certain forms of corporations and not other companies in competition with them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Power\n   </em>\n   court set aside the language of the tax, analyzed its incidents, and concluded it was \"a mere property tax masquerading as an excise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the taxing scheme, a Washington corporation with zero net income would not pay any income tax, while a foreign corporation doing business in Washington would pay taxes on activities unconnected to the privilege of conducting business in Washington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the scheme hewed closely to federal corporate income tax law, illustrating its true nature as an income tax. The\n   court concluded the tax was a nonuniform property tax and therefore unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b614 We consider the statutory and constitutional issues in this case within the clear bounds of these precedents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It is no longer subject to question ... that income is property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxes are to be evaluated by their incidents rather than by their legislative designation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   And a net income tax, whether levied on a corporation or a natural person, must be uniform to comply with article VII, section 1 of our constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    II. Justiciability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b615 Before addressing the tax's statutory and constitutional validity, we must address Shock's threshold contention that these issues are nonjusticiable political questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shock contends, \"The City's request that this Court reverse nearly a century of case law holding that income is personal property, and therefore subject to the Constitution's uniformity tax requirement, is not appropriate for judicial determination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is well settled that Washington courts have the power to hear constitutional challenges to tax laws,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is why we are guided by \"nearly a century of case law\" on these issues. The issues raised in this case are justiciable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b616 We review summary judgment orders and questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation de novo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   We interpret statutes and ordinances to discern and implement the legislative body's intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   We give effect to a statute's plain meaning as a statement of legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   A statute's plain meaning can be discerned from the language of the statute itself, other provisions of the same act, and related statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Terms in a statute are read with their common and ordinary meaning, absent ambiguity or a statutory definition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   A dictionary can supply an undefined term's ordinary meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" 'Only when the plain, unambiguous meaning cannot be derived through such an inquiry will it be appropriate [for a reviewing court] to resort to aids to construction.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Statutory Taxing Authority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b617 Washington municipalities have no inherent power to levy taxes because\n   our constitution vests that power with the legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the constitution authorizes legislative delegations of taxing power to municipalities. Under article VII, section 9, the legislature can delegate power to municipalities \"to make local improvements by special assessment.\" Article XI, section 12 both prohibits the legislature from levying local taxes for \"municipal purposes\" and empowers the legislature to enact \"general laws\" that \"vest in [municipalities] the power to assess and collect taxes\" for municipal purposes. These constitutional provisions are not self-executing, however, so the legislature must grant taxing authority to the municipality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Municipal taxes enacted without delegated authority are invalid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b618 RCW 35.22.280(2) explicitly grants first-class cities authority to levy a property tax on real or personal property for municipal needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Culliton\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, an income tax is a property tax.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Seattle's income tax was authorized by RCW 35.22.280(2). At oral argument, tax opponents asserted RCW 35.22.280(2) did not authorize Seattle's tax because income is a form of intangible property rather than real or personal property. But personal property can be intangible,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   and income is intangible property under our constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Seattle possessed valid statutory authority to levy a property tax on income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b619 Seattle also contends RCW 35.22.570 grants first-class cities authority to levy an income tax by according it powers enumerated in Title 35A RCW, the optional municipal\n   code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seattle is a first-class city with a governing charter and has not opted into the optional municipal code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, RCW 35.22.570 grants first class charter cities \"all the powers which are conferred upon incorporated cities and towns by this title [Title 35 RCW] or other laws of the state, and all such powers as are usually exercised by municipal corporations of like character and degree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b620 The plain language of RCW 35.22.570 grants first-class charter cities \"all of the powers\" conferred upon all other \"incorporated cities\" by both Title 35 RCW and Title 35A RCW.

But the enacting bill for RCW 36.65.030 violated the constitutional prohibition in article II, section 19 on legislation with more than a single subject. Consequently, RCW 36.65.030 is unconstitutional and no statutory prohibition limits Seattle's authority to levy a property tax on income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b649 Under the doctrine of stare decisis, we are bound by our Supreme Court's precedential decisions that a tax on income is a property tax and that a graduated income tax violates the uniformity provision of article VII, section 1. Because Seattle enacted a graduated tax on income, it is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b650 Based upon this alternative rationale, we affirm summary judgment in favor of the tax opponents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Hazelrigg-Hernandez, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Robert C.

RCW 84.36.070(1). The premise of the tax opponents' contention appears to be that any tax on income is a prohibited ad valorem tax on intangible personal property. But this premise is inconsistent with the statute's text and legislative history. First, RCW 84.36.070 has never listed \"income\" as intangible property. RCW 84.36.070(2) ; Laws of 1931, ch. 96, \u00a7 1. Second, the legislature enacted RCW 84.36.070 in 1931 following the passage of amendment 14 to article VII, section 1, which allowed taxation of intangible personal property.\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Atwood v.

And even after the\n    <em>\n     Culliton\n    </em>\n    decision clearly stated income is intangible property, the legislature enacted the net income tax at issue in\n    <em>\n     Jensen\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jensen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"481698\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash/185/209/\">\n     185 Wash. at 211, 215-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20P.2d%20607\">\n     53 P.2d 607\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citing Laws of 1935, ch. 178). It would be incongruous to conclude that at the same time the legislature enacted a tax on income, it also intended RCW 84.36.070 to impede a tax on income.
