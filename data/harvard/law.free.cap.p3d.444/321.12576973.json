Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai'i (State) charged Phan with Abuse of Family or Household Member, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 709-906 (Supp. 2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for an incident that occurred on August 11, 2016. After a jury trial, Phan was found guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Phan argues the family court erred by: (1) failing to obtain a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of Phan's constitutional right not to testify; (2) admitting into evidence State's Exhibit 8 because it constituted double hearsay; (3) admitting into evidence State's Exhibit 9 because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect; (4) instructing the jury as to jury instructions numbers 13 and 27 because they were prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading; (5) sentencing Phan to the maximum one-year jail term; and (6) setting Phan's bail pending appeal of his misdemeanor conviction at $50,000. In addition, Phan contends that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that his due process right to a fair trial was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Phan's points of error as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Given the record in this case, the timing involved, and that the defense expressly did not object to the timing of the pre-trial advisement, Phan's argument regarding the timeliness of the court's pre-trial advisement is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Phan next contends that the family court's pre-trial\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   advisement and ultimate\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy were not true colloquys but were instead mere recitals of a litany of rights without an ascertainment that Phan actually understood each of his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding the pre-trial advisement, the supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   established that trial courts, prior to the start of trial, shall\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    inform\n   </em>\n   the defendant of his or her personal right to testify or not to testify and (2)\n   <em>\n    alert\n   </em>\n   the defendant that, if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision not to testify is the defendant's own decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263909\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263909\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/292/\">\n    at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263909\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/292/\">\n    12 P.3d at 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, in the pre-trial advisement, the family court fully informed Phan of his rights to and not to testify and alerted Phan that, if he had not testified by the end of the trial, the court would question him to ensure that it was Phan's own decision not to testify. The pre-trial advisement thus met the requirements established in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   . We therefore conclude that the family court properly conducted the pre-trial advisement under\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regarding the ultimate\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy, in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , the Hawai'i Supreme Court also held that an ultimate\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy is not required in cases where a defendant has indicated that he or she does intend to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263909\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/292/\">\n    94 Hawai'i at 296-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263909\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/292/\">\n    12 P.3d at 1237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, the defense indicated that Phan would be testifying and Phan did actually testify. Therefore the family court was not required to conduct the ultimate\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy at all and any alleged error associated with the court's colloquy is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The family court did not err in its pre-trial advisement or the ultimate\n   <em>\n    Tachibana\n   </em>\n   colloquy. There is nothing in the record-to indicate that Phan's decision to testify was anything other than voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Admission of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Phan challenges the family court's admission of the Abuse of Family or Household Members Victim Voluntary Statement Form (Victim Statement Form) completed by the complaining witness, Ngoc Vu (Vu), during her statement to police (State's Exhibit 8). On appeal, Phan argues that the Victim Statement Form constituted inadmissible double hearsay because Vu's employer, Minh Nguyen (Nguyen), assisted Vu by translating between English and Vietnamese. However, Phan's objection at trial was to the admission of the Victim Statement Form to refresh Vu's memory during her testimony; Phan's objection was not regarding double hearsay. Therefore, we review the admission of the Victim Statement Form for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 52(b) (1977) (\"Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\"); Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 103(d) (2016) (\"Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The State offered the Victim Statement Form into evidence under HRE Rule 802.1 (1) (B) (2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which \"provides for substantive use of most prior inconsistent witness statements\" as an exception to the hearsay rule. Commentary to HRE Rule 613 (2016);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Canady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261973\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/469/#p480\">\n    80 Hawai'i 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261973\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/469/#p480\">\n    911 P.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 (App. 1996) (stating that HRE Rule 802.1 adopted the federal exception to common law allowing \"prior inconsistent statements to be used as substantive proof of the matters asserted in the statement\" if the statement's trustworthiness is assured).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Eastman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259521\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/81/131/#p137\">\n    81 Hawai'i 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259521\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/81/131/#p137\">\n    913 P.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (1996), the Hawai'i Supreme Court outlined the foundational requirements for evidence admitted pursuant to HRE Rule 802.1(1)(B) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) a witness must testify about the subject matter of his or her prior statements so that the witness is subject to cross-examination concerning the subject matter of those prior statements; (2) the witness's prior statements must be inconsistent with his or her testimony; (3) the prior inconsistent statements must be reduced to writing and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness; (4) the prior inconsistent statements must be offered in compliance with HRE Rule 613(b) (1993), which requires that, on direct or cross-examination, the circumstances of the prior inconsistent statements have been brought to the attention of the witness, and the witness has been asked whether he or she made the prior inconsistent statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Vu's statements in the Victim Statement Form met all the requirements for admissibility as substantive evidence of a prior inconsistent statement:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) At trial, the State directly examined Vu as a witness and elicited testimony from her regarding the night of the incident, the events that led to her injuries on that night, as well as the statements she made in the Victim Statement Form alleging that Phan injured her. On cross-examination, Vu testified that her injuries were caused by her own actions in pulling away from Phan. Thus, the State made Vu subject to cross-examination by defense counsel regarding the subject matter of Vu's prior statements in the Victim Statement Form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261973\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/469/#p480\">\n    80 Hawai'i at 480-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261973\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/469/#p480\">\n    911 P.2d at 115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that HRE Rule 802.1(1) requires, \"as a guarantee of the trustworthiness of a prior inconsistent statement, ... that the witness be capable of testifying substantively about the event, allowing the trier of fact to meaningfully compare the prior version of the event with the version recounted at trial\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) During Vu's direct examination by the State, Vu testified that Phan did not punch her on the night of the incident. On the Victim Statement Form completed on the night of the incident, however, Vu stated that she was punched. Thus, Vu's prior statements in the Victim Statement Form were inconsistent with her testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) The record indicates that Vu's prior statements were reduced to writing in the Victim Statement Form, which she signed. Vu testified at trial that the responses on the form were in her own handwriting and that the initials and the signature were her own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (4) The circumstances of Vu's prior inconsistent statements were brought to Vu's attention when the State asked her whether she remembered filling out the Victim Statement Form with the police on the night of the incident and whether she made the statements in the Victim Statement Form. Vu answered affirmatively. Thus, the prior inconsistent statements in the Victim Statement Form were offered in compliance with HRE Rule 613(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nguyen's assistance in translating the Victim Statement Form for Vu did not create a layer of hearsay rendering the Victim Statement Form inadmissible as evidence. Although it is clear from the record that Nguyen translated the contents of the form for Vu from English to Vietnamese,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nguyen's translation of the form to Vu was not an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted and therefore does not constitute hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It appears from the record before us that the statements in the Victim Statement Form were made by Vu herself. Both Nguyen and Vu herself testified that the form was completed in Vu's handwriting. Vu also testified that in completing the form, \"I just saw the words [on the form], so I copied them.\" To clarify Vu's response, the State asked Vu whether Nguyen had translated the form for her, and Vu responded affirmatively. The State then confirmed whether Vu understood the form in light of Nguyen's translation, and Vu again responded affirmatively. Therefore, it appears that Vu's statements on the Victim Statement Form were hers and hers alone, based on her understanding of the form. It appears Vu's statements on the Victim Statement Form were not translated by Nguyen and therefore do not constitute double hearsay. Thus, we conclude that the family court did not plainly err in admitting the Victim Statement Form into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Phan also challenges the family court's admission into evidence of the August 12, 2016 Ex-Parte Petition for an HRS 586 Temporary Restraining Order (TRO Petition) filed by Vu (State's Exhibit 9). The family court admitted the TRO Petition into evidence without any objection from the defense. We therefore review the issue for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRPP Rule 52 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Under HRE Rule 404(b) (2016), \"bad act\" evidence is admissible when it is relevant for some purpose other than to show action in conformity therewith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Once relevance is established, the court must then determine whether the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. HRE Rule 403 (2016). On appeal, Phan contends that the probative value of the prior acts of domestic abuse alleged by Vu in the TRO Petition were substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

On the night of the incident, Vu reported to the police that Phan \"physically hurt, harmed or injured\" her, causing injury to her forehead, nose, chin, hand, and knees. At trial, however, Vu testified that her injuries were a result of her accidental fall, that Phan did not punch her, and that she \"exaggerated a little bit just to scare [Phan] a little\" because she was \"partly afraid, partly angry[.]\" The prior incidents of domestic violence between Phan and Vu were used by the State to show the jury the context of Vu's relationship with Phan, which was relevant because the relationship was offered as the basis for Vu's recantation at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We next determine whether the probative value of the prior bad acts evidence was outweighed by the prejudicial effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   When weighing probative value against prejudicial effect in the context of an HRE Rule 403 analysis, a court must consider a variety of factors, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the interval of time that has elapsed between the crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree to which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Behrendt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312393\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/124/90/#p106\">\n    124 Hawai'i 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312393\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/124/90/#p106\">\n    237 P.3d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172 (2010) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The incidents of Phan's prior violence and Vu's behavior were admissible as probative evidence to show the jury Vu's relationship with Phan, which was offered to explain Vu's recantation of the abuse that was the subject of the charged offense against Phan at trial. Further, the State emphasized the fact that the February 14, 2016 and July 24, 2016 incidents were unreported. Thus, the need for the evidence warrants the admission of the prior bad acts evidence and, in light of Vu's inconsistent testimony, the admission of the TRO Petition itself. As to the prejudicial impact of the evidence in the TRO Petition, the family court instructed the jury in Jury Instruction 24:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   You have heard evidence that the Defendant at another time, may have engaged in other acts. You must not use this evidence to conclude that the Defendant is a person of bad character and therefore must have committed the offenses [sic] charged in this case. The evidence is being allowed to provide you with the context of the relationship between the complaining witness and the defendant and to give you a possible explanation for the complaining witness's differing testimony in court and for no other purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This instruction alleviated any risk of prejudice potentially caused by the admission of the TRO Petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect and the family court did not plainly err in admitting the TRO Petition into evidence and in further allowing the State to cross-examine Vu and Phan as to the prior incidents of violence that were the subject of the TRO Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Phan next argues that Jury Instructions 13 and 27 were prejudicially insufficient. No objection was made to either of these jury instructions below.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. Erroneous instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground for reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record as a whole that the error was not prejudicial. [However, e]rror is not to be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract.
