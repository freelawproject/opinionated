Officers searched the vehicle Matthew Harris occupied after discovering him and the driver sleeping inside. The officers knew there was an opioid crisis in the community, but had no other basis to conclude an emergency existed as to these two individuals. Generalized suspicions based on community-wide concerns are insufficient to justify an invasion of privacy. Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In the middle of the day in December 2016, a civilian flagged down Kent Police Department Officers Ferguson and Birkhofer. The civilian said there were two people passed out in a car and asked the officers to check on them. The officers found the driver and the defendant, Matthew Harris, either asleep or unconscious. The officers offered conflicting testimony regarding how long they observed the occupants of the vehicle before making contact. Both officers testified that they looked through the window and observed that the occupants were not awake. The occupants were slumped over in their seats and, based on their training and experience, the officers suspected the occupants had used heroin. The officers initiated contact because of concerns that the occupants had potentially overdosed on heroin. The officers did not observe anything else inside the vehicle that suggested drug use or any other crime. Before contacting the occupants of the vehicle, the officers did not make any attempt to rouse them. The officers opened the doors to the vehicle and woke up the occupants. After they opened the doors, the officers observed drug paraphernalia consistent with the use of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The officers arrested Harris for possession of drug paraphernalia. Based on evidence found during and subsequent to the arrest, Harris was later charged with and convicted of possession of stolen property, identity theft, and making a false statement to a public servant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.

Upon further consideration, we hold that it is unnecessary to apply the test twice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The two formulations apply essentially the same test. The first two factors of the\n   <em>\n    Kinzy\n   </em>\n   test, the officer's subjective belief of the need for assistance, and that a reasonable personal would also believe there was a need for assistance, coupled with the fourth and fifth factors added by\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   , requiring an immediate threat to a specific person or property, are roughly equivalent to the first factor of the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   test, that the officer has a reasonable belief that assistance is immediately required. The second factor in the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   test, that the search is not primarily motivated by an intent to arrest or seek evidence, matches the sixth factor added by\n   <em>\n    Schultz\n   </em>\n   .

The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Hos\n   </em>\n   was sitting on a couch, unconscious, during hours when people are usually awake. Similarly, Harris was sitting in a car, unconscious or asleep, during hours when people are usually awake. While those are not the usual locations or times for people to sleep, neither are those locations and times outlandish. Those facts, without more, do not give rise to a reasonable belief that the person needs immediate assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 The officer in\n   <em>\n    Hos\n   </em>\n   had one crucial fact that the officers here lacked: the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Hos\n   </em>\n   was unresponsive. A person that fails to wake up or respond to attempts to rouse them would cause a reasonable, objective person to believe that intervention was necessary. We recognize the need for officers to act quickly when there is a reasonable basis to believe that they have encountered an emergency. But that need must be balanced against the privacy interests each of us holds. It is not unreasonable to expect law enforcement to take at least some minimum step to identify a specific basis to support their belief that the person whose privacy interests are at issue needs emergency assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Here, the officers had a reasonable, objective basis to contact Harris as a routine health and safety check, and inquire if he needed assistance. But because the officers could not distinguish whether Harris was unconscious or asleep, and no other facts suggested an emergency situation, the officers lacked a reasonable, objective basis to justify an intrusion into the vehicle. We note that the officers here took enough time to observe the inside of the vehicle such that they were able to later testify as to the position of the occupants and describe items located inside the vehicle. Knocking on the window during their visual sweep of the scene would not have meaningfully slowed down the officers' response if this had actually been an emergency situation. Without verifying that Harris and the other passenger were unresponsive, general community concerns\n   and otherwise neutral facts were insufficient to justify a warrantless intrusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 The State argues that the officers had additional facts supporting a reasonable, objective belief that this was an emergency, but we do not find them compelling. While a concerned citizen asked the officers to check on the vehicle, they offered no additional information that suggested the situation was an emergency. The general existence of an opioid epidemic in the community is likewise unavailing. While we appreciate the dangers of opioids, the existence of drugs in the greater community could not help the officers determine whether this particular situation was an emergency. Furthermore, the existence of drugs is not new and not likely to change. A general knowledge that drugs are available in the community cannot justify invading the privacy of sleeping individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 The State also argues that the location of the car, in a busy parking lot during the middle of the day, was another indication that Harris or his companion were in need of assistance. We note that in each of the last three annual point in time counts of King County's homeless population, more than 2,000 individuals were living in their cars. APPLIED SURVEY RESEARCH, COUNT US IN 8, (2019). While a busy parking lot and the middle of the day may seem like a strange place to sleep, for individuals facing homelessness, sleeping during the day in a public place may provide a modicum of safety that might not otherwise be available. Just as probably, citizens may be found sleeping in their car during daylight hours because they are napping over a lunch break, or are in the midst of long distance travel and are catching up on rest after driving through the night. The mere fact of a person sleeping in a car during the day, without any accompanying observations of a possible medical issue or drug use, would not lead a reasonable person to believe that an emergency existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Some additional details consistent with suspected drug overdose could satisfy the emergency aid exception, such as observations about unusual breathing patterns, skin appearance (e.g. extreme pallor, lesions or wounds consistent with intravenous drug abuse ), evidence of vomiting or other physical irregularities. But merely being asleep or unconscious while slumped down in a parked car at midday, even in a community with an opioid epidemic, is inadequate to justify an officer opening a car door without first briefly attempting to speak to or otherwise rouse the suspected overdose victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Because the limited facts available to law enforcement did not support a reasonable objective belief that Harris or his companion required immediate assistance at the time the officers invaded his privacy, we reverse Harris's conviction, grant his motion to suppress evidence gathered from the unlawful search of the vehicle, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Verellen, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    These three factors appear to have been implicit in\n    <em>\n     Kinzy\n    </em>\n    to some degree.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183462\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/141/373/#p384\">\n     141 Wash.2d at 385\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20P.3d%20668\">\n     5 P.3d 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Community caretaking functions are totally divorced from investigative functions) and 386 (the emergency aid function involves circumstances of greater urgency).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
