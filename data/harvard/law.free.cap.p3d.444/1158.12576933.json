He argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney (Trial Counsel) failed to investigate and use his victim's prior fraud conviction to attack her character for truthfulness, failed to object to allegedly improper expert testimony, failed to object to inadmissible evidence of his abusive nature, and failed to object to inappropriate comments made by the State during closing argument. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant and the victim (Victim) were in a turbulent on-again, off-again relationship spanning over 14 years. In 2014, the couple spent Memorial Day weekend camping in Brigham Canyon, where they both ingested \"a lot of drugs.\" By early morning of the following Tuesday-May 27, 2014-Victim wanted to return to their home in Tremonton. Victim testified that she had not used any drugs that morning, but she believed that Defendant had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On their way home, the couple decided to visit Defendant's father at a construction site in Brigham City. On the way there, Defendant and Victim started arguing and yelling at each other. Victim testified that such arguments were common when Defendant\n   used drugs. Upon arrival at the construction site, Defendant tried to pull Victim out of the Jeep, but Victim put the vehicle into drive and drove off, heading to Tremonton without Defendant. Victim had almost made it home when her Jeep ran out of gas on the interstate. She texted Defendant, and he brought her some gas-the record does not reveal how. They soon recommenced their arguing. Instead of continuing to Tremonton, they headed back to the construction site in Brigham City for Defendant to retrieve some tools from his father. At the site, Defendant placed the tools between the Jeep's two front seats. The couple had not ceased arguing, so Defendant's father-who at trial described the two as \"out of control\" and probably \"on something\"-requested that they leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Defendant and Victim next pulled into a gas station in Brigham City. Defendant grabbed the keys out of the ignition and began walking around. Victim, wanting to go home, began yelling at Defendant and demanding to know where the keys were. Defendant replied that he did not have them. The gas station clerk soon approached them and requested that they move their vehicle because it was blocking traffic at the pumps. Frustrated, Victim continued to demand that Defendant return the keys to the Jeep, and Defendant continued to insist that he did not have them. They were both \"screaming and yelling\" at each other. After approximately 45 minutes, Defendant, who apparently no longer had the keys or at least pretended he did not, was able to start the Jeep by \"hot-wiring\" it with a screwdriver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant and Victim then left the gas station and headed toward Tremonton, with Defendant behind the wheel. During the drive home, Victim \"tr[ied] to be quiet and stay calm\" because she knew Defendant was irritated with her. Defendant kept giving Victim \"dirty looks,\" mumbled that he hated her, said that it was her fault that he was like this, and called her a whore. Victim testified that Defendant had previously told her that men should not hit women but that \"whores deserve to be beat and die.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Defendant eventually pulled the Jeep over in Deweyville. Victim immediately became fearful and attempted to escape the vehicle, but Defendant grabbed her by the hair and pulled her back inside. He told her that if she knew \"what's good for [her], [she] better stay in the ... f'ing vehicle.\" He then put Victim in a headlock, bent her over toward him, and started \"pounding on\" her with his fist and a pellet gun. Defendant hit her in the ribs, on the back, and on the back of her head. Victim managed to break away briefly, but Defendant again grabbed her and slammed her face down onto the tools that he had stored between the seats. One of the tools cut her, leaving a gash across her forehead. While once more holding Victim in a headlock, Defendant pointed the screwdriver he had used to hot-wire the Jeep at her head; again called her a \"whore\"; and told her \"[she] deserved to die, [she'd] be better off dead,\" and \"[her] kids would be better off if [she] was dead.\" Fearing for her life, Victim managed to escape from Defendant's grasp and ran toward the road. Defendant did not pursue her, but he shouted for her to return to the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Victim was able to convince the driver of a passing truck, who had stopped to see if she needed help, to give her a ride to Tremonton. Once home, one of her neighbors drove her to the emergency room. Although Victim did not sustain a concussion or broken bones, the assault left her covered in cuts and bruises. The hospital notified the authorities, and Deputy Archuletta and Deputy Palmer soon arrived. They discussed the assault with Victim and took photographs of her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Defendant was arrested later that evening. While being interrogated by Deputy Palmer, Defendant admitted to being with Victim at the construction site and gas station in Brigham City earlier that day. During the course of the interrogation, however, Defendant gave two differing answers as to where he had last seen Victim. At one point, he told Deputy Palmer that he had last seen her in Deweyville-the location of the assault. But at another time, he stated that he last saw her at the gas station in Brigham City. When Deputy Palmer asked about Victim's injuries, Defendant first stated that\n   \"she gets bruises at work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But after the deputy recounted Victim's account to Defendant, he responded, \"If she said so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The State charged Defendant with one count of aggravated assault, a third-degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), (2)(a) (LexisNexis 2014), and one count of unlawful detention, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-304(1), (4). Defendant pled not guilty to both charges. He was tried in February 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    The Prosecution Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 In its case-in-chief, the State relied on Victim's testimony, photographs of Victim's injuries, the two deputies' testimonies, and a video recording of Defendant's interrogation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Victim's injuries were difficult to discern in the photographs, and the State acknowledged that the injuries were \"hard to see.\" For that reason, the State asked Deputy Archuletta, who took the photographs, to describe each photograph to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 In laying the foundation for Deputy Archuletta's testimony, the State asked generally about her training and experience. After she replied that she was P.O.S.T. certified,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the State inquired whether she had \"receive[d] training in injuries involving domestic violence.\" Deputy Archuletta responded that she had. The State later asked how many domestic violence calls she had responded to during her 17 years of service. Deputy Archuletta responded that she \"would not want to even guess\" but that \"[she'd] had numerous\" calls of that nature. The State inquired whether some of the calls involved injuries, to which she replied affirmatively. It then asked whether she knew \"the difference between fresh injuries and old injuries,\" and Deputy Archuletta responded that she did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 After laying this foundation, the State requested that Deputy Archuletta describe each photograph to the jury and asked whether the injuries depicted in the photographs were \"fresh.\" For example, the following exchange addressed exhibit 2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Deputy Archuletta]: Okay. Right here, she had like psoriasis right here and you can see off to the inner portion of the knee fresh markings, red markings. This is a -has, I guess, an abrasion has taken a portion of the psoriasis off. You can see through, up through here like a-more still on the kneecap, the line of like a, I don't know, some type of a dragging, but there's-and this isn't clear here, but there's a line through here and then red up into here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [The prosecutor]: But this spot right here and these spots right here that you pointed to outside of the psoriasis, would you consider those fresh?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Deputy Archuletta]: ... [Y]es, this is fresh ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For the other exhibits, Deputy Archuletta indicated that the photographs showed \"fresh\" injuries, including redness on the back of Victim's head, right arm and wrist, left rib, chin, jaw, nose, right cheekbone, right eye, neck, shoulders, and clavicle. She also identified some scratches, an abrasion on Victim's kneecap, \"road rash\" and the \"stippling of ... blood vessels\" on Victim's right neck and shoulder area, and a fresh injury behind her left ear. Deputy Archuletta also identified some \"old bruising\" on Victim's left leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Trial Counsel did not object to the content of Deputy Archuletta's testimony as a whole, but he did object twice during the course of her testimony. Trial Counsel first objected when the State asked Deputy Archuletta to estimate a time frame for one of Victim's injuries. He next objected to the\n   speculative nature of Deputy Archuletta's opinion concerning the cause of one particular mark. The district court sustained both objections. Trial Counsel did not cross-examine Deputy Archuletta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 The State next called Deputy Palmer to testify. Because Deputy Palmer was the officer primarily responsible for questioning Victim at the hospital about her injuries, his testimony mainly concerned that conversation and his later interrogation of Defendant. But the State did ask Deputy Palmer whether he was able to observe Victim's injuries at the hospital and whether they appeared to be \"fresh.\" He responded in the affirmative to both questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The Defense Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Defendant denied that the alleged assault ever took place. Rather, he claimed that Victim sustained her injuries during the camping trip from which they had returned that same day. Specifically, shifting from his initial bruising-at-work theory, he alleged that Victim sustained her injuries the night before while gathering firewood in dense underbrush. To corroborate this theory, Defendant called a friend who had accompanied them on the camping trip. The friend testified that she and Victim had gone searching for firewood on the last night of the trip. She described the terrain as \"pretty rough,\" full of rocks, trees, and fallen branches. As a result, the friend testified that she herself \"hit [her] head a couple of times on the trees\" and \"had scratches all over [her]\" arms and legs. Trial Counsel showed the photographs of Victim's injuries to the friend and asked whether they were consistent with the kinds of injuries the friend had sustained while gathering firewood. The friend replied, \"Yeah. Definitely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 In addition to providing an alternative theory concerning the source of Victim's injuries, Trial Counsel attempted to impeach Victim's account in a number of ways. On cross-examination, Trial Counsel noted that although Victim had testified that Defendant had threatened her with a screwdriver, she made no mention of this in her written statement provided to the police on the day of the assault. To contradict Victim's claim that the tools were located between the two front seats of the Jeep at the time of the assault, Trial Counsel also called another of Defendant's friends as a witness. She testified that on the day of the assault, Defendant had walked to her house in Brigham City from the construction site and had asked whether he could leave his tools there. After he stayed at her house for approximately 45 minutes, she stated that she drove him to the gas station. Trial Counsel also called Defendant's mother as a witness. She testified that Victim was a \"chronical liar\" and that Victim admitted to her that, contrary to her denial at trial, she had also used drugs on the day of the assault. Finally, Trial Counsel called Victim as an adverse witness and successfully elicited testimony that she often threatened self-harm to manipulate Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Despite Trial Counsel's efforts, the jury convicted Defendant on both charges. He was sentenced to an indeterminate term not to exceed five years on the aggravated assault charge and to a concurrent six-month term on the unlawful detention charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Rule 23B Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant timely appealed his conviction. In conjunction with the opening brief, Defendant's prior appellate counsel filed a motion for remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure requesting an evidentiary hearing regarding four of Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance, which motion we granted. The four claims subject to remand included a claim for Trial Counsel's failure to investigate and present Victim's prior fraud conviction at trial. Following the hearing, the district court held that all four of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims \"fail[ed] one or both elements of the [\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ] test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Shortly after the rule 23B hearing, current appellate counsel was substituted for prior appellate counsel. With the stipulation of the State and our approval, current appellate counsel filed a replacement brief in which he pursued only one of the four claims of ineffective assistance that were the subject of the rule 23B remand, namely the fraud matter. As such, the claim of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate and use\n   Victim's prior fraud conviction is the only claim dealt with in the rule 23B hearing that is currently before us. Therefore, we address that matter and three other claims of ineffective assistance newly pursued on appeal, and so we have only limited occasion to consider the rule 23B hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b620 Defendant alleges that Trial Counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he (1) failed to investigate and use Victim's prior fraud conviction to impeach her testimony at trial, (2) failed to object to Deputy Archuletta's improper expert testimony, (3) allowed the State to introduce inadmissible character evidence of Defendant's abusive behavior, and (4) failed to object to inappropriate comments made by the State during closing argument. Defendant's first claim of ineffective assistance was subject to the rule 23B remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. App. P. 23B. \"In ruling on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim following a Rule 23B hearing, we defer to the district court's findings of fact, but review its legal conclusions for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prior Fraud Conviction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 Defendant first alleges that Trial Counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not investigating the facts underlying Victim's prior fraud conviction and not using that conviction to attack her character for truthfulness at trial. Victim had claimed benefits on behalf of children who no longer resided with her, and she was consequently convicted of workers' compensation fraud, a third-degree felony, in October 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that Trial Counsel's failure to investigate and use her conviction to impeach Victim at trial was particularly egregious because, due to the he-said-she-said nature of\n   the evidence, \"the entire trial was ... largely a test of [Victim's] credibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 Following the rule 23B hearing, the district court determined that Trial Counsel did not render ineffective assistance. We agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial Counsel's decision not to investigate Victim's prior fraud conviction or present it at trial did not prejudice Defendant's defense for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 First, although Trial Counsel did not use Victim's prior conviction to attack her character for truthfulness, he directly challenged the believability of Victim's testimony in a number of ways. On cross-examination of Victim during the State's case-in-chief, Trial Counsel noted that Victim made no mention of Defendant threatening her with a screwdriver in the written statement she made on the day of the assault. Later, during the defense case, Trial Counsel called Victim as an adverse witness and elicited testimony that she frequently threatened self-harm to manipulate Defendant. Trial Counsel also called a number of witnesses who provided testimony that contradicted portions of Victim's version of events: Defendant's mother testified that Victim had admitted to also using drugs on the day of the assault; Defendant's father testified that both Defendant and Victim appeared to be under the influence of drugs that day; Defendant's friend testified that Defendant left his tools-one of which Victim testified to cutting her forehead on-at her house in Brigham City; and Defendant's co-camper friend testified that Victim's injuries were similar to those she herself had sustained on that same camping trip while finding and hauling firewood, thus providing an alternative explanation for Victim's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 Given that Trial Counsel's efforts to directly contradict the content of Victim's testimony failed to sufficiently undermine her credibility in the eyes of the jury, we are not persuaded that it is reasonably probable that a limited mention of her prior workers' compensation fraud conviction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27, would have tipped the scales in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 Second, although Trial Counsel did not know the specific details of Victim's fraud conviction, his limited knowledge of Victim's criminal past would have nonetheless allowed him to ask her whether she had ever been convicted of fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But we are not convinced that the specific details and circumstances of Victim's fraud conviction that Trial Counsel's hypothetical investigation would have uncovered would have been admissible at trial.

In support of his contention that Deputy Archuletta testified in an expert capacity, Defendant points both to the foundation that the State laid in preparation for her testimony and to the content of her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b630 Defendant first asserts that the State asked two expert-related questions when laying the foundation for Deputy Archuletta's testimony: whether she had received training in injuries involving domestic violence and whether she knew how to differentiate between new and old injuries. On that foundation, Defendant claims, Deputy Archuletta proceeded to give expert testimony. Defendant argues that although \"not all of [Deputy] Archuletta's testimony was in the nature of an expert ... many of her answers veered into [the territory of] forensic expert\" testimony. Defendant points to Deputy Archuletta's use of \"technical terms,\" such as \"stippling of blood vessels\" and \"clavicle,\" and to her characterization of most of Victim's injuries as \"fresh,\" which Defendant asserts \"calls for some level of forensic expertise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631 We disagree. Utah Code section 77-17-13(1)(a) did not apply to Deputy Archuletta's testimony because, despite the foundation laid by the State, the subject matter of her testimony fell within the confines of proper lay opinion.

The State asked Victim for the reason she surmised that Defendant had used drugs on the day of the assault, and this exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Victim]: I know that there was still dope around with us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [The prosecutor]: And do you know his behavior?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [Victim]: Evil.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [The prosecutor]: Well, in terms of the drugs ... was it consistent with that behavior?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Victim]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Trial Counsel did not object to this brief exchange. The second instance occurred after Defendant called Victim as an adverse witness and elicited testimony that she often threatened self-harm in order to manipulate Defendant. During the State's cross-examination of Victim, the following exchange unfolded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [The prosecutor]: You mentioned in your testimony that you only got upset and threatened to hurt yourself when, in your words, \"he beats the hell out of me?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [Victim]: Uh-huh (affirmative).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [The prosecutor]: Is that what was happening [when you sent Defendant a text message threatening self-harm]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [Victim]: You know what, it started to get to where we went through a pattern ...

Defendant argues that Victim's testimony about Defendant's prior abuse was inadmissible character evidence under rule 404(a) of the Utah Rules of Evidence because he had not opened the door to it and that Trial Counsel's performance was deficient because he allowed it to reach the jury. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b640 The first exchange during which Victim called Defendant \"evil\" was brief, unprompted, and quickly passed over by the State.

While cross-examining Victim, Trial Counsel asked whether she hit Defendant at the gas station in Brigham City. Victim replied that she did not remember, but that it was possible. On redirect, the topic was revisited during this exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [The prosecutor]: Now, there was a discussion, [Trial Counsel] asked ... if you hit [Defendant] when you were at [the gas station].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Victim]: Uh-huh (affirmative).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [The prosecutor]: And you said, \"I may have.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [Victim]: I-I may have, I may not have.

Prosecutorial Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b643 Defendant lastly challenges Trial Counsel's failure to object to an inappropriate statement the State made during closing argument. Toward the middle of its rebuttal, the State referenced the 14 years of abuse by Defendant that Victim had suffered, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, finally, finally, she comes forward and she says, \"I've had enough, I'm done.\" And that's why we're here today, not because she was a drug addict, not because she liked [being] abused, because she finally said, \"I don't want this life anymore. Help me.\" That's why we're here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant argues that this statement amounted to prosecutorial misconduct and\n   that Trial Counsel performed deficiently by not objecting or taking other action to address the misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b644 \"When we review an attorney's failure to object to a prosecutor's statements during closing argument, the question is not whether the prosecutor's comments were proper, but\n   <em>\n    whether they were so improper\n   </em>\n   that counsel's only defensible choice was to interrupt those comments with an objection.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The statement was followed by a lengthy discussion of, among other things, the evidence, the credibility of Defendant's witnesses, and the elements of the crime. An appeal to the jurors' emotions and sense of duty to protect Victim was certainly not the main focus of the rebuttal. Trial Counsel therefore may well have chosen not to object to the statement to avoid highlighting Defendant's past abuse of Victim to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant asserts that Deputy Archuletta's description of the injuries depicted in the photographs was unhelpful because \"the jury could see the photos for themselves and use their shared experience to evaluate them.\" We disagree. Although the jury was certainly not prevented from forming its own conclusions based on its observations of the photographs, the extent of Victim's injuries was difficult to discern in the photographs. The jury therefore benefitted from hearing descriptions of the injuries from Deputy Archuletta-the person who took the photographs and was able to observe the injuries in person-because it helped focus the jurors on important aspects of the photographs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Moreover, even if Deputy Archuletta's testimony had amounted to improper expert testimony, Trial Counsel still would not have been deficient for not objecting.

Trial Counsel may have chosen not to object to Deputy Archuletta's testimony concerning Victim's injuries given his plan to later elicit similar testimony from Defendant's co-camper friend. Both Deputy Archuletta and Defendant's friend were shown pictures of Victim's injuries and were asked to opine about them. The State asked Deputy Archuletta to describe the injuries and to give her opinion whether they were \"fresh.\" Similarly, Trial Counsel asked Defendant's friend whether Victim's injuries were consistent with those she had obtained while gathering firewood with Victim. We can readily conceive that a competent attorney in Trial Counsel's position may have deliberately chosen not to object to Deputy Archuletta's testimony in order to set a testimonial baseline that would help overcome potential objections to the content of Defendant's co-camper friend's testimony-especially considering that the friend's testimony was crucial in establishing the defense's alternate theory as to the source of Victim's injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Furthermore, Deputy Palmer also testified that Victim's injuries appeared to be \"fresh,\" but Defendant does not challenge his testimony on appeal.
