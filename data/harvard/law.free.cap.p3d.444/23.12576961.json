The terms of the will of Constance Elaine Little and the undisputed record establish the intent of Little to incorporate by reference a separate document that directs distribution of the estate and tangible personal property.

The July 20, 2011 \"Last Will and Testament of Constance E. Little\" states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That I, CONSTANCE E.

Little's handwritten note on the Gift List states, \"Attach to my will at Yakima County Court House.\" The Gift List expressly provides, \"I do hereby state that this is a separate gift list that accompanies my last will and testament dated July 20, 2011.\" Little unequivocally directs \"my Executor, Roxanne Trees,\" to \"first reduce Renae Kay Roberson's half of my estate using the bolded amount values listed below and for the reasons provided in I, II, III, and thence to distribute the remaining items in the order listed.\" Sections I, II, and III of the Gift List state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Except for the absence of the handwritten note, the Gift List is identical to the one she signed on July 20, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Probate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 8 Little died on February 4, 2013. On February 15, Trees filed a \"Notice of Appointment and Pendency of Probate Proceedings.\" Trees filed a petition for an order to admit the will to probate and appoint her as the personal representative. Trees submitted the original July 20, 2011 Last Will and Testament of Constance E. Little; the affidavits of witnesses to the execution of the will;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   the August 4, 2011 will; and the September 16, 2011 revocation of the August 4, 2011 will. The court admitted the July 20, 2011 will to probate and entered an order of solvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 9 On February 15, 2013, the court appointed Trees as the personal representative of the estate of Constance Elaine Little (the Estate) with nonintervention powers and without bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 10 On August 19, 2015, Trees filed the \"First Interim Report and Accounting\" for February 4, 2013 through\n   December 31, 2014 and a petition for \"[r]eimbursement\" of \"[a]dvances by PR\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the Estate. Trees submitted copies of the Gift List that Little executed on July 20, 2011 and on September 16, 2011 as \"Exhibits E and F.\" Trees provided an \"Attorney-in-Fact Accounting\" of all the transactions made by Trees and Little from September 2011 until Little's death in February 2013. Trees requested the court order Roberson to file an accounting. Trees asserts that absent an accounting from Roberson, \"it is premature to order any reductions\" to her share of the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The July 20, 2011 separate writing was executed contemporaneously with the Will dated July 20, 2011 and is incorporated by reference in the Will per RCW 11.12.255. However, it is premature to order any reductions to the distributive share of Renae Roberson because the issue of \"reduction\" may be addressed in her accounting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ... Renae Roberson and Roxanne Trees both served as agents under separate powers of attorney for their mother, Constance Little. Both Renae Roberson and Roxanne Trees should file accountings. Furthermore, the \"Gift Lists\" contain a provision that Renae Roberson should account for her activities. See Exhibits E and F.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 11 The First Interim Report states that as of December 31, 2014, the balance of the Estate bank account was $ 70,281.52, the Estate owned a two-thirds interest in the residential property in Yakima, and the Federal Way property had been sold by court order. The First Interim Report states the sale of the Federal Way property resulted in net proceeds of $ 132,825.61. Trees sought court approval to sell the two-thirds interest in the Yakima property. Trees notes she owns the other one-third interest and is \"readying the property for sale.\" Trees requested approval of the Attorney-in-Fact Accounting and issuance of an order requiring Roberson to \"account\n   for her activities while serving as Agent and also for any other activities undertaken with respect to assets held by Constance E. Little.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 12 The court scheduled a hearing for October 28, 2015. The court ordered Roberson to appear and show cause why she had not prepared an accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 13 Roberson represented herself pro se. In response, Roberson filed an objection to the First Interim Report. At the hearing on October 28, 2015, the superior court commissioner approved the First Interim Report but reserved ruling on the request to order Roberson to file an accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 14 Approximately two years later on November 30, 2017, Trees filed the \"Final Report, Accounting, and Petitions for Distribution of Assets and for Decree of Distribution\" (Final Report). The Final Report states Roberson filed three creditor claims against the Estate: (1) A claim for funeral expenses, (2) a claim for house repairs in the amount of $ 51,659.99, and (3) a claim for \"services\" in the amount of $ 7,500.00. The report states Trees reimbursed Roberson for the funeral expenses but made only \"a partial payment\" to Roberson of $ 20,000.00 for the house repairs because the \"Estate lacked liquidity,\" and rejected the claim for \"services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Final Report identifies $ 133,478.29 in the Estate bank account and $ 163,498.98 from the court-approved sale of the Yakima property. The Final Report states Trees followed the directive for \"reductions to the distributive share of Renae Roberson and cash gifts to Ryan Trees, Stacey Fataua, Meridian School Foundation, YCTV, and Parker Youth Foundation\" and \"disposition of certain tangible personal property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 16 Roberson contested the Final Report. Roberson asserted the Gift List did not meet the statutory requirements for incorporation by reference under RCW 11.12.255 because it was not in existence \"when the will [was] executed\" and the will did not identify the writing or \"manifest the\n   intent to incorporate the writing\" into the will. Roberson argued the Gift List was invalid because it \"was never admitted to probate with the Will\" and the \"monetary gifts are all void as a matter of law\" because the monetary gifts are not tangible personal property under RCW 11.12.260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 17 At the conclusion of the hearing on the Final Report and petition for decree of distribution, a superior court commissioner entered the \"Decree of Distribution.\" The Decree of Distribution states the actions of the personal representative \"during this accounting period were reasonable, necessary, and furthered the administration of the Estate.\" The commissioner concluded, \"Said actions should be ratified, confirmed, and approved.\" The Decree of Distribution approves the Final Report and authorizes the proposed distribution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   1. The Final Report is approved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   2. The Cash Accounting for the period from January 1, 2015 through September 8, 2017 is approved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   3. The actions of the PR during this accounting period are ratified, confirmed, and approved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   4. The PR shall distribute the remaining net assets of the Estate as provided for in the formula outlined in the Proposed Distribution Worksheet of Cash attached as Exhibit D to the underlying Final Report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   5. Any personal property that is not picked up by Renae Roberson within 30 days of the entry of this Decree of Distribution shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Renae Roberson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 18 The commissioner entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Decree of Distribution states the \"total amount of the reductions to the distributive share of Renae Roberson provide[d] for in the Gift List is $ 122,000.\" The findings of fact state the \"Gift List is specifically referenced and described at Articles Second and Third of the Will.\" The commissioner concluded the \"Gift List is incorporated by reference in the Will under RCW 11.12.255\"; the \"provisions\n   of the Gift List detail the testator's reasons for the reductions to Renae Roberson's distributive share at Items I, II, and III\"; and the \"Gift List manifests the testator's inten[t] to equalize the advancements made to Renae Roberson during the testator's lifetime.\" The commissioner concluded the Gift List also \"disposes of tangible personal property\" under RCW 11.12.260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Revision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 19 Roberson filed a motion to revise the commissioner order approving the Decree of Distribution. Roberson argued the Gift List was unenforceable because it was not filed with the probate petition and did not meet the requirements of RCW 11.12.255 or RCW 11.12.260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 20 The superior court denied the motion for revision and affirmed the decision of the commissioner to approve the Decree of Distribution. The court found there is \"no evidence of undue influence or wrongdoing.\" The court concluded there is \"no requirement that the gift list be filed\" with the will and Roberson had the will \"or access to it ... for a few years and had an opportunity to address the issues in the gift list.\" The court entered the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The court agrees with the Commissioner that RCW 11.12.255 is the controlling statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The will referenced the gift list.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The gift list existed at the time the Will was signed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The gift list was redated and mentioned again three months later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   It is clearly referenced in the Will.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Superior Court Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 21 Roberson appeals the superior court order denying the motion to revise the decision of the superior court commissioner\n   to approve the Decree of Distribution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 22 The decision of a court commissioner is subject to revision by the superior court.
