We described the underlying facts in our decision affirming the conviction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In February of 2009, the Wyoming Department of Family Services (DFS) took K.T., a minor child who was then nine years old, to the Child Advocacy Project (CAP) in Casper, Wyoming, to be interviewed. During the interview, K.T. revealed that on two separate occasions in her grandmother's bedroom, Sullivan attempted to have sex with her but because it was too painful, K.T. stated that Sullivan anally raped her when she was seven and eight years old. K.T. also revealed that Sullivan made her taste his semen, and that there were occasions when Sullivan made her sit on his lap while he watched pornography on the computer. During one specific instance, K.T. recalled that Sullivan was rubbing K.T.'s private area through her clothes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Thermopolis Police Department interviewed Sullivan after learning of the CAP interview with K.T. They informed Sullivan of K.T.'s allegations, which he initially denied.

He claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective and that his appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to assert ineffective assistance of counsel in his direct appeal. Mr. Sullivan argued several grounds for his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, including: 1) failure to challenge his confession to law enforcement; 2) failure to depose the victim's physician; 3) failure to present expert testimony regarding alleged defects in the victim interview; and 4) failure to present evidence of sexual abuse of the victim by her uncle. The district court denied Mr. Sullivan's petition, and this Court denied his petition for a writ of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] On April 23, 2018, Mr. Sullivan filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for relief under the Post-Conviction Determination of Factual Innocence Act (hereinafter \"Act\" or \"Factual Innocence Act\"). As grounds for his petition, he asserted newly discovered evidence consisting of: 1) a defense counsel interview of the victim's physician during which the physician stated that he found limited signs of sexual abuse, that he referred the victim to a gynecologist, and that the record contained no indication that a rectal examination of the victim had been performed; 2) the victim's prior allegations against her biological father and uncle; 3) a February 22, 2018 newspaper article reporting that the victim's uncle, Glenn Tanner, had pled guilty to the 2007 second-degree sexual abuse of an unnamed minor; and 4) an assertion that law enforcement witnesses lied when they testified that Mr. Sullivan confessed to first-degree sexual abuse of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b66] On August 13, 2018, the district court entered an order summarily denying Mr. Sullivan's actual innocence petition because it failed to cite newly discovered evidence and made irrelevant and conclusory allegations.

We thus conclude that while the rules of civil procedure generally apply to a district court's consideration of a factual innocence petition, the court is not required to accept the petition's allegations as true in evaluating their adequacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [\u00b616] We turn then to the district court's initial review and dismissal of Mr. Sullivan's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     District Court's Dismissal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b617] The Act requires dismissal of a factual innocence petition if it fails to aver, with supporting affidavits or other credible documents, that \"[n]ewly discovered evidence exists that, if credible, establishes a bona fide issue of factual innocence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207-12-403\">\n    Wyo.

The Act also requires dismissal of a petition if it presents issues \"that appear frivolous or speculative on their face.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%207-12-404\">\n    Wyo.

The only ruling he challenges is the court's rejection of the 2018 newspaper article, which reported that KT's uncle, Glenn Tanner, had pled guilty to sexual abuse of a minor for acts occurring in 2007. He contends that because the sexual abuse for which he was convicted was also alleged to have occurred in 2007, Mr. Tanner's plea is evidence that KT misattributed the acts to him. He argues that because the plea evidence was not available for his 2009 trial, it qualifies as newly discovered evidence and was sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his factual innocence claim. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b619] Glenn Tanner's reported guilty plea did not clearly establish Mr. Sullivan's factual innocence. First, the cited newspaper article did not identify the victim as KT, and Mr. Sullivan cited no other credible source identifying the victim as KT. Moreover, even if the petition had contained a verified averment that KT was the victim, the evidence would not have clearly established Mr. Sullivan's innocence. KT testified at trial that three men sexually abused her: Mr. Sullivan, Glenn Tanner, and her biological father. Glenn Tanner's plea does not mean that Mr. Sullivan and KT's biological father did not also abuse her, and it therefore fails to clearly establish Mr. Sullivan's innocence. The petition was therefore properly dismissed for failing to comply with the section 403(b)(i) requirement that the proffered evidence establish a bona issue of factual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b620] Dismissal was also warranted by section 404(b)'s requirement that a petition be dismissed if it presents issues that appear speculative. The plain meaning of \"appear\" is \"to have an outward aspect: seem.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   60 (11th ed. 2007). The plain meaning of \"speculative\" is \"theoretical rather than demonstrable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1199. Mr. Sullivan's claim of misattribution is a theory and no more. It does not demonstrably establish his factual innocence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b621] Although the rules of civil procedure generally apply to petitions under the Factual Innocence Act, a district court is not required on its initial review of a petition to accept its allegations as true.

The distinction we find is that by statute, factual innocence proceedings in Utah are civil proceedings governed by the rules of civil procedure.
