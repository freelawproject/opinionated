Specifically, the State contends the court erred in excluding S.M.G.'s pending deferred disposition. This case turns on the definition of criminal history contained in RCW 13.40.020(8)(b) of the Juvenile Justice Act (JJA). Because the plain meaning of section (8)(b) requires the court to exclude all deferred dispositions, including pending deferred dispositions, the court did not err when it excluded S.M.G.'s pending deferred disposition from his criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In March 2018, the State charged S.M.G. with unlawful possession of methamphetamine with intent to manufacture or deliver and one count of misdemeanor harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 17, 2018, S.M.G. pleaded guilty to the possession charge in exchange for the State dismissing the harassment charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 At the time of imposing disposition, S.M.G. had a prior felony adjudication from 2016 and a pending deferred disposition from 2017.

S.M.G. argues the juvenile court is required to exclude all deferred dispositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 When analyzing the plain meaning of a statute, we may rely on the \"traditional rules\n   of grammar.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the final sentence of RCW 13.40.020(8)(b), the legislature used the singular article, \"a,\" in front of \"successfully completed deferred adjudication\" and again in front of \"deferred disposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Because articles have a demonstrative value, the meaning of a phrase may shift depending on the article used. For example,\n   <em>\n    an officer and gentleman escorted Princess Grace to her car\n   </em>\n   suggests (though ambiguously) that the escort was one man with two descriptive characteristics. But\n   <em>\n    an officer and a friend escorted Princess Grace to her car\n   </em>\n   suggests that two people acted as escorts.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b614 Here, the legislature's use of the singular article before each direct object indicates deferred adjudications and deferred dispositions are distinct concepts with different consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b615 The placement of the phrase \"successfully completed\" further illustrates the legislature's intent to treat deferred dispositions differently than deferred adjudications. \"Successfully completed\" is an adverbial phrase. Generally, adverbs, or adverbial phrases, should \"be placed as near as possible to the word it is intended to modify.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Successfully completed\" clearly modifies the immediately following direct object, \"deferred adjudication.\" But \"successfully completed\" does not modify \"deferred disposition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 Under the State's analysis, we would be required to either delete the second \"a\" from the sentence, e.g., \"A successfully completed deferred adjudication or a deferred disposition,\" or add a second \"successfully completed\" into the sentence, e.g., \"A successfully completed deferred adjudication or\n   <em>\n    successfully completed\n   </em>\n   deferred disposition.\" We decline to rewrite the sentence drafted by the legislature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the traditional rules of grammar, the plain language of the final sentence of section (8)(b) requires the juvenile court to exclude all pending deferred dispositions from a juvenile's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 The State contends this interpretation contradicts the language in RCW 13.40.020(8)(a) and RCW 13.40.127. Although we do not apply the rules of grammar \"if other factors, such as context and language in related statutes, indicate contrary legislative intent or if applying the rule would result in an absurd or nonsensical interpretation,\" the surrounding statutes do not reveal a contradictory legislative intent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 When calculating a juvenile's criminal history, RCW 13.40.020(8)(a) directs the juvenile court to include \"all criminal complaints against the respondent for which, prior to the commission of a current offense ... [t]he allegations were found correct by a court.\" The State argues section (8)(a) requires the juvenile court to include pending deferred dispositions in a juvenile's criminal history. But \" 'we interpret a statute to give effect to all language, so as to render no portion meaningless or superfluous.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State's rationale is that a pending deferred disposition is an allegation found correct by a court because the juvenile must plead guilty before the court may grant a deferred disposition. But this rationale conflicts with the phrase in the final sentence of section (8)(b), which excepts \"a deferred disposition\" from a juvenile's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 Although a pending deferred disposition technically falls under section (8)(a) because the juvenile must plead guilty before the court may grant a deferred disposition, section (8)(b) expressly excepts deferred dispositions from a juvenile's criminal history. Section (8)(b) includes guilty verdicts following a bench trial and guilty pleas entered outside the context of a deferred disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is not absurd for the legislature to narrowly except deferred dispositions from section (8)(a). And the State's interpretation of section (8)(a) would render section (8)(b) superfluous as to deferred dispositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b620 RCW 13.40.127(9)(c) provides, in part, \"[a] deferred disposition shall\n   <em>\n    remain a conviction\n   </em>\n   unless the case is dismissed and the conviction is vacated pursuant to (b) of this subsection or sealed pursuant to RCW 13.50.260.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues the legislature's general categorization of deferred dispositions as convictions demonstrates the legislature's intent to include pending deferred dispositions in a juvenile's criminal history. But the legislature's reference to deferred dispositions as convictions does not necessarily require the court to consider pending deferred dispositions in a juvenile's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b621 The State's argument appears to assume that a new charge during the supervision period for a pending deferred disposition will automatically result in revocation of the pending deferred disposition. But the court has discretion, when a juvenile violates the conditions of a pending deferred disposition, to impose sanctions without revocation. RCW 13.40.127(7)(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If the court finds the juvenile failed to comply with the terms of the deferred disposition, the court may:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (i) Revoke the deferred disposition and enter an order of disposition; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (ii)\n   <em>\n    Impose sanctions for the violation\n   </em>\n   .\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 If the court elects to impose sanctions, rather than revoking the deferred disposition, it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the deferred disposition statutory scheme to automatically include a deferred disposition in the juvenile's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 The State's argument also ignores the purpose of the JJA.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Although the JJA seeks a balance between the poles of rehabilitation and retribution, the purposes of accountability and punishment are tempered by and at times must give way to the purposes of responding to the needs of the juvenile. Moreover, unlike the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 applicable in adult criminal proceedings,\n   <em>\n    juvenile restitution is remedial, not punitive\n   </em>\n   .\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b624 This remedial policy is reflected in RCW 13.40.127(2), which provides, \"[i]n all cases where the juvenile is eligible for a deferred disposition,\" juvenile courts are required to apply \"a strong presumption that the deferred disposition will be granted.\" Consistent with this remedial policy, it is not absurd for the legislature to exclude pending deferred dispositions from a juvenile's criminal history. The juvenile is held accountable because they must plead guilty before disposition will be deferred. At the same time, this accountability is balanced by exclusion of a pending deferred disposition from the juvenile's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b625 Here, at the same hearing, after excluding the pending deferred disposition from S.M.G.'s criminal history for the disposition on the possession offense, the trial court revoked the pending 2017 deferred disposition. The State argues it would be odd for the calculation of a juvenile's criminal history in these circumstances to depend on the chronology of the disposition on the possession offense and revocation of the pending deferred disposition, especially when they are part of the same hearing. But it was the prosecutor who proposed the order of events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b626 If the legislature wanted the juvenile court to exclude only successfully completed deferred dispositions from criminal history, the legislature could have included \"successfully completed\" immediately before \"deferred disposition\" in the final sentence of RCW 13.40.020(8)(b). Absent such language, the juvenile court is bound to the plain language of the section. And under the plain\n   language, RCW 13.40.020(8) requires the juvenile court to exclude all pending deferred dispositions from a juvenile's criminal history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b627 We conclude the juvenile court correctly calculated S.M.G.'s offender score.
