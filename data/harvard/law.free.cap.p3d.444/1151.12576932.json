The magistrate here declined to bind Jana Clyde over for negligent homicide because he heard \"no direct evidence that it was a gross deviation\" from the standard of care for Clyde, a jailhouse nurse, not to treat an inmate for dehydration. The State appeals, and we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Inmate's Medical Treatment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Clyde was a licensed practical nurse (LPN) at the Duchesne County Jail. On a Sunday, a young woman (Inmate) was booked into the jail on drug charges. By Thursday, she was dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63\n   <em>\n    Sunday\n   </em>\n   . The booking report lists Inmate's weight at 129 pounds. When Inmate was booked, she tested positive for heroin and informed jail personnel on an intake form that she had a history of drug abuse\n   and was withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. Inmate also noted on the intake form that she was taking medication for high blood pressure. Clyde generally had access to inmate intake forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64\n   <em>\n    Monday\n   </em>\n   . Clyde saw Inmate to discuss her medication. Inmate appeared to be \"a little weak,\" and Inmate said that she \"hadn't been feeling good\" and \"probably had the flu.\" Inmate also had \"been throwing up a little but wasn't real concerned about that.\" Clyde approved Inmate's blood-pressure medication and tested her blood pressure. Clyde concluded that it was \"a little elevated\" but that Inmate had not taken her pills yet. When Clyde asked Inmate about her drug use, Inmate responded that she did not have \"any drugs in her system\" and that it \"had been several days since she'd used anything.\" Clyde testified that she thought, \"Chick, you do some serious drugs and I know you're lying to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Clyde then gave Inmate her medication with a sports drink and arranged for Inmate to receive the blood-pressure medication twice a day. She also told Inmate to let her know if she wanted her blood pressure taken again and that she could fill out a medical request form to see the jail's physician assistant (PA) who visited on Thursdays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66\n   <em>\n    Tuesday\n   </em>\n   . A correctional officer at the jail (First Officer) noticed that Inmate was getting \"weaker.\" First Officer told Clyde that Inmate was \"not looking good\" and that she wanted to give her a sports drink because \"she kept throwing up.\" Clyde said that was fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Later in the day, First Officer again informed Clyde that Inmate was \"not looking good\" and was still \"throwing up a lot.\" Clyde said to have Inmate fill out a medical request form for the PA's next visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Inmate filled out the medical request form, explaining that she had been \"puking for 4 days straight,\" had \"diarrhea,\" and could not \"hold anything down[,] not even water.\" Inmate insisted that she was \"not detoxing\" and instead had a \"stomach bug.\" Once the form was filled out, First Officer delivered it to Clyde. Clyde did not notify the PA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 First Officer also decided to move Inmate to a court-holding cell \"to be watched more closely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The holding cell contains a video camera that First Officer believed would help with Inmate's medical observation. The camera showed Inmate using \"the restroom several times\" and vomiting a \"brown substance.\" And though there was a sports drink bottle in the cell, First Officer stated that the camera did not capture Inmate taking in \"a ton of fluid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610\n   <em>\n    Wednesday\n   </em>\n   . Another correctional officer (Second Officer) took medication to Inmate, but Inmate \"said she was too sick to get out of bed.\" Ordinarily, the officers deliver medication at a \"cuff port\" so that they do not have to enter the cell. But because Inmate could not move, Second Officer \"walked in there and gave her [the] medication.\" Inmate \"didn't look normal,\" and it appeared that she had been vomiting. Second Officer may have informed Clyde of Inmate's condition. Clyde later gave a sports drink to Inmate through the cuff port.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611\n   <em>\n    Thursday\n   </em>\n   . The PA came to the jail for his weekly visit. Clyde and the PA discussed Inmate and went to the court-holding cell to see her. Once there, Inmate did not respond to Clyde's voice or knocking on the door, and the PA told Clyde to call an ambulance. Inmate was found dead, weighing 87 pounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    The Preliminary Hearing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The State charged Clyde with negligent homicide. At a preliminary hearing to determine whether Clyde should be bound\n   over for trial on that charge, the State presented, among other evidence, testimony from the medical examiner who performed Inmate's autopsy, a recorded interview with Clyde, and testimony from a registered nurse (RN) from another jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 The medical examiner determined that Inmate \"died as a result of complications of dehydration in the setting of opiate withdrawal.\" In his examination of Inmate's body, the medical examiner noted \"findings consistent with dehydration such as sunken eyes, tenting of skin, and reduced ... tissue turgor.\" The examiner testified that he based his final conclusion about the cause of death on Inmate's electrolyte results, which were \"severely in the abnormal range\" and indicative of \"profound dehydration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 The examiner opined that dehydration is a \"reversible condition\" that can generally be cured, absent cardiac arrhythmia, almost up to the time of death with the use of IV fluids. He explained that fluids should be given intravenously so that they are absorbed by the body; giving fluids orally, in the examiner's experience, \"will not resolve dehydration\" once \"there is a problem with either throwing up or diarrhea or a combination\" of the two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Next, the State introduced Clyde's interview with a detective. In the interview, Clyde explained that she knew it takes three to five days for the symptoms of heroin withdrawal to manifest. Clyde knew that the symptoms of heroin withdrawal include \"elevated blood pressure[ ],\" \"diarrhea,\" \"throwing up,\" and being \"weak.\" As a nurse, Clyde knew the appropriate protocol in treating someone suffering from heroin withdrawal is to monitor blood pressure, provide fluids, and contact the PA. Clyde stated in the interview that if inmates demanded to see a doctor, she would \"do a really good evaluation on them\" by performing a \"full set of vital signs,\" running a \"dehydration test,\" \"check[ing] their eyes,\" \"check[ing] their mouth for saliva,\" and \"do[ing a] tenting test.\" She would then \"keep an eye\" on them, observing things like whether \"they [are] up and moving\" and whether they are \"keeping anything that they're taking in down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 Finally, the RN\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that \"in assessing the risk of someone who's been vomiting and having diarrhea for four days,\" an LPN \"definitely should see it as ... a potentially very dangerous situation.\" He testified that in that situation he, as an RN, would \"immediately contact the\" PA for orders to test her blood, \"possibly start some IVs,\" and \"even go to the hospital.\" The RN also explained that he would \"continually watch[ ] vital signs,\" monitor eating and drinking, and run \"blood labs\" if he was unable \"to get the vomiting and diarrhea under control with medication.\" The RN stated that the cause of the vomiting and diarrhea-whether heroin withdrawal or the flu-would not affect the treatment. Based on what he knew about Inmate's medical condition, he would have expected Clyde to do three things: chart Inmate's vital signs, contact the PA, and \"follow up [a] minimum [of] twice a day.\" The failure to do so, in the RN's view, was a \"deviation from the standard of care\" expected from nurses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617 After hearing the evidence, the magistrate acknowledged that \"the standard for bindover is really very low,\" placing the standard somewhere between that needed for an arrest warrant and that needed to resist a directed verdict. The magistrate questioned whether \"knowing that someone has been vomiting and had diarrhea for four days communicates the existence of a risk of death that's so significant that immediate action is warranted.\" The magistrate stated that he did not \"have any evidence of how substantial this risk is\"-one in ten or one in ten thousand. Ultimately, the magistrate concluded that he \"definitely ha[d] evidence that [for Clyde] to not do something immediately was a deviation from the standard of care\" but that there was \"no direct evidence that it was a gross deviation,\" as required for criminal negligence. Unable to \"bridge\" the gap between ordinary negligence and criminal negligence\n   without such evidence, the magistrate dismissed the charges against Clyde.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 The State appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 The State contends that the \"magistrate erroneously refused to bind [Clyde] over for negligent homicide.\" \"Bindover determinations are mixed questions of law and fact to which we grant some deference.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In response, Clyde defends the magistrate's decision while also contending that the State's evidence \"fell short\" in two other respects. Specifically, Clyde invites this court to affirm the magistrate's decision based on the alternative grounds that the State failed to show the applicable standard of care or the severity of the risk that existed. Beginning with the applicable standard of care, we address all three arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. The Applicable Standard of Care\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 Clyde first argues that to prove negligent homicide, the State must establish the standard of care that is expected under the circumstances. Clyde then contends that we should affirm the magistrate's bindover decision because the State failed \"to establish what standard of care applied specifically to ... an LPN working at the [j]ail.\" She asserts that neither the RN's nor the medical examiner's testimony established the specific standard of care \"applicable to medical personnel.\" According to Clyde, the medical examiner's testimony-that dehydration was reversible almost up to the time of death-was \"borderline nonsensical\" and \"inoperable as a standard of care\" because \"there was no discussion as to how to calculate\" the time of death \"when there is 'a recovery.' \" And the RN's testimony similarly failed to establish a standard of care, in Clyde's view, because the RN \"talked in terms of what\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   would do\" as a registered nurse at a larger jail facility, never expressing \"what was standard in the industry.\" (Emphasis added.) Clyde then suggests that the RN, who may simply have been \"overly cautious,\" did not necessarily represent the typical standard of care exercised by a jailhouse medical professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 The State counters that the preliminary hearing evidence was sufficient on this point. It stresses that Clyde, while focusing on the RN's and medical examiner's testimonies, ignores \"her own damning statements.\" In her interview, Clyde stated that she knew the appropriate protocol in treating someone suffering from heroin withdrawal would be to monitor blood pressure, provide fluids, and contact the PA. And when asked what she would do if an inmate demanded medical attention, Clyde responded that she would \"do a really good evaluation,\" check \"vital signs,\" perform a \"dehydration test,\" and \"keep an eye\" out to ensure that the person was \"keeping anything that [he or she was] taking in down.\" The State also defends the medical examiner's testimony as \"[i]nferentially ... support[ing] the standard of care established by\" Clyde's statements. The State argues that \"the inability to calculate exactly when death might occur does nothing to undermine ... the ordinary standard of care\" but rather \"emphasizes the substantial risk of inaction at the first sign of serious trouble.\" And the RN's testimony, according to the State, \"adequately defined, for preliminary hearing purposes, the standard of care\" because there is a \"reasonable inference\" that the RN's testimony \"would address the standards of care applicable to all nurses.\" So when the RN testified that he would have expected Clyde to chart Inmate's vital signs, contact the PA, and \"follow-up [a] minimum [of] twice a day,\" the State asserts that he helped define the applicable standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 We agree with the State. \"The bindover standard is intended to leave the principal fact finding to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, Clyde knew that after Inmate requested a doctor, she should perform a dehydration test and ensure that Inmate was keeping fluids down.

Severity of the Risk\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627 Clyde next argues that we should affirm the magistrate's bindover decision because there was no evidence of a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of Inmate's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2076-2-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (LexisNexis 2017). Echoing the magistrate's concerns, Clyde argues that there is a lack of evidence on \"the likelihood that the risk alleged would result in [Inmate's] death.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Specifically, she asserts that \"the State presented no evidence on the probability-large or slight-that [Clyde's] conduct would cause [Inmate's] death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 The State responds that its evidence at the preliminary hearing \"established that a\n   person experiencing severe vomiting and diarrhea constitutes 'a potentially very dangerous situation' because a person can die from the resultant severe dehydration.\" The State also argues that Clyde \"should have been aware of the risk\" to Inmate because she \"usually receives an inmate's intake papers\" and heard from First Officer that Inmate was sick and vomiting \"a lot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 We again agree with the State. \"The magnitude of a given risk is determined in part by the probability that the risk will be actualized and in part by the seriousness of the consequence if the risk is actualized.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This probability to seriousness ratio is fact-dependent, but \"the potential of a risk [of] death ... is always serious.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10389133\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/769/254/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, even a small likelihood of death might create a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10389133\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/769/254/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b630 Here, the risk of not treating Inmate for dehydration was death. The RN testified that \"vomiting and having diarrhea for four days\" is \"definitely ... a risk\" and a \"potentially very dangerous situation.\" And the risk was particularly unjustifiable because, as the medical examiner testified, it is generally avoidable. According to his testimony, dehydration is a \"reversible condition\" that can be cured, absent other conditions, almost up to the time of death by giving fluids intravenously. In fact, the magistrate recognized that if the jail \"had medical visits on Wednesday, we probably wouldn't be here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b631 The State also presented evidence that Clyde should have been aware of the risk and was in a position to combat it. Clyde generally would have received Inmate's intake form, which stated that Inmate was withdrawing from drugs or alcohol. Clyde also suspected, despite Inmate's protestations to the contrary, that Inmate used drugs recently. When Inmate said she was not withdrawing from any drugs, Clyde testified that she thought, \"Chick, you do some serious drugs and I know you're lying to me.\" In addition, Clyde received reports from at least First Officer that Inmate was sick and should be moved to court holding for medical observation. Given the seriousness of the risk (death) and the relative ease with which it can be avoided (IV fluids), we conclude that there was evidence of a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2076-2-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) ;\n   <em>\n    Standiford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10389133\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/769/254/\">\n    769 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   263 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III. Gross Deviation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b632 Having disposed of Clyde's alternative bases to affirm, we turn finally to the State's contention that Clyde's \"near complete indifference to [Inmate] grossly deviated from the standard of care\" and that the magistrate erred in concluding otherwise. Despite Clyde's knowing that she should monitor Inmate, provide her with adequate liquids, and consult with the PA, the State asserts that Clyde \"did none of this.\" And because \"[t]he evidence showed that a person can die from severe dehydration,\" the State argues that Clyde's \"failure to perceive [that risk] constituted 'a gross deviation from the standard of care.' \" (Quoting Utah Code section 76-2-103(4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b633 To defend the magistrate's ruling, Clyde relies on\n   <em>\n    State v.

Clyde argues that \"[t]he State failed to show any evidence that [Clyde's] conduct was a gross deviation from the standard of care.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 We agree with the State for a third time. The evidence in this case, taken in the light most favorable to the State, adequately established a reasonable inference that Clyde's near complete indifference to Inmate grossly deviated from the standard of care for treating severe dehydration, especially when the result of a failure to treat is death. Other than checking Inmate's blood pressure on Monday and dropping off a sports drink on Wednesday, Clyde did not take Inmate's vital signs or perform other tests, did not check on Inmate in her cell, and did not contact the PA, even after receiving a medical request form stating that Inmate had been \"puking for 4 days straight\" and was unable to \"hold anything down.\" First Officer, who was not charged with Inmate's medical care, informed Clyde that Inmate \"was not looking good\" and even moved\n   Inmate to court holding to facilitate medical observation because she noticed Inmate's deteriorating condition. And Second Officer may have informed Clyde that Inmate was too weak to get out of bed. Clyde failed to follow the protocol that she identified by not running tests or even \"keep[ing] an eye on [Inmate].\" Thus, according to the State's evidence at the preliminary hearing, there is \"a wide gulf between the standard of care [Inmate] should have received and the care [she], in fact, received.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10383413\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/813/1146/#p1154\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10383413\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/813/1146/#p1154\">\n    at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 We emphasize that a preliminary hearing is not concerned with the ultimate merits of the State's case, that is, whether the State will be able to prove at trial the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
