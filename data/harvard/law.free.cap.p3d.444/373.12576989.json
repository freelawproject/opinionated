Whildin and Thomas M. Whildin and incorporated into their divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jaime appeals the hearing officer's order modifying child support and the district court's judgment affirming that order. Jaime raises four issues on appeal. First, she contends the district court erred by refusing to enforce the parties' agreement that Thomas would maintain extensive business records and employ a certified public accountant (CPA) to establish his yearly gross domestic income for purposes of determining future child support. Second, Jaime argues the district court should have enforced the stipulation of Thomas' minimum gross domestic income when calculating child support. Third, Jaime asserts the district court erred when using the extended income formula to calculate the parties' child support obligations. Fourth, Jaime contends the district court erred by not awarding her attorney fees. Fifth, Jaime seeks attorney fees for prosecuting this appeal. Finally, Thomas, as appellee, claims error in the arbitrary imputation of a gross wage of $52,500 per year as Thomas' gross domestic income for purposes of calculating child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon our review, we affirm the rulings of the hearing officer and district court. We also dismiss Thomas' claim of error and deny Jamie's motion for appellate attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jaime and Thomas were married in 2003. During their marriage, the couple raised their two children together and resided in La Cygne. In October 2013, Jaime filed a petition for divorce and moved to Louisburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the divorce proceedings, Jaime was employed as an air traffic control specialist with the Federal Aviation Administration earning about $124,912 per year. Thomas was a self-employed electrician who owned his own electrical business which he operated out of the marital residence. Throughout the litigation, there was disagreement regarding Thomas' income for purposes of determining child support. Jaime alleged Thomas' annual income was about $120,000, while he calculated his annual income at $14,040.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ultimately, Jaime and Thomas entered into a separation agreement, property settlement, and parenting plan. The parenting plan called for joint legal custody and shared residential custody of the minor children. The plan also provided that the couple would share parenting time on an equal basis with the children. Under the plan, the children were to attend school in Louisburg instead of LaCygne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The separation agreement and property settlement (Agreement) provided that Jaime was to pay Thomas $350 in spousal maintenance for a 24-month period. The Agreement also contained several provisions pertaining to child support payments. Although the couple disagreed on the methods and figures to calculate child support, they compromised with Jaime agreeing to pay Thomas $900 per month for child support. For his part, Thomas agreed to pay all direct expenses for the two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Agreement also outlined the couple's stipulations for future modifications of child support payments. The couple agreed that Thomas had no right to seek an increase in child support payments until after July 1, 2016. Thomas stipulated that he would maintain proper financial records, financial reports, source documents, and employ a CPA to prepare quarterly and annual financial reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, the couple stipulated that in any future child support modification proceedings, Thomas' gross domestic income for calculating support \"shall be either [Thomas'] gross domestic income at that time or the sum of $75,000.00, whichever is greater.\" The Agreement provided that Thomas' gross domestic income could be less than $75,000 only if he was disabled or not gainfully employed because of serious injury or illness. The couple suggested these stipulations were necessary for the future because of the dispute over Thomas' income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2014, the district court issued a divorce decree which incorporated the Agreement. The district court ordered that Thomas should maintain appropriate record keeping to show his gross domestic income from self-employment. Additionally, the district court ordered, per the Agreement, that Thomas' gross domestic income when modifying child support would be the greater of his actual gross domestic income or $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   About a year and a half later, on March 18, 2016, Thomas moved to modify child support. He argued that child support should be modified because Jaime's income had increased, the parties needed an expense sharing plan, and his receipt of spousal maintenance was set to terminate in June 2016. Thomas sought an order increasing Jaime's monthly child support obligation to $1,466 effective July 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In Jaime's answer to Thomas' motion for modification, she claimed he was barred from arguing that his gross domestic income was less than $75,000. Jaime also asserted that Thomas failed to produce business records and information that he agreed to maintain under the Agreement. She sought attorney fees incurred due to Thomas' motion to modify child support. Thomas responded that his record keeping requirements and stipulated minimum gross domestic income were void as against public policy and not in the children's best interests. Thomas claimed his income for 2015 was $28,353, including Jaime's maintenance payments to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   An administrative hearing officer held a hearing on Thomas' motion to modify child support. At the hearing, the parties discussed the children's daycare situation and Thomas' work hours. Thomas claimed his work hours were limited due to transporting the children to and from school in Louisburg. This travel limited Thomas to working about 25-30 hours per week for which he could not feasibly make $75,000 a year. Jaime suggested that the children's maternal grandmother could pick up the children from school and watch them until Thomas finished work. The hearing officer noted that Thomas needed to work 40 hours per week and ordered the parties to obtain daycare for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With regard to the dispute over the amount of Thomas' income, the hearing officer advised that she was \"not stuck\" with the parties' stipulation that Thomas had a minimum gross income of $75,000 a year. Thomas argued that, with his reduced hours, he was currently making less than $2,000 a month. With an increase to a 40-hour work week, Thomas opined that he could make about $30,000 a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For her part, Jaime insisted the hearing officer should use the $75,000 minimum amount that Thomas agreed should be imputed as his gross domestic income. She argued that Thomas \"whittle[d]\" down his income by claiming a \"bunch of expenses.\" Jaime suggested that Thomas failed to maintain records he agreed to keep and did not provide documents to substantiate his income and expenses. Instead, Thomas produced only a profit and loss statement and bank records. Jaime asserted the Agreement's provision requiring Thomas to keep business records was not against public policy and should be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The hearing officer split the difference between the parties' disputed claims about Jaime's income and imputed a wage of $52,500 per year as Thomas' gross income for purposes of calculating child support. Next, a 15% parenting time adjustment was made to Jaime's child support obligation. The hearing officer calculated Jaime's annual income at $162,750.16 based on her most recent paystub.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the end of the hearing, Jaime questioned why the hearing officer was not enforcing the Agreement requiring Thomas to maintain certain business records. The hearing officer responded that because Thomas was self-employed he needed to maintain financial records but due to the significant expense of hiring a CPA to maintain and analyze the records provided in the Agreement, she was not enforcing that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The hearing officer filed a journal entry memorializing the hearing. The hearing officer found the Agreement's provision stipulating to a minimum gross income for Thomas of $75,000 was against public policy and unenforceable. The provision requiring Thomas to maintain business records was also deemed unenforceable. Based on Thomas' imputed income of $52,500 per year and Jaime's annual income of $162,750.16, the hearing officer ordered Jaime to pay Thomas $2,167 per month in child support and filed a child support worksheet in support. The worksheet indicates that the hearing officer used the extended income formula to calculate Jaime's child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jaime filed a motion for review, asking the district court to review the hearing officer's child support order. In her motion, Jaime argued: (1) The provision requiring Thomas to maintain business records was valid and nonmodifiable; (2) the stipulation that Thomas' gross income would be calculated at a minimum of $75,000 was an enforceable agreement; and (3) the hearing officer erred by using the extended income formula to calculate child support. Jaime sought the calculation of child support using the stipulation that Thomas' annual income was $75,000. She also sought attorney fees based upon her claim that Thomas breached the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court affirmed the hearing officer's child support rulings. In its ruling, the district court cited\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Schoby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103038\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/269/114/\">\n    269 Kan. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103038\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/269/114/\">\n    4 P.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), for the rule that \"[d]ivorced parents cannot legally reduce child support or terminate the obligation by a contractual agreement or otherwise.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    Schoby\n   </em>\n   and three out-of-state cases, the district court adopted the hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jaime filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   GENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO SEPARATION AGREEMENTS AND CHILD SUPPORT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A district court has continuing jurisdiction to modify a child support order when the facts and circumstances make modification proper.\n   <em>\n    Schoby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103038\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/269/114/\">\n    269 Kan. at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response, Thomas argues this provision is not enforceable because it is against Kansas public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The hearing officer did not enforce this provision of the settlement agreement because-although it was important for Thomas to maintain records-due to his self-employed status, the hearing officer found the significant expense and burdens associated with hiring a CPA to analyze, keep, and maintain the specified records was cost-prohibitive. Moreover, as the hearing officer informed Thomas, \"I need you making money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On appeal, Jaime suggests the hearing officer and district court did not have jurisdiction to modify the Agreement. However, the records provision was written to provide a financial basis to calculate child support, and the provision is found in the section of the Agreement entitled \"Agreements and Stipulations for Future Modification of Child Support.\" We are persuaded this provision of the Agreement was pertaining to child support, and, therefore, appropriately within the jurisdiction of the hearing officer and district court. See K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 23-2712(a) and (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Our reading of the record indicates the hearing officer, while not enforcing the Agreement's provision for collection of voluminous, detailed records and source documents with periodic analysis by a CPA, did emphasize the necessity for Thomas to maintain essential records to prove his income and expenses for purposes of future child support modifications. Given the obvious expense of complying with this provision, and the need for Thomas to limit expenses because of his self-employment, we are unable to conclude that this discretionary judgment was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   FAILURE TO ENFORCE THE STIPULATION REGARDING THOMAS' MINIMUM INCOME\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Jaime next contends the district court erred when it refused to apply the provision in the Agreement that stipulated that Thomas' gross domestic income would be calculated at a minimum of $75,000 a year. Thomas responds that this stipulation was not in the best interests of the children and was unenforceable as against public policy.

The parties further stipulate and agree that the sole basis for Husband's gross domestic income to be determined to be less than the sum of $75,000.00 it would require the Court to determine that Husband is disabled or unable to be gainfully employed due to a serious injury or illness.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The KCSG provides the basis for establishing and reviewing child support orders, including cases settled by agreement of the parties.

Instead of enforcing the stipulation, the hearing officer, after being informed of all the circumstances, imputed a wage of $52,500 for Thomas' income. Although this income was higher than Thomas' actual earnings as stated in his income tax returns, additional wages were imputed because Thomas was working less than 40 hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As mentioned earlier, parties to a divorce may not alter by agreement the amount of child support payments made to the parent with primary custody of the children.\n   <em>\n    Schoby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103038\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/269/114/\">\n    269 Kan. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The calculations of parental child support obligations under the guidelines creates a rebuttable presumption of a reasonable child support order. KCSG \u00a7 I.

For example, in this case the hearing officer calculated Thomas' domestic gross income at $48,791-the $52,500 imputed gross income minus $3,709 in reasonable business expenses. After computing child support and applying a parenting time adjustment, Jaime's child support obligation was set at $2,167 a month and Thomas' obligation was fixed at $1,239 a month. When using the same expenditures and parenting time adjustment but imputing to Thomas $75,000 annual domestic gross income, Jaime's child support obligation would be $2,065 a month and Thomas' obligation would be $1,618 a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although applying the stipulation would result in a higher total child support obligation, this methodology violates public policy by reducing Jaime's child support obligation while envisioning that Thomas will pay the discrepancy in child support with a wage higher than he actually receives.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Child support has three purposes: (1) to protect the well-being of the child; (2) to enforce the social consensus that both parents have a support obligation; and (3) to limit the size of the gap between the child's standard of living and the higher standard of living of the support obligor.\" 2 Elrod, Kansas Law and Practice: Kansas Family Law \u00a7 14:1 (2018-2019 ed.).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In our view, the stipulation of Thomas' minimum gross domestic income violates the first and third purposes of child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, the stipulation has the potential to harm the well-being of the children. If the stipulation was followed, Jaime would pay less in child support obligations. While Thomas' portion of child support would be greater, the expectation that Thomas should provide this increased support is based on an overstated income not reflected in reality. As a consequence, the children could be placed in financial jeopardy because Jaime would pay less in child support, and Thomas-the child support obligee-would be unable to provide his portion of child support. Importantly, Kansas public policy prevents child support from being reduced by agreement of the parents.\n   <em>\n    Schoby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103038\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/269/114/\">\n    269 Kan. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 1. Although the guidelines allow income to be imputed in some instances, this is not an appropriate circumstance like those identified in KCSG \u00a7 II.F.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, the stipulation also violates the purpose of child support to limit the size of the gap between the children's standard of living and the higher standard of living of the support obligor. Although the parties have shared residential custody, the children spend more time with Thomas. By reducing Jaime's support obligation and increasing Thomas' obligation with no corresponding increase in Thomas' income, the gap between the children's standard of living at Thomas' residence and the higher standard of living of the support obligor increases. A large gap in the wealth and standard of living between two parents may result in one parent having financial superiority over the other, leading to conflict between the parents and undue pressure on the child.

Additionally, the stipulation was unenforceable as against public policy. We conclude that the district court did not err by refusing to enforce the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   APPLICATION OF THE EXTENDED INCOME FORMULA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, Jaime contends the district court erred in calculating child support by applying the extended income formula. According to Jaime, the district court failed to consider what support should be awarded above the highest amount on the child support schedules and, instead, automatically applied the extended income formula. Thomas responds that this issue is not properly raised for the first time on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Our court reviews a district court's order determining the amount of child support for an abuse of discretion, while the district court's interpretation and application of the KCSG is subject to unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416705\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/49/952/#p954\">\n    49 Kan.

KCSG \u00a7 App. II. If the combined income exceeds the highest amount shown on the schedules-$15,500 a month-the district court should exercise its discretion by considering what amount of child support should be set in addition to the highest amount on the schedule. KCSG \u00a7 III.B.3. (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 88). To assist the court in this discretionary task, the guidelines include a specific formula at the end of each child support schedule showing how to compute incomes above the amounts reflected in the schedules. KCSG \u00a7 App. II. This method of calculating child support when parental monthly income exceeds the amounts in the schedules is the extended income formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   During the hearing conducted by the hearing officer on Thomas' motion to modify child support, neither party discussed whether the extended income formula should apply or whether support above the highest amount on the schedule should be awarded. The hearing officer filed a journal entry with an attached child support worksheet that Thomas prepared. The worksheet revealed that the hearing officer used the extended income formula in calculating Jaime's $2,167 monthly child support obligation. There was no explanation, however, regarding the hearing officer's decision to employ the extended income formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   After the journal entry was filed, Jaime moved for review by the district court. In her motion for review, Jaime claimed the hearing officer erred by applying the extended income formula without considering the best interests of the children.

In her answer to Thomas' motion to modify child support, Jaime suggested the combined parental monthly income was above the highest amount on the schedules. And during the hearing on Thomas' motion, both parties acknowledged that the combined parental monthly income was above $17,000 and above the highest amount listed on the schedules.

First, neither party brought an action for enforcement, breach, or clarification of the Agreement. Instead, Thomas filed an action to modify child support and Jaime invoked provisions in the Agreement to defend against the modification action. As a result, this litigation did not trigger the provision mandating payment of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, Jaime was not entitled to attorney fees under this provision because she is not the \"prevailing party\" in the action. \"With respect to the specific question of attorney fees, it has been stated a prevailing party is the person who has an affirmative judgment rendered in his or her favor at the conclusion of the entire case.\"\n   <em>\n    Curo Enterprises v.

The terms of the attorney fees provision do not permit an award of attorney fees under the circumstances, and regardless, Jaime did not prevail on appeal. Finally, while attorney fees may be awarded \"as justice and equity require\" under K.S.A. 2018 Supp. 23-2715, given our holding, we are unable to make those findings in order to award Jaime appellate attorney fees in this case.
