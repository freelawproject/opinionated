On appeal, he avers that the information charging him with the offense was constitutionally defective in that it did not include all of the elements of the offense of robbery in the second degree. He also perceives error in the absence of a jury instruction on the defense of good faith claim of title. Finally, he asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not propose a good faith claim of title instruction. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Clifford Van Horne, night manager at a Red Apple Market in Seattle, saw Earl Phillips enter the store, select a case of 18 beer bottles from the refrigerator, and walk past the store's checkout counter without paying for the item. Van Horne followed Phillips past the counter. Accosting Phillips as he was leaving the building, Van Horne grabbed the case of beer and told Phillips to return the\n   item. Phillips attempted to strike Van Horne, but Van Horne ducked and was not hit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Oscar Cerrillo, a store cashier on duty at the time, also saw Phillips attempt to leave without paying for the beer. Cerrillo followed Van Horne and attempted to assist him in the physical struggle with Phillips. Phillips, for his part, pushed back and refused to surrender the beer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Phillips insisted that he had a receipt for the item, but both Van Horne and Cerrillo, having seen him bypass the checkout counter without paying for it, did not believe him. Both employees told Phillips that he would be free to go upon relinquishment of the beer, but Phillips did not yield. As this struggle was ongoing, the case of beer fell to the ground, breaking some of the glass bottles within.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 At this point, Troy Jenks, a regular customer at the Red Apple, drove into the store's parking lot and saw the two employees scuffling with Phillips. Jenks was able to restrain Phillips and held him on the ground while Van Horne left to telephone the police. While he was being restrained by Jenks, Phillips bit Jenks's bicep with sufficient force to puncture the skin. Jenks continued to restrain Phillips until the police arrived on the scene. Upon arrival, Seattle Police Officer Nathan Bertsch searched Phillips and did not find a receipt for purchase of the beer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Phillips was charged with robbery in the second degree and assault in the third degree. The information charging Phillips with robbery in the second degree stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   That the defendant Earl Ray Phillips in King County, Washington, on or about February 8, 2017, did unlawfully and with intent to commit theft take personal property of another, to-wit: merchandise, from the person and in the presence of Clifford Van Horne and Oscar [Cerrillo], who had an ownership, representative, or possessory interest in that property, against his will, by the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence and fear of injury to such person or his property and to the person or property of another;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Contrary to RCW 9A.56.210 and 9A.56.190, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 At the close of the trial, the jury found Phillips guilty on both counts. However, prior to sentencing, Phillips moved for a new trial based on his trial counsel's failure to propose a jury instruction on self-defense. The trial court granted the motion only as to Phillips's conviction for assault in the third degree. The State chose not to retry the assault charge and it was dismissed. The trial court imposed a standard range sentence of 70 months of incarceration on the robbery conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Phillips first contends that the information charging him with robbery in the second degree was constitutionally deficient. This is so, he avers, because it did not specifically state that he had used force or fear to obtain or retain possession of the property at issue. We disagree with his contention that this is an essential element of robbery such that its omission amounted to constitutional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Pursuant to both the Constitution of the United States and the Washington Constitution, an accused has a right to be informed of the criminal charges against him or her to enable adequate preparation of a defense.

In response, the State asserts that this sentence is merely definitional and exists only to explain the \"transactional\" understanding of how robbery occurs, and not to broaden the elements of robbery set forth in the first sentence. Given that Phillips did not raise this issue in the trial court, we apply the standard of review set forth in\n   <em>\n    Kjorsvik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1373973\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/117/93/#p106\">\n    117 Wash.2d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=812%20P.2d%2086\">\n    812 P.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we must first determine whether the language of the amended information included all of the essential elements of the crime of robbery in the second degree. This requires us to explicate the essential elements of that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Washington law incorporates a \"transactional\" view of the crime of robbery, meaning that a robbery need not involve the use of force in the initial taking of property but, rather, may involve the use of force to retain property already taken or to impede the rightful owner's efforts to retrieve it.\n   <em>\n    State v. Handburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/284/#p293\">\n    119 Wash.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20P.2d%20641\">\n    830 P.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).

There, a man who used force to effect an escape only after abandoning stolen property was held not to have committed robbery. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court's unchallenged findings of fact state that Johnson was trying to escape when he punched the security guard in the nose. And the trial court concluded that even though Johnson did not use force to obtain or retain the property, he was guilty of the crime because the transactional view of robbery includes force used during an escape. But as noted above, the force must relate to the taking or retention of the property, either as force used directly in the taking or retention or as force used to prevent or overcome resistance \"to the taking.\" Johnson was not attempting to retain the property when he punched the guard but was attempting to escape after abandoning it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3766201\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/155/609/\">\n    155 Wash.2d at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20P.3d%2091\">\n    121 P.3d 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 This decision makes clear the relationship between the first and second sentences of RCW 9A.56.190. The first sentence, which sets forth the statutory elements of robbery, includes the element of \"the use or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury.\" The second sentence defines \"force,\" and \"fear,\" as used in sentence one.\n   <em>\n    \"Such force or fear\n   </em>\n   must be used to obtain or retain possession of the property, or to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking; in either of which cases the degree of force is immaterial.\" (Emphasis added.) It also defines to \"obtain\" or \"retain\" as a form of \"take,\" as used in sentence one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 Similarly, the third sentence, which begins, \"Such taking ...\" is plainly referencing and defining the word \"takes,\" as used in sentence one. It is definitional and does not broaden the statutory elements of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Our view that the statutory elements of robbery are set forth in the first sentence while sentences two and three are mere definitional statements is supported by Supreme Court precedent. In\n   <em>\n    Handburgh\n   </em>\n   , the court discussed the interplay between sentences one and two, concluding that \"a forceful retention of stolen property in the owner's presence is the type of 'taking' contemplated by the robbery statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370256\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/284/#p293\">\n    119 Wash.2d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=830%20P.2d%20641\">\n    830 P.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a \"retention\" is a type of \"taking.\" A \"retention\" is not different from a \"taking.\" A \"retention\" is included within a \"taking.\" A \"retention\" is not in addition to, or an alternative to, a \"taking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 Seven years ago, we were called on to resolve a sufficiency of the evidence challenge to a conviction of robbery in the first degree.\n   <em>\n    Truong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027279\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/168/529/#p535\">\n    168 Wash.

To the contrary, his present assertion of a good faith claim of title defense is that he first selected the case of beer, then paid for it at a checkout stand, and then was accosted as he was leaving the store. But this scenario, if accepted by the jury, establishes a defense to the robbery. It does not establish the defense of good faith claim of title. If the jury believed that Phillips paid for the beer after obtaining it then there would be no theft of the beer and, hence, no robbery. The good faith claim of title defense would be surplusage-simply unnecessary. However, if the jury did not believe that Phillips paid for the beer there would be a theft-and no good faith claim of title defense.
