We hold that a termination based on fifteen-months' out-of-home placement requires the court to consider the totality of the circumstances throughout the dependency when determining whether the Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") made a diligent effort to provide appropriate reunification services, including whether DCS's failure to act reasonably and diligently contributed to the circumstances causing the child to remain in out-of-home placement. We further hold that a request through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (\"ICPC\") is not required when the evidence does not support a dependency concerning the out-of-state parent. Given the absence of evidence in this case, we vacate the termination judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Donald W. (\"Father\") met Q'Nique T. (\"Mother\") in Sacramento, California, where they lived together for a short time. After discovering she was pregnant, Mother moved to Arizona. Given the brevity of the relationship, Father was unsure if he was the biological father of Mother's unborn child. He told Mother that if he was the child's father, he wanted to parent the child. Father maintained contact with Mother until October 2014. Father later discovered that Mother had married someone else around the time she stopped communicating with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Mother gave birth to Melody in Arizona on December 5, 2014. DCS took custody of Melody from the hospital the next day and placed her in foster care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DCS filed a dependency petition regarding Melody naming Mother, her husband, and a John Doe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On January 2, 2015, Mother reached out to Father for the first time since October 2014 and told him that her husband was Melody's father. Skeptical, Father called Mother's husband, who informed him Melody was in DCS's custody. On January 3, 2015, Father called the assigned DCS case manager, Lucero Garcia, explaining that he believed he was Melody's father and requested a paternity test. The case manager told him that the judge would have to award him a paternity test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    The Dependency Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 DCS amended the dependency petition to include Father. After alleging that Father was not married to Mother and had not\n   established paternity, the amended petition read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Father is unable to parent due to neglect. Father is unable to provide his child with the basic necessities of life, including, food, clothing, shelter and support.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. Father has abandoned his child. Father has failed to maintain a normal parental relationship without just cause. Father has failed to send cards, gifts, letters or child support since the child's birth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The case manager signed the verification, swearing to the veracity of the petition's contents. In the amended petition, DCS requested the court issue a judgment of paternity, but it only included Mother's assertion that her husband was Melody's father and did not mention that Father had contacted DCS believing he was Melody's father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 On March 9, 2015, the court held Father's initial dependency hearing, where he denied the unfitness allegations in the petition. At the hearing, the court ordered DCS to conduct a paternity test and scheduled a dependency hearing for May. The results of the paternity test, dated April 15, 2015, confirmed Father was Melody's father. Immediately following receipt of the test results, Father, to show the court that he cared about his child and wanted custody of Melody, enrolled in a thirteen-week parenting class, which he completed in August 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 Although the child had been in DCS custody from birth, after the dependency hearing the court found \"[Melody] is dependent as to [Father] based on inability to parent due to neglect and abandonment.\" The court set the case plan as \"family reunification concurrent with severance and adoption.\" DCS stated that once Father was on the birth certificate, it would submit an ICPC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 27, 2015, DCS filed its notice of lodging the order of paternity, which the court issued two weeks later. By this time, Melody was seven months old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Sometime in the summer of 2015, DCS initiated an ICPC with California. In November 2015, the court held a review hearing, where it addressed the pending ICPC, directed DCS to provide a written transition plan to move Melody to California with Father, and found Melody continued to be dependent. The ICPC report, dated December 2015, was favorable to placement with Father. The ICPC social worker in California interviewed Father in his home, then separately interviewed his ex-wife, children, and a friend. The report noted that Father's ex-wife stated: \"[he] was a good father, who cares and provides for his children.\" After interviewing Father's children at their school, the social worker further noted that \"[i]t is obvious that [the children] feel loved and cared for by their father and that he is very involved in their lives.\" The ICPC concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Father] had good references and all stated that [he] is an excellent parent to his children. From observation it appears that he has a positive relationship with his children and they look to him for attention and affection. [Father] was the non offending parent and has been diligent in seeking custody from the court in Arizona.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Placement of the child, [Melody], with [Father], is approved. Please send a [Form] 100(B), confirming the ICPC placement of the child with the father. Please include any additional requests for services from Sacramento County, including courtesy supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Early in the dependency, Father asked DCS for the foster placement's contact information because he wanted to check on Melody. DCS refused and did not allow Father to have contact with the foster mother until Melody was almost one year old. DCS then gave Father the foster mother's email address, and the two began communicating weekly with updates and exchanging pictures of Melody. In January 2016, DCS finally allowed Father to have contact with Melody, and he began sending \"Glide videos.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father recorded and sent the video messages to the foster mother's phone. She showed the videos to Melody and recorded messages from Melody to send back to Father. Father and the foster mother established a routine of exchanging Glide videos several times a day, which they continued throughout the dependency proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 Although California sent DCS the ICPC approval letter in December 2015, during the February 2016 review hearing, the case manager stated incorrectly that the ICPC had only been \"verbally approved.\" Again, the juvenile court found Melody continued to be dependent. Father attended the February 2016 hearing and anticipated visiting Melody for the first time in person while in Arizona. Because DCS failed to communicate with Father regarding a visit before the hearing, no visit was scheduled. However, Father was able to see Melody for one hour at a fast-food restaurant with the foster mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 In April 2016, the case manager finally emailed Father a transition plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Just to reiterate our conversation from today. You will try to come out twice a month if possible to Arizona to visit Melody as much as you can. You will also begin calling Melody every Monday, Wednesday, Fridays [sic] and Sunday at 630pm. The phone call should be about 5-10 minutes. This way Melody gets to know your voice and also recognize it. Lastly, you will notify me at least two weeks in advance when you plan to visit Melody so that I can submit a case aide request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Father began calling Melody as directed. In addition, he continued to exchange the Glide videos, and he rented a car and drove his mother, father, and son to Arizona for a weekend visit to meet Melody. In the June 2016 DCS Report, while still reporting that \"[Father] will need to be further assessed to determine appropriate services,\" the case manager stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [I have] attempted to coordinate with [Father] to set up a transition plan for [Melody] to be moved into his care, however he has failed to follow through with the transition plan. [DCS] no longer believes that it is in the child's best interest to place her in the care of his [sic] father as he does not appear to be committed in the reunification process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 On July 12, 2016, DCS moved to terminate Father's rights based on abandonment and fifteen months' time-in-care. At the time of the motion, Melody was 19 months old, and DCS was still making efforts to locate an adoptive placement. Despite DCS moving for termination, Father continued to visit Melody when he was financially able and consistently communicated with her through Glide videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 When reviewing the case plan in September 2016, the Foster Care Review Board expressed its concern with the case manager's lack of communication. It reported that she was not present for the review; attempts to contact the case manager and her supervisor were unsuccessful; and she failed to provide a current case plan document for review. The Board determined \"there are significant service gaps or system problems\" and it was \"unable to conduct a thorough review\" because it had \"inadequate information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 By October 2016, DCS closed the ICPC because there had \"not been any progress made toward transitioning Melody to [Father].\" The October 2016 DCS Report stated that because Father had only visited Melody twice, he \"[did] not appear to be\n   interested in reunifying with his daughter.\" In April 2017, when Melody was two and a half years old, the juvenile court ordered Father to complete a Bonding/Best Interest Evaluation (\"Bonding Assessment\"), which was conducted by Dr. Mary Oakley on June 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    July 2017 Termination Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 The court heard evidence on DCS's termination motion in July 2017 (\"2017 Hearing\"). At the hearing, the case manager testified that DCS wanted once-a-month visits at first, then intended to increase the number of required visits before reunification even though Father \"had indicated that he had money issues, financially, and he wasn't able to complete\" once-a-month visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 At the hearing, the case manager was asked why DCS had not sent Melody to California to visit Father. She stated: \"Because we just can't send the child out there. We know-that's not the process. We normally increase contact with the parents.\" The court questioned whether DCS had a program to offer financial assistance to out-of-state parents. The case manager responded: \"Not that I know of, no.\" When asked if DCS could have moved Melody into a California placement to be closer to Father, she responded: \"I don't believe so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 After hearing the evidence, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   I'm sad to hear that this case has been going on for all this period of time .... But I don't think ... if you're [in] a long-distance situation, [and] you could only afford to come once a month or once every two months, [too] bad, we're going to sever your child from you. I don't think that was what was intended [under the time-in-care statute].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The court concluded it could not \"sever rights, because people are poor\" and denied DCS's motion for termination. The court then ordered DCS to (1) \"staff with the unit psychologist regarding all factors in this matter including father's financial status to develop a transition plan\"; (2) provide transportation for Father's visits, including airfare and transportation to and from the airport and the visitation center to see Melody; and (3) have the visits occur once a month, pending the opinion of the unit psychologist and the transition plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b618 DCS objected to paying for Father's airfare, stating it \"is the most expensive way\" and that DCS does not have \"unlimited resources.\" However, the court determined, \"as [the case manager] stated, it's a long drive from Sacramento,\" and flying was the most reasonable option. The court held that the \"option needs to at least be tried\" because \"I cannot, in good conscience, say ... you're too poor, so we're going to sever you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b619 DCS booked and paid for Father's visit in September 2017, which he attended. But DCS failed to produce the court-ordered transition plan. The October 2017 DCS Report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [The case manager] has also consulted with the unit consultant to come up with a transition plan to transition [Melody] into father's care, however the unit psychologist indicated that this needed to be done with the assigned evaluator that completed the [Bonding Assessment] as she had more knowledge as to the relationship between the father and child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Before Father's October 2017 visit, the court held a review hearing and ordered Father to increase his visits to weekly, six hours on Saturday and six hours on Sunday. DCS again objected to purchasing Father's airfare, and the court modified the order to allow DCS to reimburse Father upon arrival. Accordingly, Father purchased the airfare for the last weekend of October 2017 and the first weekend in November 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b620 When Father arrived for his October visit, DCS did not immediately reimburse him as the court ordered it to do. Instead, on November 1, 2017, DCS moved to modify the court's order, this time requesting permission to reimburse Father within three weeks of receiving his claim to allow for approval and processing. Father arrived for his November 6, 2017 visit before the court ruled on DCS's motion. Again, DCS did not reimburse Father on arrival. On November 21, 2017, the court granted DCS's motion, vacated the October order, and ordered DCS to reimburse Father \"for his travel expenses up to three\n   weeks after [DCS] receives a receipt for the purchase of travel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b621 DCS failed to reimburse Father within the three weeks per the court order. Because of the out-of-pocket expense and reimbursement delay, Father was no longer able to afford to travel to Arizona for the weekly visits, and he canceled the visits scheduled for the remainder of November. In the DCS Report dated January 26, 2018, the case manager acknowledged that \"[Father] also reported that he was waiting to get the flight refunds from DCS so that he could book another flight.\" She testified that she did not know how long it took for Father to receive reimbursement checks, and there had been a \"lack of communication\" that caused \"an issue.\" In February 2018, DCS again moved to terminate the parent-child relationship based on fifteen months' out-of-home placement. By then, Melody was a little over three years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    July 2018 Termination Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b622 The juvenile court held a second termination trial in July 2018 (\"2018 Hearing\"). The termination motion cited Father's \"unstable employment,\" which it stated \"ha[d] been a frequent problem since the beginning of this case,\" that Father \"ha[d] been unable to demonstrate an ability to parent the child,\" and that \"Father ha[d] failed to establish and maintain a normal parental relationship with his child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b623 The court found that Father's \"substantial failure to engage in visitation\" was the circumstance that was currently causing Melody to remain in out-of-home placement, and that, despite DCS's reimbursement of Father's travel expenses, he had not been able to remedy the circumstance. The court additionally found that termination was in Melody's best interests, and granted DCS's motion to terminate the parent-child relationship. Melody was three and a half years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b624 Father timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235(A) and Arizona Rule of Procedure for the Juvenile Court 103(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b625 The juvenile court terminated the parent-child relationship under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8)(c), which requires DCS to establish by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) Melody had been in court-ordered out-of-home placement for at least fifteen months; (2) DCS made a \"diligent effort to provide appropriate reunification services\"; but despite that effort, (3) Father had been unable to remedy the circumstance causing Melody to be in court-ordered out-of-home care; and (4) there was \"a substantial likelihood that [Father would] not be capable of exercising proper and effective parental care and control in the near future.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberto F. v.

Because the court did not identify the \"circumstance\" causing the out-of-home placement,\n   <em>\n    both the origin and any cause arising during the dependency\n   </em>\n   , the court was unable to properly conclude that: DCS had made a diligent effort to provide appropriate reunification services (\"diligent efforts\"); Father was unable to remedy the circumstance; and Father was unlikely to be able to parent effectively in the near future. After reviewing Father's and DCS's actions throughout the three and a half years Melody was in DCS's custody, we hold that no one could reasonably find the evidence supporting the statutory grounds for termination to be clear and convincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Court-Ordered Out-of-Home Placement Was Based on a Factually Deficient Dependency Petition and Insufficient Evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b627 The first issue that must be reviewed under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8) is the\n   \"circumstance\" causing out-of-home placement. Because the substantive statutory grounds are \"synonymous with unfitness,\" as \"[t]hey address the most serious instances of parental abuse, neglect, or incapacity,\" the reason causing out-of-home placement must be one that indicates parental unfitness.\n   <em>\n    Alma S. v.

The juvenile court has the authority to place a\n   <em>\n    dependent\n   </em>\n   child in out-of-home care only if placing the child \"with the child's parents is contrary to the child's welfare.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 8-845(A). A dependent child is defined by A.R.S. \u00a7 8-201(15). Generally, a dependent child lacks a parent willing and able to exercise proper and effective parental care and control, or in other words, lacks a fit parent. A.R.S. \u00a7 8-201(15)(a)(i). Nothing in the record supports a finding that Melody is, or has ever been, dependent as to Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Court Ordered Out-of-Home Placement Was Based on a Factually Deficient and Unsupportable Petition.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b628 Relating to Father, the primary cause of Melody's out-of-home care was the court's dependency finding in May 2015. At that time, no evidence showed that Father was an unfit parent, or that living with Father was contrary to Melody's welfare. Melody had been in DCS's custody since birth. Father contacted DCS when Melody was less than one month old. Nevertheless, without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   investigation, DCS filed a petition alleging that Melody was dependent due to abuse or neglect as to Father. DCS claimed that \"Father is unable to parent due to neglect. Father is unable to provide his child with the basic necessities of life, including, food, clothing, shelter and support,\" and \"Father has abandoned his child. Father has failed to maintain a normal parental relationship without just cause. Father has failed to send cards, gifts, letters or child support since the child's birth.\" The petition did not state any facts supporting these conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-841(B)(3) (the dependency petition must include \"[a] concise statement of the facts to support the conclusion that the child is dependent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b629 Under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-201(25)(a), \"neglect\" is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [t]he inability or unwillingness of a parent ... of a child to provide that child with supervision, food, clothing, shelter or medical care if that inability or unwillingness causes unreasonable risk of harm to the child's health or welfare[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   And under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-201(1), \"abandoned\" means\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   the failure of the parent to provide reasonable support and to maintain regular contact with the child, including providing normal supervision.

It is often difficult ... for the unwed father to provide support or supervision, or to even maintain contact.

The petition's generic assertions failed to support the conclusion that an out-of-state parent-seeking to establish paternity of a less than one-month-old child, who has been in DCS custody since birth-abused, neglected, or abandoned the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-841(B)(3) (the dependency petition must include \"[a] concise statement of the facts to support the conclusion that the child is dependent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b630 Moreover, the record is devoid of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence supporting the unfitness allegations in the petition, a fact DCS acknowledged at oral argument before this court. Mother had lived with Father in Sacramento, where the couple conceived Melody. Mother decided to move to Arizona. Even so, Father proactively maintained contact with Mother and told her he wanted to be involved in parenting the child. Mother ended the communication with Father once she married. Despite Mother's deception in telling Father that he was not\n   Melody's father, he called Mother's husband, found out Melody was in DCS's care, and immediately contacted DCS requesting a paternity test. The case manager told Father to contact the juvenile court, which he did. Father diligently complied with the ordered paternity test, appeared for the hearings, participated in parenting classes, and contested the allegations in the dependency petition.

Therefore, it wanted to set up a plan with Father to ensure that Melody transitioned smoothly into Father's care. Although a transition plan may be ideal, DCS's authority is governed by statute. DCS, again, has not provided this court with any authority that allows it to withhold a child from a fit parent until it creates and institutes a transition plan. It is undisputed that in December 2015, Melody had a parent willing and able to provide the necessary care. Thus, at that point, Melody was not dependent, and the court lacked authority to continue Melody's out-of-home dependency for DCS's transition plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

DCS had no evidence that Father was unfit and failed to act before pursuing a dependency to resolve its unfounded concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Emoni W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20A.3d%201\">\n    48 A.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than making diligent efforts to transition Melody to Father's care, DCS chose to undertake an eight-month investigation into whether Father was fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b653 The April 2015 DCS Report stated that DCS would submit an ICPC. In the May 2015 hearing, the court asked DCS whether the ICPC was underway. DCS said that the ICPC would be sent after Father was placed on Melody's birth certificate. Yet, DCS did not lodge the order of paternity for nearly two months after paternity was presumed-which was four months after Father requested a paternity test. The case manager testified that she \"believed\" she had submitted the ICPC in the summer of 2015. Because of Melody's age-and because Father is Melody's parent-Father was eligible for a priority placement ICPC, requiring the receiving agency to complete the request within 20 business days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICPC Regulation 7(9)(e); DCS Pol'y &amp; Proc., Overview of ICPC, Ch. 5, \u00a7 39 (DCS may request the court order a priority ICPC when the child is under four years old). DCS did not request a priority placement ICPC and unnecessarily delayed its investigation of Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    b. DCS Failed to Make a Diligent Effort By Instituting a Transition Plan That Had No Likelihood of Success.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b654 The approved ICPC did not result in immediate unification. The case manager testified at the 2018 Termination Hearing that \"[California] wanted us to do a transition\n   process for Melody but that never got completed, so then [the ICPC] ultimately was denied.\" Without any factual basis, DCS blamed Father's \"lack of commitment to Melody,\" for the unsuccessful unification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b655 The record refutes the case manager's claims that the ICPC approval was conditional, or that California ultimately denied it. Other than the ICPC approval letter, DCS had no communication with California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DCS Pol'y &amp; Proc., ICPC Placements, Ch. 5, \u00a7 41 (all significant verbal communication with the sending or receiving agency should be documented). The language in the letter was conclusive: \"Placement of the child ... is approved. Please send a [Form ICPC-100(B) ], confirming the ICPC placement of [Melody] with [Father].\" Once the ICPC is approved, \"[i]t is up to the\n   <em>\n    sending entity\n   </em>\n   ... to decide if and when to place the child.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The October 2016 DCS Report stated that the \"ICPC packet has now been\n   <em>\n    closed\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) DCS's attorney later admitted that California had not denied the 2015 ICPC; instead, DCS allowed it to lapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b656 DCS maintains that the circumstance that caused Melody to remain in out-of-home placement was the perceived lack of a bond between Melody and Father. Because Melody was uneasy around people that she did not know, DCS claimed it \"implemented a transition plan that would allow Father to build a relationship with [Melody] in anticipation of her moving to his care.\" Why DCS required any transition plan after the initial ICPC is unclear. Melody was not in an adoptive placement, and she could have been removed from the foster mother's care at any time for a variety of reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b657 DCS expressed concern that Melody and Father lacked a bond in November 2015-even before the results of the ICPC were known-and before it permitted contact between Father and Melody. In response to DCS's concern, the court directed DCS \"to provide a written transition plan of Melody to the father\" at that time. Five months later, the case manager finally sent Father an email that DCS refers to as the transition plan. The email suggested-but did not require-Father \"try to come out twice a month to Arizona to visit Melody as much as [he] can,\" and to \"begin calling Melody\" for 5-10 minutes, four times a week for Melody to \"get[ ] to know [Father's] voice and also recognize it.\" To support Father in completion of the transition, the case manager testified that DCS also offered supervised visitation if he was able to come to Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b658 The in-person visitation plan lacked any prospect of success. Father told the case manager that he would only be able to visit \"every four months ... so [he could] save enough money to actually be able to come out ....\" and \"make sure that [his] bills [were] taken care of.\" Father testified that DCS told him \"that's going to be a problem,\" but he did not believe there was \"any leeway\" and understood DCS's position to be \"do this or ... you don't see your daughter.\" The case manager confirmed that DCS was aware that \"he had money issues ... and he [wouldn't be] able to complete [the plan].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b659 However, DCS did not modify the visitation recommendation, work with Father to establish a plan with which Father could comply, or attempt to send Melody to California to visit Father. The case manager testified that she did not try to secure financial assistance for Father's visits, and she was not aware if DCS offered such services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Riva M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6036099\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/235/403/#p414\">\n    235 Cal.

Father did travel to Arizona to visit Melody twice between March and June 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b660 Although DCS maintains that Father should have engaged in a calling plan to successfully bond with Melody, other than hearing his voice, it is not clear what DCS hoped to accomplish by requiring him to make several phone calls per week with a child who was only one and a half years old. Even at the time of the 2017 Hearing-when Melody was two and a half years old-the\n   case manager testified that \"she kind of babbles on, because she can't really say a lot of words right now\" and admitted that phone calls with an infant were \"almost of [no] value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b661 In the June 2016 DCS Report-within three months of sending the transition-plan email-DCS stated that it \"no longer believe[d] that it [was] in the child's best interest to place her in the care of his [sic] father as he does not appear to be committed in the reunification process\" and recommended changing the case plan to severance and adoption. In its subsequent termination motion, DCS falsely claimed that \"Father ha[d] failed to keep most of the weekly appointments for telephonic contact with the child.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b662 The foster mother reported that Father missed only five calls of the fifty days on which Father would have been scheduled to call in that period. More importantly, Father was establishing a relationship with Melody in the best way he could under the circumstances. In addition to the scheduled telephone calls, Father and the foster mother-without the assistance of DCS-developed their routine of sending the Glide videos every morning and night to accommodate both of their schedules. Because of the Glide videos, Melody was able to acknowledge Father's face and voice. Melody responded to Father's Glide videos by saying \"hi daddy,\" \"babbling,\" and sending him kisses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    2. DCS Failed to Make a Diligent Effort By Failing to Communicate With Father When It Perceived that His Efforts Were Deficient.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b663 DCS's plan lacked justification, and the case manager acknowledged that the requirements were \"not feasible\" for Father, yet DCS failed to help Father comply. Consequently, the plan was guaranteed to increase Melody's time in the out-of-home placement, which strengthened Melody's attachment to the foster mother, and created a circumstance Father could not remedy effectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b664 Although DCS's July 2016 motion for termination alleged that the lack of a bond precluded Father from being able to care for Melody, DCS did not commission Dr. Oakley to perform the Bonding Assessment until immediately before the July 2017 Hearing, almost one year later. By then, Dr. Oakley observed that Melody had a \"strong attachment to [the foster mother],\" and concluded that, if removed from the foster mother's care, Melody \"may incur long-term negative effects.\" She opined that although \"distance [was] why [Father] ha[d] not spent more time with [Melody],\" \"the longer [Melody was] out of [Father's] home, the harder it [would] be for her to transition from her home with [the foster mother].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b665 Based on Dr. Oakley's assessment, DCS maintained that the lack of a bond-a situation it had effectively created-could be remedied only by frequent in-person visitation. DCS argued that termination was appropriate because \"we don't know whether Father is willing to relocate to establish a relationship. And we don't know how long that would take as well.\" The case manager testified that Glide videos-which Father had been consistently sending daily for over a year and a half-were not interactive like \"Skype\" and were insufficient for creating and maintaining a \"normal parent-child relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b666 DCS failed to inform Father of the deficiencies it perceived with his compliance with the case plan and did not allow Father to satisfy its requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberto F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p56\">\n    232 Ariz. at 56, \u00b6 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p56\">\n    301 P.3d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"fault ... lies with [DCS], not Father\" when DCS fails to inform him that his attempt to satisfy the case plan failed or is deficient). Father testified that he used Glide to communicate because Melody was unable to use the phone on her own, and, although he attempted to use other video chat services, the foster mother was familiar only with Glide and Father was limited to what she knew how to use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b667 Even if Glide videos were somehow less effective than a \"more interactive chat,\" it was DCS's duty to communicate the purported deficiency to Father and to teach the foster mother how to use alternative methods or arrange for someone to facilitate the type of communication that it would consider acceptable. As it was, without the foster mother's\n   cooperation with Father, it is uncertain whether DCS would have facilitated any contact for Father and Melody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santosky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p753\">\n    455 U.S. at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p753\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Indeed, because the child is already in agency custody, the State even has the power to shape the historical events that form the basis for termination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court Erred By Considering Only DCS's Efforts in the Final Seven Months of the Time-in-Care, and By Finding that Those Efforts Were Diligent.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b668 By failing to consider the totality of the circumstances of the dependency, the court erroneously found that because \"DCS allowed visitation every weekend and paid for his travel from Sacramento to Arizona,\" DCS made a diligent effort; and \"[t]he failure of reunification [was] due to Father's failure to participate, not due to any failure by DCS.\" The conclusion was erroneous for two reasons. First, the court abused its discretion by only considering DCS's efforts in the final seven months of the more than three and a half years Melody was in DCS's custody. Second, the evidence does not support the finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Court Erred By Finding DCS Made Diligent Efforts Because It Failed to Consider DCS's Contribution to the Circumstances Existing at the Time of the Hearing.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b669 The court's order reflects a finding based solely on the services the court ordered following the 2017 Hearing. However, under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8), the court was required to examine not only the final months but the entire dependency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b670 From the finding of dependency in May 2015 until June 2016, the case plan was reunification. At that point-just 11 months after the dependency finding-DCS moved to change the plan to severance and adoption. After the July 2017 Hearing, the court reinstituted the reunification plan, but DCS again moved to change the plan to severance and adoption in February 2018. Although the case plan was reunification for a cumulative total of fifteen months, DCS failed to diligently provide appropriate services to remedy the circumstances as DCS believed them to be, and its intermittent efforts only undermined Father's efforts and prolonged the dependency. The juvenile court failed to consider these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b671 Examples of DCS's failure to follow the court's orders are numerous. In July 2017, the court ordered DCS to \"staff with the unit psychologist regarding all factors in this matter including father's financial status to develop a transition plan.\" The October 2017 DCS Report states that the unit psychologist recommended Dr. Oakley prepare the transition plan because she was familiar with Father and Melody's relationship. This result was anticipated and addressed in the 2017 Hearing and the court's order. But the two subsequent DCS Reports prepared before the 2018 Hearing made no mention of a transition plan. Nor did the case manager testify that one was created or in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b672 DCS failed to comply with the court's orders regarding providing Father airfare for his visits. Although Father purchased October and November airfare and sent receipts, DCS refused to reimburse Father for that travel upon his arrival in Arizona. Instead, on November 1, 2017, DCS again moved to modify the juvenile court's order, this time requesting that it be permitted to wait three weeks to reimburse Father to allow for approval and processing. Even after the court modified the order on November 21, 2017-based on the timeline and procedure DCS outlined in its motion-DCS failed to reimburse Father for the visits consistent with the court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b673 The case manager testified that when Father sent her the receipt, as he was directed, she forwarded it to the resource liaison who was responsible for getting him to fill out the documentation. The additional documentation was not mentioned in the court's order or DCS's motion. The case manager admitted that because of a lack of communication there was an issue with the reimbursement, and she did not know \"exactly how long it [took]\" for Father to receive payments. Father, however, testified reimbursement took between three to six months. He testified that he contacted his attorney and\n   DCS to follow up with the payment, which the January 2018 DCS Report confirmed. Nevertheless, in February 2018, DCS again moved to terminate the parent-child relationship citing\n   <em>\n    Father's failure\n   </em>\n   to visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Court Erred By Finding that Father's Failure to Visit More Frequently Indicated He Lacked Parental Fitness.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b674 Under A.R.S \u00a7 8-533(B)(8)(c), the court found that \"the circumstance[ ] existing now that ha[s] caused the Child to be in an out-of-home placement [is] Father's substantial failure to engage in visitation.\" The court supported its order for termination by finding that DCS's visitation requirement was reasonable considering Dr. Oakley's conclusion that Melody was strongly bonded to the foster mother. The court then found that Father had failed to remedy the bonding problem and would be unable to do so in the near future because (1) Father's visits had decreased since the Bonding Assessment; and (2) Father's reason \"to justify his failure to visit the Child more frequently was financial,\" but his \"reason lack[ed] credibility given that DCS reimburse[d] Father for his transportation costs.\" The record does not support the court's two findings regarding Father's alleged shortcomings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b675 First, Father's visits did not decrease after the Bonding Assessment. Neither side disputes that Father made more visits in the eight months following the Bonding Assessment than he did in the first two and a half years of Melody's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b676 Second, DCS failed to provide evidence establishing timely reimbursement of Father's travel costs. At the end of the hearing, the court requested reimbursement records because, it \"was not really addressed in DCS's testimony, and [the court] ha[d] no record of reimbursements and whether they occurred when he arrived.\" DCS's attorney apologized for not producing reimbursement records and stated that the \"case manager testified that the reimbursements were made.\" However, the case manager did not testify that the reimbursements were made. Of the four documented flights that Father made after the July 2017 court order, the case manager testified that DCS provided \"one or two of those flights.\" Regarding the remaining flights that Father purchased, she could testify only to what the court ordered, which was for DCS to reimburse within three weeks. She specifically testified that she did not know how long it took to reimburse Father. Father testified that \"[he] booked those tickets in advance, and [he] didn't get a reimbursement until ... three to six months later,\" which is supported by the case manager's testimony that a lack of communication had caused a delay in processing and the January 2018 DCS Report noting Father had not received payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b677 Ultimately, without evidence showing that DCS was reimbursing Father per the court order, Father's reason that he could not continue visiting was not a matter of credibility, just pure mathematics. DCS may not have unlimited resources, but Father's resources are demonstrably more limited. Father's income was approximately $2000 a month, he had $100 in savings, and he was living paycheck to paycheck. When traveling to Arizona, Father was responsible for his hotel, food, and \"supplies\" for Melody such as snacks and diapers. Had Father completed weekly visits, DCS procedures would have required Father to spend his entire monthly earnings on airfare and then wait for three to six months for reimbursement. Such a process does not consider how Father would be able to maintain his home and care for the other children in his care in California while waiting for the reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b678 The evidence shows, and the case manager admitted, that Father was complying with the court-ordered visitation before the court modified the reimbursement order. Without evidence establishing that DCS was reimbursing Father in a manner that allowed him to travel, the evidence does not support a finding that Father's failure to visit Melody was due to parental unfitness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maricopa County Juv.

The Court Erred By Finding That Father Was Not Able to Exercise Proper Care and Control.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b679 Finally, the court was required to find by clear and convincing evidence that \"there [was] a substantial likelihood that [Father would] not be capable of exercising proper and effective parental care and control in the near future.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8)(c). Again, the record lacks evidence that Father has\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   been incapable of parenting Melody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b680 The ICPC noted: Father's ex-wife stated \"[he] was a good father, who cares and provides for his children\"; it was \"obvious that [his children] feel loved and cared for by their father and that he is very involved in their lives\"; Father's references \"all stated that [he] is an excellent parent to his children\"; and the ICPC caseworker observed \"it appears that he has a positive relationship with his children and they look to him for attention and affection.\" The case manager testified that \"[Melody] does do well during scheduled visits with Father.\" Dr. Oakley reported that she saw no \"obvious risks\" with his parenting, Father likely had the skills to be an adequate parent, he appeared to care for Melody, he was appropriate with her, and Father seemed to be bonded to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b681 Moreover, under the circumstances, Father's inability to replicate the foster mother's bond with Melody does not show that he was \"not capable of exercising proper and effective parental care and control.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   In any severance proceeding, the material issue facing the court is whether a parent has the ability to properly parent his/her child; it is irrelevant whether a child has a stronger attachment to their foster parents, whether foster parents are more \"nurturing,\" or whether foster parents might be more capable or better parents than a natural parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Roberto F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p56\">\n    232 Ariz. at 54, \u00b6 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p56\">\n    301 P.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The severance statute does not permit termination of a parent-child relationship based on the lack of a bond. As previously discussed, any perceived lack of a bond between Melody and Father was not because of Father's lack of effort, but because of DCS's delay, contact restrictions, and substantial failure to try to unify Melody with Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b682 Accordingly, because we find a complete absence of evidence in the record to support the juvenile court's findings and conclusions supporting the termination of Father and Melody's parent-child relationship, we vacate the order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Mother's parental rights to Melody were terminated, and she is not a party to this appeal.
