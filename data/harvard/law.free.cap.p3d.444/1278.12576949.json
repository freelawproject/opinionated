The petition alleged the reporting requirement was a substantial burden because of Mr. Gunsch's age (64), numerous health problems (including legal blindness, ambulatory challenges, and kidney failure ), and the inconvenience to his spouse (also his caregiver). The State urged the district court to deny relief based on the egregious nature of Mr. Gunsch's incest conviction and his subsequent convictions for failure to register. However, it conceded Mr. Gunsch \"appears to meet the statutory requirements for termination of his duty to register as a sex offender pursuant to W.S. \u00a7 7-19-304(a)(i).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] The district court entered its \"Order Terminating Duty to Register\" on July 13, 2018, finding Mr. Gunsch \"meets all statutory requirements set forth in Wyoming Statute \u00a7 7-19-304(a)(i) and (d), and, therefore, is eligible for relief under the same.\" Ten days later, the State filed a W.R.C.P. Rule 60 motion alleging Mr. Gunsch was not eligible for relief from the duty to register because he was convicted of incest as an adult and not \"adjudicated as a delinquent.\" Based on this mistake, the State asked the district court to vacate its \"Order Terminating Duty to Register\" and deny the Petition for Termination of Duty to Register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] The district court granted the motion and entered the Order that is the subject of this appeal (\"Order Granting State's W.R.C.P. 60 Motion for Relief from Order Terminating Duty to Register\"). It found that Mr. Gunsch was not statutorily eligible for termination because he was \"not adjudicated as [a] delinquent for a violation of that statute; rather, he was\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     convicted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [of incest] as an adult.\" The court concluded it \"had no subject matter jurisdiction, and it was error on the [c]ourt's part to enter the\n   <em>\n    Order Terminating Duty to Register\n   </em>\n   .\" Mr. Gunsch filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] W.R.C.P.

In this case, the dispositive facts were undisputed. Both parties represented Mr. Gunsch was adjudicated as a juvenile when he was not. The State moved for relief under W.R.C.P.

Rule 60(b)(1) provides \"[o]n motion and just terms, the court may\" grant relief from a final judgment due to \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\" Mr. Gunsch contends that the State's and the district court's failure to correctly interpret the statute does not fall within the concept of mistake or inadvertence. Rather, the State was required to correct any error by bringing an appeal. Mr. Gunsch also claims the term \"adjudicated as a delinquent\" is unclear and is not specifically defined in the WSORA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b612] First, we address Mr. Gunsch's argument on the meaning of \"adjudicated as a delinquent\" in the WSORA.

This phrase was introduced in the 2011 amendments to the WSORA. The amendments expanded the reporting requirements to not only include adults convicted of a sexual offense, but to also include juveniles adjudicated as a delinquent of a sexual offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342632\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1086/\">\n    391 P.3d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
