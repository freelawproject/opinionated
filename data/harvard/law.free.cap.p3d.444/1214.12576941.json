We address Vance's remaining arguments in the unpublished portion of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We affirm Vance's convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On August 26, 2010, FBI Special Agent Alfred Burney, working undercover in Detroit, Michigan, used a peer-to-peer file sharing program to download 35 files from a software user with an IP address subscribed to Comcast. At least 20 of those files appeared to be pictures of children engaged in sexually explicit activity. Burney then submitted an administrative subpoena to Comcast requesting all subscriber information for the person using that IP address. Comcast responded that the IP address belonged to Vance. Burney sent this information and the downloaded files to the FBI's Seattle office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Seattle FBI office obtained and confirmed Vance's street address and sent the information and files it received to Investigator Maggi Holbrook of the Vancouver Police Department and the Clark County Sheriff's Office Digital Evidence Cybercrime Unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At the time of Burney's investigation, the FBI was part of an interagency, multi-jurisdictional initiative involving the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security's United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Internet Crimes Against Children task forces. The sheriff's office's Cybercrime Unit was a local Internet Crimes Against Children task force, and Holbrook was the local liaison. Burney was not involved with the task force himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Using the information received from the FBI, Detective Patrick Kennedy of the Vancouver Police Department\n   and Special Agent Julie Peay of Immigration and Customs Enforcement independently verified\n   Vance's home address. Kennedy then obtained a search warrant for Vance's home. The warrant first authorized a search for \"evidence of the crime(s) of: RCW 9.68A.050 Dealing in depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct and RCW 9.68A.070 Possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 3. The warrant then described the items to be seized, including a list of specific types of electronic devices and media \"capable of being used to commit or further the crimes outlined above, or to create, access, or store the types of evidence, contraband, fruits, or instrumentalities of such crimes.\" CP at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The warrant also identified for seizure the accompanying records, documents, and information necessary to operate and access those devices and data. This description of the goods authorized for seizure concluded with authorization to transfer any and/or all seized items to the Cybercrime Unit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [F]or the examination, analysis, and recovery of data from any seized items to include: graphic/image files in common formats such as JPG, GIF, PNG or in any other data format in which they might be stored, pictures, movie[ ] files, emails, spreadsheets, databases, word processing documents, Internet history, Internet web pages, newsgroup information, passwords encrypted files, documents, software programs, or any other data files, whether in allocated or unallocated space on the media, whether fully or partially intact or deleted,\n   <em>\n    that are related to the production, creation, collection, trade, sale, distribution, or retention of files depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit acts/child pornography\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CP at 6 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The Cybercrime Unit executed the warrant on Vance's home and seized several electronic devices. The resulting forensic examination revealed at least 20 images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State charged Vance with seven counts of first degree possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct and three counts of first degree dealing in depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court denied the motion to suppress, and the parties proceeded to a bench trial. Just before trial, the State filed an amended information dismissing the distribution charges and instead charged Vance with a total of 10 counts of possession of depictions of minors engaged in explicit sexual conduct. After a bench trial, the court found Vance guilty on all 10 counts. Vance requested an exceptional sentence downward, but the court imposed a standard range sentence of 77 months of confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Vance appeals his convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PARTICULARITY OF SEARCH WARRANT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 Vance argues that the search warrant for his electronic devices was insufficiently particular to satisfy the Fourth Amendment or article I, section 7, and so all evidence seized as a result of that warrant should have been suppressed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Both the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 7 require that a search warrant describe with particularity the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The warrant here used sufficiently specific language to authorize the seizure of only illegal materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 Vance argues that the warrant should have included the definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\" in RCW 9.68A.011(3). To be sure, adding a reference to that definition would have made this warrant even more precise. But the warrant taken as a whole makes it clear to the executing officer what specific items are authorized for search and seizure. And it does not appear that this warrant\n   authorized law enforcement to search for and seize adult pornography or depictions of children more generally. While the warrant contemplates that law enforcement would retain Vance's devices for a period of time to search them for the files to seize, allowing law enforcement some amount of time to search electronic devices for this specifically identified evidence to seize does not undermine the validity of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 Accordingly, we hold that the search warrant was sufficiently particular. To the extent\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   contradicts our conclusion, we disagree with\n   <em>\n    McKee\n   </em>\n   .
