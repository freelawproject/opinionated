ST. JOHN, Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 119,310\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Kansas.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Opinion filed July 26, 2019\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   Pierron, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   St. John pleaded no contest to two counts of criminal sodomy and one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a child. The district court found he was a persistent sex offender because he had a prior conviction for second-degree rape in Oklahoma. The court sentenced him to 214 months' imprisonment, an enhanced sentence based on his status as a persistent sex offender. St. John appeals, arguing the district court erred (1) in classifying him as a persistent sex offender because Oklahoma second-degree rape is not comparable to any sexually violent crime in Kansas; (2) in classifying his Oklahoma second-degree rape conviction as a person felony because the elements are not identical to, or narrower than, any Kansas crime; (3) by holding it did not have discretion to depart from the persistent sex offender sentencing provision; and (4) in relying on an Oklahoma deferred judgment in determining his criminal history score.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In December, 2017, St. John pleaded no contest to two counts of criminal sodomy and one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, all severity level 3 person felonies. See K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-5504(a)(4) ; K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-5506(b)(1). In exchange for his pleas, the State agreed to recommend the sentences run concurrently. St. John would be free to argue for any other legal sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   St. John's presentence investigation (PSI) report showed he had a criminal history score of C and showed he had two prior convictions. One was a 2010 conviction for second-degree burglary from Oklahoma. That conviction was classified as a nonperson felony. The other was a 2011 conviction for second-degree rape, also from Oklahoma. That conviction was classified as a person felony. His PSI report also classified him as a persistent sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   St. John moved for a durational departure. At sentencing, the district court found he had a criminal history score of C. After hearing from both parties, the court found it did not have discretion to depart because St. John qualified as a persistent sex offender. The court added it would have departed if it had the discretion to do so. The court then sentenced St. John to a controlling term of 214 months' imprisonment. St. John appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   St. John argues the district court erred in classifying him as a persistent sex offender under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j). That statute defines a persistent sex offender in part as an offender with a prior conviction for a sexually violent crime in Kansas or a comparable out-of-state felony. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)(2)(A)(ii). Relying on the Kansas Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Wetrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    307 Kan. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    412 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), St. John argues that a comparable felony under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j) is one with identical-or-narrower elements to a Kansas sexually violent crime. He contends that some versions of Oklahoma second-degree rape are broader than any sexually violent crime in Kansas, thus his Oklahoma second-degree rape conviction is not a comparable felony and cannot be used to classify him as a persistent sex offender. Because he was incorrectly classified as a persistent sex offender, he argues his sentence is illegal under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3504(3) because it does not conform to the appropriate statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State points out that St. John is challenging the legality of his sentence for the first time on appeal. Generally, when a party fails to raise an issue before the district court, it may not raise that issue on appeal. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417279\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/965/#p971\">\n    298 Kan. 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417279\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/965/#p971\">\n    318 P.3d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The State urges us to apply this rule here. But Kansas appellate courts have repeatedly held that a court may correct a sentence at any time, even when a party raises the issue for the first time on appeal. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Dickey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418099\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/1018/\">\n    301 Kan. 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418099\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/301/1018/\">\n    350 P.3d 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To resolve this issue, we must answer two questions: (1) What is a comparable felony under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j) ; and (2) is an Oklahoma second-degree rape conviction comparable to a Kansas sexually violent crime? To answer these questions, we must interpret the Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act (KSGA). Statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    State v. Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415914\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/472/#p473\">\n    303 Kan. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473-74,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415914\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/472/#p473\">\n    362 P.3d 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Likewise, a sentence's legality is a question of law over which we have unlimited review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

That grid defines the presumptive sentence for felony convictions based on the crime's severity level and the offender's criminal history score. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(c) and (d). That statute also contains a special sentencing provision for persistent sex offenders and requires district courts to sentence persistent sex offenders to double the maximum presumptive prison term for the offender's crime of conviction. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A persistent sex offender is a person who:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"(A)(i) Has been convicted in this state of a sexually violent crime, as defined in K.S.A. 22-3717, and amendments thereto; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"(ii) at the time of the conviction under subsection (j)(2)(A)(i) has at least one conviction for a sexually violent crime, as defined in K.S.A. 22-3717, and amendments thereto, in this state or comparable felony under the laws of another state, the federal government or a foreign government; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"(B)(i) has been convicted of rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-3502, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-5503, and amendments thereto; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(ii) at the time of the conviction under subsection (j)(2)(B)(i) has at least one conviction for rape in this state or comparable felony under the laws of another state, the federal government or a foreign government.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   So whether an offender qualifies as a persistent sex offender depends on two factors-the offender's current conviction and the offender's criminal history. St. John's current convictions are for criminal sodomy and aggravated indecent liberties with a child. Both crimes are sexually violent crimes under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3717(d)(5). Because St. John's current convictions are sexually violent crimes, he would have to have at least one prior conviction for a sexually violent crime or a comparable out-of-state felony to qualify as a persistent sex offender. K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)(2)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   St. John has a prior conviction for second-degree rape from Oklahoma. Oklahoma classifies second-degree rape as a felony. Okla. Stat. Ann. Tit. 21, \u00a7 1116. But whether this conviction qualifies him as a persistent sex offender depends on the requirement for comparability under K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j)(2)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Riolo challenged his classification as a persistent sex offender based on a prior Colorado conviction for sexual assault on a child. He argued that differences between the elements of sexual assault on a child in Colorado and indecent liberties with a child in Kansas meant his Colorado conviction was not comparable to any Kansas offense. The\n   <em>\n    Riolo\n   </em>\n   court rejected his argument, holding that under the persistent sex offender sentencing provision, the elements of the comparable Kansas offense need not be identical to the out-of-state crime as long as the statutes were similar in nature and in the conduct they prohibited.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416230\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/50/351/\">\n    50 Kan. App. 2d at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Riolo\n   </em>\n   court relied on previous caselaw interpreting the meaning of \"comparable\" in K.S.A. 21-4711(e) (later recodified as K.S.A. 21-6811 [e] ).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416230\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/50/351/\">\n    50 Kan.

That statute requires an offender's prior out-of-state convictions to be classified as either a person or nonperson crime for calculating the offender's criminal history score. In determining whether an out-of-state conviction is a person or nonperson crime, \"comparable offenses under the Kansas criminal code in effect on the date of the current crime of conviction shall be referred to.\" K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6811(e)(3). When\n   <em>\n    Riolo\n   </em>\n   was decided, Kansas caselaw held that under subsection (e), \"[a] comparable offense need not contain elements identical to those of the out-of-state crime ... but must be similar in nature and cover a similar type of criminal conduct.

In\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   , the defendant challenged the classification of his prior Missouri burglary conviction as a person felony for purposes of calculating his criminal history score. The\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   court declined to resolve this issue on constitutional grounds and relied instead on statutory interpretation. The court first sought to determine the plain language of K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6811(e)(3). But after looking at both dictionary and thesaurus definitions of comparable, the court determined that the plain language was unclear.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    307 Kan. at 559-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the statute's language was unclear, the\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   court turned to legislative history. The court recognized that the KSGA represented a significant change in sentencing laws. The Kansas Legislature had several stated principles behind this change, including: \"Sanctions should be uniform and not related to socioeconomic factors, race, or geographic location.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565558\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/984/\">\n    307 Kan. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In line with this principle, the court determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"For an out-of-state conviction to be comparable to an offense under the Kansas criminal code, the elements of the out-of-state crime cannot be broader than the elements of the Kansas crime.

But\n   <em>\n    Riolo\n   </em>\n   based its decision on prior caselaw interpreting the meaning of comparable in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6811(e). The Kansas Supreme Court has since re-examined the meaning of comparable in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6811(e). It follows then that the meaning of comparable in K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804(j) should follow suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State argues that\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   does not apply here for several more reasons: it was wrongly decided because the commonly understood meaning of comparable is \"similar\" and not \"identical\"; it interpreted a different statute; and K.S.A. 21-4704(j) (now K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804 [j] ) is a special sentencing provision first passed in 1996, three years after the Kansas Legislature enacted the KSGA. See L. 1996, ch. 258, \u00a7 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State's arguments are not persuasive given the controlling caselaw. We are duty bound to follow\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   absent some indication our Supreme Court is departing from its previous position.\n   <em>\n    State v. Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416963\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/51/1066/#p1072\">\n    51 Kan.

No such indication exists here. While\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   interpreted a different statute, both statutes are part of the KSGA, and courts must construe statutes\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   and bring the provisions into a workable harmony.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Finally, while K.S.A. 21-4704(j) was enacted in 1996, there is no reason to think the Kansas Legislature abandoned the principles behind the KSGA in those three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The State also argues that\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   does not apply because of a 2017 amendment to K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 22-3504(3) that states: \"A sentence is not an 'illegal sentence' because of a change in the law that occurs after the sentence is pronounced.\" The State says\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   was a change in the law after St. John's sentencing, so the new identical or narrower rule does not apply to his sentence. The State is correct that\n   <em>\n    Wetrich\n   </em>\n   is a change in law. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

While\n   <em>\n    Bruner\n   </em>\n   addressed first-degree rape, there is no reason to believe Oklahoma courts would treat second-degree rape any differently, as both crimes are defined in the same statutes. Thus, the many ways to commit second-degree rape in Oklahoma are means and not elements. See also,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He points out his PSI showed he had a criminal history score of C based on two prior Oklahoma convictions: second-degree rape, classified as a person felony, and second-degree burglary, classified as a nonperson felony. At sentencing, the court found he had a criminal history score of C and used that score to determine his sentence. But St. John claims his Oklahoma burglary conviction was a deferred judgment and should not have been included in the calculation of his criminal history score. Without the burglary conviction, his criminal history score would have been D instead of C. See K.S.A. 2017 Supp. 21-6804.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Hankins\n   </em>\n   court noted that under Kansas law, a conviction requires a judgment of guilt. But Oklahoma's deferred judgment allows courts to impose conditions without entering a judgment of guilt. If the offender completes the deferred judgment, he or she is discharged without a judgment of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The State makes no argument on whether St. John's sentence is legal or illegal. Instead, it argues that St. John has failed to provide a record establishing error. Generally, the party claiming an error occurred has the burden of designating a record showing prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

St. John did attach purported proof of his Oklahoma deferred judgment to his brief. But while an appellant's brief may contain an appendix with limited extracts from the record for the court's convenience, an appendix may not substitute for the record itself. Kansas Supreme Court Rule 6.02(b) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Because the record does not show that St. John's Oklahoma burglary conviction was a deferred judgment, the State's argument has some merit. But St. John's sentence is vacated and remanded for resentencing for other reasons. Although an issue not raised below is precluded on appeal, the issue may be raised on remand.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we decline to reach the merits of whether St. John's sentence is illegal on this point and allow him to raise the issue before the district court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The sentence is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for resentencing consistent with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Vacated and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-143\">\n   Bruns, J., dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   I respectfully dissent.

Rev. Stat. 569.170 (1986). In that context, the \"identical or narrower\" analysis made sense because crimes such as burglary can be either person or nonperson crimes depending on how they are committed. On the other hand, a rape-the penetration of another human being without consent-is by definition a person crime regardless of how or where it is committed. Thus, I would affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
