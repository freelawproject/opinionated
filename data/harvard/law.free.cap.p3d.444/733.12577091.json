Here, we decide whether a defendant who introduces expert evidence of a character trait for impulsivity to challenge premeditation may also introduce evidence of brain damage to corroborate the existence of that trait. We hold he cannot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Stephen Jay Malone Jr. and A.S. lived together in a tumultuous romantic relationship. On June 9, 2013, A.S. left Malone, moving from their home with their three children. Two evenings later, A.S., along with her sister, E.S., and two of the children, drove to the home to return a gift to Malone. On the way, A.S. spoke to Malone by phone and told him that despite his threats, she was leaving him. When A.S. arrived, Malone came up to the car, took the returned gift, and asked her to stay so his mother, who was in the house, could see the children. A.S. refused and drove away; Malone quickly followed in another car. After a five-to-six-minute chase, during which Malone blocked A.S.'s car twice, Malone jumped from his car and fired multiple gunshots into A.S.'s car, killing A.S. and injuring E.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The State indicted Malone on several charges, including premeditated first degree murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-1105(A)(1), the only charge at issue here. Before trial, the State moved to preclude expert testimony from psychologist James Sullivan, Ph.D, that Malone's performance on neuropsychological assessment tests was \"consistent with significant and permanent diffuse brain damage,\" meaning Malone was \"more likely to have a character trait for impulsivity.\" (Dr. Sullivan did not obtain an MRI scan or like evidence to bolster his assessment that Malone had brain damage.) While acknowledging that\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   permitted Dr. Sullivan to testify that Malone had a character trait for impulsivity, the State argued that\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   precluded evidence that brain damage made the existence of this trait more likely. Over defense objection, the trial court granted the motion and precluded Dr. Sullivan from offering an opinion at trial regarding brain damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At trial, Malone rebutted the State's allegation that he premeditated A.S.'s murder by introducing evidence suggesting he had acted impulsively. To that end, Dr. Sullivan testified that, based on his observations and psychological tests, Malone had a character trait for impulsivity. Dr. Sullivan explained that people with this character trait are compromised in their ability to think through the consequences of their actions before acting, although they are capable of doing so. The State did not contest that Malone had a character trait for impulsivity\n   but nevertheless maintained he premeditated A.S.'s murder. The jury agreed and found Malone guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In a split decision, the court of appeals concluded the trial court erred by precluding Dr. Sullivan's testimony concerning brain damage.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, apart from insanity, Arizona does not permit a defendant to introduce evidence of a mental disease or defect as either an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea element of a crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p541\">\n    187 Ariz. at 540-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p541\">\n    931 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050-51 ;\n   <em>\n    Schantz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610295\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/200/#p212\">\n    98 Ariz. at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"610295\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/98/200/#p212\">\n    403 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   529 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-502(A) (\"A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the commission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that the person did not know the criminal act was wrong.\"). Thus, for example, in\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   this Court held that the trial court properly excluded evidence that the defendant suffered from battered-woman syndrome because it was offered to negate the mens rea element for child abuse (knowledge or intent).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p541\">\n    187 Ariz. at 539, 544-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"806872\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/187/536/#p541\">\n    931 P.2d at 1054-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One version of that defense, as\n   <em>\n    Schantz\n   </em>\n   recognized, was reflected in draft MPC \u00a7 4.01(1), as it relieves a defendant of criminal responsibility not only if he is insane under the\n   <em>\n    M'Naghten\n   </em>\n   test, but also if he \"lacks substantial capacity ... to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law\" due to a mental disease or defect.

The legislature fails to do things for many reasons, and its failure to adopt MPC \u00a7 4.02 does not imply that it intended prospectively to categorically bar certain types of evidence relevant to whether a defendant acted with the mental state the legislature has said is necessary for the commission of an offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b640 In short, neither\n   <em>\n    Schantz\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Mott\n   </em>\n   addresses the admissibility of evidence of mental disease or defect to show that a defendant has a character trait for impulsivity as distinct from the use of such evidence to show that a defendant lacked the capacity to form a requisite mental state.

Though the Court now recognizes that we have previously conflated a defense of diminished capacity with the use of mental defect evidence more broadly, it declines to alter course.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26.
