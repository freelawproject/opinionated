Under the 1940 Agreement, in lieu of making releases from the streambed reservoirs to replace seepage and evaporation losses, Denver agreed not to reuse or successively use\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   return flows from water imported from the western slope and used in Denver's municipal water system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b62 Earlier litigation in Case No. 81CW405 established that this reuse prohibition in the 1940 Agreement applies only to return flows derived from decreed water rights from Colorado River sources with appropriation dates before May 1, 1940 (the date Denver entered into the agreement); Denver may therefore use return flows derived from sources that were appropriated or acquired after that date.\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of Denver v. Consol. Ditches Co. of Dist. No. 2 (Consolidated Ditches)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10363812\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/807/23/#p38\">\n    807 P.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (Colo. 1991). The question in this appeal is whether the 1940 Agreement prohibits Denver from using return flows from water imported from the Blue River system under exchange and substitution operations that use water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir under a 1935 priority as a substitute supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b63 This issue arose out of Denver's application in Case No. 04CW121 to adjudicate and quantify reusable lawn irrigation return flows (LIRFs) for use as a substitute supply in exchanges and augmentation plans. In its application, Denver sought confirmation that it could include among its sources of LIRFs the return flows from water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange operations using the Williams Fork Reservoir as a substitute supply. Consolidated Ditches objected to Denver's inclusion of these return flows, arguing that their reuse is prohibited under the 1940 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b64 The water court bifurcated the issues involving the applicability of the 1940 Agreement into this separate case, No. 12CW05. Denver filed a C.R.C.P. 56(h) motion for determination of a question of law, and Consolidated Ditches filed a competing C.R.C.P. 56(c) motion for summary judgment, both raising essentially the same question: whether the 1940 Agreement prevents Denver from using return flows from water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a substitute supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b65 In a written order, the water court resolved these competing motions in Denver's favor, ruling that Denver's Blue River system water, which was decreed in 1955 with an appropriation date of June 24, 1946, is a source of water that was not owned, appropriated, or acquired by Denver prior to May 1, 1940, and therefore is not subject to the 1940 Agreement. The court reasoned that Blue River system water is imported through the Roberts Tunnel under a 1946 priority date, whether it is imported after diversion in priority, or after out-of-priority diversions enabled by Denver's exchange operations using water released from Williams Fork Reservoir as a substitute supply. The water court thus held that Denver may reuse or successively use imported water attributed to the Blue River system. The water court later entered its findings of fact, conclusions of\n   law, judgment, and decree, which incorporated its earlier order on the parties' competing C.R.C.P. 56 motions. Consolidated Ditches and other opposers appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b66 Consolidated Ditches contends that the 1940 Agreement applies to prevent Denver from reusing or successively using water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations. It argues that under the so-called \"character of exchange rule,\" the water diverted by exchange takes on the \"character\" of the substitute supply-here, the water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir under a 1935 priority. Thus, it contends, the return flows from the water imported through the Roberts Tunnel are derived from a source with an appropriation date before May 1, 1940. Denver responds that the water court correctly concluded that the 1940 Agreement does not apply to prohibit Denver from reusing or successively using water imported under the Blue River exchange operations because those operations were decreed in 1955 and are administered under a 1946 priority. In other words, the return flows are derived from a source that was acquired by Denver after May 1, 1940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b67 We agree with Denver. At the time it entered the 1940 Agreement, Denver could not import water through the Roberts Tunnel by exchange (or otherwise). Denver's ability to divert water from the Blue River system by exchange or substitution using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a source of substitute supply was adjudicated in 1955, and the exchange is administered under a June 24, 1946 priority, consistent with the appropriation date of Denver's rights in the Blue River system. Thus, for purposes of the 1940 Agreement, we hold that the water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations is a source acquired by Denver after May 1, 1940. Accordingly, the return flows from those operations are not subject to the 1940 Agreement and Denver may reuse or successively use those return flows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b68 We disagree with Consolidated Ditches that the so-called \"character of exchange rule\" requires a different result here. The character of exchange concept has emerged as an unofficial, permissive practice recognized by the State Engineer, but it does not appear in statute, nor have we expressly applied it in case law or defined its scope. We therefore decline to adopt a mandatory character of exchange \"rule\" that applies rigidly to all exchange operations. Whatever its scope or applicability in other circumstances, the character of exchange principle is unnecessary here to ensure that the purpose of the 1940 Agreement is fulfilled or to avoid injury to Consolidated Ditches. It is undisputed that current importations of water through the Moffat Tunnel under pre-1940 priorities more than fully offset the streambed reservoir seepage and evaporation losses that prompted the 1940 Agreement. If anything, application of the character of exchange principle to bar Denver's reuse of water imported through the Roberts Tunnel by exchange or substitution would only enlarge the existing windfall in Consolidated Ditches' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b69 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and decree of the water court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b610 Given the complexity of the factual and legal background in this case, it is necessary to set both out in detail to understand the issues before us. First, we describe the relevant aspects of Denver's transmountain water systems at issue. We then discuss the background and content of the 1940 Agreement. Finally, we review our two prior decisions interpreting the agreement,\n   <em>\n    City &amp; County of Denver v.

Denver's Transmountain Water Systems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b611 Denver's extensive and complex water supply system includes rights to several sources of water tributary to the Colorado River originating on the western slope of the Continental Divide. Denver also owns and operates collection systems, reservoirs, and tunnels to import water from these Colorado River basin sources for use on the eastern slope. The transmountain system components relevant to this dispute are the Fraser and Williams Fork systems, the Williams Fork\n   Reservoir, and the Blue River system. The following map (Water Collection System Map) provides an overview of these systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Fraser and Williams Fork Systems (Moffat Tunnel Collection System) and the Williams Fork Reservoir\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b612 The Fraser River and the Williams Fork River are tributaries of the Colorado River on the western slope of the Continental Divide. Denver has rights to divert water from these rivers through the Fraser River and Williams Fork Diversion Projects, which were decreed in 1937 by the Grand County District Court in Civil Action No. 657 with an appropriation date of July 4, 1921.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b613 Water diverted from both the Fraser and Williams Fork River collection systems is imported through the Moffat Tunnel. The Fraser River Diversion Project diverts water\n   from the Fraser River and its tributaries and since 1936, has delivered that water through the Moffat Tunnel to the eastern slope for storage and use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Williams Fork River Diversion Project includes the Gumlick Tunnel and the Vasquez Tunnel. The Gumlick Tunnel is used to import water diverted from the headwaters of the Williams Fork River and its tributaries. Starting in 1940, and before the completion of the Vasquez Tunnel in approximately 1958, the Gumlick Tunnel water was delivered to Clear Creek (a tributary of the South Platte River) for subsequent exchange. Since approximately 1958, the water imported through the Gumlick Tunnel has been conveyed through the Vasquez Tunnel to the Fraser River Diversion Project, where it is subsequently conveyed through the Moffat Tunnel to the eastern slope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b614 Additionally, Denver stores water in the Williams Fork Reservoir, an on-channel reservoir that impounds water on the Williams Fork River above its confluence with the Colorado River. The Williams Fork Reservoir was also decreed in 1937 in Civil Action No. 657, but with an appropriation date of November 10, 1935. The Williams Fork Reservoir lies downstream from the Williams Fork River collection system; Denver therefore cannot physically deliver water from that reservoir directly to the eastern slope.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, when a senior call is in effect, Denver releases the water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir as replacement water in exchange and substitution operations to allow Denver to continue to divert and store water out of priority at its Fraser River and Williams Fork River collection systems, or, as relevant here, at its Blue River collection system. Per the 1940 Agreement and the Amended Ruling and Order in Case No. 81CW405 following this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   , Denver does not reuse return flows from water imported through the Moffat Tunnel under its 1921 Fraser River and Williams Fork River Diversion Projects, including water diverted from these two projects using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a replacement source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Blue River System (Roberts Tunnel Collection System)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b615 Water rights in the Blue River have been the subject of substantial litigation in both state and federal court, resulting in a 1955 federal decree, followed by a suite of supplementary and amendatory orders, judgments, and decrees. Because Blue River exchange and substitution operations are part of this complex history, we both describe the Blue River system and briefly review the relevant decrees establishing the June 24, 1946 priority date for administration of these operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Blue River Diversion Project\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b616 Like the Williams Fork and Fraser Rivers, the Blue River is also a tributary of the Colorado River on the western slope. The Blue River Diversion Project consists of Dillon Reservoir and the Roberts Tunnel. Dillon Reservoir is an on-channel reservoir that impounds water on the Blue River and several tributaries above the Blue River's confluence with the Colorado River. The Blue River Diversion Project collects water at the confluence of the Snake River, Blue River, and Ten Mile Creek. This water can be stored in\n   Dillon Reservoir for later transport through the Roberts Tunnel, or it can be placed directly in the Roberts Tunnel and conveyed to the North Fork of the South Platte River on the eastern slope. Denver began importing water through the Roberts Tunnel in 1964.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b617 Denver also releases water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir to make replacements under Blue River system exchange and substitution operations. The Blue River exchange allows Denver to continue to operate the Blue River Diversion Project when its 1946 priorities would otherwise be curtailed by senior downstream calls by releasing water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir to satisfy downstream senior water rights on the Colorado River. The Blue River substitution is similar to the exchange in that it involves the release of water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir, albeit at the direction of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and in substitution for the amount of water that Denver would otherwise owe to Green Mountain Reservoir\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to complete the annual fill of that reservoir under its more senior (1935) priority. Under this arrangement, Denver releases water from the Williams Fork Reservoir for beneficiaries of Green Mountain Reservoir in substitution for releases that otherwise would be made from Green Mountain Reservoir but for interference by Denver's Blue River Diversion Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b618 Denver has always reused the return flows from water that it imports through the Roberts Tunnel under its 1946 priorities, including water diverted by exchange or substitution using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a substitute supply. From 1989\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to 2015, Denver imported an average of 5,482 acre-feet per year of water attributable to Blue River exchange and substitution operations, with greater amounts in dry years. Annual return flows from this imported water averaged 2,505 acre-feet during that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Blue River Decrees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b619 The Blue River direct flow diversion right and Dillon Reservoir storage rights were decreed by the Summit County District Court in 1952 in Civil Action Nos. 1805 and 1806. These rights were assigned a priority date of June 24, 1946 based on the district court's finding that construction on both the Blue River Diversion Project and Dillon Reservoir commenced on that date. Notably, Denver appealed the Summit County District Court's decision, contending that its priority date should relate back to events earlier than 1946, including to the filing of plats, surveys and construction related to (later abandoned) configurations for the project, and surveys for the Williams Fork River and Fraser River Projects.\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of Denver v.

Under this stipulation, the United States recognized Denver's 1946 Blue River rights decreed by the Summit County District Court in Civil Actions Nos. 1805 and 1806, and Denver agreed that its Blue River rights are subject to the right of the United States to fill Green Mountain Reservoir each year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. As relevant here, paragraph 4(c) of the stipulation allows Denver to operate the Blue River system ahead of Green Mountain Reservoir by exchange, using water stored in the Williams Fork Reservoir as a replacement source:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The City and County of Denver ... will at all times bypass water in quantities sufficient to meet all legal calls of downstream water rights on the Blue River, and within Colorado below the confluence of that stream with the main stream of the Colorado River, having priorities earlier than the respective priority dates of said cit[y].

The stipulation requires the U.S. Secretary of the Interior to approve the replacement plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It further requires that \"[t]he water to be exchanged shall be on hand and in storage when the exchange is proposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. Finally, the stipulation requires Denver to reuse and make successive use of return flows from the Blue River \"so as to reduce or minimize the demands of such city upon Blue River water,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, \"within legal limitations and subject to economic feasibility,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b623 After entry of the 1955 Decree, litigation regarding the consolidated Blue River cases continued. As relevant here, references to Denver's right to operate exchanges appear in a string of supplemental orders and decrees.

And in 1978, the federal district court entered a supplemental decree reaffirming that Denver may store water at Dillon Reservoir and propose exchanges of water, subject to the consent of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and subject to the release of water to the extent necessary to complete the annual fill of Green Mountain Reservoir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Judgment &amp; Decree at 3,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In 1991, a Memorandum of Agreement between the United States and Denver affirmed the terms and conditions under which the\n   Williams Fork Reservoir water may be substituted for water otherwise storable in Green Mountain Reservoir, thus allowing Denver to store and use an equivalent amount of water in Dillon Reservoir that would otherwise need to be released from Dillon Reservoir to fill Green Mountain Reservoir. And finally, in 1992, the federal district court entered another decree in the consolidated Blue River cases that specifically addressed the priority date for administration of Denver's Blue River exchange using water from the Williams Fork Reservoir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law &amp; Judgment &amp; Decree,\n   <em>\n    In re Water Rights of the U.S.\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

There, the court ordered that \"[i]n the administration of exchanges to storage in Dillon Reservoir or diversions through the Harold D.

The 1940 Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b626 Denver operates three large streambed reservoirs in the South Platte River Basin on the eastern slope: the Antero, Cheesman, and Eleven Mile Canyon Reservoirs. Denver operates these reservoirs on a gauge-height basis, which means the inflow and outflow to these reservoirs is regulated to maintain water stored in the reservoirs at a steady gauge height. This method makes no adjustments or releases to offset evaporation losses, however, and the burden of such evaporation is borne by downstream appropriators. Although the State Engineer now has statutory authority to order releases from reservoirs to compensate for evaporation losses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 37-84-117(5), C.R.S.

The water court then entered a decree in the LIRF case on May 15, 2012. Paragraph 24.5 of that decree provided that Denver and Consolidated Ditches had stipulated that Denver would reduce the amount of its reusable LIRFs by 8.3% (a stipulated approximate measure of the disputed LIRFs) until the bifurcated issues in Case No. 12CW05 were resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Parties' C.R.C.P. 56 Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b641 As this case proceeded, Denver filed a C.R.C.P. 56(h) motion for determination of a question of law, asking the water court to determine whether the 1940 Agreement prevents\n   Denver from reusing return flows from water imported from the western slope under the Blue River system exchange using water released from the Williams Fork Reservoir as a source of substitute supply. Consolidated Ditches filed a competing C.R.C.P. 56(c) summary judgment motion on the same issue. Whether the 1940 Agreement applies to this imported water determines whether Denver may reuse or successively use the water and, thus, whether it may include the water in its quantification of reusable return flows in the LIRF case. Opposer Central Colorado Water Conservancy District (Central) filed a response to Denver's motion, and West Slope Amici\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed an amicus curiae brief in opposition to Consolidated Ditches' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Water Court's Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b642 On July 12, 2016, the water court issued an order resolving the parties' C.R.C.P. 56 motions, ruling that Denver's Blue River system water right, which was decreed in 1955 with an appropriation date of June 24, 1946, is a source of water that was not owned, appropriated, or acquired by Denver prior to May 1, 1940, and therefore is not subject to the 1940 Agreement. It concluded that \"the Blue River System water imported by Denver has a priority date of 1946, regardless of whether Denver imports the water after diversion in priority or after an out-of-priority diversion enabled by Denver's decreed exchange plan, with substitute water released from [the] Williams Fork Reservoir.\" The water court therefore held that Denver may reuse or successively use imported water attributed to the Blue River system. The court rejected Consolidated Ditches' argument that the \"character of exchange\" principle renders the 1935 priority of the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply the \"operative right\" for purposes of the 1940 Agreement. Instead, the court reasoned, the relevant date for determining whether the 1940 Agreement applies is the 1946 administrative priority date of Denver's Blue River exchange, not the 1935 priority date under which Denver stores water used for substitute supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b643 Denver and Consolidated Ditches agreed that the July 12, 2016 Order resolved the issues that would be contested at trial, and Denver moved for entry of decree based on the water court's order. Central opposed Denver's proposed decree, arguing that the decree should include additional terms and conditions requiring Denver to import a certain amount of water through the Moffat Tunnel-water that is subject to the 1940 Agreement and may not be reused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b644 On September 25, 2016, the water court issued an order resolving Central's opposition and rejecting Central's request for additional decree language. The water court concluded that even in the absence of a decree condition that Denver import a specific amount of nonreusable western slope water each year, ample safeguards already ensure that Denver replaces evaporation depletions. Further, the water court reasoned, Central's requested decree condition would require Denver to import far more nonreusable water than it had imported in 1940, and would thus result in an \"even larger windfall\" of imported water deposited into the South Platte watershed compared to the evaporation losses the 1940 Agreement addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b645 On September 30, 2016, the water court entered its final decree, which adopted its findings and conclusions regarding the 1940 Agreement from its July 12, 2016 Order. The water court reiterated that the Blue River water imported by Denver has a priority date of 1946, regardless of whether Denver imports the water after diversion in priority, or by exchange or substitution using water released from the Williams Fork Reservoir. Thus, the water court concluded, water diverted from the Blue River is not subject to the 1940 Agreement, and \"Denver may reuse or successively use that water, provided such uses are consistent with the\n   Blue River Decree.\" The water court further ordered that the LIRF decree in case No. 04CW121 be modified to remove the 8.3% reduction in Denver's amount of reusable LIRFs pending resolution of the issues bifurcated into case No. 12CW05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b646 Consolidated Ditches appealed and asks this court to reverse the water court's determination that the Blue River water diverted by exchange or substitution is not subject to the 1940 Agreement. Additional parties and amici ask this court either to reverse or affirm the water court's ruling for various reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our analysis below addresses the substantive arguments made by Consolidated Ditches and other parties regarding the application of the 1940 Agreement in this dispute. To the extent that we have not expressly addressed other arguments made by the parties or amici, we note that we have considered these arguments and found them to be either unpersuasive or beyond the scope of the water court's orders being appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b647 As discussed above, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   established that the 1940 Agreement applies only to return flows derived from decreed water rights from Colorado River sources with appropriation dates before May 1, 1940; Denver may reuse or successively use return flows derived from sources that were appropriated or acquired after that date. The question before us now is whether the 1940 Agreement prevents Denver from reusing return flows derived from water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a replacement source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b648 As discussed above, water in the Williams Fork Reservoir physically cannot be delivered transmountain because it sits below the Williams Fork and Fraser River collection systems. The question here is whether the reuse prohibition in the 1940 Agreement applies when the Williams Fork Reservoir water is used instead as a source of replacement supply in exchange and substitution operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b649 Denver argues that the return flows at issue are derived from the Blue River exchange operations, which were adjudicated in the 1955 Decree and are administered under a 1946 priority. Denver contends that because the Blue River exchange is a source that was acquired after May 1, 1940, it is not subject to the 1940 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b650 Consolidated Ditches argues that the return flows are derived from the Williams Fork Reservoir water, which has a 1935 priority date, and therefore, these return flows are subject to the 1940 Agreement. Consolidated Ditches' argument rests squarely on application of the so-called \"character of exchange rule,\" the notion that water diverted by exchange takes on the \"character\" of the substitute supply. Under this view, the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply is \"moved\" (by legal fiction) to the upstream diversion point, such that the water taken at that point by exchange takes on the \"character\" of that substitute supply. In other words, under the legal fiction created by the exchange, the water taken at the Blue River upstream diversion point is effectively the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply water, and the reuse prohibition in the 1940 Agreement applies to that water when it is imported through the Roberts Tunnel because the water's 1935 date of appropriation predates the 1940 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b651 We disagree with Consolidated Ditches and conclude that, for purposes of the 1940 Agreement, the water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations is a source acquired by Denver after May 1, 1940. Accordingly, the return flows from those operations are not subject to the 1940 Agreement, and Denver may reuse or successively use them. At the time of the 1940 Agreement, Denver could not import water through the Roberts\n   Tunnel by exchange (or otherwise). Denver's ability to divert water from the Blue River system by exchange or substitution using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a substitute supply was adjudicated in the 1955 Decree, and the exchange is administered under a June 24, 1946 priority, consistent with the appropriation date of Denver's rights in the Blue River system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b652 We further disagree with Consolidated Ditches that we must apply the \"character of exchange rule\" here. Nothing in statute mandates that water diverted by exchange must take on the \"character\" of the substitute supply, and although we have acknowledged the concept in past cases, we have never expressly applied it or defined its scope. We therefore decline to adopt a mandatory character of exchange \"rule\" that applies rigidly to all exchange operations. Whatever its scope or applicability in other circumstances, the character of exchange principle is unnecessary here to ensure that the purpose of the 1940 Agreement is fulfilled or to avoid injury to Consolidated Ditches. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and decree of the water court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Character of Exchange \"Rule\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b657 Consolidated Ditches argues that the 1940 Agreement prohibits Denver from reusing the return flows from Blue River exchange and substitution operations because, under the so-called \"character of exchange rule,\" the water diverted from the Blue River system and imported through the Roberts Tunnel takes on the \"character\" of the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply released under those operations. Thus, Consolidated Ditches argues, the return flows from water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations are subject to the 1940 Agreement because they are derived from Williams Fork Reservoir water, which is a source that was appropriated prior to May 1, 1940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b658 The origins of the \"character of exchange rule\" are somewhat of a mystery. The \"rule\" exists nowhere in our state statutes. Nothing in the many statutory provisions addressing exchange operations requires the water diverted upstream to take on the character of the downstream substitute supply. These statutory provisions instead reflect that the substitute supply must mimic the water taken at the upstream diversion point in terms of quality, quantity, and continuity to meet the requirements of the downstream calling right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 37-80-120(3) (\"Any substituted water shall be of a quality and continuity to meet the requirements of use to which the senior appropriation has normally been put.\"); \u00a7 37-92-305(5) (\"[S]ubstituted water shall be of a quality and quantity so as to meet the requirements for which the water of the senior appropriator has normally been used ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b659 The notion that water diverted by exchange takes on the character of the substitute supply seems to emanate from the view of an exchange as the equivalent of \"moving\" the substitute supply (by legal fiction,\n   instead of an actual pump and pipeline) to the upstream diversion point. In other words, the water taken by exchange at the upstream diversion (exchange-to) point is effectively the substitute supply. This court has never formally endorsed this legal fiction, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b660 Not only is the \"character of exchange\" principle absent from our statutes, it is unclear what is meant by the \"character\" of the substitute supply. The briefing before us reveals disagreement over the scope of that term, and whether it refers simply to the type of source (e.g., foreign, nontributary, fully consumable native water), or more broadly encompasses benefits attached to the substitute supply (such as the right of reuse or a succession of uses), priority dates, decretal restrictions (such as type or place of use), contractual limitations, or simply \"all legal characteristics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b661 Our cases have mentioned the character of exchange principle only twice, in\n   <em>\n    City of Thornton v.

It also functions as an administrative tool for the State and Division Engineers to accurately account for water stored in reservoirs throughout the state.

Water Imported Under Blue River Exchange and Substitution Operations Is Not Subject to the 1940 Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b673 Turning now to the present dispute, we conclude that the water court correctly determined that the 1940 Agreement does not apply to prohibit Denver from reusing or successively using water imported under Blue River exchange and substitution operations using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a substitute supply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b674 Importations under Blue River exchange and substitution operations could not occur without an upstream diversion (exchange-to) point. However, at the time it entered the 1940 Agreement, no upstream diversion point existed; Denver had not shown an intent to divert water from the Blue River system at that time (by exchange\n   or otherwise).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

Denver's ability to divert water from the Blue River system by exchange or substitution using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a source of substitute supply was first adjudicated in 1955, and the exchange is administered under a June 24, 1946 priority, consistent with the appropriation date of Denver's rights in the Blue River system-the date construction on that transmountain system commenced. Thus, we conclude that for purposes of the 1940 Agreement, the water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations is a source acquired by Denver after May 1, 1940. Accordingly, the return flows from those operations are not subject to the 1940 Agreement and Denver may reuse or successively use them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b675 We disagree with Consolidated Ditches that the so-called \"character of exchange rule\" requires a different result here. Although we acknowledge that some of our cases have implicitly applied the character of exchange principle to preserve the reusability of transmountain effluent in exchange plans, here, Consolidated Ditches seeks to apply it to render the return flows from imported water non-reusable. And to the extent that Consolidated Ditches seeks application of the character of exchange rule to preserve what it perceives to be a contractual restriction on the Williams Fork Reservoir water, we conclude that the application of the character of exchange principle here is not necessary to fulfill the primary purpose of the 1940 Agreement, which was to replace seepage and evaporation losses from Denver's three streambed reservoirs. As described above, that purpose is already more than met by importations through the Moffat Tunnel of Fraser River and Williams Fork River water under their 1921 priorities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10363812\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/807/23/#p38\">\n    807 P.2d at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, applying the principle here would disserve the core purpose of the Agreement's restrictions on reuse, in that it would exacerbate the already growing disparity we acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   when we drew the line at sources with appropriation dates before May 1, 1940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b676 Consolidated Ditches contends that it does not make sense to \"count\" Williams Fork Reservoir water for purposes of the 1940 Agreement when it is imported through the Moffat Tunnel, but not when it is imported through the Roberts Tunnel. But this argument again rests on the character of exchange principle; it assumes that the water imported through the Moffat Tunnel through exchange operations on the Williams Fork River or Fraser River takes on the character of the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply and that return flows from such water are subject to the 1940 Agreement only by virtue of the Williams Fork Reservoir's 1935 priority date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b677 However, our analysis and holding in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   did not hinge on any implicit application of the character of exchange concept. We did not discuss exchange operations using Williams Fork Reservoir water as a substitute supply in that opinion. If anything, our descriptions of the water imported through the Moffat Tunnel (from the Williams Fork River and Fraser River) focused exclusively on the 1921 appropriation dates of those sources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10363812\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/807/23/#p38\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10363812\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/807/23/#p38\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, even to the extent that Moffat Tunnel water discussed in that case included water diverted by exchange (and our opinion is silent on this point), we did not rely on the 1935 appropriation date of the Williams Fork Reservoir substitute supply to conclude that such water was subject to the 1940 Agreement. Nor was it necessary to rely on the character of exchange to conclude that return flows from water imported through the Moffat Tunnel were subject to the 1940 Agreement. Even without applying the character of exchange principle, water imported from the Fraser and Williams Fork River by exchange would be subject to the 1940 Agreement because those sources had appropriation dates prior to May 1, 1940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b678 We drew a line in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Ditches\n   </em>\n   at sources with appropriation dates prior to May 1, 1940, recognizing the rough balance achieved by that line. Under the circumstances here, and considering the core purpose of the 1940 Agreement, which is already more than met by importations through the Moffat Tunnel, we decline to apply the character of exchange principle to exacerbate an already growing disparity in Consolidated Ditches' favor that it is reasonable to assume the parties to the Agreement never intended. There is no suggestion that Consolidated Ditches' interests in ensuring the offset of evaporation losses will not be met if Denver is permitted to reuse return flows from the Blue River exchange. To the extent that Consolidated Ditches suggests it will be \"injured\" by not getting the benefit of its bargain under the Agreement, we again emphasize that the core problem sought to be resolved was the dispute over seepage and evaporation losses. Consolidated Ditches' interests in having those losses fully replaced are protected both by ongoing importations through the Moffat Tunnel, and by the State Engineer's authority to order releases of water from reservoirs to compensate for evaporation losses if necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 37-84-117(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b679 There is also no suggestion that Denver will use the Blue River system exchange to decrease the amount of Fraser River and Williams Fork River water it imports, thereby reducing the amount of water subject to the 1940 agreement. That said, we agree with the water court that the ditch companies may seek relief from the State Engineer and file an appropriate action if they believe that Denver's diversions, or lack of diversions, from certain western slope sources are causing injury to their water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b680 We reaffirm that the primary purpose of the 1940 Agreement was to address the problem of evaporation losses resulting from three of Denver's reservoirs on the eastern slope, and that the 1940 Agreement applies only to water rights appropriated by Denver on or before May 1, 1940. Because the water imported through the Roberts Tunnel under Blue River exchange and substitution operations is a source acquired by Denver after May 1, 1940, we conclude that the resulting return flows are not subject to the 1940 Agreement and Denver may reuse and successively use them. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment and decree of the water court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Consolidated Ditches of Water District No. 2 presently consists of the following member ditch companies: New Brantner Extension Ditch Company, Brighton Ditch Company, Farmers Independent Ditch Company, Fulton Irrigation Ditch Company, Lupton Bottom and Lupton Meadows, Meadow Island No. 1, Meadow Island No. 2, Beeman Ditch &amp; Milling Company, Platteville Irrigating &amp; Milling Company, Platte Valley Irrigation Company, and Western Mutual Ditch Company.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    \" 'Reuse' means a subsequent use of imported water for the same purpose as the original use; 'successive use' means subsequent use of the water by the importer for a different purpose.\"\n    <em>\n     Grand Valley Water Users Ass'n v.
