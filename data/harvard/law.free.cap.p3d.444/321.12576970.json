Boyd alleged in relevant part that, prior to his trial, Officer Yee was \"prosecuted by the Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney for Shoplifting\"; that the State failed to disclose Officer Yee's prosecution in violation of Boyd's rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

A Stipulated Protective Order was filed on September 12, 2017 along with a Filing of Police Documents Under Seal with the subpoenaed documents. The documents provided, in relevant part, that on May 19, 2011, Officer Yee received a twenty-day suspension for \"Theft (Felony)\" and a three-day suspension for \"Commission of a Criminal Act (Other) - Conviction for Theft,\" that the incident took place on December 7, 2010, and that the incident involved Officer Yee walking into a supermarket, concealing poi, honey, and meat in his pants, and exiting the store without paying for the concealed items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 6, 2017, the continued-hearing on the Petition took place. On January 3, 2018, the District Court entered the Order denying the Petition. In the Order, the District Court made the following conclusion of law, which Boyd now challenges: \"5. The Court finds that [Boyd] failed to show that the shoplifting offense by Officer Yee carries probative value on the issue of the truth and veracity of [Officer] Yee as a witness against [Boyd] in [Boyd's] OVUII trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, Boyd asserts that: (1) The State's wilful withholding of the information surrounding Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution constituted a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation; and (2) had the State disclosed Officer Yee's prosecution, the discovery that records had been purged would have led to the exclusion of Officer Yee as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments they advance and the issues they raise, as well as the relevant statutory and case law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) Boyd argues that the State's wilful withholding of the information surrounding Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution constituted a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation because, had it been brought to Boyd's attention prior to trial, he could have used such information to impeach Officer Yee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In extending\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   to impeachment evidence, the Hawai'i Supreme Court has articulated that \"[t]he duty to disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused includes evidence that may be used to impeach the government's witnesses by showing bias, self-interest, or other factors that might undermine the reliability of the witness's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Birano v.

As explained above, the subpoenaed documents in connection with Officer Yee's shoplifting prosecution do not suggest that any related information was material to Boyd's guilt or punishment. As such, this is not a circumstance in which the purged records were \"so critical to the defense as to make [Boyd's] criminal trial fundamentally unfair without it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matafeo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1958343\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/71/183/\">\n    71 Haw. at 186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=787%20P.2d%20671\">\n    787 P.2d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that evidence was not so crucial to the defense as to make defendant's trial fundamentally unfair without it);\n   <em>\n    State v.
