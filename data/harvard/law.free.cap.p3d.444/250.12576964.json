The State contends that because Nunez-Diaz was deportable without regard to his plea, he cannot establish a claim of ineffective assistance or, alternatively, that any constitutional violation was harmless. Because Nunez-Diaz suffered severe and mandatory consequences (including a permanent bar from reentry) as a result of the plea he entered due to counsel's deficient advice, we agree with the trial court and the court of appeals that he received ineffective assistance of counsel justifying post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 We defer to a trial court's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hulsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20367\">\n    243 Ariz. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.3d%20408\">\n    408 P.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (2018). Nunez-Diaz was stopped for speeding and found in possession of small amounts of methamphetamine and cocaine. He was subsequently charged with possession or use of a dangerous drug and possession or use of a narcotic drug, each a class 4 felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-3407(A)(1), -3408(A)(1). The record does not reflect that Nunez-Diaz had any prior criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Upon his arrest, Nunez-Diaz's family began searching for an attorney. Their chief concern was avoiding Nunez-Diaz's deportation. They met with an attorney from a Phoenix law firm experienced in criminal defense and immigration law, who informed them that although Nunez-Diaz had a difficult case, it was possible to avoid deportation. Reassured by this meeting, Nunez-Diaz's family chose to retain that firm, and the firm assigned a criminal defense attorney to Nunez-Diaz's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The State offered a plea deal that would reduce the charges Nunez-Diaz was facing to a single count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a class 6 undesignated felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3415(A). Counsel advised Nunez-Diaz to take the plea. He did. Consistent with the plea agreement, the trial court suspended sentencing and placed Nunez-Diaz on eighteen months' unsupervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Nunez-Diaz was transferred to the custody of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). He was informed that, because of his plea, he could not bond out of custody and would be deported. This alarmed both Nunez-Diaz and his family, who returned to the law firm. There, an immigration attorney told the family that because of the plea, nothing could be done to keep Nunez-Diaz in this country. The family found new counsel who was able to negotiate for Nunez-Diaz's voluntary removal to Mexico, where Nunez-Diaz has remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Nunez-Diaz then initiated post-conviction relief proceedings pursuant to Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. He claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his pleadings, he avowed that his primary concern in considering the plea offer was his immigration status and he would not have entered the plea if his counsel had accurately advised him of the immigration consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After holding an evidentiary hearing, the trial court ruled that Nunez-Diaz had established ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). The court found overwhelming evidence that \"counsel's actions fell below an objective standard [of reasonableness].\" Counsel had \"misrepresented the immigration consequences to defendant,\" and failed to inform Nunez-Diaz that his removal would be guaranteed if he accepted the plea. As a \"direct result of [counsel's] failure,\" Nunez-Diaz was prejudiced by forfeiting his chance at trial and thus his only chance at avoiding removal. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that Nunez-Diaz's guilty plea be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The court of appeals granted the State's petition for review, and a divided panel denied relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The burden then shifted to the State to demonstrate that the constitutional deficiency was harmless, which it failed to do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.

Although Lee's election to try for a \"Hail Mary\" win at trial despite virtually no prospect for success may have been rational to attempt to avoid a deportation that would occur only as a result of a conviction,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15,\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   's reasoning does not apply here. Nunez-Diaz's victory\n   (avoiding deportation) required not just a \"Hail Mary\" win at trial, but also a \"Hail Mary\" win in subsequent immigration proceedings. In other words, even if Nunez-Diaz prevailed at trial, he would remain deportable and would avoid deportation only if a federal official exercised discretion to allow him to remain in the United States despite his illegal status. A chance at such discretionary relief is too speculative to constitute cognizable prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 However, this approach does not categorically preclude\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   's application to those unlawfully present in the United States (as the State urges) but rather recognizes that\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice requires a showing that counsel's deficient advice caused a non-speculative, material harm. Although Nunez-Diaz's deportation following his plea conviction and his loss of possible discretionary relief fail to establish prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , I concur in the majority's conclusion that his permanent bar to admission into the United States constitutes prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. This adverse immigration consequence, like the deportations in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , is a direct material harm that is exclusively the result of his plea conviction.
