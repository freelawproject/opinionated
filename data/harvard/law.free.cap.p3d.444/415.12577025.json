(collectively the \"General Partners\") appeal the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, order dismissing their Third-Party Complaint against Aultco Construction Inc. as barred by the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The General Partners assert that a prior suit by their partnership entity does not preclude the General Partners from pursuing their claims against Aultco. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Two Rivers Apartments LLLP (Two Rivers Apartments) contracted with Aultco Construction Inc. (Aultco) to build an eight-plex apartment building in St. Regis. HRC Two Rivers LLC and HRC Cottages Inc. are general partners of Two Rivers Apartments. USA Institutional Two Rivers LLC is a limited partner of Two Rivers Apartments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2015, Two Rivers Apartments filed suit against Aultco, alleging negligent construction resulting in mold in the attic of the apartments (the \"Two Rivers case\"). After two years, the parties signed a mutual release and settlement agreement and agreed to dismiss with prejudice. The District Court so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 The apartment tenants then filed suit against Two Rivers Apartments and the General Partners, alleging that Two Rivers Apartments failed to give them the statutorily required disclosure of mold testing and its results. The General Partners filed a Third-Party Complaint against Aultco for contribution and indemnity if the General Partners were found liable for damages caused by Aultco's negligent conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Aultco moved to dismiss the Third-Party Complaint based on res judicata. The District Court granted Aultco's motion on the grounds of either res judicata or collateral estoppel. Reasoning that Aultco's negligence in this case has been litigated, settled, and dismissed with prejudice, and considering that the entities are so intertwined as effectively to be one, the court held that res judicata and collateral estoppel had been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 We review de novo a district court's ruling on a M.

The court reasoned that the President of both Two Rivers Apartments and of each of the General Partners, Jim Morton, testified in his deposition that he was the person who made the decision to bring the previous lawsuit against Aultco-choosing whom to include as parties in the original suit but providing no explanation why the General Partners were not named. The District Court concluded further that the General Partners \"are so intertwined with Two Rivers [Apartments] as to be the same entity.\" Because \"[t]he matter of Aultco's negligence in this case has been litigated, settled, and dismissed with prejudice,\" the court dismissed the General Partners' third-party claims based on res judicata, collateral estoppel, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 A final judgment may have a preclusive effect on future litigation by way of either res judicata or collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baltrusch v.

They argue that the parties' intent governs whether a settlement agreement is a final judgment. The General Partners maintain that because the settlement agreement did not have the word \"partners\" in it, the parties intended for the General Partners to not be participants in the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 The settlement in the Two Rivers case involved two separate written release agreements. The first, stating the terms of the settlement between Two Rivers Apartments and two defendants other than Aultco, provided that the parties expressly agreed to release \"the other Parties, as well as the other Parties' respective officers, directors, shareholders, trustees,\n   <em>\n    partners\n   </em>\n   , members, predecessors, successors,\n   employees, attorneys, insurers, representatives, and agents ....\" (Emphasis added). In the separate mutual settlement agreement between Two Rivers Apartments and Aultco, the agreement did not specifically identify \"partners\" as one of the affiliated entities being released. Given the list of parties in the agreement as a whole, however, and the fact that the agreement did not expressly reserve or indicate the parties' intent to reserve any rights of the General Partners, we agree with the District Court that the agreement contained insufficient language to support a conclusion that the parties intended to exclude the General Partners from the final settlement agreement and to reserve their right to litigate with Aultco. The agreement plainly intended to bind Two Rivers Apartments and its privies to the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 The District Court properly concluded that the release operated as effectively on the General Partners as it did on Two Rivers Apartments.

Privity exists where \"two parties are so closely aligned in interest that one is the virtual representative of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Denturist Ass'n of Mont.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 (internal citation and quotation omitted). Privity exists between Two Rivers Apartments and the General Partners because the interests of the entities in the litigation are \"closely aligned.\" Two Rivers Apartments, the entity in which both HRC Two Rivers LLC and HRC Cottages Inc. are general partners, made the same allegation that the General Partners now make: Aultco's negligence caused mold in the apartments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denturist Ass'n of Mont.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. The parties reached a settlement on that claim and stipulated that the case would be dismissed with prejudice. Although the District Court did not analyze whether there was a final judgment on the merits, element five of res judicata and element two of collateral estoppel both are satisfied because a binding settlement agreement that dismissed the case with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Touris\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 We turn next to whether the issue and claim in this action are the same as in the Two Rivers case. The General Partners argue that claim preclusion is not proper because the General Partners' claims are not the same claims Two Rivers Apartments made in the Two Rivers case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The General Partners reason that Two Rivers Apartments made three claims against Aultco in the Two Rivers case: breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence. The General Partners maintain that in this case they have made two claims against Aultco: common law indemnity and contributory negligence. The claims thus are not identical, which is required for claim preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 The General Partners also argue that issue preclusion is not proper because the issue the General Partners raise is not the same issue litigated in the previous lawsuit. The General Partners claim that the relevant issue in the previous lawsuit was whether Aultco was liable for mold in the attic. In the instant matter, the General Partners maintain that the issue the tenants raise is whether\n   Two Rivers Apartments and its privies are liable for not providing notice of the mold to the tenants. The issue the General Partners raise in their Third-Party Complaint is whether, if the General Partners are held liable for failing to provide notice, Aultco is responsible to indemnify the General Partners or contribute to payment of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Comparing the pleadings, the allegations made in the Two Rivers Complaint and Jury Demand are identical to those made in the General Partners' Third-Party Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33. The Third-Party Complaint alleges that Aultco \"failed to build the building in compliance with the specifications and drawings [and that its] failure to construct according to specifications and drawings caused mold to grow in attic spaces.\" The Third-Party Complaint also alleges that equipment Aultco used was not of good quality, new, or free from defect, and that the construction and services were not in compliance with the requirements of the warranty agreement. Count I claims that Aultco is liable to the tenants as a result of its negligence and that the General Partners are entitled to indemnity from Aultco. Count II claims that Aultco's negligence was the cause of the tenants' damages and Aultco therefore is contributorily liable. The Two Rivers Complaint and Jury Demand alleged that Aultco's negligence, breach of warranty, and failure to construct the building in compliance with the specifications caused mold to grow in the attic spaces. Substantively the General Partners' precise claims were alleged in the Two Rivers Complaint and Jury Demand-Aultco's negligent construction. The District Court did not err in concluding that the same claim of negligence was alleged in the Two Rivers case and in the current case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 The issue the tenants raise in the case at hand is whether they were notified about mold in the apartments. The issue on which the General Partners are attempting to sue Aultco, however, is the cause of that mold-whether Aultco is responsible for the mold and for the\n   resulting injury. This is the same issue that was litigated and voluntarily settled with prejudice in the Two Rivers case. The General Partners' Third-Party Complaint and the Two Rivers Complaint and Jury Demand have substantively the same allegations. The General Partners do not raise a new issue or claim for purposes of res judicata or collateral estoppel analysis. The District Court correctly concluded that the issues and claims were the same for preclusion purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Finally, the District Court concluded that the General Partners had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues raised in the previous case. Preventing repeated litigation of the same claims serves to \"conserv[e] judicial resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Baltrusch\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denturist Ass'n of Mont.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The burden is on the party attempting to defeat the application of collateral estoppel to establish the absence of a full and fair opportunity to litigate.\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 The purpose of the partnership is to operate the apartment complex in which the General Partners have an interest. Morton, the entities' common president, testified that the decision to file the lawsuit was a \"combination of the partners' interest.\" It was Morton's decision as president and representative of the partnership, as well as members of the HRC Cottages Inc. board, to bring the suit and to name the parties. The General Partners offer no explanation why they did not participate as plaintiffs in the Two Rivers case, even though they are privies of Two Rivers Apartments and thus had the opportunity to be named parties. The General Partners allege that neither they nor Two Rivers Apartments were afforded an opportunity to seek indemnification or contribution from Aultco for failing to provide notice of mold to its tenants and should not be barred from doing so now. Yet the General Partners did not seek indemnification or contribution from Aultco for failing to provide notice. Their Third-Party Complaint seeks indemnification or contribution for Aultco's alleged faulty construction that caused the mold-the very issue and claim litigated and settled in the Two Rivers case. The General Partners had the opportunity to pursue their claims against Aultco in the Two Rivers case but inexplicably chose not to be included. The General Partners have not met their burden of establishing the absence of a full and fair\n   opportunity to litigate. The fifth element of collateral estoppel therefore is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620 The District Court did not err in concluding that all elements of res judicata and collateral estoppel were satisfied. As privies of Two Rivers Apartments, the General Partners could have joined the previous case and now are precluded from relitigating the claims and issues voluntarily dismissed with prejudice against Aultco following\n   the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621 The General Partners maintain that even if the District Court correctly applied the elements of res judicata and collateral estoppel, this Court should adopt an exception to those doctrines when the parties expressly or tacitly agree to split the claim pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 26. The General Partners argue that the absence of the word \"partners\" from the settlement agreement tacitly preserves the claims between the General Partners and Aultco by splitting the claims. The General Partners concede that they cannot speculate why Aultco omitted \"partners\" from the release it prepared but maintain that the omission constitutes a tacit agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel \"deter plaintiffs from splitting a single cause of action into more than one lawsuit ... thereby conserving judicial resources and encouraging reliance on adjudication by preventing inconsistent judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Baltrusch\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 (internal citations omitted). By its terms, the settlement agreement does not relieve Two Rivers Apartments or its privies from being bound by the choice of finality of the judgment and the settlement agreement. There is no language or other indication that the parties expressly or tacitly intended to split the claim or to preserve the General Partners' right to sue Aultco. Under the facts of this case, we decline to adopt Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26 as an exception to res judicata and collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 The District Court did not err in dismissing the General Partners' Third-Party Complaint against Aultco on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The General Partners are privies of Two Rivers Apartments and had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims in the Two Rivers case. Res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude the General Partners from bringing their Third-Party Complaint when Aultco's negligence has been litigated, settled, and dismissed with prejudice.
