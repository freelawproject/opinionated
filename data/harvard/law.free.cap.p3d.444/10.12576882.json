The statute at issue here is RCW 9.94A.753(1), which provides in relevant part, \"When restitution is ordered, the court shall determine the amount of restitution due at the sentencing hearing or within one hundred eighty days.\" \"The time limit is mandatory unless extended for good cause.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Br. of Pet'r at 8. RCW 9.94A.753(3) makes it clear that restitution is imposed \"pursuant to a criminal conviction\" and is determined by reference to \"the offender's gain or the victim's loss from the commission of the crime.\" Accordingly, we have held that restitution generally may be awarded only for \"the crime or crimes on which a conviction is specifically based,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Barbee is therefore correct that \"the sentencing hearing\" does not refer broadly to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   sentencing hearing for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   offense against\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   victim. Rather, \"the sentencing hearing\" generally refers to \"the hearing at which the offender is sentenced for the particular offense for which restitution is to be imposed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suppl. Br. of Pet'r at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 However, the record unequivocally shows that Barbee\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   sentenced for his theft from the HCA (Count 9) at his 2017 resentencing hearing. At that hearing, the trial court stated that it was entering \"a brand-new Judgment and Sentence\" and Barbee's counsel confirmed that \"the Court's correct in characterizing the position of the case and what's going to happen today.\" Suppl. VRP (Mar. 22, 2017) at 12. Barbee's new judgment and sentence, filed on March 22, 2017, unambiguously ordered a term of confinement for Count 9 (and all of the other counts of conviction) and clearly noted that restitution was to be determined at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 Nevertheless, Barbee argues that \"the sentencing hearing\" for Count 9 refers only to the hearing at which the\n   court initially imposed a term of confinement for Count 9-that is, the 2013 sentencing hearing. This narrow reading, unsupported by any statutory language, is contrary to the purpose of the restitution statute in general and its mandatory timeline in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 Restitution serves both to rehabilitate the defendant and to compensate the victim.\n   <em>\n    Gray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021689\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/920/#p925\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 929-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20P.3d%201110\">\n    280 P.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Barbee's narrow reading would directly undermine the legislature's intent and the purposes of restitution by allowing him to avoid the financial consequences of his undisputed theft from the HCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 In addition, Barbee's proposed interpretation does nothing to advance the specific purpose of the statutory time limit. \"The legislature certainly values finality in sentencing, and we have recognized that victims' 'rights will be cut off' when the State fails to comply with the 180 day time limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021689\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/920/#p925\">\n    174 Wash.2d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20P.3d%201110\">\n    280 P.3d 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.
