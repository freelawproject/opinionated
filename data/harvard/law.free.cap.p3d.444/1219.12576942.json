He contends when sentencing a juvenile in adult court, the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Washington Constitution require a presumption that a juvenile's youthfulness is a mitigating factor and the State assumes the burden to overcome the presumption. Neither the federal nor the Washington case law cited by Gregg supports his argument or warrants deviating from the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which places the burden of proving mitigating factors on the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Gregg also challenges the voluntariness of his guilty plea.

Simmons\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court acknowledged \"[t]hree general differences between juveniles under 18 and adults [that] demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   First, ... \"[a] lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults and are more understandable among the young.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   court avoided \"discount[ing] the potential benefits of such procedural requirements,\" the court determined the defendant had \"not shown that the specific procedures ... are required as a matter of federal constitutional law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's comment concerning the \"potential benefits\" of additional procedural protections is dicta, and it cannot be read as endorsing Gregg's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 Gregg contends our Supreme Court \"moved past\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In fact, with the exception of\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , none of these cases mention the additional procedural protections requested by Gregg. And in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court explicitly determined\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and the Eighth Amendment do not require the additional procedural protections at issue.

Similar to\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   and several of the cases discussed above, these out-of-state cases interpret\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   as requiring a presumption against life without parole sentences for juvenile offenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   As mentioned above, Gregg is not subject to a life without parole sentence. And even if the out-of-state cases were analogous to these facts, we cannot ignore the binding precedent from our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 Gregg has not shown that the Eighth Amendment requires a presumption that a juvenile's youth is a mitigating factor or that the State assumes the burden to prove otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    b. Article I, Section 14 of the Washington Constitution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 Gregg also argues article I, section 14 of the Washington Constitution independently requires his requested procedural protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b627 Our Supreme Court has \" 'repeated[ly] recogni[zed] that the Washington State Constitution's cruel punishment clause often provides greater protection than the Eighth Amendment.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"[e]ven where it is already established that the Washington Constitution may provide enhanced protections on a general topic, parties are still required to explain why enhanced protections are appropriate in specific applications.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628 In\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   , although the defendant was seeking similar procedural protections, our Supreme Court declined to decide \"whether article I, section 14 of the Washington Constitution requires greater procedural protections than the Eighth Amendment when a juvenile homicide offender faces life without parole\" because the defendant did not provide any explanation for why enhanced protections\n   were appropriate under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b629 Gregg relies on\n   <em>\n    State v.

But at most,\n   <em>\n    Bassett 's\n   </em>\n   critique of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   could support more precise youthfulness factors. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   suggests the State should have the burden of overcoming a presumption of youthfulness.

The duty to register is a collateral, and not a direct, consequence of a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b639 Gregg relies on\n   <em>\n    A.N.J.\n   </em>\n   to argue the question whether registration requirements are direct or collateral consequences is unresolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    A.N.J.\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea \"because, he contends, his counsel misled him about the consequences of his plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Supreme Court determined although the defendant was informed that he had an obligation to register as a sex offender, he was misinformed that his conviction could be removed from his record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b640 In\n   <em>\n    A.N.J.\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court acknowledged, \"This court has never held that a preexisting automatic statutory requirement of sex offender registration is not a direct consequence of a plea, though we decided a related but different issue in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ward\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   on the basis that \"\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   considered a statutory consequence that came into existence only after the conviction, not an existing, automatic statutory consequence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b641 But ultimately the court determined \"since [the defendant in\n   <em>\n    A.N.J. ]\n   </em>\n   was correctly informed that he had an obligation to register as a sex offender, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether a current statutory duty to register as a sex offender is a direct consequence of a plea for the purposes of establishing whether a plea was involuntarily made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Ward 's\n   </em>\n   thoughtful emphasis on whether the consequence enhances the sentence or punishment is compelling. Registration as a felony firearm offender does not alter the standard of punishment, even when automatically imposed. The felony firearm registration requirement is a collateral consequence of pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b642 Gregg contends \"regardless of whether the registration requirement is characterized as a 'direct' or 'collateral consequence,' the result is the same because [Gregg] was positively misinformed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   But affirmative misinformation about a collateral consequence does not automatically render a guilty plea involuntary. Affirmative misinformation about a collateral consequence may create a manifest injustice \"if the defendant materially relied on that misinformation when deciding to plead guilty.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b643 Gregg does not claim that the misinformation concerning the firearm registration requirement materially influenced his decision to plead guilty. And the record on appeal does not include any facts regarding how he arrived at his decision to plead guilty. We conclude, on this record, this misinformation did not render Gregg's plea involuntary and does not constitute manifest constitutional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Smith, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Andrus, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Ch. 9.94A RCW.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Clerk's Papers (CP) at 14-15.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    CP at 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    RCW 9.94A.585(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
