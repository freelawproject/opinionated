The decree ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [P]resumptive child support for the three minor children shall be set at $1,393.00. The first payment shall be due on June 1, 2015. Subsequent payments shall be made on or before the 1st day of each month thereafter until said children reach the age of majority and graduate from high school, or become otherwise emancipated. All child support payments shall be made payable to the Clerk of District Court and sent to the Clerk of District Court, Ninth Judicial District, Fremont County Courthouse, P.O. Box 370, Lander, WY 82520, and shall include the Civil Number of this case.

With regard to that payment, the decree provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff [Mr. Knell] shall pay the defendant the sum of $541,873.10 for her 49% ownership (equity) interest, in Knell Transport, LLC, as valued on December 31, 2013 and computed as set forth above. The defendant is granted a judgment against the plaintiff for said amount. The plaintiff shall pay the defendant the amount of $541,873.10 within 90 (ninety) days of the date of this judgment and decree in cash or certified funds. No interest shall be due provided the full amount is paid within the 90 (ninety) days. Any part of said sum not paid in full within 90 (ninety) days should bear interest at the statutory rate of 10%.

The application identified the amount still owing as $499,826.88, plus interest. On that same date, the clerk of district court issued the requested writ and served it on Mr. Knell's employer, Knell Enterprises. Mr. Knell objected to the writ, arguing that because his child support obligation already resulted in a withholding of more than 25% of his disposable earnings, a creditor garnishment was impermissible. In support of his objection, he submitted an affidavit stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5.

The Writ of Garnishment is enforceable from March 23, 2018 forward with payments due and owing twice monthly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   3. Accordingly, Garnishee Knell Enterprises, LLC shall immediately pay $418.75 to the Clerk of District Court for the Ninth Judicial District for payment to Defendant/Judgment Creditor Tanya Knell for each paycheck issued from March 23, 2018 forward on an ongoing basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b67] Mr. Knell timely appealed the district court's ruling to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b68] Ms. Knell chose not to participate in proceedings before this Court, and our review of the record suggests that there were no factual disputes concerning the ordered garnishment.

Although the district court did not enter an income withholding order in this case, we see no meaningful distinction between Mr. Knell's voluntary payroll deduction and a garnishment. The divorce decree's support order requires Mr. Knell to pay a percentage of his monthly earnings for child support, and if he fails to do so, an income withholding order will be entered without a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2020-6-204\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Knell's monthly disposable earnings total $3,350, and his monthly child support obligation is $1,393.
