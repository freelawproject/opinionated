Futurewise and the Pilchuck Audubon Society (collectively\n   Futurewise) believe that the County's regulations fail to meet the requirements of the Growth Management Act (GMA), codified primarily in chapter 36.70A RCW. Futurewise challenged the County's new regulations before the Growth Management Hearings Board, but the Board concluded that the majority of the regulations complied with the GMA. On appeal, Futurewise seeks reversal of the Board's decision to uphold the regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Futurewise asserts that the County's new regulations fail to protect the public health and safety from GHAs as required by the GMA and that the Board erred when it concluded that Futurewise presented inadequate briefing on certain issues and deemed those issues abandoned. We disagree. The GMA does not mandate that local governments consider the protection of the public health and safety when developing critical area regulations, and the Board did not err when it concluded that Futurewise had abandoned several issues by presenting inadequate briefing to the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Following the Oso landslide in 2014, the Snohomish County Council adopted Amended Ordinance 15-034 (Ordinance 15-034) on September 2, 2015, updating its critical area regulations. The Ordinance amended sections of the Snohomish County Code (SCC) pertaining to wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas (chapter 30.62A SCC), geologically hazardous areas (chapter 30.62B SCC), and critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs) (chapter 30.62C SCC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Futurewise and the Tulalip Tribes challenged Ordinance 15-034 and the amended regulations protecting critical areas before the Board. The Board subsequently concluded that Futurewise and the Tulalip Tribes failed to\n   meet their burden to establish the invalidity of the challenged regulations except as to one issue not pertinent to this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most pertinent to this appeal are the Board's conclusions that (1) the GMA does not mandate that the County consider the public health and safety when developing critical area regulations, and (2) that Futurewise abandoned all issues set forth under \"Issue C-1\" in its briefing before the Board because it presented inadequate argument linking the County's regulations to specific\n   violations of the GMA. After the Board reached its decision, Futurewise appealed to the Thurston County Superior Court, which affirmed the Board's decision in a brief order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Futurewise timely appealed to Division Two, which transferred the matter to us for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Futurewise's primary contention on appeal is that the Board erred by concluding that the GMA does not require local governments to consider the protection, against GFIAs, of the public health and safety when developing critical area regulations. This is so, Futurewise asserts, because RCW 36.70A.030(10) defines GHAs as \"areas that because of their susceptibility to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events, are not suited to the siting of commercial, residential, or industrial development consistent with public health or safety concerns.\" According to Futurewise, the Board's conclusion that the GMA does not require local governments to consider the protection of the public health and safety during the development of critical area regulations improperly writes \"consistent with public health or safety concerns\" out of the statutory definition of GHAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In response, the County asserts that RCW 36.70A.030(10) does not set forth any affirmative mandate to\n   consider the public health and safety during the development of critical area regulations. Instead, the County asserts that RCW 36.70A.172(1) sets forth the requirements for counties and cities when developing regulations and that this statute does not require consideration of the public health and safety. The County has the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Our review of decisions by the Growth Management Hearings Board is governed by the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW (APA).\n   <em>\n    Kittitas County v.

But Futurewise fails to identify any provision of the GMA that sets forth such a requirement. Instead, Futurewise asserts that by failing to consider the public health and\n   safety when developing critical area regulations, the County ignored the definition of GFIAs set forth in RCW 36.70A.030(10) -which specifies that GHAs are areas \"not suited to the siting of commercial, residential, or industrial development consistent with public health or safety concerns.\" According to Futurewise, this definition requires the County to consider the protection of the public health and safety from GHAs when developing critical area regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Local governments subject to the GMA are required to \"adopt development regulations that protect critical areas\" designated under RCW 36.70A.170. RCW 36.70A.060(2). The GMA further specifies that \"[i]n designating and protecting critical areas under this chapter, counties and cities shall include the best available science in developing policies and development regulations to protect the functions and values of critical areas.\" RCW 36.70A.172(1). This provision sets forth the affirmative obligation the GMA places on counties developing critical area regulations to protect critical areas' \"functions and values,\" and it does not include any requirement that counties consider the public health and safety when developing critical area regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, when interpreting the requirements of RCW 36.70A. 172(1), our Supreme Court has analyzed the statute as requiring the protection of critical areas themselves, rather than anything external to critical areas, such as the public health or safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swinomish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802087\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/161/415/#p430\">\n    161 Wash.2d at 427-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20P.3d%201198\">\n    166 P.3d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that a no harm regulation setting the baseline for measuring harm as the current condition of critical areas complied with the GMA because the word protect in RCW 36.70A.172 required only the prevention of further harm to critical areas,\n   rather than the enhancement of already damaged critical areas).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Furthermore, Futurewise's argument ignores longstanding Board precedent establishing that GMA definitions do not, by themselves, create any GMA duties.\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

Therefore, we must determine whether the Board's finding-that Futurewise's briefing did not include links between the challenged code sections and the GMA-is supported by substantial evidence, which requires that there be \" 'a sufficient quantity of evidence to persuade a fair-minded person of the truth or correctness of the order.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kittitas County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4018223\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/172/144/#p155\">\n    172 Wash.2d at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20P.3d%201193\">\n    256 P.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thurston County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996300\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/164/329/#p341\">\n    164 Wash.2d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20P.3d%2038\">\n    190 P.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 The Board explained its finding that Futurewise had not provided sufficient argument connecting challenged code sections in Issue C-1 to the GMA with the following rationale:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, Futurewise-Pilchuck failed to cite any GMA requirement supposedly violated by the County's geologically hazardous\n   area regulations listed in Issue C-1. It is incumbent upon a petitioner to relate an adopted regulation to a specific GMA statute/requirement and provide argument establishing that the provision violates the statute/requirement. That was not done here. Rather, the petitioners' brief includes statements such as the regulation \"... fails to protect development from landslides as the GMA commands\", \"... these sections violate the GMA for the same reasons ...\", and \"are not supported by the scientific evidence\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Alterations in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 The Board's description of Futurewise's briefing on Issue C-1 is accurate. Futurewise did not cite to any provisions of the GMA in its briefing before the Board for Issue C-1. While Futurewise included numerous citations to GMA provisions in its heading for Issue C, its briefing for Issue C-1 failed to connect any of the challenged code sections addressed in Issue C-1 to a violation of any of the sections of the GMA listed in the heading for Issue C. Instead, Futurewise made the general conclusory assertions identified in the Board's decision, such as, \"these sections violate the GMA.\" Not once in Futurewise's briefing on Issue C-1 did Futurewise attempt to link any of the challenged\n   code sections discussed therein to any particular provision of the GMA, whether included in Issue C's heading or otherwise. The record therefore supports the Board's finding that Futurewise failed to provide the necessary legal argument connecting challenged code sections to violations of a provision of the GMA, and thus supports the Board's ruling that Futurewise abandoned Issue C-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 We affirm the Board's decision that the GMA does not require the County to consider the protection of the public health and safety when developing critical area regulations and that Futurewise abandoned the issues presented in Issue C-1 in its briefing before the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 The remainder of this opinion has no precedential value.
