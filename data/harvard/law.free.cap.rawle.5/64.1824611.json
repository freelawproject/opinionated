The cause came on for trial at September sessions, 1834; a verdict of guilty was rendered by the jury, whereupon the following reasons were filed in arrest of judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">1st. The matter charged in the bill does not constitute an indictable offence at common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">2d. It is not alleged in the indictment that the fraud was effected by means of any false tokens, having the semblance of public authority or touching the public interest; and neither is it averred, that it was effected by means of conspiracy or forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">3d. The only means'by which the-indictment alleges the fraud or cheat to have been effected is a simple false affirmation, which is not sufficient to constitute the deceitful practice or false token required by the common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">4th. The defendant (even if the facts set forth be true) can be guilty of a mere breach of trust and not of any criminal offence whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">5th. In all cases of cheat or frauds at common, law, it is necessary that the false tokens or illegal practice should create the credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>6th. There is no avermerft in the second count, that the inhabitants of the county of Bucks were defrauded in consequence, or by means of any false pretence or tokens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">7th. The third and fourth counts merely aver that the false pretence was used with <em>intent </em>to defraud, &amp;c. They contain no averment that he <em>did </em>defraud, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">8th. There is no averment, that the defendant obtained possession of the money in consequence of the false pretences, or that he at any time appropriated it to his own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">The court overruled the reasons in arrest of judgment, and sentenced the defendant to pay a fine of two thousand dollars to the Commonwealth, and to eighteen months imprisonment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">The defendant thereupon brought this writ of error and assigned for error: -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">That the court erred in overruling the reasons in arrest of judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-10\"><em>Ross, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAN\">soon after he had commenced his argument was stopped by the court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-11\"><em>Rush, </em>for the Commonwealth,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aui\">being called on to support the judgment, contended:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR3\">1. That the offence laid in the indictment was a cheat and fraud, affecting the public and as such indictable. Cheats by statutes, <em>Hen. 8, Eliz. </em>and <em>Geo. </em>3, are frauds effected by false tokens. Cheats at the common law consist in the fraudulent obtaining the property of another, by any deceitful and illegal practice or token (short of felony) which affects the public. <em>East, Cr. L. </em>818. Frauds affecting the course of justice and immediately-injuring the interests of the public, are indictable at common law. 3 <em>Chitty, </em>Cr. <em>L. </em>995. Although they arise from the particular transactions of individuals. 2 <em>Russel on Crimes, </em>1362. <em>2 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>552, per Tilghiman, C. J. 2 <em>East, C. L. </em>816. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Wheatly, 2 Burr. </em>1125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-14\"><em>2. </em>Public officers may be indicted for frauds committed in their official capacities. 1 <em>Russel on Crimes, </em>219.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-15\"><em>Hellings </em>was a public officer. His offence was an injury to the public, whether false tokens were used or not. <em>Resp. </em>v. <em>Powel, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>47. Public officers convicted for embezzling public funds. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>1 <em>Dall </em>335, in notes, <em>(Wharton\u2019s ed.) </em>The embezzlement of public money, has likewise in this state been deemed a public wrong, for which the private sufferer was not alone entitled to redress. <em>Resp. </em>v. <em>Teischer, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>335. An indictment averring \u201c with intent to defraud the liege subjects,\u201d is sufficient. <em>Resp. </em>v. <em>Sweers, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>44. The fraudulently neglecting and refusing to account is indictable. <em>King </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>5 <em>Mod. </em>179; This case is an answer to the objection that the act of Assembly provides a penalty for neglecting and refusing to pay the moneys received. The same objection was made in <em>King </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>but overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>3. He contended that the offence if neither technically a cheat, fraud, nor deceit, was a misdemeanor at common law, and as such indictable. It is clearly a public wrong, and whatever amount's to a public wrong may be made the subject of an indictment. 1 <em>Dall. </em>238. 7 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws, </em>713.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\">The court declined hearing <em>Ritiera </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The offence here is laid as embezzlement at the common law. Sir \"William Blackstone, speaking of misprisions in public trusts and employments, remarks in the fourth volume of his Commentaries p. 121: \u201cHitherto also may be referred the offence of embezzling the public money, called by the Romans <em>peculatus, </em>which the <em>Julian </em>law punished with death in a magistrate, and with deportation or banishment in a private person. With us it is not a capital crime, but subjects the committer of it to discretionary fine and imprisonment.\u201d He refers to no-authority for the last position; but we find in <em>Moulsworth\u2019s case, Comb. </em>187, w here an overseer had charged the parish three pounds for putting out an apprentice who was in fact not put out, the expression of an opinion that there might be remedy by indictment; and in Mr. <em>Chitty\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>vol. 3, p. 701, we have two precedents of an indictment for embezzlement at Common Law.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Yet it is not a little remarkable that no trace of such an offence is found in <em>Bale </em>or <em>Hawkins, </em>or the more recent English text books. The reason of it may be that the common law prohibition has been superseded in practice by the specific provisions of various statutes to punish the pilfering and stealing, not only of servants and clerks, but officers of the post office and .bank. The civil remedy must in a vast majority of instances be inadequate to the mischief ; but the question here is whether it is not to be resorted to exclusively, by reason of our statutory provision to restrain the courts to specific remedies provided by the legislature. By the eighteenth and nineteenth sections of the act of 1799, the persons and estates of delinquent collectors, are liable to seizure and execution on summary process from the treasurer and commissioners; and the specific remedy thus provided has consequently supplanted the remedy at the Common Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> See <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>2 <em>Campb. </em>268.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
