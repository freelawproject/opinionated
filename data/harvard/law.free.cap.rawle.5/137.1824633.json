Can the action before us be so considered ? The foundatiori of it is the defendant\u2019s promise, not the will. But as executors cannot promise or covenant as such, so as to make themselves liable as executors, they are liable in a representative character, only on the contract of their testator. Naming them as such, though. a circumstance to be weighed in a doubtful case, such as <em>Foulk v. Brown, </em>is by no means decisive; to be conclusively so, the declaration must be framed on the will, and not on any evidence of responsibility subsequent to it. The defendants therefore, being sued on their own promise, were not entitled to appeal without bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
