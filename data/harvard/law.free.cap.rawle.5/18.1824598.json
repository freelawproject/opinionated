Demas y. Valle, </em>President or Governor of the Spanish Province of Guatemala, granted sundry licenses to a distinguished merchant of the city of Guatemala, <em>Don Juan Bh. Yrissary, </em>for the importation from foreign ports, especially from the United States, of all lawful merchandize; to render which licenses available he gave passports to <em>jDon Alexander Ramirez </em>and <em>Don Juan Echevria, </em>agents of <em>Yrissary, </em>to proceed to foreign ports. \u2022 They came to Philadelphia and addressed themselves to the memorialist, who together with certain persons who becameasso ciated with him, was induced to make the experiment of carrying one of the licenses into effect. The success of this enterprize induced the memorialist and his associates to enter more extensively into the business. The agents above mentioned stated that if vessels should proceed to ports of Guatemala in the Pacific, they might, on their outward voyages .touch and trade at the ports of Chili and Peru before they arrived at Guatemala, which was represented as a great advantage. Adopting this plan, the memorialist and his associates, sent two vessels, the ship Asia and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>brig Dolly,\u2019 both the property of the memorialist, with cargoes to the Pacific. . <em>Yrissary, </em>sent an agent from Caxid\u00e9 to Lima to act as consignee of any vessels which might touch at Peru. The cargoes of both these vessels were furnished by the' memorialist and several other merchants of Philadelphia who made him their sole agent, and who shipped their goods in his name. The Asia sailed from Philadelphia in October, <em>1800, </em>for Sonsonati in the Province of Guatemala, with orders to touch at Lima. The Dolly sailed soon after with orders to touch at Valparaiso in Chili. The Asia, wiihout touching at any intermediate port arrived at Callao de Lima about the end of January, 1801, and the Dolly after touching at Valparaiso, also ar l rived at Callao in June, 1801. When they, arrived, the power of the President of Guatemala to grant licenses so broad as those under which they sailed, was denied by the Government of Peru. Both vessels were therefore arrested, their cargoes seized and sold under instructions from government, and the proceeds deposited in the Royal Treasury, but the vessels; after being allowed a small sum on account of freight, were .permitted to depart with cargoes, principally on. Spanish account, one for Cadiz, and the other for Philadelphia. Though the decrees of the Government required the proceeds of the cargoes to be deposited in the Royal Treasury, yet they were so modified as to admit of their passing through the hands of <em>Yrissary\u2019s </em>agents, who were permitted to take possession of them on giving bond to place in the Treasury \u25a0 the amount of their appraised value. In this state of things it was determined by the associates of the memorialist that he should go to Spain to petition the King for relief. In 1802 he proceeded to Madrid, and in his own name solicited from the throne, restoration of the property sequestered in Lima. <em>Yrissary </em>had an agent in Madrid at the same time, urging the delivery of the property to him. After a protracted period, a royal order for its restoration was granted, but it was so qualified as to give a preference to neither party, and yet to afford a show of justice to both. This royal order was dated August 29th, 1803, and was addressed to the President of Guatemala, apprising him of the removal of the sequestration and <em>instructing </em>him to pay to the memorialist and to Mr. <em>Forbes, </em>of Jamaica, the balance due to them from <em>Yrissary, </em>and to the latter such balance as might after-wards remain in the treasury. Although the royal order had the force of a law, yet great difficulties arose in ascertaining the amount to be received by the memorialist, and he returned to the United States in order to fix that amount. It was determined by those concerned that the memorialist should prosecute the business in the manner he thought best, and to him it appeared that there'was but one course to be pursued, which was to effect a settlement with <em>Yrissary </em>at Guatemala\u2019, and to demana payment of the President of that province agreeably to the royal order. The difficulties attending this course were almost insurmountable. Strangers are generally ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>eluded from Spanish ports in time of peace, and even if admitted into the sea porls permission cannot be obtained on any terms to penetrate into the interior. The city of Guatemala, the capital of the province, is situated nearly midway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Its port of entry on the Atlantic is Omoa in the Gulf of Honduras, one of the most pestiferous regions of the globe. To that place therefore no person could go from the United States. A vessel was sent to Omoa with a view to open a communication with <em>Yrissary, </em>but he detained her so long, that the officers and crew all perished, when he sold the vessel and appropriated the, proceeds to his own use. For these reasons, the business was prosecuted languidly and all active measures were suspended. Some time in the year 1807, a letter was received by the memorialist, dated Guatemala, September, 3d 1806, signed by the executor of <em>Yrissary, </em>informing him of the death of that gentleman on the 5th of May, 1805, and enclosing an account-current which exhibited a balance in favour of the memorialist of two hundred and thirty-nine thousand one hundred and ninety-nine dollars and one and a quarter rials; but it also advised that an attachment had been laid in Lima, on one hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the funds deposited there by three persons, who had freighted the Dolly, on the ground that she had gone to London instead of Cadiz. The letter also contained an offer to pay the memorialist the balance of fifty-nine thousand one hundred and ninety-seven dollars and one and a quarter rials, provided he would receive it in cocoa at a stipulated price, and would send a vessel to a small port adjacent to Omoa to receive it. A great number of proofs and documents were , prepared by the memorialist, as well in reference to the attachment in Lima as to the contested amount in Guatemala. The documents for Lima, together with a power of attorney to Don <em>Juan B. Oyazzabal, </em>were sent out which ultimately reached their destination. The documents for Guatemala, together with a power of attorney, were sent to the <em>Marquis of Ayzinina, </em>and re iched him in due time. A letter from <em>Oya-zabil, </em>dated Lima, November 20th, 1809, informed the memorialist of the removal of the attachment, and one from the <em>Marquis of Ayzinina, </em>dated August 10th, 1809, stated that the dispute with the executors o\u00ed <em>Yri-sary </em>had been referred to the Jueces Arbitrios. Another letter from the same person, dated December 18th\u2018, 1813, info med the memorialist that he had obtained judgment and was accompanied by a copy of the proceedings in the case. The estate of <em>Yrissary </em>was declared bankrupt and surrendered to his creditors. In December, 1814, the <em>Marquis of Ayzinina </em>died, and his affairs came into the hands of his brother <em>Juan Ferm\u00edn de Ayzinina, </em>who wrote two letters to the memorialist, one dated the 18th of July, and the other the 3d of September, 1818. In the first, he announces the removal of all difficulty as to the receipt of the money in the Treasury at Lima, about two hundred and two thousand dollars, and offers, when in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>possession of it, to remit the amount in indigo. In the second, he advises of having a decree for the amount of the funds in the Treasury at Guatemala, which had been transferred from that of Lima by order of the President of Guatemala. Thus, in September, 1818, such progress had been made in the business, that it only remained to receive the official order of the President of Guatemala for the payment of the money. At this critical moment, notice of the invasion'of Florida and capture of St. Augustine, was received at Guatemala. The agent then suggested to the memorialist certain measures to be taken for the security of the property, which however, were rendered unnecessary by the treaty with Spain, under which the claim was made. The amount of the claims for the two vessels could not be exactly ascertained, but might be estimated at about three hundred thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The memorial then stated that the cargo of the Asia was divided into twenty-two shares, and held in the following proportions, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>Joshua Sutcliffe, Samuel Gatcliffe, John Ashly, Martin Walker, Simon Walker, James Yard. </em>4 Shares. 4 1 <em>\u201c </em>1 <em>rj it </em>5 \u201c</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-14\">That the cargo of the Dolly was divided into one hundred and twenty shares, and held in the following proportions, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-15\"><em>Wm.

The documents for these vessels were prepared for the ports of Guatemala only; but they had a right to call at any Spanish port on their way. By the Spanish laws of Escala, however, they were not permitted to self their cargoes unless invited to do so by the local authorities. It was the intention of the shippers by both vessels to do so if permitted. The Dolly touched at Valparaiso and took in refreshments without interruption; but not being permitted to sell her cargo, proceeded to Lima, where she, as well as the Asia, was detained by the government, not for any irregularity in proceeding to that port, but on the ground of incompetency of the President of Guatemala, to grant the license under which the voyage was undertaken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-11\">In reference to the second objection, which was, that the original memorial did not clearly state that the funds were paid into the Royal Treasury, he averred, after recapitulating some of his former statements that the funds were actually paid into the Royal Treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-12\">The thii'd objection was, that the claim seemed to be against an individual and not against the Spanish government. This he answered by stating that the claim was upon the government and not upon <em>Yrissary, </em>who was only entitled to what remained after satisfying the claims of the memorialist, Mr. <em>Forbes, </em>and others. It was necessary, however, to settle the account with <em>Yrissary, </em>in order to ascertain the amount due to the memorialist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-13\">In relation to the fourth objection, viz: That if the funds had been placed in the Royal Treasury, the memorialist had not sought to obtain them from that source in due time, he stated the following reasons for the delay which took pla.ce:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-14\">1st. His absence from Spain at the time the Royal order was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>2d. His inability to appear either in person or otherwise, at Guatemala, as stated in his original memorial and other causes, and the consequent impracticability of his coming in contact with <em>Yrissary.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">3d. The determination of <em>Yrissary </em>and his executors to protract the final settlement of his account as stated in the original memorial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">4th. A royal order to suspend the payment of all deposited funds, in consequence of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>expedition, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">5th. The refusal of the King to permit the memorialist\u2019s case to be arbitrated in the Havanna, as he prayed, so that he might have attended to it in person: and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">6th. The necessity of engaging in a law suit in a foreign and insulated country to which he could have no access, and. which is proverbial for the interminable character of its law proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">The memorialist then went at length into facts and reasonings to show why the&gt; claim was not and could not have been paid in indigo, as mentioned in the original 'memorial. He also stated, that in saying in his original memorial that in. September 1818, \u201c such progress had been made in the recovery of the amount adjudged to him, that it only remained to receive the official order of the President of Guatemala for the amount thereof,\u201d he <em>relied on the </em>representations of his agent, <em>Ayzinina, </em>who was mistaken as to the ability of the Treasury of Lima to discharge the demand of two hundred and two thousand dollars, for which he.was to receive the order of the President of Guatemala. He stated a variety of circumstances to show tha't the offer to pay the admitted balance of fifty-nine thous- and dollars in cocoa, was fallacious and merely part of a scheme of fraud. The memorialist added, that he had an interest in these claims arising out of certain agreements between the parties in interest and himself.for services to be rendered by him, and concluded with the following averments, viz:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">1. That his. claim was presented to the Government, soliciting its interposition, before the signature of the treaty with Spain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-12\">2.

He recommended however to the counsel to enter into an agreement (which was done) by which the interest of the <em>Walkers </em>in the fund in the hands of Mr. <em>Yard, </em>should, not be affected .by the verdict to be rendered in this case, in the event of the suits brought by them or their representatives being successful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-14\">As to the last point his Honour directed the jury to ascertain how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>much had been received from underwriters on account of this loss, but to find a verdict without deducting it, and the court would lessen the verdict by so much if the underwriters were not entitled to it \u2014 if they were, the court would hold the plaintiff a trustee <em>pro tanto, </em>and lay hands upon the fund for the benefit of the underwriters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">The opinion delivered by the court to the jury was excepted to by the counsel of those who opposed the claim of the plaintiff below, and on the return of a writ of error to this court, the following errors were assigned.

It seems to be admitted on all hands, that the decisions of the \u25a0board of commissioners, jvithin the scope of their authority, are final and conclusive. That authority was to receiye, examine and decide upon the amount and validity of the claims presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>them. The inquiry then is, 1st, whether, on the face of their proceedings, they have decided upon the claim under the <em>Bollmans, </em>and if they have, whether they have rejected or admitted it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">2. If this does not appear on the face of the proceedings, does the extrinsic evidence admitted by the court below, establish their right under the treaty? To understand the decision of the board, it is necessary to refer to the matter before them and the evidence given in relation to it. The memorial of Mr. <em>Yard, </em>sets forth the different interests of the persons represented by him, in relation to some of whom it appears that they were not citizens of the United States, at the time of the loss or subsequently. The <em>Bollmans </em>were aliens born and became citizens by naturalization in 1802, which was after the loss. From the two decisions of the board of 29th July, 1823, and February 16th, 1824, it appears that among the claims presented by Mr. <em>Yard, </em>were those^of persons not citizens of the United States, and that these were rejected. Who were the aliens and who the citizens? The <em>Bollmans </em>were clearly not citizens in 1801\u00bb when the loss occurred. The decision adopts no fanciful interpretation of the term citizen, but uses it in the legal and only accepted manner in which it could be used by them. It seems then from the face of the decisions that the commissioners have decided the question adversely to the claim of the <em>Bollmans, </em>and if they have, iris not denied that their decision is conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">Extrinsic evidence has however been admitted for the purpose of explaining these decisions, the' operation of which it is necessary to consider. If there was any ambiguity on the face of the proceedings of the board, the evidence relied upon is not calculated to remove it. The decisions in the cases of the Lenox and the Molly are different in principle from that now under consideration, and there is nothing like the adoption o\u00ed the principle of the one decision in the other. What is the character of the evidence ? It is to prove citizenship <em>defacto, </em>arising from commercial residence, not citizenship <em>de jure, </em>as the basis of the supposed decision of the commissioners, that the <em>Bollmans </em>were citizens within th\u00e9 meaning of the treaty. Thus, if the defendant in error can prove that they were commercially citizens, he will raise on this foundation an argument, that the com-, missioners, after having in terms excluded all who were not citizens, but admitted a claim under the <em>Bollmans </em>in other cases, have necessarily decided on this ground, that they were citizens. To suppose the board have proceeded on any such ground, is to suppose they have done what they had no right to do. Their office was to decide on claims of citizens of the United States, and on the validity of such claims their decision is conclusive. But they had no right to decide that an alien is a citizen, and such a decision would not be conclusive. It would be in contravention to the treaty. They did not and could not give to it so fanciful an interpretation as that of the District Court, that although not within the letter, the <em>Bollmans </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>were within the purview of the treaty. The language of a treaty is to be carefully scrutinized and to be understood according to its meaning in the state in relation to which it is used. In the 9th and 11th sections the term <em>citizens, </em>is used, and not <em>inhabitantsl mi </em>these are the sections under which the claim is made. The use of the term <em>.inhabitants </em>in other sections and in reference to other objects, shows that these terms were adopted with care and discrimination and were not intended to be understood as convertible terms. In the language of all \u00f1ations the word <em>citizen, </em>has a definite meaning, but no where is it so clearly ascertained as in the United States, where the term means one who by birth or naturalization has acquired municipal rights; not one, who by commercial residence has become entitled to protection and to certain privileges. The inference from a decision in other cases, different in their circumstances, ought to have no operation in determining this case. The court do not know what the evidence in those cases was. There may have been produced a false certificate of naturalization. But the court do know that the evidence produced in this case proved that they were neither native nor naturalized citizens at the time of the loss. Besides, the claimants in the cases of the Lenox and Molly were insurers who were citizens of the United States, and had paid the loss. They were the real sufferers at the time of the loss, to which the policy related back, and they came within-the terms of the treaty. They cited <em>Con. U.

The interlocutory decree of July 29th, 1823, allowed the validity of the claim, subject to a deduction on account of foreign interests, without specifying what they were; and the final decree of February lGth, 1824, awarded to the claimants generally a certain sum, which was ordered to be paid to <em>James Yard, </em>for himself and others. This decree making no distinction between foreign and American interests, must be understood to embrace all the claimants represented by their common agent, the doubt as to the citizenship of some of them, having been removed. Those therefore, who contend that the claim under the <em>Bollmans, </em>was rejected are bound to show it, independently of the language of the decision. They did not attempt to do so, and this was perhaps enough for the plaintiff below. But it was open to him to strengthen his case, by showing that they were considered citizens by the commissioners, and this he could do, in the first place, by showing that they actually were citizens within the meaning of the treaty, and that therefore, the commissioners must have decided that they were so; and secondly, that the commissioners' actually did so decide, as appeared from their proceedings in reference to those individuals, in other cases of the same character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">The first question then is, whether under the Florida treaty, persons who were neither native nor naturalized citizens, but who were domiciled here, and carrying on commerce as American merchants were entitled to indemnity for losses sustained by Spanish seizure, in the prosecution of their business as American merchants. Nothing is more clear, than that by the law of nations, a man may acquire a national character, and enjoy all its advantages, so far as relates to commerce, not only independently of, but directly in opposition to his original character. In all cases therefore, of prize and insurance, in all cases whatever, in. which national character is the subject of inquiry, as connected with commerce, the inquiry is, not to what country the party owes allegiance according to municipal laws, but of what country is he a citizen, or subject according to the law of nations; and this inquiry is fully satisfied, by shewing what is his commercial domicil. So far is this principle carried, and so entirely is original national character lost, for certain purposes, by the acquisition of a new commercial domicil, that the courts of a man\u2019s native country will condemn his property as enemy property, merely on the ground of his being domiciled in the enemy country, <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>The Maryland Ins.

Unless then, there is a difference between the words \u201ccitizen\u201d and \u201csubject,\u201d as used in reference to cases of prize and insurance, and as used in a treaty, these authorities are conclusive. It is not easy to perceive on what foundation such a distinction rests. It is applied to all persons having a commercial' domicil, and extended to all commercial concerns. Domicil stamps national \u25a0character as to every thing connected with commerce, though it does not open the door to immunities and privileges, which depend on municipal laws. In determining the meaning of the word, as used in the Florida treaty, it is proper to inquire what objects it had in view. A number of American merchants, natives, naturalized and domiciled, had large claims against the government of Spain, for the spoliation of their property. Indemnity for the loss of this <em>American </em>property had been the subject of frequent and fruitless application \u25a0 to the Spanish government, and our own government, interposed its offices for its recovery. The claims of those interested in the cargoes of the Asia and Dolly, had been the subject of the application of the government of the United States, and no distinction was made between those who were native or naturalized, and those who were domiciled citizens. The property confiscated, was American property, because it belonged to American citizens, and was entitled to protection as such. When the treaty of 1819 was formed, the. United. States exonerated Spain from all such claims, and undertook to satisfy them to the extent of five millions,of dollars. By the words of the treaty, our government exonerated Spain from all claims of American citizens; the plain and obvious meaning of which is, that Spain Was released from all claims on account of American property, the term citizen being used to signify those who represented such property. Any other construction would be in the highest degree unjust- and fruitless, to those who had settled here, confiding in the protection of our government. Their claim on Spain was gone. If it had been made, the answer would have been, that the cession of Florida had extinguished all claims founded on the confiscation of American property. As Hanoverians, the <em>Bollmans </em>could make no claim on Spain, because Spain was then at' war with Hanover, and if the property was Hanoverian property, it was rightfully confiscated. But it would have been in violation of the law of nations to call it Hanoverian property. The only quarter to which they could look, was the government of the United States, in whose protection they had confided, and who were bound to protect their property as American property. It is urged that strict criticism should be applied in construing a treaty, in which every word is weighed and considered. Where shall we be landed, if we construe the word <em>citizen, </em>with critical precision? It is defined by the best English lexicographers, to be \u201c a freeman of a city, not a foreigner; not a slave,\u201d \u201c a townsman, a man of trade; not a gentlemen\u201d \u2014 \u201can inhabitant, a dweller in any place.\u201d The meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>given of the corresponding Spanish word used in the treaty, <em>cuidadano, </em>is \u201c a livery man of a city\u201d \u2014 \u201c a freeman who enjoys the pri- , vileges of a city\u201d \u2014 \u201c an inhabitant of a city.\u201d It would be absurd .to give the term the same signification, in reference to every subject. If there be any instrument to the interpretation of which the princi\u2022ples of the law of nations peculiarly apply, it is a treaty, with which the municipal law has nothing to do. The 11th section of this treaty makes the law of nations, and the stipulations of the treaty of 1795, the rule of interpretation, and the 15th section of the treaty of 1795, w'hen applied to that of 1819, shows that citizens by domicil were included. To show the idea attached by the English courts to the term <em>citizen, </em>when used in a treaty, the case of <em>Maryatt </em>v. Wilson, 1 <em>Bos. d\u00a1- Pull. </em>430, will be sufficient. This was not a case o'f prize of war, but of citizenship; under a treaty.authorizing citizens of the United States, to trade to British ports in the West Indies, from which British subjects, except the East India Company, are rigorously excluded; yet a native British subject was considered as having so entirely changed his national character by commercial domicil, as to be within the terms of the treaty. Though the parties in that case are spoken of, as adopted or naturalized citizens of the United States, yet it no where appears that they had become so otherwise than by domiciliation; and even if they had been regularly naturalized under the laws of the United States, that would not have affected the principle, since nothing is more notorious than that Great Britian never permits a subject entirely to put off his allegiance, though, in common with all other civilized nations, she permits him to divest himself of national character, so far as to become a foreign merchant, and enjoy all the privileges incident to that character. Qualified commercial citizenship, in a foreign country, she recognizes in her subjects, complete municipal citizenship, she does not. It is clear then, that the intention of the contracting parties was, to extend the benefit of the treaty to all who bore the character of commercial citizens, whose interests the United States were bound to protect, because their property was American property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">But there is abundant evidence to shew that the board considered the <em>Bollmans </em>citizens, within the meaning of the treaty, and that evidence was competent. The cargoes of the Asia and Dolly, were not the only ones in which they had an interest. They had interests in tho'se of the Lenox and Molly, and claims were presented by persons in whom those interests were vested. When these cases first came before the board, they made an interlocutory decree, as in the case of the Asia and Dolly, allowing the claim, provided they should be of opinion, that the <em>Bollmans </em>were embraced by the treaty. Having satisfied themselves on that subject, they afterwards allowed the whole claim, which they apportioned among all the claimants, including those who claimed under the <em>Bollmans. </em>The final decrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>in these cases were given a few days before that of the 4-sia and Dolly came up for final adjudication. Having settled the principle in these two cases, under circumstances precisely similar, they of course applied it to the case before them. If it be said that their interests had passed into the hands of insurers, who were citizens, the answer is twofold. In the first place, the commissioners were\" to look to the original character of the claim, without regard to those in whom it had become vested; <em>Comegys </em>v. <em>Vasse, </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>211; and in the second place, the interest of the <em>Bollmans </em>in the cargoes of the Asia and Dolly, had passed to assignees, who were citizens, for the benefit of creditors, who were also citizens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASZ\">Was the evidence to prove this fact admissible <em>1 </em>The only evidence admitted by the District Court, was the record of the proceedings of the commissioners in the two cases referred to. No parol evidence was offered or received. The report of <em>Forrest, </em>the regularly constituted agent of the board, was strictly part of the record. The argument that the decision in those cases, is between other parties, loses sight of the peculiar character of the tribunal, and the object for which the evidence was offered. Though possessing a judicial character, the board do riot resemble an ordinary court of law, in which' one party impleads another, and the judgment <em>given, </em>affects themselves alone. It was a court of peculiar and exclusive jurisdiction. Before the board all the claimants under the treaty, were parties to all the cases, and it was the interest of each to exclude the others, the fund to be distributed being inadequate to the payment of all the demands upon it. It was a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>upon the fund, and in such case, the decision binds all the world. ' 1 <em>Phill.

It is to be observed too, that the evidence was not offered as the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, against the defendant, nor for any of those purposes for which evidence is usually offered, but to show the decision of the board, upon the construction of a treaty; to show that they had fixed a principle by which all cases of an analogous character were to be governed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"pAmP\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afb\">This is an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>for money had and received, brought by <em>Cramond, </em>the surviving assignee of <em>Eric </em>and <em>Lewis Bollman, </em>to recover their proportion of the sum of 136,265 dollars, awarded by the Commissioners under the Florida treaty, to <em>James Yard, </em>and others.

This memorial was examined by the Board, on the 15th June, 1822, and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On the 21st October, 1822, a supplemental memorial was filed, No. 1631, and with the original memorial, received on that day by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">On, Tuesday 29th July, 1823, the following proceedings, among others, took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">No. 1631. <em>James'Yard, </em>for himself and others \u2014 ship Asia and brig Dolly.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Upon examination of the testimony filed in support of this claim, the board are of opinion, that it be allowed as valid, for their pro-, portion of the nett proceeds of the cargoes of these vessels deposited in the royal treasury at Lima, from which must be deducted, such' sums as are claimed for those who are not- citizens of the United States, and,also any sum which is claimed under any person who was not such citizen at the time of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">On Monday, 16th February, 1824, the board proceeded as follows :\u2014 . '</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">Ship Asia, <em>'Peterson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Brig Dolly.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The board having heretofore received, examined, and allowed the claim, as valid, this day proceeded to ascertain the amount thereof, and do award to the claimants, the sum of one hundred and thirty-six . thousand two hundred and sixty-five' dollars, in. full, for the loss sustained in arrest of these vessels at Callao, by order of the Spanish. authorities, and the sale of their cargoes in 1801, which sum is to be paid to <em>James Yard, </em>for himself and others, $136,265,96.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">It is conceded by the defendant in error, and but faintly denied by the plaintiff, that the decree of the commissioners is conclusive, and of course not open to review, either directly or collaterally by suit. Independent of the authorities cited, on the conclusive nature of such decrees, the treaty itself furnishes evidence that such was the intention of the contracting parties. The United States exonorating Spain from all demands in future, on account of claims of citizens, &amp;c. and considering them entirely cancelled, undertook to make satisfaction for the same, to .an amount not exceeding five millions of dollars. To ascertain, the full amount and validity of these claims, a commission to consist of three commissioners, citizens of the United States, were to be appointed by the President, &amp;c. which commissioners were to meet at the city of Washington, and within the space of three years from the time of their first meeting, to receive, examine, and decide, upon the amount and validity of all the claims included within the descriptions mentioned in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>treaty. The commissioners were required <em>to </em>take an oath or affirmation, to be entered on the record of their proceedings, for the faithful and diligent discharge of their duties, &amp;c. They are authorized to hear and examine on oath, every question relative to said claims, and to receive all suitable authentic testimony concerning the same. It is required that the payment of such claims as may be admitted and adjusted by the commissioners, to an amount not exceeding five millions, shall be made by the United States, either immediately, &amp;c. or by creation of. a stock bearing interest, &amp;c. The record of the proceedings of the commissioners, together with the vouphers and documents produced <em>before </em>them, relative to the claims to-be adjusted'and decided upon by them, shall after the close of the transactions be deposited in the department of state, of the United States; and copies of them or any part of them, shall be furnished to the Spanish Government, if required, at the demand of the Spanish Minister, in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">By this summary of powers and duties of the board, it will be seen that the commissioners are invested with full and plenary authority to decide every question, as well the amount as the validity of the claims included in the treaty, whether the matter in dispute arises from objections as to the fact, or the law. The commissioners are ordered to keep a record of their proceedings, which together with the documents are ordered to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State, as well for the use and inspection of the Spanish Government, as of our own.' There is nothing in the treaty which countenances the idea,, that either party can resort to the tirdinary 'tribunals of the country, to alter or control the decisions of the commissioners. It would then be an assumption of authority on the part of this court, tb attempt to review the decision of this tribunal created by the contracting parties, for the speedy and final adjustment of all claims preferred under the treaty. It is then plain, that the principal, if not the only point, is to ascertain from the lights we have, what was the decision of the commissioners, for whether right or wrong, in law, or in fact, is immaterial, as we have no power to examine and correct the mistake, if any exists. Notwithstanding this, however, the plaintiff\u2019s and- defendant\u2019s counsel invoke the aid supposed to be derived from the interpretation of the treaty of the 22d February, 1819. They both claim the benefit of the presumption, that the commissioners have decided as they ought to have decided. For explanation of the decree, they have gone into an extended and able examination of tlje meaning of the term, \u201c citizens\u201d of the United States, used in the treaty as descriptive of the class of persons entitled to the benefit of the fund. It is contended on the one hand, that the interpretation of the word citizen, is to be settled, not <em>by </em>its definition, in a merely municipal sense, but as it has been, and-ought to be interpreted by the law of nations, and the decisions of the courts of prize. That it was the intention of the contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>parties to include all cases of American property traversing the ocean, in an American vessel, under the protection of the American flag, engaged in a lawful commerce, and owned by merchants residing and carrying on trade in any of the ports of the United States, under the sanction of the laws of the United States, whether citizens in the strict sense of the word, by birth or naturalization, or its extended sense, domiciliated for commercial and other purposes, and assuming the character of the country in which they reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">On the other hand, it is insisted, that by the term citizen, must be understood citizen, in the strict sense of the word, as known to the constitution and laws of the United Stales. That the provisions of the treaty, are for citizens of the United States, and the subjects of Spain, and that we must resort to the laws of each country, to know what they respectively meant, by citizens and subjects. That a citizen of the United States, must be either native or naturalized, and that subjects of Spain, are those who owe her full and not temporary allegiance. That a commercial resident, is not embraced, either within the words, or the spirit of the treaty. The point is of great importance, and not without difficulty, but as a decision of the question is not absolutely required, I am instructed to say, that the court do not wish to be considered as having formed any opinion upon it. It is deemed most prudent to decide the question when it directly arises, and not, as in this case, for the benefit of a presumption, which, whatever might be our sentiments in regard to it, would not alter the judgment in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The principal question, arises from the answer of the court to the defendant\u2019s first point, \u201c that the <em>Bolivians\u2019 </em>interest is clearly and conclusively rejected, by the decision of the Commissioners, on the face of their awards.\u201d To this point, I shall now direct my attention, and shall proceed to examine the nature and extent of the sentence, or decree of the Commissioners on the claims represented by Mr. <em>Yard, </em>arising out of the seizure of the cargoes of the ship Asia, and brig Dolly. Did the Commissioners include the claim of indemnity, made on account of the <em>Bolivians </em>and the <em>Walkers ? </em>If the claims were disallowed, with or without reason, there is no pretence to say, the plaintiff can recover in this suit, for the award is the foundation of their action. And however we may regret the situation in which the error of the Commissioners may have placed the parties, we cannot afford the necessary redress. In the interpretation of these decrees which are, it must be admitted, wanting in precision, we must refer to the matter which was before the board ; and this appears from the memorial, and the documentary evidence filed in pursuance of the directions of the treaty, and which form part of the proceedings. The claim for the whole interest in the Asia and the Dolly, was made by Mr. <em>Yard, </em>in virtue of a letter of attorney, from the persons interested in the cargoes. The memorial stated the different interests of the parties concerned, together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>-national character of the individuals, whom he represented. That the <em>Bollmans </em>were aliens born, and had been naturalized in 1802, a time subsequent to the loss. That the <em>Walkers </em>were also aliens born; that one of them had never become a citizen, but that the other had; and that all the other claimants were either natural born, or had .been naturalized previously, to the loss. The memorial of Mr. <em>Yard </em>also showed, that the claim was divided into two parts. One for the money, which was deposited in the royal treasury at Lima, amounting to upwards of 202,000 dollars, the other, for a sum due from a Mr. <em>Yrissary, </em>which he had received out of the proceeds of the sale of the cargoes of the Asia and the Dolly. The first memorial was rejected, but' the second, which contains a full and able examination of the whole case was received; but still it is apparent, that two objections remained, the one to the claim on account of the money due from <em>Yrissary, </em>the other an objection to the national character of the <em>Bollmans </em>and the <em>Walkers. </em>Of this, we cannot entertain a doubt, for they alone came within the discription of commercial residents; the others, without exception, were either native born, or naturalized citizens. With these representations, the proof accompanying them, and the question of national character for decision, the commissioners decreed, \u201c that the claim is valid, for their proportion of the nett proceeds of the cargoes of these vessels, (Asia and Dolly,) deposited imthe royal treasury at'Lima, from which must be deducted such sums as are claimed by those, who are not citizens of the United States; and also, \u00bfny sum which.is claimed under any person, who was not such citizen at the time of the loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The commissioners decree, that the claim, viz. Mr. <em>Yard\u2019s </em>claim, is valid, (it must be recollected, the whole claim was at first rejected,) but iheyconfin'e'the award to the sum deposited in the royal treasury at Lima, excluding that part of the claim, made by Mr. <em>Yard, </em>on account of the, money received by Yrissary.. If the decree had stopped here, who could have doubted the intention of the commissioners, to include the Messrs. <em>Bollmans </em>and <em>Walkers ? </em>But unfortunately for them, the decree contains an exception, which is senseless, unless it is construed to embrace their case. For it proceeds to say, \u201c from which must be deducted such sums, as are claimed by those who are not citizens of the United States; and also, any sum which is claimed under any person, who was not such citizen at the time of the loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The question has been asked, to which no satisfactory reply has been given; why except from- the benefit of the fund, those who are not citizens of the United States, unless it was intended to exclude those who were not citizens, in the strict municipal sense of the term. Why introduce any exception into the decree, at all, unless it was designed to exclude the claim of the <em>Bollmans </em>and the <em>Walkers, </em>whose claims alone are included within the exception, and to whose demand after the presentation of the second memorial, alone objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tions were made. A sum was claimed by and for the <em>Walkers, </em>one of whom was not then a citizen, and the other was not at the time of the loss, and a sum was claimed by the assignees, of the <em>Bollmans, </em>who were not citizens at the time of the loss. The sentence of the commissioners has a direct and special reference to these claims, and to none other; and to give the decree any other construction, we must suppose that the commissioners used language without meaning, and inapplicable to the case before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The decree, it must remarked, is in its nature interlocutory, and not final. It was necessary for the commissioners, in addition to an order, as regards the right of the different class of claimants, to .settle the amount to which Mr. <em>Yard, </em>as the representative of the persons whose claims were allowed, was entitled. In pursuance of this further duty, on the 16th February, 1824,-the commissioners made a final award, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The board having heretofore received, examined, and allowed the claim as valid, this day proceeded to ascertain the amount thereof, and do award to the claimants, the sum of one hundred and thirty-six thousand two hundred and sixty-five dollars, in full, for the loss sustained in the arrest of these vessels at Callao, by order of the Spanish authorities, and the sale of their cargoes in 1801; which sum is to be paid to <em>James Yard, </em>for himself and others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAW\">If the interpretation of the interlocutory decree be correct, there is nothing in the final decree, which does, or purports to interfere with that interpretation. It is in no part intimated, that a re-examination and change of opinion on the part of the commissioners, had taken place, but on the contrary, the former decision is made the basis of the final award. The commissioners refer to and incorporate their first order in the final decree, in language which cannot be mistaken. It is inconceivable, that in an affair of such magnitude, if the minds of the commissioners had undergone a change on the legal point, whether a commercial resident was embraced by the treaty, something should not appear on the record of their proceedings, indicative of such change of opinion. The former order is expressly referred to, and confirmed,so as to constitute but one decree, and these decrees are in the most perfect harmony with each other. Nor does the use of the word \u201cClaimants,\u201d invalidate this construction. That word, if we give language its ordinary import, has reference to those, who before had been decided to be lawful claimants, and citizens of the United States, in a municipal sense. The conclusion to which the court has come, is strengthened by the fact, that the amount claimed by Mr. <em>Yard, </em>deposited in the Royal treasury at Lima, is upwards of 202,000 dollars. It does not appear, that any reason was alleged for the reduction of that amount, except the disallowance of these claims, and yet we find, that the board allowed only 136,265 dollars, which is about the sum Mr. <em>Yard </em>would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>entitled to receive, after deducting the amount claimed, on account of the Messrs. <em>Bollmans </em>and the <em>Walkers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">It is in vain then, to allege that it is ungenerous to refuse them a participation in the fund. It would be a manifest wrong; that they should be paid at the expense of the other shippers. If the <em>Bollmans </em>have been injured, it is not by the other claimants, but by the sentence of the tribunal, whose duty it was to receive, examine, and settle all conflicting claims, and to whom full power was committed, to decide all questions of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">This opinion of the courts disposes of the whole case, and thus dispenses with the necessity of a minute examination of the principles of evidence, ruled at the trial.- The evidence was admitted for purposes of explanation, but as the proceedings do not need the aid of extrinsic evidence, it was clearly inadmissible on that ground. But in addition to this, there is no principle better settled, than that a judgment or decree of a court is evidence, in another suit only,' as against parties and privies. But it is said, that this was a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and as such binding on all parties. And in one sense this is true, but this cannot make the proceedings in another case, between other parties, and under different circumstances, evidence, to control the plain import of the decree itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
