one of <em>Joel Funk </em>his brother, and the other of <em>Jesse Cook </em>his agent, to sustain his cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\"><em>Joel Funk </em>of the county of Champaign, Ohio, being examined on behalf of the plaintiff deposed, that in September, 1828, in conversation with <em>Hannah Downing </em>and <em>Sarah Downing, </em>they said that . if <em>Daniel Funk </em>(plaintiff,) would give time, they would see an account paid that deponent then presented to them: and in answer to the third interrogatory, he said, that in September, 1828, he called at the dwelling of <em>Hannah Downing </em>and <em>Sarah Downing </em>with a bill against <em>Israel Downing, </em>in favour of plaintiff. The amount of said bill was about one hundred and thirty dollars. After making known his business, <em>Hannah Downing </em>withdrew for a short time, and when she returned, said <em>Israel Downing </em>was sick and could not be seen; and also said, he, <em>Israel, </em>appeared sorry he could not then 'discharge the bill. Then <em>Sarah Downing </em>said she had assumed the payment of a bill from <em>David Cook </em>against <em>Israel Downing, </em>and would also pay this if longer time would be given. Deponent requested her to give her obligation for the amount of the bill presented, which she refused to do. <em>Hansiah Downing </em>said that <em>Sarah Downing\u2019s </em>word could be relied on, and that she <em>Hannah Downing </em>would vouch for the payment if time was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">The conversation referred to, took place on the first floor of \u2022the dwelling of <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Sarah Downing. </em>Deponent did not know where <em>Israel Downing </em>was, but was told that he was sick and in bed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">In answ'er to the first cross-interrogatory, he said, he had seen <em>Hannah Downing </em>one of the defendants twice. The first time in September 1828. The second time in the summer of 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">In answer to the third cross-interrogatory, he said,.he called upon defendants with a bill, as stated in answer to third interrogatory, in favour of plaintiff; saw both the defendants at that time ; saw them together, except when <em>Hannah Downing </em>withdrew, as stated in answer to the third interrogatory. They were in the same apart-ment and on the first floor of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-12\">In answer to the fourth interrogatory, he said, he had a conyer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>sation with the defendants relative to the bill in the third interrogatory, and would refer to the answer to that interrogatory for the substance of the conversation as near as could be recollected. <em>Isaac Downing </em>was present part of the time, and he thought heard some part of the conversation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">- Deposition of <em>Jesse Cook, </em>taken in Adams county, Pennsylvania, states, \u201c that he knows the parties in the foregoing action \u2014 that <em>Daniel Funk </em>informed this affirmant of a claim that he the said <em>Daniel </em>held against <em>Israel Downing, </em>and requested this affirmant to call on Mr. <em>Downing </em>for the amount of the demand. He called sometime in the summer of 1829, and not s\u00e9eing Mr. <em>Downing, </em>and on informing <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Israel Downing\u2019st </em>mother of the claim that the said <em>Funk </em>held against <em>Israel Downing, </em>they the said <em>Hannah </em>and <em>Sarah </em>said, provided the said <em>Daniel Funk </em>would wait he should be paid, as they would pay him ;that they believed Mr. <em>Funk\u2019s </em>claim against <em>Israel Downing </em>to.be just.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">Evidence was given on the part of the defendant to discredit the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s two witnesses, and some rebutting testimony was also produced on the part of the plaintiff. None of this evidence however is material to the point now in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to instruct the jury on the following points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">1. Definiteness and certainty, as opposed to the vague and general, are necessary in the terms of every consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">2. A stipulation to forbear to sue for a time, for some time, or for a longer time, is insufficient, as a consideration of a contract to pay the debt of another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-11\">3. If therefore there is no evidence in this case of a stipulation on the part of <em>Hannah </em>to pay the debt in question, upon more certain and definite terms, than waiting or forbearing for a time, or giving time, or some time, or a longer time, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-12\">4. Neither the testimony of <em>Jesse Cook </em>nor of <em>Joel Funk </em>supplies the definiteness and certainty necessary in such cases. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-13\">5. The plaintiff having declared upon a joiht contract cannot recover by proof of a several one, and there is no evidence to support the allegation of a joint contract, except that of <em>Jesse -Cook. </em>If the jury therefore doubt the correctness of his testimony, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-14\">. 6. The averments in the declaration are not supported by any evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-15\">The Court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-16\">Having stated to the Jury, that the consideration for the promise of the defendants as stated in the declaration was, that <em>Israel Downing </em>being indebted to <em>Funk, </em>in consideration that he, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the instance of <em>Sarah </em>and <em>Hannah Downing, </em>would forbear and give time to <em>Israel, </em>they would pay; and that he did forbear and give time as stated in the declaration was a good consideration, well laid, and if proved the plaintiff was entitled to recover: that it need not be proved in the terms or words laid, but that it W'as sufficient if substantially proved ; that if, at the instance of the defendants, he would wait, forbear and give time to <em>Israel, </em>thereby absolutely suspending his right to sue <em>Israel </em>for a time certain, or for a reasonable time, or indefinitely, and thus subjecting to loss, delay or disadvantage, in consideration of which the defendant promised to pay the debt, and that he did so wait for a time alleged or for a reasonable time; such a state of things substantially proved to the satisfaction of the jury, would make out the plaintiff\u2019s case and entitle him to recover; the court then referred to the points of the defendants as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">The first two propositions are true, and as general principles are applicable to all cases of this kind, but are chiefly applicable to the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">The third proposition is predicated upon the supposition that there is no evidence in this case of a stipulation on the part of <em>Hannah Downing </em>to pay the debt in question upon more certain or definite terms, than waiting or forbearing for a time, or some time, or a longer time, in which case the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. But I have already said that there is a sufficient cause of action laid before you in the declaration, a forbearance for a reasonable time, or a time certain or indefinite, and as there is evidence fairly before you, from the consideration of which it is your duty to determine whether the. cause of action is substantially proved \u2014this proposition cannot be affirmed as stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">It is for you to say whether the parol evidence by <em>Jesse Cook </em>or <em>Joel Funk, </em>or either of them substantially proves the contract stated in the declaration and thus supplies \u201c all the definiteness and certainty required in such cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-9\">The plaintiff having declared upon a joint contract cannot re- \u2022 cover by proof of a several one. But I cannot say there is no evidence to support the allegations of a joint contract except that of <em>Jesse Cook. </em>The whole deposition of <em>Joel Funk </em>is before you, and from it also you are to judge whether a joint or several contract is proved: all the evidence is before you, and from it you are to judge whether the contract is proved substantially as laid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-10\">There is evidence before you in support of the averment in the declaration. I cannot say there is no evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-11\">Assignment and specification of errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-12\">1st.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmT\">Some of the principles discussed here, are not. embraced by the assignment of errors; and as they have recently been settled in <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Russel </em>at the last term for the Western District, I shall consider but the points immediately raised on the record. These arise not so much out of principles, as their application to the evidence. The consideration laid in the first count, is forbearance for a reasonable time; and in the second, for an indefinite time. To maintain these allegations, the testimony of two witnesses was adduced; the first of whom proved a promise to pay if the plaintiff <em>\u2018 </em>would give time,\u2019 and, in. a subsequent part of his examination a promise to pay if \u2018 longer time\u2019 were given. In common parlance the words longer time are as indefinite as the word time without an adjunct; and they are equivalent to it in strict meaning, the adjunct being redundant. The other witness testified to a promise to \u2018 wait,\u2019 without any adjunct whatever. The popular sense of this last word, when used nakedly and in reference to a debt, is precisely that of the word forbear, which, when unqualified by terms of restriction, has regard to a general forbearance. To the first prayer for a direction that definiteness and certainty, as opposed to the vague and the general, are necessary in the terms of any consideration, the Judge responded in substance, that a promise to pay in consideration that -the plaintiff would wait, forbear, or give time, indefinitely or for a reasonable time, at the instance and request of the defendant, would maintain the declaration. There certainly was no error in that; and the application of the principle he left on the evidence, to the proper judges of the meaning of the words. He went further, and intimated that a suspension of the right to sue the original debtor, ought to be an ingredient in the consideration \u2014 a position not sustained in <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Russel, </em>as proper to be taken unless where the defendant\u2019s promise, and not performance of it, is relied on as the consideration. He undoubtedly\" went as far in the defendant\u2019s favour, without trenching on the province of the jury, as the facts would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The counsel prayed a further direction ; that a stipulation to pay on terms no more definite than waiting or forbearing for a time, or giving time, or a longer time, would not \u00e9ntitle the plaintiff to. recover ; and that the t\u00e9stimony of the two witnesses did not supply the certainty necessary in such a case. The- abstract proposition, \u2022 thus put, was affirmed; and its dependence on the evidence for matter of fact, was properly left to the jury. It is to be remarked that nothing was said by the witnesses about waiting for <em>a </em>tim\u00e9, or giving <em>some </em>time; and that but one of them spoke of a proposal to give <em>longer </em>time. The same witness, however, testified in another part of his examination, that it was to give time generally; and the other witness, instead of the words \u2018 give time,\u2019 used the word \u2018wait\u2019 which has in country parlance, the same signification. There was evidence therefore on which the jury <em>might </em>find a promise in consideration of forbearance which was determined in <em>Hamaker </em>v. <em>Eberly, 2 Binney </em>510, tobe equivalent to <em>general </em>forbearance; andas it does not seem to have been a point of defence at the trial, that the forbearance was not in faq.t at the instance and request of the defendants, we cannot entertain an objection on that ground here. The residue of the prayer \u2014 to say whether there was evidence of a joint promise \u2014 was properly denied, as one of the witnesses asserted it positively, and the other less pointedly; after which the matter became a question exclusively for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
