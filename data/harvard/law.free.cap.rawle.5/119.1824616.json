The argument upon the exceptions was then suspended, and the counsel was requested by the court, to argue the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">The counsel on both sides, agreeing as-to the right of the court t.o issue the <em>certiorari </em>in this case, the question was argued by <em>Olmsted </em>and <em>Smith, </em>who contended,\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-11\">1. That the action before the mayor was a strictly popular one, not intended to compensate the plaintiff for any injury suffered by him, but to punish the defendant, and therefore not a <em>.civil action </em>within-the act of March 20, 1810, taking away the writ of <em>certiorari. Buckwalter </em>v. <em>the United States, </em>II <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>193. <em>Zeigler </em>v. <em>Gram, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>102. <em>Davy </em>v. <em>Baker, 4 Burr. </em>2471. A writ of <em>certiorari </em>may issue from this court to remove' the proceedings of a justice under the act of 1705, relative to swine running at large. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fourteen Hogs, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-12\">2. The right of this court to issue a <em>certiorari </em>to the mayor, even incivil actions, has never been taken away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-13\">The act of March 20, 1810, refers only to <em>justices of the peace. </em>Justices of the peace, are a class of officers, whose appointment is provided for in section 10, of art. 5, of the constitution. A mayor is a magistrate of an entirely distinct class, deriving his appointment from a different source, and exercising different functions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-14\">If the mayor is a justice of the peace, he is entitled to the civil jurisdiction conferred, upon the latter officer, by the act of March 20, 1810, which has never been pretended. If he is included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the term, \u201c justice of the peace-,\u201d in the 24th section of the act, he must be included in the same term in thepther sections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">It can make no difference that the mayor has, to some extent, the powers of a justice \u2014 his office of mayor is not merged. The judges of the Common Pleas are, by the constitution, justices of the peace. Does the act of 1810, therefore take away the <em>certiorari </em>to them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">The act of 1810 takes away from parties to civil actions before a justice of the peace, the protection of this court, and therefore ought to be, and always has been, strictly construed. In <em>Lenox </em>v. <em>M\u2018Gall, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>101, it was held that a <em>certiorari </em>lay to the proceedings of'two aldermen under the act of April 6, 1802. A similar construction was applied in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Yeat, 4 Binn. </em>185.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">If this court cannot issue a <em>certiorari </em>to the mayor, parties injured by his judgments will be without remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">By section 8, of art. 5, of the constitution, the judges of the courts of Common Pleas have power to issue writs of <em>certiorari </em>to justices of the peace. They have no authority under the constitution, or under any act of assembly, to issue a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to the mayor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-10\">This court has ample power. Judiciary act of May 22, 1722. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaumont, 4 Rawle, </em>366.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AuQ\">The opinion of' the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b122-12\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">By the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1810, it is declared that \u201c no writ of <em>certiorari </em>by or out of the Supreme Court to any justice of the peace in any <em>civil </em>suit or action, shall be available to remove the proceedings had before such justice.\u201d Is the present then a civil suit ? Whatever may have been the notions of the courts in the earlier times, the point was solemnly considered and decided in <em>Atcheson </em>v. <em>Everitt, Corp. </em>382, where it was determined that actions strictly popular and not compensatory, are not criminal prosecutions but civil suits. The question was, whether in an action of debt on the 2 G. 2, c. 24, section 7, which gives a penalty for bribery to any one who will sue for it, the testimony of a Quaker might be received on his solemn affirmation pursuant to the 8 and 9 W. 3, which authorises such testimony, except in \u2018 any criminal cause/ and the 22 G. 2 c. 30, which prohibits it in \u2018 any criminal case / and it was adjudged competent, though the action was not only popular but productive of personal disabilities. In delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Mansfield remarked that penal actions had never been ranked with criminal prosecutions by elementary writers;and that such a proceeding was as much a civil action as if it were for money had and received. In this he is certainly corroborated by <em>Wynn </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>125, in which it was held that an action for double damages as a penalty for a false return, given by the 7 and 8 W 3, c. 7, to the party aggrieved, is not a criminal prosecution but a civil action, and amendable, as such, by the 16 and 17 Car. 2, c. 8, though the 4 G. 2, c. 26, excepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>criminal cases from the operation of the statutes of jeofails; and the judgment was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber. It must be admitted however, that the damages beyond mere compensation, were given to the party injured; but Lord Mansfield recognised no distinction on that head. Such is the law as settled on principle and the latest authority in England. But as standing in opposition to it, is cited the decision in <em>Buckwalter v. The United States, </em>11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>193, in which it was said generally by Mr. Justice Duncan, delivering the opinion of the court, th.at an action of debt on a penal statute, is not within the compulsory arbitration act which is applicable in its terms but to civil suit.s. The action there, however, was brought by a sovereign for an infraction of the laws of the land, and not, as here, for the infraction of the bye-law of a corporation ; and though it has beeq determined that the United States, when descending to the level of an ordinary suitor in a state court, divests herself of the prerogative of a sovereign, yet it may well be thought that her action for, a breach of the criminal laws is not a civil suit within the intent and meaning of the arbitration act, which has-in other instances been construed more restrictively than the letter would seem to require; as in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>76, and <em>Deal </em>v. <em>Deal, </em>7 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>201, where, it seems to have been thought that account render, though indisputably a civil action, was not originally within its purview; and in <em>Roop </em>v. <em>Meek, </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>345, the same thing seems to have been thought of an action on a bail bond or a recognisance in a criminal prosecution, the court having a discretionary power to stay proceedings, or to remit or moderate the penalty. In <em>Buckwalter </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>policy required that the accused should not be suffered to baffle the prosecution by arbitrating the question of criminality with his pi'osecutor; and that was in truth the ground of the decision, though Mr. Justice Duncan, as was his custom, brought to the defence of his position every technical principle and authority that could be .brought to bear upon the argument. He was perhaps inaccurate in saying that statutes of amendment do not extend to penal actions, except perhaps where the state is prosecutor. Here, however, the state is not a! party, as the plaintiff prosecutes for himself and a corporation..</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">It is contended however, that though the action be a civil one, the writ of <em>certiorari </em>may well lie from this court to the mayor who is not a-justice of the peace, and whose proceedings therefore are not within the prohibitory clause. But he is clothed with no other jurisdiction than that of an alderman who is virtually a justice, and whose proceedings can be dealt with by the courts of record only as such. The root of the matter is, that the mayor had no jurisdiction of the cause of action by the general law giving civil jurisdiction to justices and aldermen; and the legislative power of the corporation was incompetent to supply the deficiency, as was \u2018determined in <em>Barter </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>3 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>260. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The judgment being void, there needs no reversal. However worthy of decision by the court in the last resort, it seems impossible to get at the question in the present shape. The end might perhaps be attained by an indictment in the Mayor\u2019s Court; and though it may be inconvenient if not oppressive in practice to prosecute every breach of an ordinance in tha't way, an application to the' legislature would doubtless produce an appropriate remedy saving to the accused his constitutional right to a trial by jury on appeal. We are however to administer the law as we find it: and we feel ourselves not at liberty to disregard the injunction which forbids us to take jurisdiction of the question by <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Writ quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-7\">Huston, J. was absent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
