His father advanced this sum' to <em>Ilenry </em>and took his note for the same, dated the first of April, 1823. <em>Ilenry </em>afterwards came again and asked his father to advance him one hundred and thirty dollars more, to pay another debt, which the father advanced to <em>Henry </em>and took his note for this sum, dated the 10th of May, 1823. <em>Baltzer Earnest </em>told his son <em>Henry </em>when he paid him the two hundred and fourteen dollars, he never expected to receive it in his lifetime, and that it was to go against <em>Henry\u2019s </em>share of the estate. He told <em>Henry </em>he must not expect to spend the other children\u2019s money: that these advancements must be against his share of the father\u2019s estate, at his death. I remember it was in the spring of 1823, when <em>Henry </em>wanted the two hundred and fourteen dollars to pay Mr. <em>Wentz. </em>J recollect <em>Henry </em>failed at that time and sold out, and was not able to pay his debts. He was there twice about the two hundred and fourteen dollars. <em>Henry </em>called on his father to pay a debt of <em>Jacob Redifer; </em>two bills of about twenty dollars, one in March 1824, and one in December, 1824. His father said he could pay these bills, but it must go against <em>Henry\u2019s </em>share of his estate, and <em>Henry </em>was so agreed and his father paid them. In 1827, <em>Henry Earnest </em>and <em>Jesse Earnest </em>came to their father\u2019s two different times, and <em>Henry </em>requested his father to pay <em>Jesse Earnest </em>seventy-nine dollars and twenty-eight cents, the amount of a note he had against <em>Henry. </em>The first time'the father said he did not know whether he would do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>it or not; he had advanced so much to <em>Henry, </em>he thought <em>Henry </em>would spend all his share before his father\u2019s death. The second time they called the father said he would answer the note but it should come against <em>Henry\u2019s </em>share of the father\u2019s estate after his death. <em>Henry </em>was agreed to it that it should, and it was paid by <em>Baltzer Earnest </em>the father, in the spring of 1829, after <em>Henry\u2019s </em>death. The second time they called was in May or June, 1827. The note was not assigned to <em>Baltzer Earnest. Henry Earnest </em>and Dr. <em>Jones </em>came to <em>Henry\u2019s </em>father, and <em>Henry </em>requested his father to pay a debt of twenty dollars to Dr. <em>Jones. </em>His father told <em>Henry </em>he would pay it, but it should come against his share of the father\u2019s estate. <em>Henry </em>agred to it, and his father afterwards paid this to Dr. <em>Jones </em>in May, 1828. <em>Henry </em>was upwards of thirty years old at the time of his death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\"><em>Jacob Redifer </em>a witness on the part of the defendants, testified as follows: \u201c <em>Baltzer Earnest </em>paid me two bills I had against his son <em>Henry Earnest. </em>He paid me one bill of six dollars and forty-two cents, the 12th of March, 1824; and the other of thirteen dollars and ninety-three dents, he paid me the 24th of December, 1824.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then offered in evidence, a promissory not\u00e9 from the said <em>Henry Earnest, </em>to the said <em>Baltzer Earnest </em>for two hundred and fifty dollars, dated the 1st of April, 1823, (the same above mentioned in <em>Catherine Earnest\u2019s </em>testimony,) of which the following is a copy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-8\">\u201c I promise to pay, or cause to be paid unto <em>Baltzer Earnest, </em>senior, or order, the just and full sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, in' six months after this date, with interest at three per cent., until paid, it being for value received, as witness my hand this 1st day of April 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-9\">$250. <em>Henry Earnest, </em>[l. s.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-10\">\u201c Witness present,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-11\">\n<em>William Earnest.\u201d</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-12\">And also, a certain other promissory note from said <em>Henry Earnest </em>to <em>Baltzer Earnest, </em>for one hundred and thirty dollars, dated May 10th, 1823.

His father then advanced <em>Henry </em>one hundred and thirty dollars more, and <em>Henry </em>then gave his father the above mentioned note for one hundred and thirty dollars, dated May 10th, 1823: That immediately after advancing said respective sums of two hundred and fifty dollars, and one hundred and thirty dollars, and taking the said notes therefor, and at other times afterwards, when <em>Henry </em>would want his father to advance him more money, his father told his son <em>Henry </em>that the above mentioned sums of two hundred and fifty dollars, and one hundred and thirty dollars were towards <em>Henry\u2019s </em>share of his father\u2019s estate, and to come against his share at his father\u2019s death: That these sums were not to be received from <em>Henry </em>in the father\u2019s lifetime, but to come against <em>Henry\u2019s </em>share at his death. <em>Henry </em>always replied he expected that, and was agreed thatsthese sums should come against his share at his father\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the admission of the said notes, and testimony of <em>Catherine Earnest, </em>in evidence, contending that they were no evidence of advancements by the said <em>Baltzer Earnest, </em>to his sori <em>Henry.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">The court was of opinion that the said notes and testimony of <em>Catherine Earnest, </em>should not be admitted in evidence, and that the said sums of two hundred and fifty dollars, and one hundred \u2022 and thirty dollars were not advancements to'the said <em>Henry Earnest, </em>and accordngly rejected the evidence.

The rejection of the promissory notes given by <em>Henry Earliest </em>to <em>Baltzer Earnest, </em>and \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">2d. The refusal to admit the notes with the <em>explanatory evidence </em>of <em>Catharine Earnest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">As to the first point, it seems to have been conceded on the argument. in the court below, that.a debt due by a son to a'father, cannot be set off in a suit brought by the grand-chijdren for a distributive share of the estate of the grandfather. .Now, it appears to us, that whether the notes were evidence of a debt, or are to be taken as an advancement, is immaterial, so far as their admissibility in evidence is concerned. It is clear, that ii <em>Henry Earnest, </em>the father of the plaintiffs, had been, alive and had brought suit for a distributive share of the estate, the administrators could have availed themselves of the defence, and it is not perceived in what respects the plaintiffs are in a better situation. They claim not as next of kin, but by right of representation; for by the third section of the act of the 19th of April, 1794, such issue are allowed to inherit <em>such share only, </em>as would have descended to the parent, if such parent had been living. And the 9th section, which relates to advancement, contains this exception; that when the issue to take shall not be of equal degree to the person dying, seized or possessed, the several descendants taking by way of representation, shall inherit such share only, as would have descended or been distributed, to his, her, or their parent or ancestor, if such parent or ancestor had been then living.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">There has been no direct decision on\u2019the effect of the above section in this state, but on the construction of the English statutes of distribution, which are in substance the same, many points have been ruled, and to these, it will be only necessary briefly to advert. The cases are classed under three heads.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">1st. Where none of the intestate\u2019s children are dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>2d. Where the intestate\u2019s children are all dead, all of them having left children.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">3d. Where some of the intestate\u2019s children are living, and some dead, and such as are dead have left children.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In the two first classes the parties are said to take <em>per capita, </em>or in other words, equal shares in their own rights; but in the last case, the grand-children take <em>per stirpes, </em>that is to say, not in their own right, but by representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">This case is one of the last description, and as the plaintiffs entitle themselves as representing their parent only, they must take the share which descended to them, with all the burden with which it would have been charged, had their parent been living.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The primary object of the act is <em>equality </em>in the different branches, springing from the common ancestor; and this <em>effect </em>is produced by placing the grand-children so far as the other heirs are concerned, but no further, in the place of their respective'parents. It has been decided in <em>Proud </em>v. <em>Turner, 2 P. Wms. </em>560, that if a child who has received any advancement from his father, shall die in his father\u2019s life-time, leaving children, such children shall not be admitted to their father\u2019s distributive share, unless they bring in his advancements, since as his representatives, they would have no better claim than he would have had, if living. As the issue stands in the place and stead of the father in cases of an advancement, th\u00e9re could be no reason why they should be in a better condition than their father would have been, if he had claimed his distributive share when largely indebted to the estate, of which he desired to participate. 3 <em>Bacon\u2019s Ab. </em>75. 1 <em>Equity Cases Abridged, </em>249. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Walsh, Precedents in Chan. </em>54. <em>Toller, </em>374. 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The disposition thus made of the first point, makes the second of but little importance. For the administrators admit that these notes although <em>prima facia </em>evidence of a debt, were intended as an advancement ; and this it is no longer the interest of the plaintiffs to deny, for it makes this difference to them, that as a debt, they must account for principal and interest; but as an advancement for principal only.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">But it is said the question of advancement, can only be settled in the Orphans\u2019 Court.- That it may be settled in that court, there is no doubt; but that it <em>must, </em>is not so clear. An administration account, is an exhibit of the estate of the intestate of which an advancement is properly no part. A child to whom an advancement has been made, cannot be called on to supply a deficiency of the estate for the benefit of either creditors, or legatees, for that is no part of the assets of the estate. The act does not divest the child of any property which has been given to him, however unequal it may have been, or how much soever it may exceed the residue; he may if he pleases, keep it all. If he be not contented, but would have more, then he must bring what he has before received, as the law expresses it, into <em>hotch pot, </em>that is, into the general mass of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>.property to be divided. But a child is not compelled to bring the amount of his advancement into hotch pot, until the balance has been struck, and the amount of the surplus to be distributed, has been ascertained. When the value of the estate is known, if he is not satisfied with what he has received, he must account for the amount he had already been advanced; when the balance is struck and distribution of the surplus is to be made, then, and not till then, it becomes important to ascertain the amount which each of the heirs or distributees has received, either from the administrator or the ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Distribution, is usually made either under the 13th or 16th section, of the act of 1794, that, is, either with or without an application to the Orphans\u2019 Court,' taking a bond with sufficient securities, to indemnify the administrator against any debts that might afterwards be recovered against the estate. When an application is made to the Orphans\u2019 Court, they no doubt would have power to inquire into and settle the amount of the advancements, and to make a special decree ascertaining the respective rights of each, and the persons to whom distribution should be made. But it has not been usual to make a special decree, but the practice with some exceptions .in <em>the </em>Orphans\u2019 Court, has been to make a general decree, that the balance be distributed according to law, leaving it to the administrator, taking the security prescribed by the act, to pay to each person entitled, the amount of his distributive share, or in case of difficulty, to settle the right of the respective heirs in a suit in the common law courts. Where the advancement is of a certain value, as of a sum of money, either the administrator or the Orphans\u2019 Court, can settle the distribution without difficulty; when it is uncertain, as a tract of land, for example, a jury would seem to be the appropriate tribunal. In some cases it must be admitted, a settlement in the Orphans\u2019 Court has an advantage over a common law tribunal, as the Orphans\u2019 Court acting as a court of equity, have the power to bring all the parties before them, and can settle the controversy by one decree, as for example, when several of the children have been advanced, and a controversy exists as to the amount or value of the advancement of one or all of them, the Orphans\u2019 Court can and ought to take jurisdiction of the cause. When some of the heirs reside out of the state, the manner of proceeding is prescribed by the act of the 13th of March, 1815. But where all the heirs reside in the state, there is no statutory regulation. The inconveniences which caused the enactment do not exist here, and in such cases the manner of proceeding prescribed by the act of 1815, may furnish a safe rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In the latter case, the amount which each had been advanced, may be.readily ascertained by application to the parties, or by application to the Orphans\u2019 Court, with notice to the heirs. But this can be necessary only where the administrator has notice, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>some of the heirs have been advanced, for when he makes distribution, either with or without the sanction of the court, but without notice of any advancement made by the ancestor, he should be protected. And this would seem to be equitable, for all that an administrator has a right to require from the distributees, under the act of 1794, is an indemnity against debts that might be afterwards recovered from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
