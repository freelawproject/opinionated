The witness replied that he did tell her of a conversation with <em>Robert Lewis. </em>Mr. <em>Tilghman, </em>counsel for the plaintiff, objected to the witness stating what the conversation was. The objection however was overruled by a majority of the court, and the evidence admitted, to which admission the plaintiff excepted, and the court sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">The witness proceeded to testify as to what her husband had said. He said \u201c <em>Robert </em>and him had had one of their long talks, when he came home. The reply he made was, it was a little masonry, and not for women to know. He believed it was <em>Robert\u2019s </em>will they had been signing, and not uncle\u2019s. He did not tell me the conversation between him \u2022 and <em>Robert; </em>nor I never knowed it, nor never asked him1 \u2014 not till since uncle\u2019s death. <em>Eli </em>told me that night, he would not for a twenty dollar bill have put his hand to that paper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-12\">The plaintiff in error assigned for error,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-13\">1st.

Having said that her husband had told her <em>\u2018of </em>a conversation with <em>Robert Lewis,\u2019 </em>Mr. <em>Tilghman </em>objected to the witness\u2019s stating <em>what that conversation was; </em>being allowed to relate it, she said, \u201cHe <em>did not tell me </em>the conversation between him and <em>Robert, </em>nor I never know\u2019d it, nor never asked him till since uncle\u2019s death.\u201d Is not that the very case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>11 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, 362, </em>where it was held that the inability of a witness to answer an improper question, cured the error in allowing it to be put? It is true the witness here, added other matters that were possibly inadmissible; but these were suffered to pass without exception, and they cannot be made the subject of error here.</p>\n<p id=\"AslH\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
