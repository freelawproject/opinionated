The justice gave judgment against the defendant for fifty-two dollars and fifty cents, from which he appealed to the Court of Common Pleas; and the case was referred under the compulsory arbitration act. The arbitrators reported in favour of the plaintiff, thirty-one dollars and fifty cents; and that each party should pay his own costs. The defendant obtained a rule to show cause, why judgment should not be entered without costs, and the defendant allowed his daily \u2022pay, counsel fee, and costs on the appeal.. This rule was discharged by the court, and was the error assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-9\">The plaintiff gave evidence before the arbitrators, which she had mot given before the justice. The defendant produced no evidence before the arbitrators, which had not been before the justice. On the trial before the arbitrators <em>John High, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s son, who had not been examined before the justice, was produced by the plaintiff. After he had been examined, and had withdrawn to another part of the room, the defendant told him not to depart, as he wished to examine him further. He was afterwards called by the defendant, immediately after the plaintiff had closed, and he testified as follows: \u2014 \u201cMr. <em>Sergeant </em>lived at the corner of Fourth and Wood street, about two squares from my mother\u2019s, where he kept a drug store, and <em>Jesse Wildemuth, </em>was with him. <em>Jesse </em>brought him to our house.

Costs are exclusively a matter of statutory regulation. 1 <em>Penn. R. </em>461. <em>Ashmead, </em>3.

The award being less than the judgment, and the defendant having given no new evidence before the arbitrators, which deprived him of costs, he is entitled to recover his costs on the appeal, from the plaintiff The act of 1810, sec. 4, gives the defendant his costs on appeal, if he succeeds in reducing the judgment of the justice; if he produces no other evidence, than that which he exhibited before the justice. The condition is annexed to prevent him from holding back his evidence, before the justice. 1 <em>Browne, </em>206. 16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>168. No small or accidental variance of proof, will discharge the appellee 'from costs. The general rule is, that .if the appellant produces new evidence to strengthen his case, he loses his right to costs. 16- <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 168. If </em>he called a witness who could testify to nothing, he would not lose his costs; for the same reason if the witness could not testify to any thing pertinent to the case, it would not affect his costs. In this case, the new evidence was in substance the mere cross-examination of one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. What the witness stated, ha*d no relation, or application to the issue. It did not vary the evidence. It does not deserve the character of the \u201c <em>evidence,\u201d </em>or \u201c <em>proof\u201d </em>in the cause. It did not in the slightest degree strengthen the defendant\u2019s case. The court should, therefore, have made the rule absolute. 2 <em>Rawle, </em>149.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-7\"><em>Hirst, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\"> For the report of this case, the reporter is indebted to Mr. <em>Sterigere.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Judgment reversed as to the costs, and affirmed as to the residue; and judgment that the defendant below, recover his costs on the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
