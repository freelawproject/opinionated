PARKER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b802-24\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b802-25\">In October 1990, special agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cATp<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d) were informed that a destructive device consisting of dynamite and a detonation cord had been found at a place of business in El Paso, Texas called Sharkey\u2019s Billiards. An employee of Sharkey\u2019s suggested the name of the defendant, Alan Wade Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d), as a possible suspect. The investigation led to the discovery that Johnson, a convicted felon, had purchased a .45 caliber pistol and a nine millimeter pistol at Benny\u2019s Pawn Shop in El Paso. In addition to being a felon in possession, it appeared that Johnson had executed treasury form 4473 to acquire these firearms and had denied his prior felony conviction. The case against Johnson was presented to an Assis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>taut United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) in June, 1991. In the meantime, however, the State of Texas had charged Johnson with aggravated robbery and capital murder. The firearms which were central to the ATF investigation were also apparently evidence in the state criminal prosecution. The AUSA in charge of the case decided to defer to the state and to decline federal prosecution for the firearms violations at that time. The ATF investigation then lay dormant until Johnson\u2019s state trial on the charge of capital murder. Johnson was found \u201cnot guilty\u201d by the jury. The ATF then revived its investigation, and the original indictment in the instant case was returned in December 1993. A superseding indictment was returned in July 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The superseding indictment charged Johnson with six counts of possession of a firearm by a felon, two counts of making a false statement on an ATF form, and one count of possession of a silencer that had not been registered to him. The Government also gave notice of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) based on Johnson\u2019s six prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. Johnson filed a motion to dismiss the case for vindictive prosecution. After hearing the testimony of the state and federal prosecutors detailing the decision-making process which preceded the federal indictment, the district court determined that Johnson had not shown prosecutorial vindictiveness and denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On July 25, 1995, following a jury trial that began the previous day, Johnson was found guilty as charged in Counts One through Four and Counts Six through Nine of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson timely filed a notice of appeal, contending that the district court erred in <em>refusing </em>to dismiss the superseding indictment due to prosecutorial vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Johnson contends that we may find prose-cutorial vindictiveness if we agree with his assertion that the State of Texas used the federal prosecution as a tool for subjecting Johnson to successive prosecutions. He bases this argument upon an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine. In order to understand his argument we must first examine that doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns for crimes arising out of the same acts are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>United States v. Lanza, </em>260 U.S. 377, 382, 43 S.Ct. 141, 142-43, 67 L.Ed. 314 (1922). However, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has suggested that an exception to the dual sovereign doctrine exists when prosecution by one sovereign is used as a tool for successive prosecution by another sovereign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bartkus v. Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 123-24, 79 S.Ct. 676, 678, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959)). It is this exception, referred to as the <em>Bartkus </em>exception, that Johnson urges us to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Johnson requests this court to apply the <em>Bartkus </em>exception, not in the context of an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine, but <em>rather </em>as <em>an </em>exception to the general rule that successive prosecutions by different sovereigns tend to negate a finding of prosecuto-rial vindictiveness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Heidecke, </em>900 F.2d 1155, 1159 (7th Cir.1990) (\u201c[wjhere there are successive prosecutions by two sovereigns ... it is improbable that a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness exists\u201d); <em>United States v. Schoolcraft, </em>879 F.2d 64 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 995, 110 S.Ct. 546, 107 L.Ed.2d 543 (1989) (\u201cthe role of a separate sovereign in bringing charges against a defendant minimizes the likelihood of prosecutorial abuse\u201d); <em>United States v. Ng, </em>699 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cthe fact that the prosecutions of the defendants are by two different sovereigns, each acting independently under its own laws and in its own interest without any control of or by the other, renders inapplicable the concept of prosecutorial vindictiveness\u201d). Assuming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>arguendo, </em>that the <em>Bartkus </em>exception is applicable to the general rule that successive prosecutions by different sovereigns negate a finding of prosecutorial vindictiveness, we will review the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">A district court\u2019s factual findings on prosecutorial vindictiveness are reviewed for clear error and the legal principles which guide the district court are reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., United States v. Bullis, </em>77 F.3d 1553, 1558 (7th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Wall, </em>37 F.3d 1443, 1448 (10th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Schoolcraft, </em>879 F.2d 64, 67 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 995, 110 S.Ct. 546, 107 L.Ed.2d 543 (1989). <em>But see, United States v. Noushfar, </em>78 F.3d 1442, 1446 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that the proper standard of review for vindictive prosecution is unsettled in the Ninth Circuit). The inquiry into prosecutorial conduct in a pretrial context may be distinguished from conduct occurring thereafter. <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 379-82, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2492-93, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982). A prosecutor has broad discretion during pretrial proceedings \u201cto determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 102 S.Ct. at 2493. Absent a presumption of vindictiveness in this context, the defendant must prove that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was actually vindictive. <em>United States v. Molina-Iguado, </em>894 F.2d 1452, 1455 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 831, 111 S.Ct. 95, 112 L.Ed.2d 66 (1990). This court examines the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in light of the entire proceedings to determine whether it gives rise to a presumption of vindictiveness. <em>Id. </em>at 1454. In determining if a presumption of vindictiveness is warranted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">the appropriate inquiry is whether ... for example, where, after the defendant\u2019s prior exercise of a procedural or substantive legal right, or his having succeeded in reversing a conviction on appeal, the prosecution acts arguably to punish the exercise of such rights, by increasing the measure of jeopardy by bringing additional or more severe charges[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em>United States v. Ward, </em>757 F.2d 616, 619-20 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The following relevant evidence was adduced at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. During the latter part of 1990 and the early part of 1991, agents of the ATF became aware that Johnson was a convicted felon who had purchased two firearms between June and December 1990. A case report was presented to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in June 1991 for possession of a firearm by a felon and falsifying ATF records in order to obtain a firearm. David Nichols (\u201cNichols\u201d), the AUSA who was reviewing the case, declined prosecution at that time because Johnson was facing charges in Texas state court, and because a firearm central to the ATF investigation was needed as evidence in the state criminal prosecution. Nichols testified that he decided to postpone prosecution until \u201cthe state ran its course, whatever it was, or would be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The State of Texas tried Johnson for capital murder beginning on October 16, 1993, and he was acquitted on December 1, 1993. During or shortly after the capital-murder trial, Johnson filed a grievance with the State Bar of Texas (the Bar) against two assistant district attorneys on the ground that they had withheld exculpatory evidence during the course of the trial. In March 1994, the Bar\u2019s grievance committee made a finding of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">Shortly after the verdict, an assistant district attorney met with prosecutors from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office to discuss prosecuting Johnson on federal charges and obtaining the state\u2019s evidence. Government prosecutors learned that the state still had pending robbery charges against Johnson. However, a decision was made to proceed with the federal prosecution to avoid the appearance that the federal government was \u201ccoming in and sweeping up after the state.\u201d On December 15, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment, and the nine-count superseding indictment was returned on July 6,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Johnson has failed to demonstrate that circumstances warranting a presumption of vindictiveness exist in this case. Johnson has shown no more than that the Government brought charges for firearms violations after he was acquitted of capital murder in state court. The district court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Johnson\u2019s federal investigation \u201cwas \u2018put on hold\u2019 not only because the state charges were more serious, but also because some of the evidence essential to the federal prosecution was in the hands of the state.\u201d The district court further found that \u201cthe federal prosecutors had no knowledge of the grievance or the reprimand prior to the return of the superseding indictment.\u201d Those findings are not clearly erroneous. Absent any presumption of vindictiveness and absent any evidence of such, Johnson cannot prove that the Government\u2019s prosecution was used as a tool of the state. Consequently, the district court did not err in refusing to dismiss Johnson\u2019s superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\">. The district court granted Johnson\u2019s motion to require the Government to elect between counts five and eight because these counts were multi-plicitous. The Government elected to proceed to trial on count eight and dismissed count five.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
