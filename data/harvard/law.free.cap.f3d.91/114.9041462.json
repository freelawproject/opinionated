Adams raises three issues on appeal, all of which we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Adams contends that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause power in regulating the mere possession of a gun under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He argues that his conviction and sentence under that section should be reversed. However, in <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996), we upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) in the face of a <em>Lopez </em>challenge identical to Adams\u2019. Accordingly, we reject his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Next, Adams contends that the district court improperly applied the \u201carmed career criminal\u201d enhancement, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), to his sentence. He argues that that enhancement is not applicable to him, because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In <em>Taylor, </em>the Court held that the term \u201cburglary,\u201d as used in \u00a7 924(e), means burglary in the \u201cgeneric\u201d sense, which requires an unlawful entry into \u201ca building or other structure.\u201d Thus, non-generic burglaries, such as car burglaries, do not count as burglaries for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>at 599, 110 S.Ct. at 2158. Even so, the Court held that a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute may be counted for purposes of enhancement under \u00a7 924(e) if the conviction was, in essence, for a generic burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 110 S.Ct. at 2158-59. In particular, the Court stated that a non-generic burglary conviction may be counted \u201cif ... the charging paper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Adams contends that, under <em>Taylor, </em>his convictions for burglary under Georgia\u2019s non-generic burglary statute do not constitute burglary offenses for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), because they were obtained by guilty pleas instead of by jury trials. The thrust of Adams\u2019 argument is that a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute does not suffice as a \u00a7 924(e) predicate for enhancement, unless the jury instruction for that conviction demonstrates that the \u201cjury [was] actually required to find all of the elements of a generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Adams pleaded guilty, and there was no jury instruction, he argues his prior convictions may not form the basis for a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">In <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995), we addressed whether a prior conviction under Florida\u2019s non-generic burglary statute constituted a \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of a \u00a7 4B1.1 \u201ccareer offender\u201d enhancement. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 (Nov.1995). We held that, because <em>Taylor </em>concerned a different enhancement provision (\u00a7 4B1.4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> its categorical approach to defining \u201cburglary\u201d was not binding with regard to \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, and that under \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 a court could \u201clook behind the judgment of conviction\u201d without restraint from <em>Taylor. Spell, </em>44 F.3d at 939. Even so, we reasoned that, just as it was true under \u00a7 4B1.4 in <em>Taylor, </em>so was it true under \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2 that the \u201cpractical difficulties of holding mini-trials on a defendant\u2019s prior convictions counsel against looking beyond the fact of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that our \u201clook behind the judgment of conviction\u201d must be \u201climited to examining easily produced and evaluated court documents, including the judgment of conviction, charging papers, plea agreement, presentence report adopted by the court, and the findings of a sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although our decision in <em>Spell </em>is instructive for present purposes, it did not address the question before us today: whether under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>Taylor's </em>categorical approach, the government may use some means, other than a jury instruction, to establish that the prior conviction resulted from a generic burglary for purposes of enhancement under \u00a7 924(e). Several circuits have addressed this question, and have held that, contrary to Adams\u2019 contention, a conviction under a non-generic burglary statute may still constitute a \u201cburglary offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), even though there was no jury trial and no jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>964 F.2d 1234, 1236 (1st Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>921 F.2d 59, 61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 825, 112 S.Ct. 91, 116 L.Ed.2d 63 (1991); <em>United States v. Kaplansky, </em>42 F.3d 320, 322 (6th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>United States v. Gallman, </em>907 F.2d 639, 645 n. 7 (7th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 908, 111 S.Ct. 1110, 113 L.Ed.2d 219 (1991); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 703, 708 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 882, 112 S.Ct. 232, 116 L.Ed.2d 188 (1991); <em>United States v. Sweeten, </em>933 F.2d 765, 769-71 (9th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Strahl, </em>958 F.2d 980, 983 (10th Cir.1992). Those seven circuits have concluded that under <em>Taylor </em>the government may use some means, other than a jury instruction, to establish that the prior conviction resulted from a generic burglary. We agree with those circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">In this case, the district court considered the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) in determining that Adams\u2019 prior convictions under Georgia\u2019s non-generic burglary statute constituted \u201cburglaries\u201d under \u00a7 924(e), <em>i.e., </em>generic burglaries. The PSR documented Adams\u2019 prior convictions, pursuant to his guilty pleas, for burglarizing both dwellings and businesses. The information contained in the PSR about Adams\u2019 prior convictions established that they were generic burglaries under <em>Taylor </em>and therefore those burglaries were properly counted for purposes of the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Nothing in <em>Taylor </em>suggests that a defendant with prior convictions from a state with a non-generic burglary statute may escape the application of \u00a7 924(e) simply by pleading guilty and thereby avoiding the creation and use of jury instructions. <em>See, e.g., Harris, </em>964 F.2d at 1236. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Finally, Adams contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) &amp; (d), and his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a erime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Generally, we review whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction <em>de novo. United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir.1995). However, when the defendant fails to renew his Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the defense case, as did Adams, we \u201cmay reverse only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 556-57 (11th Cir.1990) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 943, 111 S.Ct. 2241, 114 L.Ed.2d 482 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The manifest miscarriage of justice standard \u201crequire[s] a finding that the evidence on a key element of the offense is so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Tapia, </em>761 F.2d 1488, 1492 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>United States v. Landers, </em>484 F.2d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1973) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 924, 94 S.Ct. 1428, 39 L.Ed.2d 480 (1974)). That is certainly not the case here, where Adams\u2019 arguments amount to quarreling with the jury\u2019s credibility determinations and ignore the force of the evidence that the police found the stolen \u201cbait\u201d bills on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We AFFIRM Adams\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-10\">. Section 4B1.4 provides that \u201c[a] defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 (Nov.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
