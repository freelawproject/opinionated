J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJs\">An information was filed on July 30, 1986, in the Stanislaus County Superior Court charging appellant with child concealment in violation of Penal Code section 277.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and submitted the matter on the basis of the preliminary hearing transcript. The trial court found appellant guilty of child concealment in violation of section 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">At the sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence was suspended. Appellant was granted three years probation on the condition that he serve one hundred and three days in jail with credit for time served. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Appellant cohabitated with Ms. D. from 1983 until May of 1986. A daughter, Sabreena, was born to the couple on June 9, 1985. After the couple separated, the child remained with Ms. D. and appellant visited with the child on occasion. No formal or court-ordered custody or visitation arrangements were determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On Thursday, June 19, 1986, Ms. D. left Sabreena with appellant at the home of appellant\u2019s mother in Escal\u00f3n. It was agreed that Ms. D. would return for Sabreena on Sunday. However, the preceding Friday appellant telephoned Ms. D. and asked to keep Sabreena until Tuesday in order to buy her clothes and have her photograph taken. It was finally agreed to extend the visit until Wednesday, June 25, 1986. Appellant told Ms. D. she could pick up Sabreena at his parents\u2019 home Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. \u201csharp.\u201d When the mother arrived to retrieve Sabreena, appellant and Sabreena were not there and appellant\u2019s mother handed Ms. D. a letter from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Ms. D. read the letter and accompanied appellant\u2019s mother to a phone booth. Appellant telephoned at approximately 3:30 p.m. During the course of two telephone calls appellant informed Ms. D. that Sabreena was with him and Ms. D. would have to \u201cdo certain things\u201d if she wanted to see Sabreena again. Ms. D. was to move in with appellant\u2019s parents, explaining to her family that she and appellant had reunited. He also demanded she contact an attorney and give appellant complete custody of Sabreena. If Ms. D. did not meet these demands, she was told she would never see Sabreena again. He threatened, however, that if she did recover physical custody of Sabreena, he would \u201cdo whatever he had to do to get her back. If he had to come back and kill all [of Ms. D.\u2019s] family to do it, he\u2019d do it.\u201d She was warned not to call the police and if he \u201cfelt any heat\u201d he would leave the country if necessary. He then arranged for a followup phone call for the following Monday at 8 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On Monday, as instructed, Ms. D. returned to the telephone booth with appellant\u2019s mother and stepfather. During this telephone conversation, appellant instructed Ms. D. to remain with his mother on Tuesday night and bring money for a bus ticket. His parents would then take her to the bus station on Wednesday. Upon arrival at the destination, Ms. D. would be met by someone. Appellant indicated he would call Tuesday night at the\" Glow Worm bar and reveal the rendezvous point.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Appellant telephoned Ms. D. at the Glow Worm bar at approximately 6:40 p.m. on Tuesday night. He revealed that he and Sabreena were in Paradise, California, and that upon Ms. D.\u2019s arrival there she would be met by someone named \u201cRick\u201d in a stationwagon. After appellant determined to his satisfaction that she was not being followed, she would be reunited with Sabreena.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">On Wednesday morning, Ms. D. took a bus to Paradise as instructed. She was met by appellant who gave her a big hug. At that point, the authorities, who had been contacted by Ms. D., intervened and arrested appellant. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>sheriff\u2019s deputy escorted Ms. D. to a trailer park where she was reunited with Sabreena.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Appellant testified he had known Ms. D. eight or nine years and acknowledged fathering their child, Sabreena. Appellant claimed he had been concerned about S\u00e1breena\u2019s welfare. According to appellant, Ms. D.\u2019s mother customarily brought strange men home from bars, one of whom attacked appellant with a knife. Ms. D.\u2019s sister, Sharon, was allegedly selling cocaine, and left dangerous paraphernalia, i.e., a razor blade, within Sabreena\u2019s reach. Appellant caught Sabreena as she was placing a razor blade she found on the floor in her mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Appellant testified that due to these concerns he contacted an attorney on June 20, 1986, who informed appellant he was not legally required to return Sabreena to her mother. However, the attorney cautioned that pursuant to an \u201cunwritten law,\u201d if Ms. D. contacted the police, they would probably return Sabreena to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">He further testified his only intention in taking Sabreena was to remove Sabreena from an unsafe environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">I. Whether Preamended Section 277 Is Unconstitutionally Vague</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Section 277 provided at the time of the incident in question and at time of trial: \u201cIn the absence of a court order determining rights of custody or visitation to a minor child, every person having a right of custody of the child who maliciously takes, detains, conceals, or entices away that child within or without the state, <em>without good cause, </em>and with the intent to deprive the custody right of another person or a public agency also having a custody right to that child, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year, a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both, or by imprisonment in the state prison for a period of one year and one day, a fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000), or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">\u201cA subsequently obtained court order for custody or visitation shall not affect the application of this section,</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">\u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018a person having a right of custody\u2019 means the legal guardian of the child or a person who has a parent and child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>relationship with the child pursuant to Section 197 of the Civil Code.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">By urgency measure, on September 26, 1986, the Legislature amended section 277 by adding the following paragraph: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018good cause\u2019 means a good faith belief that the taking, detaining, concealing, or enticing away of the child is necessary to protect the child from immediate bodily injury or emotional harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Appellant challenges the preamended statute as being unconstitutionally vague in that section 277 failed to provide any guidance as to what constitutes \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u201c \u2018[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019 <em>(Connally </em>v. <em>General Const. Co. </em>(1926) 269 U.S. 385, 391 . . . .) However, \u2018[a] statute is fatally vague only when it exposes a potential actor to some risk or detriment without giving him fair warning of the nature of the proscribed conduct.\u2019 <em>(Rowan </em>v. <em>Post Office Dept. </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 728, 740. . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lortz </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 363, 370 [187 Cal.Rptr. 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The California Supreme Court, in a majority opinion authored by Justice Grodin, reviewed the \u201cvoid for vagueness doctrine\u201d in <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 755 [221 Cal.Rptr. 779, 710 P.2d 845]: \u201c \u2018Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u2019 <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294], fns. omitted [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 227-228, 92 S.Ct. 2294].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The high court further explained the vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThis is so because \u2018[v]oid for vagueness simply means that criminal responsibility should not attach where one could not reasonably understand that his contemplated conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>is proscribed. In determining the sufficiency of the notice a statute must of necessity be examined in the light of the conduct with which a defendant is charged.\u2019 [Citations.] For this reason, \u2018[o]ne to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 764.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Respondent contends the section is not void for vagueness in that the term \u201cgood cause\u201d used in the preamended section has acquired reasonable certainty by long-established usage and a well-settled conmonsense meaning. <em>(McMurtry </em>v. <em>State Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 760, 766-767 [4 Cal.Rptr. 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476 [1 L.Ed.2d 1498, 77 S.Ct. 1304], it was argued that an obscenity statute did not provide reasonable ascertainable standards of guilt and therefore violated the constitutional requirements of due process. The court stated at pages 491-492 [1 L.Ed.2d at p. 1510-1511]: \u201cThis Court, however, has consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process. \u2018. . . [T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards\u2019; all that is required is that the language \u2018conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In <em>Cal. Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Cal. Unemp. Ins. Appeals Board </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 263 [3 Cal.Rptr. 37], the Second District Court of Appeal, in determining whether the employer made a prima facie showing that the claimant/employee left his employment with the employer voluntarily and without good cause, looked to a Pennsylvania Superior Court case construing the term \u201cgood cause\u201d in an identical statute: \u201c \u2018Of course, \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d are flexible phrases, capable of contraction and expansion, and by construction, all meaning can be compressed out of them or they may be expanded to cover almost any meaning. Reducing them to a fixed, definite and rigid standard, if desirable, is necessarily difficult, if not impossible. However, in whatever context they appear, they connote, as minimum requirements, real circumstances, substantial reasons, objective conditions, palpable forces that operate to produce correlative results, adequate excuses that will bear the test of reason, just grounds for action, and always the element of good faith. When related to the context of the statute, \u201cgood cause\u201d takes on the hue of its surroundings, and it, and \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d must be construed in the light reflected by its text and objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 272-273, quoting <em>Bliley Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Comp. Board of Review </em>(1946) 158 Pa.Super. 548 [45 A.2d 898, 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The Second District Court of Appeal in <em>Zorrero </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 434 [120 Cal.Rptr. 855], in determining a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>complainant was ineligible for unemployment compensation on the ground that he quit work voluntarily without good cause, held voluntary termination of employment for good cause must be based on \u201cserious and exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In another unemployment benefits case, the Second District Court of Appeal determined \u201c \u2018[g]ood cause\u2019 means a legally sufficient ground or reason for a certain action.\u201d <em>(McCrocklin </em>v. <em>Employment Development Dept. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1067, 1071 [205 Cal.Rptr. 156].) In <em>R. J. Cardinal Co. </em>v. <em>Ritchie </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 124 [32 Cal.Rptr. 545], the First District Court of Appeal stated that the \u201cnucleus\u201d of the concept of \u201cgood cause\u201d involved the essential ingredients of reasonable grounds and good faith. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201cThe concept of good cause should not be enshrined in legal formalism; it calls for a factual exposition of a reasonable ground . . . [or] a good reason for a party\u2019s failure to perform that specific requirement from which he seeks to be excused . . .\u201d or, in the converse, to excuse conduct otherwise prohibited. <em>(Waters </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 885, 893 [27 Cal.Rptr. 153, 377 P.2d 265]; <em>Board of Medical Quality Assurance </em>v. <em>Gherardini </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 681 [156 Cal.Rptr. 55].)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The power of a court to declare a statute unconstitutional is an ultimate power; its use should be avoided if a reasonable statutory construction makes the use unnecessary. <em>(Ashwander </em>v. <em>Valley Authority </em>(1936) 297 U.S. 288, 346 [80 L.Ed. 688, 710, 56 S.Ct. 466] (conc. opn. of Brandeis, J.); <em>Syrek </em>v. <em>California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 519, 526 [7 Cal.Rptr. 97, 354 P.2d 625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Thus, respondent contends that the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d has a common and generally accepted meaning and, therefore, submits that preamended section 277 is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">In our view, respondent\u2019s reasoning has merit. \u201cGood cause\u201d has in fact acquired reasonable certainty by established usage, interpretation and a settled commonsense meaning. Moreover, the term \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in both the preamended and postamended section is further narrowed or circumscribed by the requirement that the taking, detaining, concealment or enticing of the child be done maliciously, i.e., with malice. Malice is defined in section 7, subdivision (4): \u201cThe words \u2018malice\u2019 and \u2018maliciously\u2019 import a wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act, established either by proof or presumption of law.\u201d And as Professor Witkin states, \u201cBut such hatred or intent to injure is rarely required; the element of malice in most criminal statutes is satisfied by the intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>doing of the act without justification or excuse or mitigating circumstances (\u2018an intent to do a wrongful act\u2019).\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7 60, p. 64.) Thus, if one acts maliciously in the taking, concealing, etc. of the child, as established by the record, it seems logical he or she did not have good cause, i.e., acted without good cause. Upon this analysis, we conclude the preamended section 277 was not unconstitutionally vague for allegedly failing to provide any guidance as to what constitutes \u201cgood cause.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Assuming arguendo we were in agreement with appellant\u2019s initial argument, we would further find, in the instant case, appellant\u2019s conduct clearly falls within the prohibition of section 277. This is particularly true in light of the fact that the preamended and postamended section 277 require that an offender act \u201cwith the intent to deprive the custody right of another person . . . also having a custody right to that child.\u201d (See <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 553, 559 [11 Cal.Rptr. 758, 360 P.2d 334]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaughan </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 409, 414 [317 P.2d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cHowever, \u2018the requirement of a specific intent to do a prohibited act may avoid those consequences to the accused which may otherwise render a vague or indefinite statute invalid .... [W]here the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law. The requirement that the act must be willful or purposeful may not render certain, for all purposes, a statutory definition of the crime which is in some respects uncertain. But it does relieve the statute of the objection that punishes without warning an offense of which the accused was unaware.\u2019 <em>(Screws </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1945) 325 U.S. 91, 101 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yoshimura </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 410, 414-415 [133 Cal.Rptr. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Appellant\u2019s conduct so clearly falls within the prohibition of section 277 that the phrase \u201cwithout good cause\u201d as applied to appellant is constitutionally valid. Throughout the incident, appellant\u2019s actions did not manifest a subjective or objective belief that he was acting within the law. Appellant arranged to speak with Sabreena\u2019s mother at designated pay telephones, instructing his mother to answer the phone first on each occasion. Sabreena\u2019s mother was warned not to contact the police and appellant made threats on her family should she attempt to retrieve Sabreena. In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to respondent, it is not reasonable to infer that appellant believed subjectively or objectively that his actions were within the law or legally justified so as to constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for the abduction of his daughter. Appellant\u2019s self-serving testimony directed toward justifying his conduct lacked credibility. Thus, we would conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>section 277 is not void for vagueness under the facts of the instant case in that appellant\u2019s conduct falls clearly within the prohibitions of the section without credible evidence of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Best, J., and Ballantyne, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-15\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 629.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
