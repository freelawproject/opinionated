False representations by the owner of a hotel, which induced another party to exchange properties with him, as to the amount of annual rental, the lessee\u2019s promptness in payment and his satisfaction with the lease, which the lessee corroborates under instructions from the owner when questioned by the other party, are ground for setting aside the deeds of conveyance.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-8\" pgmap=\"226\">Writ of Error to the Circuit Court of Cook county;\u00bb the Hon. John Gibbons, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-9\" pgmap=\"226(219) 227(373) 228(17)\">This was a bill in chancery exhibited in the circuit court of Cook county by the defendant in error against the plaintiff in error. The bill alleged the plaintiff in error and other persons named in the bill, who had combined and conspired together for the purpose, by means of false and fraudulent representations induced the defendant in error to transfer to the said plaintiff in error certain real estate in the city of Chicago, together with his promissory note in the sum of $1000, in consideration the plaintiff in error would convey to the defendant in error certain other real estate also in the city of Chicago, known as the \u201cAlabama Hotel,\u201d together with the furniture and fixtures therein; that in pursuance of the said conspiracy, and with intent to cheat and defraud the defendant in error, the plaintiff in error and said other persons represented to him that said premises were then rented to good tenants at a rental of $4200 per year, payable in monthly installments of $350, for a term expiring July 30, 1896; that said tenants paid the rent promptly and punctually, and had paid all the rent then due, including the month of December; that said tenants were doing a good business and were satisfied with their lease; that Dunne was urged to make such exchange, and was told by them that it was a most advantageous one for him to make, all of which representations were false and made for the purpose of defrauding Dunne; that defendant procured the lessees of said premises to verify the statements so made by the defendant, and that one of the lessees, Prescott Jordan, afterward, by the procurement of the defendant, upon Dunne asking him as to the truth of such statements, represented that he, said lessee, had leased said premises and was paying for the use thereof $350 a month; that he was doing a good and profitable business and was well satisfied with his business and the terms of the lease; that all said statements were false; that said lessees had, in fact, paid no rent for such premises to Briggs and but a small sum to More-house, the prior owner; that he was not satisfied with said business nor was it profitable, and that said pretended lease was not executed in good faith, but for the sole purpose of enabling the owner to sell said premises for more than their actual value; that said tenant had no lease but was holding the premises on sufferance, upon the sole consideration and for the express purpose- of enabling the owner to sell them for more than their actual value; that Briggs and his agent, Orr, at said time well knew the purpose for which said lease was made, and that said lease was not made in good faith; that said lessee did not pay any rent on the same, except $60; that Dunne believed said representations and relied on them, and on account thereof agreed to and did make said exchange of properties; that afterwards Dunne and wife executed and delivered to Briggs two warranty deeds of such property, which were recorded, and also a note for $1000 secured by trust deed, and that Briggs and wife executed and delivered to Dunne a warranty deed of the Alabama Hotel property, which was recorded, and that Briggs did also sell and transfer to Dunne all the furniture owned by him in said hotel, by written assignment dated December 10, 1895, and on the same date assigned to Dunne said lease of said hotel.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\" pgmap=\"228\">The bill prayed that the contract of exchange be rescinded and the plaintiff in error ordered to re-convey the property conveyed to him by the defendant in error. Answer was made to the bill, replication thereto filed, and cause submitted to the court upon the proof taken in open court. The court rendered a decree granting the relief prayed for by the bill. This is a writ of error to reverse said decree.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-6\" pgmap=\"228\">W. R.

The specific ground of this insistence may be best made to appear from the statement thereof in the brief of plaintiff in error, viz.: \u201cThe testimony of Jordan, Orr and Briggs shows that Jordan was not requested or authorized to show this property, or make any statements regarding the same, to any person unless such person was sent there by Briggs or Orr with a note or written instructions to Jordan to show the property to such party. When Dunne called, on Sunday, Jordan testifies that he didn\u2019t know Dunne \u2018from Adam;\u2019 that Dunne had no written instructions or note from Orr or Briggs.\u201d</p> <p id=\"ACh\" pgmap=\"231(220) 232(243)\">It clearly appeared in the evidence plaintiff in error authorized Jordan to make the false representations recited in the decree, and in part consideration he should do so agreed Jordan should occupy the hotel without payment of rent. The secret arrangement between the plaintiff in error and Jordan that a written order should be provided directing Jordan to show the hotel to the bearer thereof, was not for the purpose of authorizing Jordan to make the false representations in question. He was otherwise fully authorized as to that. The office of the order or letter was to designate the bearer as a person who contemplated buying or exchanging other property for the hotel, and as one to whom the false representations should be made. Defendant in error came to the hotel as a prospective purchaser, and though he bore no letter he advised Jordan of the purpose of his visit. Jordan thereupon made the fraudulent and false statements set forth in the decree which in part induced the defendant in error to consent to the exchange of the properties. The fraud of Jordan was instigated by the plaintiff in error and was within the scope of the conspiracy between them. It contributed to induce the exchange of properties. The plaintiff in error consented to receive the benefit of the fraud and must be held to have ratified the acts of the perpetrator thereof. Moreover, the evidence warranted the finding that the plaintiff in error, through his agent, Orr, made the like false representations to the defendant in error. These statements were not mere expressions of opinion as to the value or desirability of the property, but were false representations as to an existing fact material for consideration in determining its value, were known to be false, and were deliberately made for the express purpose of deceiving and defrauding the defendant in error. The fact was one peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiff in error, Orr and Jordan, and the truth with relation to it could not be ascertained by an inspection of the premises. The value of the hotel property depended largely on the amount to be derived from it by way of rent. In order to increase its value in the estimation of the defendant in error it was falsely represented the hotel was yielding \u00a7350 per month rental. The property was mortgaged for \u00a720,500, which entailed an annual interest charge of \u00a71230, payable in semi-annual payments. It yielded nothing whatever, and it would seem idle to enter upon a discussion of the insistence of the plaintiff in error the decree should be reversed on the ground the evidence disclosed only a case of fraud without resulting financial injury.</p> <p id=\"b232-5\" pgmap=\"232\">It would serve no useful purpose to enter upon a review of the testimony in detail. We find the decree amply supported by the proof. The principles of law involved are well recognized\u2014in fact are fundamental. It is the peculiar province of a court of equity to grant relief in such cases.</p> <p id=\"b232-6\" pgmap=\"232\">The decree must be and is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b232-7\" pgmap=\"232\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
