Shepherd, deceased, in certain lots in the city of Sullivan, in said county, and asking \u25a0that the same be declared and that partition be made. The bill showed that Ann M. Shepherd, who was the owner of the property at the time of her death, died December 16, 1889, leaving her surviving as her only heirs-at-law, her husband, Edwin L. Shepherd, her mother, Jane Hawkins, and her brothers, the two complainants, bnt that prior to her death she made her last will, which shortly after her decease was admitted to probate in due form, which said will was as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\" pgmap=\"215\">\u201cFirst\u2014I give, devise and bequeath to George B.

Bohling, to the highest bidder, and the proceeds of said sale to be divided, share and share alike, between Mrs. Ettie Bohling, wife of George B. Bohling, and Mrs. Margaret Craig, wife of Walter Craig; and that lots 1 and 2, in block \u2018A,\u2019 Patterson &amp; Snyder\u2019s addition to the town (now city) of Sullivan, Moultrie county, State of Illinois, shall descend to my brother, William H.

Shepherd, the said Margaret Craig also died, and that after her death, and on the 24th day of April, 1895, the said Edwin L. Shepherd died without any disposition having been made of said lots otherwise than in and by said will.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\" pgmap=\"217\">To this bill John B. Shepherd, M. T. Shepherd and Belle Eden, the only heirs-at-law of Edwin L. Shepherd, deceased, also appeared as defendants and answered, and alleged that they were the owners of an undivided one-half interest in said lots as heirs-at-law of said Edwin L. Shepherd. The theory of their claim is, that Edwin L. Shepherd inherited one-half of said property, under the statute, from his wife, Ann M. Shepherd, she having left no children or descendants of children surviving her; that under the statute he had two months after he had been notified that all the debts and claims against the estate of his wife had been paid, in which to elect whether he would take under the will or under the statute, and it was alleged that \u201cat no time did the executor or any one else ever notify the said Edwin L. Shepherd that all debts and claims against the estate of the said Ann M. Shepherd had been paid;\u201d that as he was never called upon to elect in his lifetime, the right of election survived to his heirs. The other defendants to the bill, George B. Bohling, Etta B. Bohling, T. E. Craig and Walter Craig, who are the defendants in error here, demurred to the bill and cross-bill, which demurrer was sustained by the court and both bill and cross-bill were dismissed for want of equity. This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse that decree.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-6\" pgmap=\"217\">John R. &amp; Walter Eden, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-7\" pgmap=\"217\">The distinction between a gift on a particular day and a gift to be paid on such day is taken between a case where there is a simple direction to divide at a specified time and where there is an express gift accompanied by a direction to divide at such specified time.

If the time of payment merely be postponed, and it appears to be the intention of the testator that his bounty should immediately attach, the legacy is of the vested kind; but if time be annexed to the substance of the gift as a condition precedent, it is contingent, and not transmissible.

Shepherd, deceased, depends entirely upon the question as to whether Margaret Craig took by the will a vested or only a contingent remainder. The legal title, for the purposes of the execution of the trust created by the will, was vested in defendant in error George B. Bohling, as trustee'. But it is well settled that there may be vested equitable as well as vested legal interests or remainders, and if Mrs. Craig took a vested equitable interest, then, notwithstanding she died before the death of the husband of the testatrix, Edwin L. Shepherd, the life tenant, her interest descended to her heirs-at-law, who were defendants in error T. E. Craig and Walter Craig. If, on the other hand, her interest was contingent only, her death before it vested rendered it intestate estate, and it passed to the heirs-at-law of the testatrix, who at the time of the filing of the bill were the complainants below.</p> <p id=\"b219-5\" pgmap=\"219(229) 220(154)\">It must be presumed that the testatrix intended by her will to dispose of her entire interest in the property, and not to die intestate as to any part of it. So strong is this presumption that it has sometimes been said, with some extravagance, perhaps, that it will justify almost any construction of a will which will defeat intestacy as to a part of the estate. (2 Redfield on Wills, 235; Higgins v. Dwen, 100 Ill. 554; Hayward v. Loper, 147 id. 41.) Again, the law favors the vesting of estates rather than that the title shall be in abeyance, and it was said in Scofield v. Olcott, 120 Ill. 362 (on p. 374): \u201cIt has long been a settled rule of construction in the courts of England and America, that estates, legal or equitable, given by a will, should always be regarded as vesting immediately, unless the testator has by very clear words manifested an intention that they should be contingent on a future event.\u201d (McArthur v. Scott, 113 U. S. 235; Kellett v. Shepard, 139 Ill. 433.) As said in 4 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, 205: \u201cIt is not the uncertainty of enjoyment in the future, but the uncertainty of the right to that enjoyment, which makes the difference between a vested and contingent interest.\u201d (Temple v. Scott, 143 Ill. 290.) With these rules in mind, it must be held that Margaret Craig, upon the death of the testatrix, took a vested interest. The person who was to take was in esse and named in the will. Her right to the property was not to depend upon any dubious or uncertain event. The mere fact that power was given to the trustee to sell upon the request of the life tenant, and to use the proceeds for his support, did not make Mrs. Craig\u2019s interest contingent, for the interest may vest subject to the power, and may be liable to be defeated or destroyed by its exercise and still not be a contingent as distinguished from a vested interest. Thus, \u201ca devise to a person after the payment of debts and legacies is not contingent until such debts and legacies are paid, but confers an immediately vested interest.\u201d Ducker v. Burnham, 146 Ill. 9; Scofield v. Olcolt, supra.</p> <p id=\"b220-5\" pgmap=\"220\">But it may be said that here there was no original gift to Mrs. Craig, but only a direction to sell and pay over to her after the death of the life tenant, and that in such a case the interest, which is in personalty, is held by the authorities to be contingent. To this point it is sufficient to reply, that it appears by the will that the payment or distribution was postponed for the convenience of the estate,\u2014that is, to let in the prior interest given to the husband,\u2014and was not postponed for reasons personal to the legatee, and that in such cases the interest will vest on the death of the testator. Had it been postponed until Mrs. Craig should have arrived at a certain age, or until the happening of some event personal to herself which might never happen, a different construction might be required. Scofield v. Olcott, supra, and authorities there cited.</p> <p id=\"b220-6\" pgmap=\"220(61) 221(39)\">It appearing, then, that Mrs. Craig\u2019s interest vested in her at the death of the testatrix, it passed to her heirs upon her death before the death of the husband of the testatrix, and plaintiffs in error, who filed the bill below, took no interest as heirs of the testatrix. Nor did the cross-complainants, as heirs of the husband, Edwin L. Shepherd, take any interest in the property. The husband took and enjoyed during his life the life estate and benefits given to him by the will, and his heirs cannot now elect to take contrary to its provisions.</p> <p id=\"b221-5\" pgmap=\"221\">The demurrers to the bill and cross-bill were properly sustained, and the decree is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b221-6\" pgmap=\"221\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
