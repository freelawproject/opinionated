E. P. Vail, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-18\" pgmap=\"68(42) 69(50)\">This was a suit brought by the city of Decatur before a justice of the peace, against F. W. Niedermeyer, for violating an ordinance of the city in obstructing a certain alley. A fine of ten dollars and costs was assessed against him, and he appealed to the circuit court of Macon county, where the case was tried before the court without a jury. The court found for the defendant, and rendered judgment for costs against the city. The city brings the case to this court on writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-4\" pgmap=\"69(352) 70(31)\">The alley, the obstruction of which is complained of, is in block 1 of Yates &amp; King\u2019s addition to Decatur, which was platted in 1855. The plat of block 1 shows that the northern portion of the same was 262 feet from east to west and 101$ feet from north to south, divided into six lots. South of these lots is an alley 16 feet wide. The southern portion of the block is 156|- feet from north to south, and divided into lots in the same manner as the northern portion. Monroe street runs along the east side \u2022of lot 1, in block 1, said lot being in the north-east corner of the same.' On the west of block 1 lies block 2, which is in all respects similar to it. South of these two blocks lie blocks 3 and 4, divided in the middle by a 20-foot alley, the lots both on the north and south of the alley being 150 feet deep. North of blocks 1 and 2 there was a platted street 40 feet wide, called King street. The city afterwards opened another street, called Eldorado street, 48 feet 10 inches north of the north line of these blocks, and sold the intermediate strip of 48 feet 10 inches lying along block 1 to F. W. Niedermeyer, the defendant in error. He became the owner of lots 1 and 2 in 1856, and subsequently of the rest of the northern tier of lots. In 1857 he built a house and barn on this property, putting the latter on the line of the alley, as indicated by the surveyor\u2019s stakes. He afterwards built on the same line a corn-crib, which was subsequently enlarged and turned into a dwelling. Later the barn burned down and he built a brick barn on the same line. In 1894 Monroe street was paved, and the surveyor then fixed the south line of the alley six or seven feet north of the fence on the north side, as now located. The city notified Niedermeyer to remove the obstructions in the alley, which he failed to do, hence this suit. One of the errors assigned is the judgment for costs against the city, and the defendant in error has offered to remit such costs.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-4\" pgmap=\"70\">James M.

According to the latest surveys, the alley should be located somewhere from four to seven feet further north than the place where it now is and for more than twenty-five years has been actually opened, located and used, and would include within it, to the extent mentioned, the enclosure, buildings and improvements of the defendant in error. A. T. Risley, a former county survejror, testified that when surveying in 1861 he found a number of stakes on the line of the alley as now located, and recognized some of the original corners in block 2; that the alley in block 2 was on a line with the alley in block 1, and that the line is substantially the same now that it was then. William Niedermeyer, son of the defendant, testified that the fence was built on the line of the stakes there, in lot 2. F. W. Niedermeyer testified that he built this first fence in 1857, on the line of pegs shown him by one Baker, the agent for Yates &amp; King; that there were stakes all over the addition; that one Young built his fence on the south line of the alley according to the pegs; that the last time he (Niedermeyer) re-built the fence, nine or ten years ago, he found one of the original pegs in the ground. All the witnesses testified that the fence had been on the same line ever since it was first put up, and the barns and corn-crib had always stood on the line where they stand now; that no change had been made in the location of the alley since it was first fenced on both sides, and they refer to periods of time running back from fifteen to thirty years. This evidence is-uncontradicted. The city had the addition surveyed recently by the city engineer and by the county surveyor, and while their measurements do not agree exactly, they both locate the alley farther north than it is at present, one of them four feet and the other from six to seven feet, but no original corner stone of the addition could be found by them. It is claimed by defendant that there is a mistake in the figures of the plat; that the lots in the southern portion of block 1 should be only 150|- feet deep instead of 156!, thus corresponding with the size of the lots in the blocks south, and thus explaining the discrepancy between the measurements according to the plat and the location of the stakes by the original surveyor. However this may be, the acquiescence by the city for so long a time in the location of the alley and of the improvements made by the defendant upon the line of the alley as so located, should be given great weight in determining, in a conflict of evidence, where the true boundary is. (City of Mt. Carmel v. McClintock, 155 Ill. 608.)</p> <p id=\"b73-4\" pgmap=\"73\">The propositions which plaintiff in error asked and the court refused to hold as law do not correctly state the law, for they all make the lot lines, as shown on the plat, control, and not the lines as actually run on the ground and the stakes set by the surveyor. As has been repeatedly held by this court, the true boundary lines of a city lot are where they are actually marked by the monuments placed by the surveyor to indicate where they are to be found, and the most satisfactory evidence of the place where the lines were located is afforded by the original stakes. The monuments must necessarily control the field notes and maps of the survey, as well as courses, distances and quantity. These monuments are facts; the field notes and plats are but descriptions which serve to assist in ascertaining the facts. (McClintock v. Rogers, 11 Ill. 279; Bauer v. Gottmanhausen, 65 id. 429; City of Mt. Carmel v. McClintock, supra.)</p> <p id=\"b73-5\" pgmap=\"73(37) 74(152)\">The fences and buildings had been built on the same line for over twenty-five years, and the alley has been opened and used according to such fences since 1872. There is evidence that the city authorities recognized the alley as now located. The city put in a culvert in this alley, ordered Niedermeyer to clean out the filth in it, and has never made any claim to that part alleged to be within his enclosure, Niedermeyer having been in undisputed possession of it for over thirty years. Muzzy, who had been alderman of Decatur for a number of times, testified that the aldermen gave the same attention to this alley as to any other alley; that it had been used by the public continuously since 1873. The long acquiescence of the city in the location of the alley as actually established, and its acts of recognition shown by the evidence, taken in connection with the other evidence tending to show that the alley was actually located according to the original survey, make the weight of the evidence such that the judgment should not be disturbed.</p> <p id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74\">The court below found for defendant in error, and, we think, correctly. The judgment for costs against the city is erroneous, (City of Carrollton v. Bazzette, 159 Ill. 284,) and so far is reversed, but the judgment is in all other respects affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AD\" pgmap=\"74\">Judgment affirmed in part.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
