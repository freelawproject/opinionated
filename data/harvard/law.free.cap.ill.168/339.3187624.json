It appeared to the circuit court the said Bernard Iago was insane, whereupon the court appointed one H. T. Aspern as guardian ad litem for the defendant. Such proceedings were had in the circuit court as that a decree of divorce was entered in favor of the wife, the defendant in error. On the application of the husband, by Annie Brock, his next friend, a writ of error to reverse the decree was sued out in the Appellate Court for the First District. On motion of the defendant in error the writ was dismissed, hence this appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-10\" pgmap=\"339\">Haley &amp; O\u2019Donnell, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-11\" pgmap=\"339(31) 340(20)\">The guardian ad litem must make the defense of the interests of his ward as vigorous as the nature of the case will admit, and nothing is admitted, but strict proof is required.

It is also well settled in this State a writ of error is a new suit. The reasoning of the Appellate Court is, that an insane person, being incapable in law of instituting and maintaining a bill for divorce, is likewise incapable of maintaining a writ of error for the purpose of questioning the regularity and legality of a decree of divorce entered against him in a proceeding instituted after he became insane. We are unable to assent to this view. Actions for divorce may be instituted against insane defendants for a cause of divorce committed before the period of insanity. When such an action is begun, a court of equity, in view of the peculiar duty of such courts to protect the personal and property rights of lunatics, will appoint some discreet and proper person to conduct the defense. The power possessed by courts of equity to provide that such defense shall be made is not exhausted by the appointment of a conservator ad litem or next friend to defend in the trial court, but may be exercised in courts of review, and further defense of the action for divorce prosecuted by any remedy provided by law whereby reversal of a decree of the trial court may be obtained. A writ of error is a new suit, but at the same time, when brought to review a decree for divorce, is but a step in defense of the relief sought to be obtained by the complainant in the original bill.</p> <p id=\"b342-5\" pgmap=\"342\">In Bradford v. Abend, 89 Ill. 78, a bill in chancery filed by the conservator of an insane wife to set aside a decree of divorce was entertained by the circuit court and its decree vacating a decree of divorce was affirmed by this court. It is true that in that case the bill for divorce was filed in the name of the wife while she was insane, and that the principle that an insane person cannot maintain a bill for divorce was applied by this court in support of the decree of the circuit court in vacating the decree for divorce. 1 But it is further true that the insane wife was equally as incapable of electing whether she would remain married or single as was the plaintiff in error in the case at bar, yet the aid of the court against the decree of divorce was fully recognized and enforced. In the case cited, the ground of attack upon the decree could not be availed of in a writ of error, and for that reason resort was had to an original proceeding in the trial court. Had such ground been apparent from an inspection of the record, no reason is perceived why the relief might not have been had through the medium of such writ. Though an insane person may be incapacitated from maintaining an action for divorce, still 'it by no means logically follows no legal remedy can be availed of to remove a decree of divorce entered against the person so unfortunately afflicted.</p> <p id=\"AYF\" pgmap=\"343\">It is not essential the same person who represented the insane party as guardian ad litem in the circuit court should appear as next' friend in a writ of error. (Ames v. Ames, 148 Ill. 321.) True, as suggested, the insane person has not capacity to consent to a change of the representative, but it is within the power of the court to appoint or accept another person to act in that capacity. Rev. Stat. sec. 13, chap. 86, \u201cLunatics.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">We think no sufficient reason appeared for dismissing the writ. The judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to that court, with directions to overrule the motion.</p> <p id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
