HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b317-21\">Stephen Halmekangas sued ANPAC Louisiana Insurance Company and its agent Stephen Harelson in Louisiana state court. All parties were Louisiana domiciliaries, and no federal question was presented. Facing the hurdle that the district court would not have had original jurisdiction had the suit been first filed there, defendants removed to federal court, asserting supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) \u2014 on the idea that the state case related to an action pending in federal court. The federal district court denied Halmekangas\u2019s efforts to remand and granted summary judgment to AN-PAC and Harelson. Halmekangas appealed. Because there was no authority to remove the ANPAC action, we vacate the summary judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to remand the ANPAC suit to the originating Louisiana state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-23\">Stephen Halmekangas lived in a three-story, 5,400-square-foot home in New Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>leans. Hurricane Katrina flooded his first floor; five days later, a fire burned the house to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Seeking to recover from his homeowner\u2019s policy \u2014 written by ANPAC \u2014 Halmekangas learned he was underinsured. ANPAC\u2019s agent, Stephen Harelson, had covered the house as a two-floor, 3,400-square-foot dwelling. ANPAC paid policy limits, $346,700 for the top two floors. Halmekangas sued ANPAC and Harelson in Louisiana state court, urging two claims: (1) \u201cHarelson and/or ANPAC were negligent in not properly issuing the policy providing coverage for the entire structure of 5,400 sq. ft.\u201d; and (2) \u201cPlaintiff relied to his detriment upon the representations\u201d of Harelson advising that he was fully covered. The parties agree that there was no federal question or diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">A month after filing the state action, Halmekangas sued State Farm, his flood insurer, in federal district court, asserting federal question jurisdiction under the National Flood Insurance Program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed that State Farm had arbitrarily and capriciously paid out only $83,399.57 for the flood in his 2,000-square-foot ground floor, well under the coverage limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">When ANPAC learned of the federal suit, it removed to federal court, asserting jurisdiction supplemental to the State Farm case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367. Halmekangas protested, arguing in part that the state action against ANPAC did not arise from the same nucleus of common fact as the State Farm action. The federal district court disagreed, explaining: \u201cthe object of the litigation in the two matters was the same: Plaintiff\u2019s home.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The damages alleged in the two suits comprised the common nucleus of operative fact. The parties and the district court glided past the predicate question of Congressionally conferred power to remove.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">The cases progressed together in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The court granted ANPAC\u2019s summary judgment motion, Halmekangas and State Farm settled out of court, and Halmekangas appealed the adverse summary judgment. He now moves for dismissal \u2014 arguing that the district court never had subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the ANPAC litigation. Indeed, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">\u201cThere should be little need for a reminder that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, having \u2018only the authority endowed by the Constitution and that conferred by Congress.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an effort to establish jurisdiction, ANPAC points to two Congressional grants \u2014 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1367 <em>&amp; </em>1441.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We begin by rehearsing how these two statutes work in isolation, then describe how they can operate in tandem, and conclude by explaining why they do not in this case confer subject-matter jurisdiction. Section 1367 allows federal courts to hear state claims that travel with federal claims in the same lawsuit. \u201cIt grants supplemental jurisdiction over [state] claims that do not independently come within the jurisdiction of the district court but form part of the same Article III \u2018case or controversy.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe question under section 1367(a) is whether the supplemental claims are so related to the original claims ... that they \u2018derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">While \u00a7 1367 permits a federal court to regard state claims outside of its ken, \u00a7 1441 allows parties to pull federal cases out of state court. \u201cA [federal] district court has removal jurisdiction in any case where it has original jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cOriginal jurisdiction, in non-maritime claims, lies where the conditions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 [federal question] or 1332 [diversity] are satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If a plaintiff files suit in state court and asserts a federal cause of action or sues completely diverse defendants, the defendants might invoke \u00a7 1441 to remove the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">With the right ingredients, \u00a7 1367 and \u00a7 1441 can combine to bring into federal court a state claim originally filed in state court. Indeed, if a plaintiff files suit in state court alleging both federal and state claims arising out of the same controversy, the entire action may be removed to federal court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Suppose a young professor asserts that the public university for which she works has wrongfully denied her tenure. She sues in state court, alleging 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 violations alongside state breach of contract claims. The university can remove the whole ease to federal court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Although this permitted removal of state and federal claims is simultaneous, it is useful to view it in steps: first, a party will use \u00a7 1441 to remove the civil action over which federal courts have original jurisdiction; and second, the party will invoke \u00a7 1367 to allow the state claims to piggyback the federal claims. In our rebuffed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>professor\u2019s example, the federal question presented under \u00a7 1983 provides the necessary original jurisdiction to remove, and the common nucleus shared by the federal and state claims allows the district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the contract claims. Sections 1367 and 1441 are bound together because the professor filed the federal and state claims in a single civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Where, as here, the plaintiff files an action in state court with no federal question or complete diversity, the original jurisdiction necessary for removal under \u00a7 1441 does not exist. Congress specified that federal courts have removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1441 only if the district court otherwise has \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d over the \u201ccivil action.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No federal court had original jurisdiction over the ANPAC action, and \u00a7 1367, by its own terms, cannot fill the void. Section 1367 grants \u201csupplemental jurisdiction\u201d over state claims, not original jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Without original jurisdiction, ANPAC has no jurisdictional hook for removal. Section 1441(e)(1) in providing removal in the narrow circumstances of that statute which are inapplicable here (single accident with 75 deaths of natural persons) accents this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">This is so even if we assume that the district court would have had supplemental jurisdiction over ANPAC had Halmekangas filed a single lawsuit in federal court asserting claims against both State Farm and ANPAC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the state-filed suit could not meet the demands of original jurisdiction, \u00a7 1441 did not allow for removal. The district court should have remanded to state court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Our holding is both axiomatic<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in line with the Sixth and Eighth Circuits. The Sixth has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">The supplemental-jurisdiction statute is not a source of original subject-matter jurisdiction, and a removal petition therefore may not base subject-matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>jurisdiction on the supplemental-jurisdiction statute, even if the action which a defendant seeks to remove is related to another action over which the federal district court already has subject-matter jurisdiction, and even if removal would be efficient.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">And the Eighth has admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Section 1367(a) does not mention removal at all .... While this statute does allow factually related state law claims to be joined with the claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction, it plainly does not provide a separate basis for removal of independent state law actions .... [It] is not original jurisdiction ....<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201c[E]very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review .... \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Supplemental jurisdiction on its own does not give federal courts the power to remove a state case that does not arise from a federal question or offer complete diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Halmekangas\u2019s action against ANPAC and Harelson never had federal subject-matter jurisdiction, so \u2014 responsive to our constitutional duty\u2014 we VACATE and REMAND to the district court with instructions to remand to Louisiana\u2019s court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Any other outstanding motion is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4053 (granting \"original exclusive jurisdiction\u201d in National Flood Insurance Program adjustment cases to the \"United States district court for the district in which the insured property ... shall have been situated\u201d); <em>see also Borden v.

Defendants sometimes will assert that a pending federal action that shares a common nucleus of operative fact with the state lawsuit that defendants seek to remove can furnish an anchor claim under Section 1367(a), and thus enable removal of a separate suit under Sections 1441(a) and (b). This is a misreading of Section 1367, which authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are within the same civil action as a federal question claim (or over claims that are within the same civil action as a claim satisfying 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332, the statute conferring diversity jurisdiction), and those claims alone.\u201d (footnote omitted)); 16 James Wm.
