The building to be searched was a small concrete outbuilding located some distance from the nearest residence and separated from it by one fence and one gate and by a distance of approximately 150 to 180 feet, and the nearest residence was not at the time in use as a dwelling house. Conceding, however, that the residence was actually being used by the Brock family as a dwelling, the outbuilding was not a part of, or located within its curtilage, and if it was, the search and seizure in the instant case was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">On the night of January 7, 1957, the agents had, by the use of sight and smell, determined that a felony, the operation of a still, was being committed. As they approached the building, the door to it was open, the appellant came out, shone a light upon the agents who gave chase, and during the course of it, the agents could and did observe through the open door that a still was in operation. The arrest was perfected and as incident to that arrest the property under the immediate control and possession of appellant, to-wit, the block house, was searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. This is the testimony as defendant, with substantial correctness states it:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The evidence on which defendant was convicted consisted of the testimony of two Revenue Agents who, without warrant for search or arrest, entered upon Defendant\u2019s property at eight o\u2019clock at night on Jan. 7, 1957, crept up to a concrete block outbuilding located near the dwelling house, smelled the odor of mash, heard the sound of a blower, observed defendant outside the rear of the concrete block out building, flashed a light and his face, chased him around the building, caught him and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Prior to the night time raid, the Revenue Agents had entered upon Defendant\u2019s premises on four occasions. On Dec. 18, 1956, acting on a tip from an undisclosed source, three agents walked across the pasture and up to the concrete block outbuilding and smelled what they were convinced was fermenting mash. Agent Powell testified that they could not get in the building \u201cbut we definitely established to our satisfaction, through smell, that there was an illicit distillery in that building\u201d. They returned on Dec. 19, Dec. 20, and Dee. 21, 1956. They observed a man walk from the residence to the outbuilding on Dec. ' 20, and on Dec. 21 they observed signs at the outbuilding that convinced them a distillery had been run on the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-19\">The concrete block building was \u201cfifty or sixty steps\u201d from the dwelling house. It lay in a fenced field. The dwelling house had a fence which was \u201c40 steps\u201d from the concrete outbuilding and that fence had an opening, large enough to drive a ear through, by which access was had between the house and the still house. The barn lay outside the \u201cyard fence\u201d and a smoke house lay inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">Agent Powell testified that on Dec. 20, 1956, the dwelling house did not appear occupied \u2014 -that he saw no smoke coming from the chimney. He saw chickens in the yard and a horse in the field. Agent Saunders testified that on the night of the raid when they allowed the defendant to change clothes in the dwelling house that he saw beds, chairs, possibly a living room suite \u2014 but that in the kitchen there was no stove or refrigerator. The defendant testified on Jan. 7, 1957 he was living in the dwelling house \u2014 that he had lived there since 1946. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that she was living there the night of the raid. She also testified that the family took no meals there, but at a cafe-filling station that had recently begun operating in Vernon, some 3 miles away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">.
