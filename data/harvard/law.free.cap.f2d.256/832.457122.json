BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AePI\">The question here is whether the production of citrus pulp cattle feed and citrus molasses simultaneously performed during the processing of fresh citrus fruits into canned or concentrated frozen juices or fruit entitled the Employer to an Fair Fair Labor Standards Act \u00a7 7(b) (3) \u201cseasonal industry\u201d exemption. It is conceded that for these two by-product operations the Employer is entitled to the \u00a7 7(c) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">At the outset it simplifies our understanding to contrast in a gross way these two exemptions <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 7(b) (3) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>7(c). Section 7(c), if applicable, is so because of its own terms. It is self-executing and requires only that the facts bring the employer\u2019s activity under it. Section 7(b) (3), on the other hand, is not self-executing. It applies only to \u201can industry <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>3 found by the Administrator to be of a seasonal nature.\u201d A finding by the Administrator is therefore an indispensable requirement. Under \u00a7 7 (c) the fourteen week exemption relates to overtime for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. Under \u00a7 7(b) (3) the exemption is limited to a maximum of 12 hours in any one day and 56 hours in any one workweek. And, of extreme importance, under \u00a7 7(c) the exemption applies only to those <em>employees </em>\u201cengaged in the first processing of * * * seasonal fresh fruits or vegetables * * * \u201d whereas \u00a7 7(b) (3), on the other hand, extends the exemption to \u201cany employee * * * if such employee is * * * employed * * * in an industry.\u201d It is at this point that the issue is crucial here for while those employees engaged directly and immediately in the manufacturing process of citrus pulp feed and citrus molasses come under \u00a7 7(c), a large number of clerical, administrative and service employees who would be \u201cemployed * * * in an industry\u201d under \u00a7 7(b) (3) are not within the reach of \u00a7 7(c). In addition, although not stressed here, we understand that the two exemptions may under some circumstances be cumulative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajy-dedup-1\">\u201c7(c): * * * in the case of an employer engaged in the first processing of, or in canning or packing, perishable or seasonable fresh fruits or vegetables * * *, the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, during a period or periods of not more than fourteen workweeks in the aggregate in any calendar year, shall not apply to his employees in any place of employment where he is so engaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Both exemptions are therefore valuable and if applicable are as important in the Congressional pattern as any other provision. For the Wage and Hour Act is a complex piece of legislation in which Congress, articulately seeking to accommodate the general aims of this legislation to our diverse economy, was as acutely concerned over the areas and circumstances not covered as those covered. See Maneja v. Waialua Agricultural Co., 349 U.S. 254, 75 S.Ct. 719, 99 L.Ed. 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The problem becomes somewhat unmanageable and awkward if the two exemptions are not carefully distinguished. This is especially so where such terms as \u201cfirst processing\u201d are used in the definitive description of an industry found by the Administrator to be seasonal under \u00a7 7(b)(3) and which are, of course, the statutory basis under \u00a7 7(c). Indeed, this is the heart of the Employer\u2019s approach. For in the final analysis it treats the \u201cfirst processing\u201d of \u00a7 7(e) and the \u201cfirst processing\u201d in the Administrator\u2019s 1940 determination of the seasonal nature of the fresh fruit industry as a common denominator. The Employer, transposing this in the equation, then contends that whatever comes within \u201cfirst processing\u201d under \u00a7 7(c) automatically is eligible under \u00a7 7(b)(3) if the Administrator\u2019s determination of a given seasonal industry expressly encompasses a \u201cfirst processing\u201d operation. In this approach the Employer has respectable-analogous support in the so-called Mus-selman doctrine, now formally recognized by an Administrator\u2019s Regulation <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under which by-product operations carried on simultaneously with and as an integral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>part of first processing of fresh fruits or vegetables are deemed to be \u00a7 7 (c) \u201cfirst processing\u201d up to the point in the manufacturing process of the first non-perishable by-product.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">With \u201cfirst processing\u201d as the common denominator and the Musselman concept as its theme, the Employer makes a substantial factual showing. For it is without dispute that, almost as with any modern manufacturing undertaking, the impact of irrepressible, competitive drives and forces has brought about in the Florida citrus industry during the postwar decade, a remarkable industrial process in which by efficient stream and assembly line techniques the fresh whole citrus fruit is simultaneously processed <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the point of practical exhaustion of all edible as well as inedible products and by-products.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Were this approach correct, we would certainly agree with the Employer and disagree with the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">But this approach, in our view disregards, first, the necessity for a <em>finding </em>by the Administrator that production of citrus pulp feed or citrus molasses (or both) is a seasonal industry, and second, the fact that, as to part in 1952, and as to all of it in 1955, the Administrator has found that such operation is not a seasonal industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">It is true, of course, that in 1940 the Administrator dealt with two phases of the fresh fruit and vegetable business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>and as to them it found two things. First, that \u201c3. The packing, handling, and preparing in their raw or natural state of perishable or seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables is a branch of an industry and of a seasonal nature within the meaning of Section 7(b)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Part 526, as amended, of the Regulations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issued thereunder.\u201d Having found the first, the question then followed whether first processing and canning of such perishable fruit was a branch of an industry of a seasonal nature. The second finding then was that \u201c5. The first processing and canning of perishable or seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables is a branch of an industry and of a seasonal nature within the meaning of Section 7(b)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Part 526, as amended, of the Regulations issued thereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">But while Courts were some day to hold, and the Administrator finally recognized, see note 3, supra, that by-product operations carried on simultaneously to the point of the first non-perishable product were to have the \u00a7 7(c) \u201cfirst processing\u201d status, this was not the course followed as to citrus pulp. Almost immediately it was, as a practical matter, treated as something other than \u201cfirst processing.\u201d At least it was in the sense of the 1940 finding that first processing of fresh fruit was a branch of an industry and of a seasonal nature within \u00a7 7 (b)(3). Instead of relying on such an interpretive application of \u201cfirst processing\u201d, interested segments of the industry in 1941 sought a determination that, as carried on in Florida, Texas and California, the citrus pulp operation was seasonal in nature. This was rejected by a finding that the industry was not seasonal in nature since it appeared that citrus waste was available for approximately eight months in Florida. In 1943 reconsideration of this adverse 1941 determination was sought by Florida processors of citrus waste. This rehearing resulted in a finding <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of seasonality for the Florida and Texas branches of the industry. The basis was stated to be that while the evidence showed that \u201ccitrus waste [was] technically available in Florida for a period of approximately eight months,\u201d various factors made it actually \u201cavailable * * * for a period of time averaging six to seven months out of each year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">There was thus administrative determination as to citrus pulp by-prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>uct operations that (a) such activities were not automatically under the \u201cfirst processing\u201d 7(b) (3) determination of 1940 and (b) would require a specific separate application and determination, and (c) were seasonal in nature because citrus waste was actually available substantially for only six months. As this continued to be the determination until 1952 when the citrus molasses application for 7(b)(3) seasonal finding was denied, it comes here with the unique imprimatur which the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, \u00a7 16(c), 63 Stat. 910, put on pre-1949 orders, regulations, and interpretations of the Administrator. Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, 345 U.S. 13, 16-17, 73 S.Ct. 565, 97 L.Ed. 745; Maneja v. Waialua Agricultural Co., 349 U.S. 254, 270, 75 S.Ct. 719, 99 L.Ed. ,1040; Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S. 247, 255, 76 S.Ct. 330, 100 L.Ed. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">This state of fact was again recognized in 1952 when application was made by the Citrus Processors Association, Inc. to extend to citrus molasses the 1943 determination, note 7, supra, which was limited to the manufacture of citrus pulp cattle feed. Citrus molasses, as the description of the process, note 4, supra, reveals, is a by-product which is capable of separate use as such, or, as here, in reconstituting the dried pulp into feed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Not only does this demonstrate again the uniform administrative treatment of the citrus pulp by-products operation as one separate and apart from the 7(b) (3) \u201cfirst processing\u201d status earlier accorded in 1940, but it reflects the substantial basis for it. In 1943 the Administrator reversed his 1941 ruling on the ground that citrus waste, while theoretically available, was not <em>actually </em>available in excess of six months. But by 1952 postwar developments had occurred which were almost revolutionary in nature. Production of fruit of different varieties resulted in a marked and spectacular growth<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the volume and extent of operations. The citrus fruit operations and those related to it had expanded to the point where it was carried on for nearly the whole of the year. In this setting, on facts which the Employer does not here challenge, the Administrator denied the 1952 application. In doing so, the Administrator found that \u201ccitrus canning and concentrate plants now operate for 10 to 11 months and in heavy volume for at least 8 months; hence citrus pulp and waste from these plants are \u2018technically\u2019 available for a period of 10 to 11 months in the State of Florida and are actually available in large quantities for processing into cattle feed and molasses for at least 8 months during the year. * * * This pattern of operations represents a marked contrast with the situation when the previous determination was issued [1943], at which time the pattern of the dehydration industry was found to be a 6 to 7 months period including a trial period at the beginning of the season.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Three years later the Administrator, in 1955, again reviewed the whole citrus fruit industry on the application of labor unions which sought, not only revocation of the 1943 citrus pulp cattle feed 7(b) (3) determination, but made a broad attack on the 1940 finding of seasonality as to the Florida citrus fruit and first processing operations on the ground that even these direct activities were no longer seasonal in fact. On the 1955 record which formally included the 1952 citrus molasses record and other data, it was found, and later confirmed by the Administrator, that the 1943 finding of seasonality, note 7, supra, for the citrus pulp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>and waste industry as applied to the Florida branch of the industry should be revoked. As the \u00a7 7(b) (3) exemption relates to an \u201cindustry,\u201d not an individual employer, the hearing properly encompassed the probable duration of these processing activities throughout the state. It was found that the \u201clength of the season [had] increased substantially since the original pulp determination was issued\u201d and \u201cthe length of the pulp dehydration season typically is longer than that for any single fresh fruit operation, since the dehydration operation utilizes the pulp and waste from all fresh fruit \u25a0operations.\u201d As the subject of inquiry was the citrus waste pulp industry (and not the operational period of time of any individual plant engaged in it), the finding was significant that \u201cThose plants that receive raw material from more than \u2022one canning or concentrating plant will .start operations when a sufficient quantity is received from the first plant and continue until the last plant ceases operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Again proffering these findings and the Administrative report in evidence, the Employer here does not challenge the facts found. The Employer\u2019s contention is that if the citrus pulp by-product operation now extends substantially for 8 months or more (as it thus concedes), the same is true of the 1940 determination concerning the \u201cpacking, handling, and preparing in their raw or natural state\u201d and \u201cthe first processing and canning\u201d of the fruit itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Such an argument will scarcely pass muster. For merely because another obtained more than was warranted is no reason to afford similar relief to one' who, on recognized and valid standards, has not demonstrated an eligibility. Additionally, it assumes here that because the Florida orange or grapefruit and their canned or concentrated edible products compete nationwide with other fresh fruits and vegetables sufficiently to justify a nationwide definition of that industry, this inescapably requires that all manufacturing operations' industrially related to this fresh fruit are a part of <em>that </em>industry.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Neither this record nor the long-settled administrative practice supports any such assumption. Cattle feed, citrus molasses, or citrus molasses mixed in pulp cattle feed are hardly, a part of that intricate system by which in countless markets and groceries, at crossroads, in villages or metropolitan areas, America\u2019s millions may procure their daily ration of the highly advertised vitamins and nutrition from nature\u2019s bounty. And, at the same time, this practical difference in the nature of the goods, and the consistent administrative practice both recognizing and establishing it, also supports the reasonableness of the 1952 Amendment to the initial 1940 determination that \u201cfirst processing\u201d of fresh fruits was a 7 (b) (3) seasonal industry. This Amendment <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> expressly excludes by-product operations as a part of the fresh fruit \u201cindustry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number> There was thus ample basis for the finding that citrus pulp cattle feed and citrus molasses, alone or together, were operations not seasonable in nature, and that such operations constituted an \u201cindustry\u201d separate and apart from the fresh citrus fruit \u201cindustry.\u201d The determination came only after there had \u201c* * been a fair hearing, with notice and opportunity to present the circumstances and arguments to the decisive body, and an application of the statute in a just and reasoned manner.\u201d Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 411, 62 S.Ct. 326, 332, 86 L.Ed. 301, 309. The result was not arbitrary. It had ample factual support. And since \u201cThe Administrator fulfills his role when he makes a reasoned definition,\u201d Mitchell v. Budd, 350 U.S. 473, 480, 76 S.Ct. 527, 531, 100 L.Ed. 565, 574, it was and is valid. Within the framework of the statutory definition of \u201cindustry,\u201d the determination whether in a given situation, it comprises a single branch of an industry, several branches of an industry, a whole industry, or a group of industries, is one committed to the reasoned and informed discretion of the Administrator. Opp Cotton Mills v. Administrator, 312 U.S. 126, 149-150, 657, 61 S.Ct. 524, 85 L.Ed. 624, 638; Columbus &amp; G. Ry. Co. v. Administrator, 5 Cir., 126 F.2d 136, 139; Pearson v. Walling, 8 Cir., 138 F.2d 655, 657, certiorari denied 321 U.S. 775, 64 S.Ct. 616, 88 L.Ed. 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">We disagree, however, that the effective date was 1952 so that, as asserted in the Administrator\u2019s complaint for injunction, this Employer was in violation \u201cduring the period since February 27, 1953\u201d with respect to its operations, described in note 4, supra, in the production of its citrus pulp cattle feed with molasses. While the handwriting on the wall was then so plain that it required no Daniel as a seer, the fact is that as to citrus pulp cattle feed, the 1943 express determination of 7(b)(3) seasonal industry, note 7, supra, remained in effect until February 17,1956, when the 1955 revocation of the 1943 determination became effective.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The citrus pulp cattle feed \u201cindustry\u201d thereby defined, was entitled to rely completely on the 1943 finding until it was revoked. Here this Employer\u2019s production of citrus molasses is but a momentary manufacturing result in the continuous integrated production of a cattle feed fortified by citrus molasses. So far it appears it was producing citrus cattle feed only. Until the effective date of the 1955 determination, note 12, supra, that was declared to be a seasonal industry and 7(b)(3) applied to it.

This process is aptly described in the Employer\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-14\">\u201cIn the processing operation the fresh fruit after it has been graded and washed is placed in a fruit extractor where the juice is separated from the peel, seed and pulp. From the extractor the juice is piped into a surge tank and then to evaporators where it is concentrated. After it is concentrated it is blended in blending tanks and from there placed in a can and frozen after which the cans are cased and ready for market. The citrus peel, seeds and pulp is conveyed from the fruit extractors to a peel surge bin and from there it goes into a peel shredder where it is shredded and cut. Next, the shredded pulp is conveyed to a mixer where it is thoroughly mixed and then conveyed into a peel press, where the press water is separated from the pulp, seed and other solid parts. The solid material after separation is conveyed to a peel drier or dehydrator. The press water after being conveyed to a surge tank is pumped into an evaporator whore the moisture is evaporated from the water resulting in a syrup like fluid called molasses. This molasses is added back to the pulp coming from the peel press and on its way to the drier or dehydrator. The combined dried pulp and molasses is allowed to remain in the drier until thoroughly dried after which it is cooled and bagged. The entire process, that is, from the fresh orange to the finished product takes approximately two hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-16\">\u201cThe pulp operations are an integral part of the concentrate operations and said operations are interdependent. Both operations are carried on at the same location and at the same plant. The machinery used in the processing of each is so interrelated and connected that a break-down at any point would shut down both operations. As is the case of the juice leaving the extractor, the pulp and other waste material are highly perishable and must be processed within six hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">.

More than twice as much fruit is now grown, with virtually the entire increase going into processing rather than fresh markets. The amount processed lias increased from 17,825,000 boxes in 1939-40 to 83,719,000 boxes in 1953-54. Most of this increase has gone into the production of frozen concentrated juices.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b892-5\">. Because even these direct activities regularly occurred throughout substantially the whole year and way beyond the six-months standard, the Hearing Officer found that those operations could not, standing alone, qualify as seasonal in nature. Largely on the ground that Florida citrus fruits competed nationwide with other fresh fruits and vegetables, he concluded, although the question was a \u201cclose\u201d one, that this part of the Florida citrus activities should not be treated as a separate industry. Accordingly, so much of the application as sought the revocation of the 1940 determination was denied and subsequently confirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">.
