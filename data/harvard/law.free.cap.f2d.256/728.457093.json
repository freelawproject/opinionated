Dyer has stipulated in this court that he waives all damages for the harm claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The District Court had orally announced its opinion that it would order a reapportionment or in the alternative an election at large when Congress amended Section 55 of the Organic Act (Public Law 895, 84th Congress, 2d Session; 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 562) and itself ordered reapportionment of the senatorial and representative districts. This amendment, of course, made Dyer\u2019s controversy over reapportionment moot. Nevertheless the District Court entered a declaratory decree for Dyer recognizing and adjudicating the deprivation of his rights during the period prior to the amendment of Section 55. Since the sole purpose for such a decree was to afford Dyer a ground for the damages he now does not seek we reverse it and order the District Court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-21\">. The decree was predicated on the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1483.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
