Motion for a new trial was denied, and this timely appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">Appellant urges on this appeal as grounds for reversal: (1) The insufficiency of the evidence; (2) error of the trial court in declaring the wife to be a hostile witness; (3) error of the trial court in admitting, over objections of remoteness, testimony that Mrs. Stevens worked as a prostitute near Sacramento, California, in the early part of 1956 and in Miles City, Montana, in 1955; (4) error of the trial court in admitting three government Exhibits \u2014 Nos. 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 9 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 11.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">We will discuss the four errors urged together. Because the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>evidence to convict is challenged, it is necessary to detail some of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">There was no attempt on the part of anyone connected with this case to deny that Mrs. Stevens had embraced the oldest profession in Miles City, Montana in 1955 and had engaged in it near Sacramento, California early in 1956; in San Francisco, California in late 1955 and early 1956; and in Wallace, Idaho on April 10, 1956. Her voluntary registration with the police department at Wallace, Idaho on April 10th, as a prostitute, was described by a witness, and her registration card with her signature and fingerprints placed in evidence (Exhibit 8). Her prostitution covered a period both before and after her marriage to defendant on October 31, 1955. Mrs. Stevens\u2019 knowledge of any work her husband might do was extremely vague. She knew her husband sometimes worked as a cook, and sometimes as a bartender, and sometimes as a gambler. When she admittedly worked as a call-girl in San Francisco, California, he worked as a gambler, but she didn\u2019t know where. As a call-girl, she operated through bellboys in various hotels, some of whom testified. In the other places, she admittedly was an inmate of a house of prostitution. Her husband was known to at least some of her associates in both activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">It is undisputed by the testimony of Mrs. Stevens alone that the defendant husband knew of his wife\u2019s profession. He knew of her work at Sacramento. He knew <em>before </em>she left for Wallace, Idaho what she proposed to do in Idaho. He drove her to the ticket office to get <em>the </em>ticket. He drove her to the airport to take the plane for Spokane, Washington. At the airport, flight insurance was purchased by one of them, on her life, with the husband as beneficiary. Mrs. Stevens recalled that a woman friend, Kathy M-, gave her a \u201ccouple of little sun suits\u201d which Mrs. Stevens, being a confessed prostitute, recognized as \u201coutfits\u201d useful and useable in her profession, and known as \u201ctrick clothes.\u201d Her husband gave this Kathy a baby stroller, presumably in return for the \u201coutfits.\u201d \u201cKathy\u201d testified to this transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">But the statement which Mrs. Stevens allegedly gave to the two F.B.I. agents on April 10, 1956, which was initialed by her and stated to be true and correct, was repudiated by her on the witness stand and not only with respect to those matters which might have implicated her husband. She stated, in fact, \u201cI think there is hardly anything in the statement that is correct. * * * The whole thing is a falsehood.\u201d The agents \u201cput words in my mouth. * * * My answers were false.\u201d This, despite the fact that at the trial she couldn\u2019t \u201cremember what all I talked to them about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Mrs. Stevens could not remember at the trial whether or not she had told the F.B.I. she had earned $133 for twenty-one \u201ctricks\u201d on her first day at work. Exhibit 15, in her own handwriting and in evidence without objection, constituted her bookkeeping records, showing what she had earned, and showed twenty-one \u201ctricks\u201d by twenty-one entries of money received on April 10, 1956. This admittedly was given by her to the F.B.I. agents, and, on the same kind of stationery upon which she wrote out her earnings, she gave the F.B.I. a receipt for it and for other things (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 19).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>trial, it was only when questions were asked that might have directly implicated her husband, that she became vague about some things and certain about others. She didn\u2019t recall making the statement that her husband gave her three $20 bills to buy the ticket to Spokane from San Francisco. She remembered going to the car after buying the ticket, but couldn\u2019t remember if she had shown her husband the ticket. She remembered signing the application for insurance and making her husband the beneficiary, but she didn\u2019t remember whether her husband paid for it. All of these matters were described in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 11. She did remember that her husband had <em>not </em>told her to send her earnings to him by money order, contrary to the recital in Exhibit 11. She did remember that she left the house of ill repute near Sacramento and went <em>alone </em>to San Francisco, contrary to the recital in the statement that when she wanted to leave the house she telephoned her husband and \u201che drove up and got me.\u201d She remembered that her husband had <em>not </em>written \u201cPeggy\u201d and the telephone number \u201cWallace 1-4041\u201d on the card, at her request, but she didn\u2019t know whether she had told the F.B.I. men that he had written it because \u201cI was so mixed up,\u201d and \u201cthey twisted everything around\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s been over a year ago and I can\u2019t remember those things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The witness had written her husband a letter telling him she liked the place, but didn\u2019t remember if she told him the amount of money she was making. She may have said that she made $67.50, and that she was on a fifty-fifty split with the Madam.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The court did not arbitrarily declare that Mrs. Stevens was a reluctant and hostile witness. It was only after her testimony as hereinabove outlined in part was given that he was satisfied to grant the government\u2019s request that Mrs. Stevens be declared a hostile witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">Appellant raises the point that a witness cannot be impeached by the side calling him absent a real showing of surprise, and since the government made no attempt to contact this witness before the trial to check whether she would stand by her previous statement, they cannot now claim surprise as the basis for impeachment. The government replies that when it is under obligation to call all material witnesses it can impeach a witness\u2019 adverse testimony, and that it had no reason to believe Mrs. Stevens\u2019 statement would be different from her prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\"> The power to permit impeachment of one\u2019s own witnesses lies peculiarly and properly within the discretion of trial judges who can closely observe the witness\u2019 behavior on the stand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both Kuhn v. United States, 9 Cir., 1928, 24 F.2d 910, and Sullivan v. United States, 9 Cir., 1928, 28 F.2d 149, are properly cited for the appellant\u2019s position, but both are older cases and both involved one of many witnesses necessary for conviction, rather than the sole witness causing the proceeding. The court in those cases recited the commonly accepted rule that a party calling a witness cannot impeach except upon a showing of real surprise. This rule, however, is subject to much criticism in general and, in particular, in the situation where, as here, the government is under an obligation to call the witness. McCormick (Evidence, \u00a7 38) criticizes the rule in its entirety and indicates approval of the exception where there is an obligation (such as is on prosecuting officials) to call the witness. This Court has recently indicated approval of the latter exception where the government finds it necessary to impeach its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>witness (Meeks v. United States, 9 Cir., 1950, 179 F.2d 319, 321).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And although some of the older cases would require the government to investigate prior to trial before claiming surprise, such a rule seems entirely inconsistent with the processes of truth ascertainment (see McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 39) and an undue imposition on the government where they reasonably rely on the prior statements as the truth, to which the witness will again testify (Weaver v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 23, 25). Thus we conclude that no error was committed by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion in permitting impeachment of the government\u2019s own witness under the circumstances of this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Being a hostile witness, it was proper to impeach Mrs. Stevens. The best way in which this could be accomplished was by proof of prior inconsistent statements. This made admissible for purposes of impeachment the notes written by one of the F.B.I. agents at the time the conversation with Mrs. Stevens was had, which detailed the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The objection made to Exhibit ll\u2019s admissibility was that it was \u201cincompetent, immaterial, irrelevant, and hearsay as to the defendant.\u201d It was competent, it was material, and it was relevant. It was hearsay as to the defendant to the extent it tended to prove the fact of the matter asserted, that is, defendant\u2019s conduct with reference to the Wallace trip.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It was inadmissible as substantive evidence. But it was admissible to impeach the hostile witness. Weaver v. United States, supra; Meeks v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">No request was made by the defendant to limit the evidence to impeachment only, either when the evidence was received or at the conclusion of the trial. No exception to the court\u2019s instructions was taken, and particularly, to the court's general instruction on impeachment. No request for additional instructions was made. Fed.R.Crim.P. 51, 18 U.S.C. No request was made to have the evidence admitted for any limited purpose, or as against any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Since the notes were clearly admissible for a limited purpose, we hold the defendant waived error, if any, by failure to object, to except, or to request any limitation. The court\u2019s ruling, upon the record in this case, was not plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201cThe admitted normal rule is that an appellate court will not consider matters which are alleged as error for the first time on appeal, and this is true of criminal as well as civil cases.\u201d Smith v. United States, 9 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 181, 184; cases cited at note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Despite the fact that no such limiting instruction or admonition was sought by defendant\u2019s counsel, he now urges that the admission of Exhibit 11 was clearly erroneous, and that there was insufficient evidence, apart from Exhibit 11, to establish defendant\u2019s guilt. With this we cannot agree. The defendant\u2019s admitted knowledge of his wife\u2019s prostitution; his taking her to the ticket office and to the plane (whether or not he bought the ticket and paid for the fare); the testimony of McGovern that he had seen the defendant with Mrs. Stevens when she was working as a call-girl and when he (McGovern) had used her; the testimony of the first Mrs. Stevens that the defendant had suggested to her that prostitution \u201cwas a good way to make money,\u201d that he had suggested she become a prostitute; that she had refused; that in December 1955 his suggestion that he could place her in prostitution in Miles City, are all persuasive. Most damaging to defendant, in our view, was the testimony of Kathy M-, a prostitute, that the defendant introduced Mrs. Stevens as \u201chis old lady\u201d' in a bar; that he was not working then, but was in the bar every day during the daytime; that the defendant requested Kathy to obtain for him some \u201ctrick-shorts\u201d his wife could use in prostitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Clearly there was evidence sufficient to go to the jury, entirely apart from the evidence contained in Exhibit 11, and such evidence without the aid of Exhibit 11, was sufficient to entitle the jury to convict the defendant of knowingly persuading, inducing, and enticing his wife into prostitution. With Exhibit II in evidence for all purposes the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We need not devote much time to the point that Exhibits 4 and 9 were admitted in error. Mrs. Stevens did not trouble to deny she stayed in Room 14A of the Davenport Hotel in Spokane, Washington, with a Mr. C- on April 9, 1956. Exhibit 4 may have been cumulative, but it was admissible, and certainly its introduction could not prejudice the defendant. The telephone number of the house of prostitution in Wallace, Idaho and the Madam\u2019s name were material to the case, though perhaps not admissible against the defendant until connected up. It was cumulative as to the issue of prostitution as the purpose of Mrs. Stevens\u2019 journey. But certainly no prejudicial error occurred by reason of its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We need not devote any greater time to appellant\u2019s point three \u2014 the remoteness of the prostitution at Sacramento and Miles City. Both were within a year, and closer to six months prior to the acts charged in the indictment. The trial court has wide discretion as to the materiality and relevancy of such matters, and we would not disturb its decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">Our discussion hereinabove clearly shows that there was neither error in the introduction of the testimony objected to, nor in declaring the witness Mrs. Stevens a hostile witness, nor in submitting the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The judgment must be, and is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\">.

There is a serious disagreement with this traditional rule by both McCormick and Wigmore (McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 39; Wigmore, Evidence (3 ed.) \u00a7 1018), but both admit that the courts have not yet found themselves able to overcome the traditional \u2022objections to hearsay to recognize the fact that in this situation the supposedly dangerous evidence is much more likely the truth and supplies the main requirement of hearsay, that is, the out of court declarant is presently on the stand and thus subject to cross-examination. Both writers feel also that the earlier statement being closer in time to the event and made under circumstances indicating its veracity, is probably better believed in a search for the truth. However, both concede the rule is that such evidence cannot be used substantively. The government here relies on a slight modification of that rule, adopted originally in the Second Circuit (Di Carlo v. United States, supra) and apparently recognized in this circuit (Craig v. United States, 1936, 81 F.2d 816, 828). However, the modification requires some indication in the record that the prior statements be \u201cadopted\u201d by the witness on the stand, in the sense that the record shows the jury could have believed that the witness considered them correct and thereby they became a part of Ms present testimony (see United States v. Block, 2 Cir., 1937, 88 F.2d 618, 620). Whatever the merits of this exception, the record contains such complete denials of the accuracy or veracity of the F.B.I. statements by Mrs. Stevens, that it would seem entirely inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\">.
