Soto, De Leon, 4/22/57 Marihuana Olivo</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Counts three and four were dismissed on motion of the government, Moody and Del Rio were granted a severance, and the cause proceeded June 11, 1957 to trial on the remaining counts, and the verdict was returned June 17, 1957; Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 was decided June 3, 1957. Counsel for the two appellants claim reversible errors are present because: (1) the trial judge sustained, or countenanced, the prosecution\u2019s refusal \u201cto turn over reports of testifying agents\u201d; denied Soto and De Leon a severance, and refused to grant the defense motion for a directed verdict, (2) there were prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor and government witnesses, and, (3) the evidence fails to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Prom what has already been stated it is apparent that counts three and four charge Olivo, Moody and Del Rio with a marijuana transaction of March 18, 1957, without naming either of the two defendant-appellants now before us. When the present case went to trial Olivo was defending on counts 1, 2, 5 and 6, but he alone was accused in counts 1 and 2 and with Soto and De Leon on the fifth and sixth counts. Singer\u2019s testimony, given for the government in his capacity as a treasury enforcement agent, concerned purchases of heroin: (1) from Olivo on February 7, 1957 \u2014 the subject-matter of counts 1 and 2 and, (2) the marijuana transaction on April 22, 1957 involving Olivo and his co-defendants Soto and De Leon under counts 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The dismissal of counts 3 and 4 charging Olivo and, the Del Rio-Moody severance, precluded testimony by Singer regarding the March 18,1957 transaction and, for those reasons, he related nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">To maintain its proof under the counts in issue the government, through the testimony of several federal narcotics agents, including Bernard Singer, and appellant\u2019s co-defendant Reynolds Olivo, showed inter alia, the following. After some negotiations of Singer with Olivo during the week prior to the indictment date, April 22, 1957, Olivo agreed to sell Agent Singer roughly 50 pounds of marijuana at seventy dollars per pound, and for that purpose Singer went to Olivo\u2019s house, 1408 West Harrison Street, Chicago, at 7 P.M. On his arrival in a government vehicle, Singer observed Olivo standing in front of his house talking with Soto and De Leon, waited for several minutes until those two appellants departed and until Olivo joined Singer. Following Olivo\u2019s directions, Singer drove to a point in the vicinity of 84th and Burley Streets, on Chicago\u2019s south side, where Olivo got out of the government vehicle and disappeared from Singer\u2019s view. Subsequently Soto and De Leon walked past Singer\u2019s automobile in the same direction taken by Olivo, and they also got out of Singer\u2019s sight, only to reappear several moments later, again passing Singer. Afterward, Olivo returned and told Singer to drive to 90 th and Burley Streets, where, after waiting a few minutes, Singer asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here? Is somebody supposed to meet us here ?\u201d Olivo replied, \u201cYea(h), but I am not sure that I have got the right street comer.\u201d Five minutes later, when a Plymouth automobile came in view, Olivo said, \u201cWell, there they go,\u201d and he directed Singer to follow that car. Following the Plymouth led back to 84th and Burley where both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>cars, the Plymouth and government vehicle, were there parked. Soto and De Leon got out of the Plymouth, went to the rear of it and opened the car trunk; Olivo asked Singer where he wanted the marijuana. Telling him to put it in the trunk, Singer then opened the government car trunk. Soto and De Leon removed three gunny sacks (containing 56 pounds of marijuana according to counsel\u2019s stipulation <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the trial court) from the Plymouth and placed them in the trunk of the Singer vehicle. After opening one package from each sack, Singer signaled several other agents waiting in the vicinity, and when they arrived Olivo, Soto and De Leon were arrested. This transfer of marijuana was made without a written order and the overt acts, just described, of Soto and De Leon are undisputed and witnessed. Olivo readily admitted the sale and transfer during his testimony given below. The defense of Soto and De Leon consisted solely of examining the government witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">On cross-examination Singer testified that he made \u201croutine\u201d reports to the Bureau of Narcotics; that there were a \u201cnumber of reports\u201d made in this case. When this government witness was examined by counsel defending Olivo the following exchange, urged as the foundation for production of these reports, took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">\u201cQ. How often do you make a report? A. Only on those occasions when some importance occurs, such as the purchase of narcotics, would I make a report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cQ. Well, do you make a report about how you are introduced to a man ? Do you give a detailed explanation? A. Not necessarily, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cQ. Well, what type of a report did you make in this case? A. I made what I would consider a routine report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-9\">\u201cQ. When did you make that? A. I wouldn\u2019t know the date of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-10\">\u201cQ. Approximately? A. Well, there would be a number of reports made on this particular case. I don\u2019t know which one in particular you mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-11\">\u201cQ. About how many reports? A. I couldn\u2019t say without looking at the file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-12\">\u201cQ. And do they all concern Olivo and these other two defendants? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-13\">\u201cQ. In this particular case? A. I think that you will have to be a little more specific in referring to the file before I can answer your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-15\">\u201cQ. Well, as to what you have testified here as to the dates and the times and the bargaining over the price, did you make a report on that? A. I have just testified that I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-16\">\u201cQ. Well, what type of a report did you make? A. I would only make a report, I repeat, on those dates on which something of some importance occurred such as the purchase of the narcotic exhibits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-17\">\u201cQ. Well, what is your testimony about this particular case? You said you made three or four reports on this case? A. Possibly more than that are contained in the file. I don't know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-19\">\u201cQ. Do you have those reports with you ? A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-20\">\u201cMr. Devitt: Your Honor, I would like to call for the production of those reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-21\">\u201cMr. Grady: The Government is going to object to that, your Honor. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-22\">Appellate counsel, acting on behalf of Soto and De Leon, press on us the paral-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>lei manifestations of policy they think are found in both Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 and Jencks v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the outset, however, we underscore the uncontroverted evidence of possession, and concealment established on the record before us, and stress that this is a record barren of any firm showing of relevancy regarding \u201cdisclosure of an informer\u2019s identity, or of the contents of his communication.\u201d Indeed Mr. Justice Burton, delivering the Roviaro majority opinion wrote: \u201cwe believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable.\u201d 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 628. It must be remembered that the unidentified informer in the Roviaro case was a material witness. An examination of the circumstances under which the Supreme Court made some statements in Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, quoted to us by defense counsel in the current appeal illustrates how in-apposite their use by these defendants is to the instant question. In Roviaro the government, having virtually abandoned its position on Count 1 [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2554 (a)], was struggling to maintain the conviction on Count 2, charging illegal transportation of narcotics under 65 Stat. 767, 768, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174, by reasoning that: \u201c * * * the identity of the informer, in the circumstances * * * has no real bearing on that charge and is therefore privileged.\u201d 353 U.S. 53, 59, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627. The relevancy and materiality of testimony which might have been given by, or about, the unidentified \u2014 unproduced informer was evaluated in the setting of Count 2 under the particular factual situation pointed up by Mr. Justice Burton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-7\">\u201cThe circumstances of this case demonstrate that John Doe\u2019s [the informer] possible testimony was highly relevant and might have been helpful to the defense. So far as petitioner knew, he and John Doe were alone and unobserved, during the crucial occurrence for which he was indicted. Unless petitioner waived his constitutional right not to take the stand in his own defense, John Doe <em>was Ms one material witness. </em>Petitioner\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine Police Officer Bryson and Federal Narcotics Agent Durham was hardly a substitute for an opportunity to examine <em>the man who had been nearest to him and took part in the transaction. </em>Doe had helped to set up the criminal occurrence and had played a prominent part in it. His testimony might have disclosed an entrapment. He might have thrown doubt upon petitioner\u2019s identity or on the identity of the package. He was the only witness who might have testified to petitioner\u2019s possible lack of knowledge of the contents of the package that he \u2018transported\u2019 from the tree to John Doe\u2019s car. The desirability of calling John Doe as a witness, or at least interviewing him in preparation for trial, was a matter for the accused rather than the Government to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-10\">\u201cFinally, the Government\u2019s use against petitioner of his conversation with Joe Doe while riding in Doe\u2019s car particularly emphasizes the unfairness of the nondisclosure in this case. The only person, other than petitioner himself, who could controvert, explain or amplify Bry-son\u2019s report of this important conversation was John Doe. Contradiction or amplification might have borne upon petitioner\u2019s knowledge of the contents of the package or might have tended to show an entrapment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201cThis is a case where the Government\u2019s informer was the sole participant, other than the accused, in the transaction charged. The informer was the only witness in a position to amplify or contradict the testimony of government witnesses. Moreover, a government witness testified that Doe denied knowing petitioner or ever having seen him before. We conclude that, under these circumstances, the trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting the Government to withhold the identity of its undercover employee in the face of repeated demands by the accused for his disclosure.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\u2019What distinguishes Roviaro from the Soto-De Leon appeal is the informer\u2019s participation and perpetration in the proscribed behavior with Roviaro, implemented by conversations between the two .actors during <em>the </em>episode. Soto and De Leon, on the other had, were on trial with Olivo who not only participated but who testified about the transaction involving Soto and De Leon. Just how .any information concerning an informer (if there was one) would aid the defense \u2022of Soto and De Leon is unexplained in this record save for some unconnected utterances of Olivo\u2019s counsel regarding \u2022entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">While testifying as a government witness, about his reports filed with the Bureau of Narcotics, Singer stated that they did not all concern Olivo, De Leon and Soto. From the unduly extended colloquy concerning the report, it is clear that there was a 21-page report from which the government excised certain portions leaving scattered fragments<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> relating to Singer\u2019s testimony, and these were handed the attorney representing Olivo. Counsel for appellants refused to look at the \u201cconfetti\u201d and later when agent Cloonan was on the witness stand the U. S. Attorney said: \u201cI have here, your Honor, all portions of this report which are pertinent to this witness\u2019 testimony, and I hereby tender them to counsel,\u201d appellant\u2019s attorney refused that tender.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">We believe it is the sounder view that nothing said in Jencks authorizes rummaging through government reports by defendants hunting for exculpatory scraps. Gordon v. United States, 1953, 344 U.S. 414, 419, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447. The total report on activities of all defendants named in the six counts might make the report somewhat relevant but those portions of it touching defendants other than those then on trial would be irrelevant since neither Singer nor Cloonan, or any other government agent, testified about anything beyond<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> matters concerning Olivo, De Leon and Soto. So much of the reports relating to the testimony given by Singer and Cloon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>an were produced and we think that is all Jencks required.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">When Olivo voluntarily took the witness stand he verified some critical portions of the evidence given by the government agents. Yet it was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion to order all three defendants to be tried together. Stilson v. United States, 1919, 250 U.S. 583, 40 S.Ct. 28, 63 L.Ed. 1154. See Rules 12(g) (2) and 14, Federal Rules Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. Abuse of sound judicial discretion on that point is unsupported by this record. United States v. Kramer, 7 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 656. Soto and De Leon in our judgment, had a fair trial. Dunaway v. United States, 1953, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 205 F.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Defendant\u2019s attack on the presumption <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> laid down by Congress in 21 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 176a was recently answered in Caudillo v. United States, 9 Cir., 253 F.2d 513 and we are in accord. See also Garcia v. United States, 10 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s remark, during an ill-advised exchange among the attorneys, which counsel for the defense claims ran afoul of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 because the finding of mental competency was indirectly brought to the possible notice of the jury is, at best, harmless error. Federal Rules Criminal Procedure, Rule 52 (a), 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Though we considered all points urged on behalf of these appellants those left unmentioned in this opinion required no reported discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-16\">. Section 4742(a) provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, whether or not required to pay a special tax and register under sections 4751 to 4753, inclusive, to transfer marihuana, except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such marihuana is transferred, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Secretary or his delegate.\u201d 68A Stat. 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-17\">.
