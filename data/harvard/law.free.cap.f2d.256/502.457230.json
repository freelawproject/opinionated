He contends that the remedy by motion under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Warner claims that he is entitled to a remedy by habeas corpus because he has filed five different proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District Court of Alaska in each of which his motion was denied and his motion to appeal in forma pauperis denied by the District Court. However, in but one of the five cases did he move this court to appeal in forma pauperis, and in that one case the motion <em>was </em>made after the time for appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">We think no inadequacy to test the legality of Warner\u2019s rights under \u00a7 2255 is shown.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
