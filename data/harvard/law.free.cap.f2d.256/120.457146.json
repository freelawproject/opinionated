Miller, entered into an agreement with Pauline Furber, appellee [then the divorced wife of John Marti], in September of 1939, to live together as common-law husband and wife; that, thereupon, they entered into that status and lived together continuously until his death on April 21, 1944, during which time they held themselves out to their relatives and friends, as well as to strangers, as husband and wife; that two children were born of their relationship, namely, Roberta Miller (born August 30, 1940) and Allen Miller (born July 12, 1943) ; and that their common-law father, Andrew A. Miller, \u201cacknowledged them to be his children by every conceivable means thereby legitimatizing said children under the laws of the State of <em>Ohio.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-19\">The district court denied the motion of appellant for summary judgment and granted the motion of the appellee, mother of the minor children, for summary judgment, recognizing Roberta and Allen Miller to be entitled to social security benefits under the Social Security Act as the legitimate children of the wage-earner, Andrew A. Miller. It was held that child\u2019s insurance benefits were awarded to Roberta and Allen Miller [minor-claimants] as the children of the fully or currently insured wage-earner, Andrew Miller, [as defined under the Social Security Act] from and after April 29, 1944, which was the date on which Pauline Miller [later Furber], claimant, applied for widow\u2019s insurance benefits for herself and for child\u2019s insurance benefits for each of the two children, Roberta and Allen Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-20\">United States District Judge Connell, highly experienced in the interpretation of Ohio law, in a logically reasoned opinion discussed the applicability and meaning of such law and decided that the children fell within the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, section 2105.18, and were therefore entitled to Social Security benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-21\">The Ohio statute provides: \u201cWhen by a woman a man has one or more children, and afterwards intermar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>r\u00edes with her, such issue, if acknowledged by him as his child or children, will be legitimate. The issue of parents whose marriage is null in law, shall nevertheless be legitimate.\u201d Gen.Code, \u00a7 10503-15. The district judge well stated that the reason and spirit of that section of the Ohio Code \u201cis to legitimatize children; to permit legitimatized children to inherit from the father as well as the mother; and to protect innocent offspring from punishment for the sins committed by their parents.\u201d The following Ohio authorities were cited: Wright v. Lore, 12 Ohio St. 619; Carmichael v. State, 12 Ohio St. 553; Clinton County Nat. Bank <em>&amp; </em>Trust v. Todhunter, 43 Ohio App. 289, 183 N.E. 88; Bates v. State, 9 Ohio Cir.Ct.R.N.S., 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The district court also quoted 26 O.Jur. 93, to the effect that in a civil action a marriage may be established by showing that the parties lived together, and cohabited as husband and wife for a series of years; and that they were so treated and reputed to be in the community and circle wherein they moved, although no witnesses testified that they saw the couple marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Pauline Miller Furber testified that on the day he returned from a three or four months\u2019 trip West, Miller told her that he had been divorced from his wife so that they could be married. Asked why they had not had a \u201cceremonial marriage,\u201d she replied that Miller told her they would live together as man and wife for a while, which would be legal, until he arranged his financial affairs, whereupon they would be married in church. She said that she loved the man and took him at his word. She stated further that Miller put his hand on a Bible and asked, \u201cPauline, will you take this man for your wedded husband?\u201d She testified that she had replied : \u201cI take Andrew for my husband\u201d; that he then \u201creversed the words\u201d and said, \u201cI take Pauline as my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Upon consideration of the entire record in the case and of the opinion of the district judge, we affirm his judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b176-8\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A2h\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">I join the court in following the District Court\u2019s construction of Ohio law legitimatizing the wage-earner\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The District Court\u2019s order, however, also directed that child\u2019s insurance benefits be paid to appellee \u201cfrom and after April 29th 1944.\u201d This is the date of the first application, filed by appellee on her own and the two children\u2019s behalf, which the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance rejected on July 15, 1944, and which she thereafter abandoned. The application upon which the present suit rests was filed by appellee eleven years later, on June 7, 1955, and only on behalf of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">Section 202(j) (1) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(j) (1), limits retroactivity of benefits to a year prior to the date of the application. The question whether the benefits here involved should be geared to the 1944 application or the 1955 application was not specifically in issue at any stage of the proceedings below. By assuming that appellee\u2019s abandonment of the 1944 application was not binding upon her children, one can gear the benefits to that early application. But what this court, now assumes is a matter that was not considered below. Moreover, the effect of abandonment may well turn upon a finding as to what the attendant circumstances were. I think sound principles, of judicial administration require that the administrative agency be afforded the opportunity, in the first instance, of' passing upon this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would therefore reverse and remand to the agency with appropriate instructions for that purpose.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\">. Other questions not considered below relate to the finality and appealability of the rejection of the 1944 application. These questions as well, I think, should not be disposed of on this appeal. To the extent that they should remain in the case, it would be time enough to consider them judicially after further administrative action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
