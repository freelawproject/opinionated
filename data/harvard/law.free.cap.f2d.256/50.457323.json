The two wore charged jointly in counts one and four of violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a \u2014 knowingly selling or facilitating the sale of marijuana. Counts two and three were charges against Landry alone. Sometime between indictment and trial, the fifth count alleging conspiracy, as appellant states, was \u201cdropped.\u201d A joint trial of the two defendants was had. Defendant was convicted on counts one and four, as charged. His co-defendant was convicted on all four counts. Anthony, appellant here, has taken a timely appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">Appellant does not urge the insufficiency of the evidence to convict on either count. He does urge four alleged errors in the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">An informer, or \u201cstool pigeon,\u201d introduced federal narcotics officers to co-defendant Landry as a possible supplier of marijuana. Landry supplied the narcotics officer with several ounces of marijuana on February 23, 1957, which marijuana was delivered to the officer in a common brown-paper grocery bag. This was immediately after defendant had arrived at Landry\u2019s home, apparently for the purpose of delivering something in a similar brown-paper bag seen to be in appellant\u2019s possession as he walked to Landry\u2019s apartment just prior to the sale. This was count one charged against defendant and Landry.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">On February 27, 1957 Landry sold a pound of marijuana to the narcotics officer. At that time defendant had been parked in his automobile near Landry\u2019s apartment. After the narcotics officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>left, Landry came out of his house, went to appellant\u2019s car and had a conversation with Anthony. After a few moments Landry got out of the car and defendant left. <em>Appellant was not charged with this sale of February 27, 1957, </em>but Landry was.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">On March 7, 1957 the narcotics officer made a third purchase of two pounds of marijuana. Co-defendant Landry brought this marijuana in a similar bag, from the back to the front room of his building. At that time Anthony\u2019s car was parked at the rear of the house. The narcotics officer took the marijuana to his car. The defendant while this was happening got into his car and circled the block, returned and parked near Landry\u2019s apartment. After the narcotics officer left, Landry came out of the apartment and got into defendant\u2019s car for a few minutes. <em>Appellant was not charged on this sale of March 7, 1957, </em>but Landry was.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On March 11, 1957 the same narcotics officer made a fourth purchase at Landry\u2019s apartment after parking his car on the rear driveway. While the narcotics officer was in Landry\u2019s apartment, the defendant had parked his car and appeared at the rear door. Defendant and Landry walked out to appellant\u2019s car and Landry returned with a brown-paper bag containing two pounds of marijuana.' The narcotics officer paid Landry $140. The narcotics officer left by the rear door and found an auto in the driveway blocking his exit to the street. The narcotics officer complained to Landry that his egress was blocked. Landry spoke out the window to the driver of the obstructing auto. The narcotics officer recognized defendant in the front seat of the obstructing auto. The driver backed the obstructing auto out and the narcotics officer left. Landry then went to defendant\u2019s car, got in for a few minutes then went back into his apartment. Defendant left the scene in his auto. The defendant was arrested several minutes later. On his person was found the $140 previously given by the narcotics officer to Landry, identified by the serial numbers of the bills previously recorded. Two bags of marijuana were found in defendant\u2019s car. This sale was charged as count four against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Appellant claims as the first error the admission of testimony that marijuana was found in appellant\u2019s car on March 11, 1957 when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">It must first be noted that the trial court at the time it was offered carefully and specifically limited the introduction of the evidence of existence of the marijuana in appellant\u2019s auto \u201cto negative mistake, and on the issue of his state of mind or intent, and for that limited purpose only.\u201d The court again carefully instructed the jury at the conclusion of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Appellant claims evidence of a <em>subsequent </em>criminal act cannot prove intent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>knowledge, and cites three cases. We first analyze the time element involved in the cases appellant relies on, for comparison with the facts of the instant case. In Hubby v. United States, 5 Cir., 1945, 150 F.2d 165, the second possession of narcotics was at a time over a month subsequent to the possession charged. In Witters v. United States, 1939, 70 App.D.C. 316, 106 F.2d 837, 838, 125 A.L.R. 1031, the only reference respecting the time element in the purchase of stolen bicycles was that \u201con three separate occasions within a period of about two weeks appellant purchased other bicycles from three different boys.\u201d In Lawson v. State, 1945, 148 Tex.Cr.R. 140, 185 S.W.2d 439, evidence of the sale of liquor twenty-six days subsequent to the sale charged was held inadmissible, but its admission was held not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">In the instant case, appellant <em>assumes </em>that the proof relates to a <em>subsequent </em>act. It <em>was </em>subsequent chronologically, but occurred not only on the same day, but certainly within a half-hour, and probably within a very few minutes. The narcotics officer arrived at co-defendant Landry\u2019s apartment at 8:15 p. m. on March 11, 1957; the arrest took place at 9:00 p. m. on the same date, about five minutes after Anthony received the identifiable money.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The possession at the scene of the arrest might well be considered part and parcel of one entire transaction, <em>i. e., </em>the sale and delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The trial court required the government to establish guilt as to Count IV <em>by other evidence </em>before the jury was allowed to consider the marijuana found in the car, and then only to show appellant\u2019s state of mind with respect to the already estabished sale of marijuana, or as the court expressed it, \u201cin other words, to show he [appellant] knew what he was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> Appellant\u2019s whole argument on this point overlooks entirely the limitation ordered by the court and the instructions given by the court, which the jury presumably followed. The court specifically told the jury that the fact a defendant may have done an act on one occasion would not be proof he did it on another.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence introduced solely for the limited purpose ordered by the trial court and considered by the jury under the court\u2019s careful instruction was proper, even if obtained subsequent to the crime charged, Shreve v. United States, 9 Cir., 1939, 103 F.2d 796, 803, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 570, 60 S.Ct. 84, 84 L.Ed. 479. It was admissible as an exception to the general rule of inadmissibility to prove the crime charged, Helton v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 338, 340; to show an established plan or intent, United States v. Wall, 7 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 905, 908; \u201cabsence of mistake,\u201d or \u201caccident,\u201d Hoyer v. United States, 8 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 134, 138; intent or absence of mistake, Smith v. United States, 9 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 181, 185; or to show \u201cknowledge,\u201d even when no cautionary instruction is given in a narcotics case, Wright v. United States, 9 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 595, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">The second and third errors relied on by appellant may be considered one \u2014 that the court permitted the questioning of defendant as to previous use of marijuana, and the admission of testimony purporting to establish that defendant had admitted such previous use.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">The use of such testimony must be placed in context with its purpose and other evidence in the case. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>had denied he had ever seen or used marijuana before his arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">It should be noted (a) that most of the cross-examination and all of the rebuttal testimony now claimed as error was not objected to at the trial; (b) that defendant\u2019s counsel himself asked questions concerning previous use of marijuana; and (c) that no cautionary or any instruction was requested by appellant at the trial, with respect to such evidence so introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant has waived any claimed error by failure to object in the trial court. Williams v. United States, 8 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 529; Gianotos v. United States, 9 Cir., 1939, 104 F.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Appellant further urges on oral argument that his appeal is supported by two cases from the California courts. We find little comfort for him in either of them. In People v. Blodgett, 1956, 4&amp; Cal.2d 114, 293 P.2d 57, defendant was charged with possession of marijuana. He was asked about the effects of heroin allegedly taken the night before, and the court sustained an objection to such a question. Such ruling was held proper. The obvious purpose of the prosecutor was to fix in the jury\u2019s mind the fact of previous use of the second narcotic drug. The Supreme Court of California said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-28\">\u201cNo further direct reference was made to heroin, but Mrs. Grundy and Sanders were questioned in detail concerning the activities of the three in the restroom. During the questioning it was brought out that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>had partaken of Sanders\u2019 purchase. It is apparent from the repeated references to the restroom and the conduct therein that the purpose of the questions was to keep constantly before the jury the suggestion in the opening statement [that heroin was used by defendant the night before] that could not properly be proved. Cf. People v. Mullings, 83 Cal. 138, 145-146, 23 P. 229, 17 Am.St.Rep. 223. A careful review of the entire record convinces us, however, that this misconduct did not result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id., 46 Cal.2d at page 118, 293 P.2d at page 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In People v. Perez, 1954, 128 Cal.App.2d 750, 276 P.2d 72, defendant was charged with possession of marijuana. He was asked about prior use of both heroin and marijuana. Testimony of prior addiction was held not prejudicial. In that connection we should note that the California court stated (128 Cal.App.2d at page 756, 276 P.2d at page 75):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A94\">\u201cPrior addiction to marijuana would be relevant to the issue of \u2018guilty knowledge\u2019 of marijuana\u2019s nature, it was so held of prior use of opium on the charge of possession of opium in People v. Gin Hauk Jue, [93 Cal.App.2d 72, 75, 208 P.2d 717] supra; but prior use of heroin is not necessarily relevant to a guilty knowledge of the less dangerous narcotic, marijuana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The fourth (here third) alleged error relied on by appellant was the admission into evidence of the declarations of a co-defendant made in the absence of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\"> This point is not well taken. The trial court has a large discretion as to the order in which evidence may be introduced in a conspiracy case, or a case tried on the theory of joint enterprise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Here there was, in our opinion, sufficient evidence <em>aliunde </em>the conversations in question to show the existence of a joint enterprise or concert of action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence offered was \u201cconnected up\u201d by subsequent evidence. This was largely circumstantial evidence, it is true, as was much of the evidence against this appellant, but it was extremely convincing evidence. This is not the case, therefore, where the <em>only </em>evidence of the concert of action was the complained of evidence, and hence the rule of Nibbelink v. United States, 6 Cir., 1933, 66 F.2d 178, 179, and comparable cases, is not applicable. If not \u201cconnected up,\u201d or if defendant\u2019s counsel thought it was not so connected, he had the obligation to move to strike the unconnected incriminating conversation. This he failed to do.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">Finding no error in the admission of evidence, the judgment of conviction on both counts is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">. \u201c[T]he jury will recall what the court said previously with respect to that matter. <em>The fact that a defendant may have done a certain act on one occasion is not proof that he did it on another occasion. </em>And with respect to this particular exhibit, it may be received in evidence on the issue alone of the intent or state of mind of the defendant Anthony.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In other words, if you should find from the other evidence in the case, independent of this series of five exhibits, Exhibit No. 5, with respect to any offense charged, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt from the other evidence in the case that defendant Anthony committed the offense charged in the indictment, then you may then, and only then consider this testimony with respect to the Exhibit 5 evidence; that is, as with respect to what was recovered in his car after the arrest. <em>And then you may consider it only with respect to his state of mind, </em>with respect to the offenses, if any, which you find that he did commit. In other words, <em>it is offered, </em>on the Government\u2019s theory, <em>to negative mistalce or inadvertence or innocence with respect to any transaction charged in the indictment; </em>in other words, to show he knew what he was doing. <em>It is for that purpose, only, and may he considered for that purpose only </em>\u2014 namely, <em>intent or state of mind.\u2019\u2019 </em>[Tr. 159-160.
