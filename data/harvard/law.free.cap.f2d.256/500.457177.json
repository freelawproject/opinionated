C. Andrews, Jr., Thomasville, Ga., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b554-21\">W. Howard Fowler, Asst. U. S. Atty., Frank 0. Evans, U. S.

United States, 5 Cir., 250 F.2d 549; Moomaw v. United States, 5 Cir., 220 F.2d 589; and that on the record there is no basis for the claim that the evidence implicating him in the conspiracy is so wanting that it would be plain error to affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The same situation exists as to the second claim of error. The claim now made was not sufficiently asserted below to preserve it on appeal. But it would not avail appellant if the objection had been made and preserved, for Cox was admittedly the prime mover in the conspiracy, and in such circumstances the law is established quite to the contrary of the appellant\u2019s claim. In Heflin v. United States, 5 Cir., 132 F.2d 907, 909, this court thus stated the general and prevailing rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cUpon a trial for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, the acts and declarations of one of the parties to a conspiracy otherwise proven, whether or not he is a defendant, are admissible in evidence if they were made in an attempt to carry the conspiracy into execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Cf. Phelps v. United States, 8 Cir., 160 F.2d 858 and Clune v. United States, 159 U.S. 590, 16 S.Ct. 125, 40 L.Ed. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
