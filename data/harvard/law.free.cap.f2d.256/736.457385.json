The district court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">It is uncontradicted that the trademark Perfectform was adopted in 1944 by appellant in its business of manufacturing ladies slips, panties, pajamas, nightgowns and bed jackets. On May 18, 1948, registration of the trade-mark (#500,444) in the Supplemental Register, under Section 1091 of the Lanham Act, was allowed appellant. The evidence is that after the adoption of the trade-mark in 1944 and starting with the year 1945, plaintiff advertised its mark regularly. Its general advertising expense steadily increased from then on<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> through 1952 in which year it reached a peak of $11,461.00. Appellant\u2019s sales of Perfectform slips and petticoats showed corresponding increases through 1951; after that, a marked decline. As testified to, these in dollars were: \u201c1945, ninety-nine thousand; 1946, a hundred and forty-nine thousand; 1947, four hundred and forty-two thousand; 1948, seven hundred and eighteen thousand; 1949, seven hundred and eight thousand; 1950, seven hundred and sixty-five thousand; 1951, one million sixty-six thousand; 1952, one million twenty-three thousand; 1953, six hundred and five thousand; 1954, five hundred and forty-five thousand; 1955, five hundred and thirty-two thousand; 1956, four hundred and twelve thousand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">It was in 1951 that the defendant-ap-pellee, a brassiere maker, took the trademark Perfect Form using block type and with the name in a straight line. It applied for trade-mark registration of that name in that style to the Patent Office, October 29, 1953. The Patent Office denied the application because the mark was identical with plaintiff\u2019s and because defendant\u2019s goods and plaintiff's \u201care closely related it is believed that confusion in trade would result if applicant\u2019s mark were allowed over registrant\u2019s marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">A renewal of defendant\u2019s application for the trade-mark was filed with the Patent Office April 12, 1955, At that time defendant urged that its use of the name Perfect Form for brassieres was so substantially different from Perfectform Corporation\u2019s use that confusion would be unlikely. It said further, \u201cThe mark \u2018Perfect Form\u2019 is a combination of the dominant portion of appellant\u2019s corporate name and the descriptive term \u2018form\u2019. Such combination is registrable under the recent decision of Assistant Commissioner Robert in Ex Parte The Celotex Corp., 103 U.S.P.Q. 141. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">The Patent Office on July 29, 1955, again denied the application, holding :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUHS\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s mark is \u2018Perfect Form\u2019, applied to brassieres. Registrant\u2019s marks are both \u2018Perfect-form\u2019, applied to ladies\u2019 slips, panties, pajamas, nightgowns and bed jackets. The marks are identical and the goods are closely related. Applicant\u2019s brassieres and registrant\u2019s lingerie are articles for women and are often purchased in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>same shops. Slips are often made with brassieres in them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXO\">\u201cIt is believed that concurrent use in the same geographical areas of the marks involved herein would be reasonably likely to cause confusion in trade. Registration is, therefore, refused in view of registration numbers 419,893 and 500,444.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A73\">\u201cThe refusal is made final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a2n-dedup-0\">The original appellee corporation was organized April 5, 1932. That was sue-ceeded in 1936 by a New Jersey corporation of the same name. The name Per-feet Brassiere Co., Inc. has been used since 1932; first by the original company and since then by defendant. According to its principal witness, defendant\u2019s business from the beginning has been to sell brassieres \u201cMostly to variety stores, such as Woolworth\u2019s, McCrory\u2019s, and so forth. All over the country.\u201d It designated its brassieres as \u201cPerfect Bra\u201d and also used the word \u201cPerfect\u201d standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"agc-dedup-0\">ti * , ,, , . , , It is agreed that m approximately, July of 1951, the defendant started its use of the mark Perfect Form. And it was testified to by the same principal witness, Abraham Rubinstein, the directing head of the defendant company, that in 1954 after he had been advised by his lawyer of the first rejection of Perfect Brassiere Company\u2019s application for the trade-mark Perfect Form, he changed the mark to one word, Perfectform and from straight letters to script slanted letters, The witness said that in 1953 he had been asked by plaintiff to stop using the name Perfect Form.</p>\n<p id=\"ASR\">Testimony by the president of the Per-fectform Corporation was to the effect that the tremendous loss in its sales from 1952 through 1956 was because of \u201cthe use of my label and my name on a cheap garment\u201d. He explained that \u201cwe sell a better product, * * * it is at a higher price range, and it is not salable to the basement departments.\u201d He stated the retail price of Perfectform garments ran from $2.98 to $8.95 which indicated, according to the trade, that they were mostly expensive slips. He characterized the defendant\u2019s 69 cent brassieres as low priced.</p>\n<p id=\"AV_\">There was evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that its sales to Macy\u2019s Department Store, New York City, dropped badly in 1955 after Woolworth\u2019s in 1954 had opened a large store across the street in which defendant\u2019s brassieres were featured. Appellant\u2019s president stated that Sliperfection slips of his company, unlike 11:8 ^&gt;er^'ec:^orm sllPs sb\u00b0wed solid sales mcreases during the years after the def(:ndant started lts use of the Perfect F\u00b0\u2122 and Perfectform marks. Speaking 0 ,llle increases in Sliperfection sales he said:, \u201cWell&gt; in 1951 we had an increase sa es over -19150 ol- $257,000, in 1952 *ouri hmldred thousand over 1950, five hundred thousand in 1953, in 1954 four hundred and ninety thousand over 1950, in 1955 seven hundred thousand over *9 9\u2019 and in S1X hundred and eigh.ve thousand over 1950. By company f0 lcy\u2019 all I can say is, we do over a mil-11011 dollars of volume.\u201d \u201cQ. In what ? A. In the Sliperfection slips. Q. Then \u2022 ,, , , ,, . * to \u2122 that the Sliperfection \u2018\u201c\"J <em>^ </em>\u201c2 hue.- \u2018 ' \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AWn\">Perfect Brassiere Co. in addition to using Perfect Form and Perfectform as a trade-mark on occasion marketed brassieres as made by Perfect Form. One exhibit in evidence, a photograph of a defendant display, reads \u201cPock-ette Bra by Perfect Form\u201d. A specimen of defendant\u2019s advertising attached to the complaint features the word Perfectform iu script and toward the bottom of the advertisement appears the language Look for the Perfectform label.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZqx\">Defense witness Rubenstein on eross-examination said that during the critical period sales of defendant\u2019s brassiere called Wings remained substantially the same while sales of its Perfectform product \u201cnearer tripled than doubled\u201d. The same witness stated that the Wings product was sold by the concern \u201cto apparel chains and department. stores\u201d with a price range \u201cfrom one dollar up to two-fifty\u201d. The Perfect arid later the Per-fectform garments on the other hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>were sold \u201cTo the variety stores\u201d at prices from 1951 on of \u201c69 cents, a dollar, a dollar forty-nine\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"AG3\">There is some evidence of confusion in the record. The editor of a fashion magazine stated that in accordance with the magazine\u2019s practice of sending advertisers a copy of their advertisements in the publication, it actually sent a copy of defendant's advertisement to plaintiff by mistake. The trial judge himself remarked as to this witness, \u201cWell, obviously she was confused.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit P-13 is a letter from what the letterhead characterizes as \u201cAmerica\u2019s foremost item merchandise service\u201d to the plaintiff addressed as \u201cPerfect Form Corp.\u201d and dated February 28,1957. It incorrectly speaks of plaintiff\u2019s line of brassieres and \u201cthat they have been doing quite well\u201d. It seeks to help in the increase of such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-2\">... The complamt in this cause was filed <em>1 7\u00f1 </em>S n 5 2 ^ !\u2019 \u00b0n ,May 10\u2019 9f\u2019 Fmd: mgs of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Final Judgment dismissing the complaint, with costs to the defendant, were e '</p>\n<p id=\"as3-dedup-0\">The district judge found that the above referred to trade-mark registration had been allowed plaintiff May 18, 1948 <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that under it use of the mark beginning 1944 was claimed; that defendant within six years of the filing of the complaint has been selling brassieres in interstate commerce \u201cwith the use of the accused mark \u2018Perfect Form\u2019 displayed as one word and as two words in various forms of display, including script display.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"afv-dedup-0\">The court also found \u201c* * * defendant\u2019s addition of \u2018Form\u2019 in the accused mark to its prior use of \u2018Perfect\u2019 for brassieres beginning in 1932, could not and did not and was not likely to cause confusion or mistake between plaintiff and defendant, or to deceive ul-t\u00edmate purchasers as to the source of origin of defendant\u2019s brassieres, or to cause ultimate purchasers to believe that defendant\u2019s brassieres were garments of the plaintiff.\u201d What defendant did is statad as = \u201cIn hanging to the accused mark\u2019 defendant merely continued the f10f bf me88 and good will which de8 Predefssor and defendant es-Jabbsbed for bras8\\erf beginning m J93?- c\u2122rt 8tatas f^ther as a fact \u00f1ndl^i, Due tbe old and com; \u201con use of F\u00b0rm, m brassiere marks and tbe_ common dm^ay of \u2018Form\u2019 marks m scnp&gt; <em>th* </em>\u00a3eature <em>of^ </em>\u201cark 18 Perfect\u2019. as which de\u00edendan* has priority m the brassiere Jrade\u2019 beginning m 1932.

Plaintiff\u2019s products are exclusive or prestige items and sold in better department stores, specialty shops and lingerie shops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">Among the conclusions of law it was held that \u00abIf plaintiff\u2019s registered mark hag any status as a trade-mark or trade-name, it is a very weak mark\u201d; \u201cThe scope of plaintiff\u2019s registration and good will must be and is restricted to the goods which plaintiff has sold, which ex-eludes brassieres\u201d. It was also held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoo\">\u201cBy reason of defendant\u2019s prior use of \u2018perfect\u2019, defendant had the right at any time, to add the feature<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>less and descriptive word \u2018Form\u2019 which has been and is common to the brassiere trade, and to use the common and featureless script display.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">With reference to the denial by the Patent Office of defendant\u2019s applications to register the accused mark, a conclusion of law states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">\u201cUnder 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1094, plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Register certificate is not governed by 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1066, which provides for an interference in the U. S. Patent Office between a registration and an application for registration in the U. S. Patent Office in certain cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">\u201cHence the refusal of the U. S. Patent Office to register the accused mark to defendant has no effect in this litigation, because defendant was debarred by the current Lan-ham Trade-Mark Act from demanding an interference, in order to establish defendant\u2019s twelve years\u2019 priority in \u2018Perfect\u2019 for brassieres.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> In his Conclusions of Law the trial judge decided that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of unfair competition is governed wholly by federal law. Actually no problem arises in this appeal with respect to the law controlling the particular unfair competition charged. At the very least in this circuit we agree with the New Jersey decisions that likelihood of confusion is the test and that secondary meaning for plaintiff\u2019s mark need not be established in order for plaintiff to make out a cause of action. Campbell Soup Co. v. Armour, 3 Cir., 1949, 175 F.2d 795, 796-797; Vaughan Novelty Mfg. Co. v. Greene Corporation, 3 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 172, 174, note 6; House of Westmore v. Denney, 3 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 261, 265; Lorraine Mfg. Co. v. Lorraine Mfg. Co., D.C.N.J.1952, 101 F.Supp. 967, 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">At least since the opinion of Vice Chancellor Backes in Cape May Yacht Club v. Cape May Yacht and Country Club, Ct.Ch.1913, 81 N.J.Eq. 454, 456, 86 A. 972, 973, New Jersey has held that in the present type of situation \u201cAll that is required to bring into activity the injunctive powers of the court is to inform it that the complainant\u2019s trade is in danger of harm from the use of its name by the defendant in such a way as is calculated to deceive the public into the belief that the defendant\u2019s affairs, in the respect complained of, are those of the complainant.\u201d And see American Automobile Ass\u2019n v. Automobile Ass\u2019n of N. J., E. &amp; A. 1948, 142 N.J.Eq. 673, 61 A.2d 148; Squeezit Corporation v. Plastic Dispensers, Inc., 1954, 31 N.J.Super. 217, 106 A.2d 322; Lorraine Mfg. Co. v. Lorraine Mfg. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">That the use by defendant of practically a replica of plaintiff\u2019s trademark was deliberate is conclusive from the facts of its receipt in 1953 of Perfectform\u2019s protest and of the denial in 1954 by the Patent Office of its application for a block, separated design of the name on the specific ground that it infringed upon plaintiff registrant\u2019s mark. The fact that the mark is basically descriptive would hardly excuse fraudulent appropriation of it. Shaver v. Heller &amp; Merz Co., 8 Cir., 1901, 108 F. 821, 827, 65 L.R.A. 878. And \u201cA fraudulent intent need not be shown to invoke the aid of the court. * * * The test is: Is the resemblance calculated to mislead or confuse, to the complainant\u2019s damage?\u201d Cape May Yacht Club v. Cape May Yacht and Country Club, supra, 81 N.J.Eq. at page 458, 86 A. at page 974. We held in Cridlebaugh v. Rudolph, 3 Cir., 1942, 131 F.2d 795, 801, that \u201cThe test is whether the public is likely to be deceived by the alleged infringing name\u201d. In so doing we followed the New Jersey rule as outlined in Rosenthal v. Blatt, 1912, 80 N.J.Eq. 90, 93, 83 A. 387. And see Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1). Direct competition need not necessarily exist between the parties. 51 West 51st Street Corporation v. Roland, 1946, 139 N.J.Eq. 156, 50 A.2d 369. Under New Jersey law where the trade name of another concern is adopted, apparently to take advantage of that concern\u2019s good will, equity will grant relief though the wronged plaintiff does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>not have an exclusive property right in that name. Weiss v. Stork and Gift Shop, 1946, 137 N.J.Eq. 475, 45 A.2d 688, and cases there cited. The Federal principle is similar. In Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Elliot, 3 Cir., 1925, 7 F.2d 962, the trade-mark of a manufacturer of coats, vests and pants was held infringed by defendant\u2019s use thereof on hats and caps. We said at page 967, \u201cAlthough there is no testimony that a purchaser was so deceived, we are of the opinion that the advertisements tend to readily deceive the public, \u2022' '\u2022 s ave sai \u2019 the vendors of the hats and caps on sale in the respondent s store had their own trade-mark \u2018Park\u2019 They seemed satisfied with it until the complainant s mark became known nationally. We find nothIng which justified them in enlarging their trade-mark to embrace the precise words of- the complainant\u2019s trade-mark and thereby to reap the advantage of the wide publicity which the complainant had earned by the expenditure of large sums of money in advertising. It is possible unfairly to obtain such advantage by the use of similar words and get up in advertising matter even though the wares of the contesting parties do not actually come into competition. Against a wrong of this kind courts of equity will grant re 1 '</p>\n<p id=\"anf-dedup-0\">In Youthform Co. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., D.C.Ga.1957, 153 F.Supp. 87, a small manufacturer of brassieres, having no more than minor damage, waiting ten years before commencing suit and with no Patent Office ruling in its favor, was allowed an injunction against a slip manufacturer and a department store selling the slips from using plaintiff's label containing the words \u201cYouthform\u201d written in script. The facts in reverse are quite similar to those at bar but much weaker, Because of the laches there existing no accounting was ordered. The decision is illuminative ak to the very real assoeiation between the two products. The court stated in that opinion, at page 92:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aoo-dedup-0\">\u201cAs stated above, plaintiff and defendant are not competitors, as plaintiff primarily sells brassieres and defendant primarily sells slips, etc. However, as shown by many of the advertisements placed in evidence, both brassieres and slips show the female form clad in both a brassiere and a slip, which connects the two together in the public mind, Furthermore, each garment is sold largely in the same stores, though frequently at different counters,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axc-dedup-1\">*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae2\">\u00abThere is therefore, the prob-abmty of confusion between defendant\u2019s slips sold under the trade-name \u00cdMiss Youth Form, of &lt;Youth Form, especially under the one word ^ gcri t Youthform\u2019 as to plaintiff,g braggiereg under plaintiff&gt;s trademark \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auo-dedup-0\">The record contains as exhibits a brassiere and slip made by the same manufacturer and carrying like labels for both, Defendant\u2019s witness Rubenstein agreed that bra-top slips, a combination of brassieres and slips into one garment, have been on the market for many years, There is evidence of at least four manufacturers putting out bra-top slips and that since 1955 that kind of garment \u201cis beginning to sell very well\u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"A9F\">n ,g impoggible reasonably to avoid the conclusion that the undergarments in dispute are closely related; that the ordinary customer, having a knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s slips and confronted with plaintiff\u2019s identical label on defendant\u2019s brassieres, is likely to be misled into accepting the latter as originating from the plaintiff despite the fact that there is no direct competition between the parties\u2019 wares. Safeway Stores v. Sklar, D.C.E.D.Pa.1947, 75 F.Supp. 98, 103. The law, New Jersey and Federal, is that such business tactics are unfair and that plaintiff is entitled to be protected against them. National Drying &amp; Machinery Co. v. Ackoff, D.C., 129 F.Supp. 389, affirmed National Dryer Mfg. Corp. v. National Drying Machinery Co., 3 Cir., 1955, 228 F.2d 349, certiorari denied 1956, 351 U.S. 906, 76 S.Ct. 694, 100 L.Ed. 1442.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"> The second part of the tenth finding of fact reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\"* * * and defendant's addition of `Form' in the accused mark to its prior use of `Perfect' for brassieres beginning 1932, could not and did not and was not likely to cause confusion or mistake between plaintiff and defendant, or to deceive ultimate purchasers as to the source of origin of defendant's brassieres, or to cause ultimate purchasers to believe that defendant's brassieres were the garments of plaintiff.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">This is a conclusion from facts and as Judge Staley said in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Johnson, 3 Cir., 1956, 219 F.2d 590, 591: \"This court, by examining the basic facts found by the district court, can determine, as advantageously as the district court can, whether or not an inference of likelihood of confusion is warranted.\" Our conclusion from the basic facts is that likelihood of confusion of the source of origin of defendant's brassieres does exist. The second part of said finding will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-31\">The fourteenth finding of fact reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-32\">\"In changing to the accused mark, defendant merely continued the prior business and good will which defendant's predecessor and defendant established for brassieres beginning in 1932.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-38\">This is clearly wrong in fact. It will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-40\">The first of the two No. 15 findings reads: \"Due to the old and common use of `Form' in brassiere marks and the common display of `Form' marks in script, the dominant feature of the accused mark is `Perfect', as to which defendant has priority in the brassiere trade, beginning in 1932. Ultimate customers who have bought and who will buy defendant's brassieres for use have identified said brassieres and will identify them by `Perfect', as to which defendant has priority.\" There is no justification in the record for these conclusions. In addition the attempt is made, as with finding No. 10, to break down the one trade name into two distinct segments and then destroy each segment separately. We find no warrant for such practice. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. v. Houston Ice &amp; Brewing Co., 1919, 250 U.S. 28, 29, 39 S.Ct. 401, 63 L.Ed. 822. The finding will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-63\">The second #15 finding reads: \"Ultimate customers who buy brassieres for use have not been confused and will not be confused by the script display of one of the forms of the accused mark.\" The test laid down by the statute and the reported cases cited above is \"likelihood of confusion\" which we have already pointed out exists in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-72\">Finding No. 18 that \"The defendant has not violated any rights of plaintiff\" is a conclusion from the facts. It is erroneous. It will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-76\">Finding No. 19 reads: \"Defendant has not made any unlawful gains, profits or advantages by its use of the accused mark.\" It is impossible to so conclude at this stage of the proceedings. Defendant has been unfairly competing against plaintiff with the accused mark. And there is sufficient evidence before us to call for an inquiry on whether plaintiff has been damaged thereby and if s~ in what respects. The finding will be set aside. Finding No. 20 will be set aside for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-89\">If Finding No. 24 is intended to state the test of unfair competition it is erroneous. The portion of its factual statement that \"The use of the accused mark has caused no confusion in the trade * * *\" is contrary to the record. It will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-97\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b797-98\">Conclusion No. 6 holds that defendant has the right to use the accused trademark. It is erroneous and will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-102\">The second paragraph of conclusion No. 7 is wrong in law. It will be set aside. A claimed interference arises from an alleged priority in the disputed mark. Defendant never possessed pri- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ority in the mark Perfectform. It had a prior use of Perfect which gave it no rights in Perfectform.</p>\n<p id=\"A4l6\">Conclusion No. 8 holds that the unfair competition branch of this suit is governed solely by federal law. As we have already stated, New Jersey and federal law are substantially the same respecting the kind of unfair competition presented in this action. Since therefore this conclusion is not decisional it need not be further discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">The portion of conclusion No. 9 stating that defendant has not competed unfairly with plaintiff or violated any of the latter\u2019s rights is erroneous. It will be set aside. The remaining part of the conclusion declaring that defendant has not infringed upon plaintiff s Registration No. 500,444 brings us to that question which cannot be considered by us at this time because of the state of the rec-01\u2019d-</p>\n<p id=\"AXh\">In order to sustain the technical trademark infringement it alleges, plaintiff must establish a secondary meaning for its descriptive mark, not in the brassiere trade respecting which the district judge held it had no secondary meaning, but m its own slip trade. The court found that plaintiff\u2019s trade name was \u201ca very weak mark\u201d. He even qualified this by prefixing \u201cIf plaintiff\u2019s registered mark has any status as a trade-mark or trade-name * * <em>*j&gt; </em>'Whether the mark is \u201cvery weak\u201d or not may or may not be important. In the National Drying decision, supra, the mark \u201cNational\u201d was held to be \u201calmost as weak a mark as can be found\u201d, but it was upheld both as to infringement and unfair competition, What is important beyond doubt is that in the whole elaborate group of findings of fact and conclusions of law there is not one word attempting to properly void plaintiff\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"ASU\">Plaintiff argues strongly that certain of the findings and inferences therefrom plus the trial evidence of its mark\u2019s secondary meaning make it mandatory on us to uphold its claim of technical trademark infringement. However, as we have stated, in our view it is necessary to send this phase of the suit back to the district court for decision as to whether plaintiff has sustained its claim in this connection. We therefore wifi set aside the ^rst Pal't of the 9th conclusion of law that \u201cdefendant has not infringed upon plaintiff\u2019s Registration No. 500,444 * * * \u201d since the distrct court did not Pass upon the validity of plaintiff\u2019s trademark. Under the facts, until that is done there can be no finding as to infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"Aft\">ACCOUNTING</p>\n<p id=\"Aut\">We are not at all sure that an injunction to prevent future use of the name Perfectform or Perfectform in script, block letters or otherwise by the appellee will satisfy the equities of this case. There is evidence of substantial damage and loss of profits to the plaintiff which is attributed to the unlawful use 0f trade name by appellee. This demands a thorough inquiry. Cf. Morgenstern Chemical Co., Inc. v. G. Searle &amp; Co., 3 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"ato-dedup-1\">The judgment of the district court will be reverfjed and the cause remanded with the direction that.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">TT , ,L Under the first count of the comPlamt appropriate findings be made with resPect to Plaintlff s registered trade-</p>\n<p id=\"asb-dedup-0\">2. Judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant on the second count of the complaint and that an injunction issue against the defendant-appellee, its agents, servants, employees, successors and assigns, from using plaintiff-appellant\u2019s name Perfect-form, as one word or two, and from any further acts of unfair competition arising from its unlawful appropriation and use of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s trade name Perfectform.</p>\n<p id=\"ali-dedup-0\">3. An accounting be had to ascertain whether plaintiff has sustained any damage and loss of profits from defendant\u2019s unfair competition and if so, in what respects.</p>\n<p id=\"ayf-dedup-0\">4. For such other and further proceedings as are not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-18\">.
