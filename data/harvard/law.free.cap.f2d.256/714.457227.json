Public land is Government owned land which was part of the original public domain. For leasing procedures, both are governed by the provisions of \u00a7 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 226.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">These provisions require the Secretary to issue a lease to the first qualified applicant, providing the land is not within any known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field. If the land is within such structure, it must be leased to the highest responsible qualified bidder by competitive bidding. The question whether lands are within such structure is one of fact which the Secretary has delegated to the Director of the Geological Survey who is required by the Secretary\u2019s regulations to define the bounda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ries of the structure and delimit the definition on maps filed in the appropriate field offices. 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.6. Notices of these determinations have been published in the Federal Register since the effective date of the Administrative Procedure Act of June 11, 1946, c. 324, \u00a7 3(a) (3), 60 Stat. 238, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002 (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">It has been stipulated that Barash \u201cwas and is the person first making application for a noncompetitive lease covering the 954.51 acres who is qualified to hold a lease under the Act.\u201d And the Secretary admits that \u201cno map or diagram was placed on file * * * \u201d by the Director of Geological Survey, nor was there publication in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In September 1954, more than a year after Barash filed his application, he learned, in the course of trying to expedite issuance of his lease, that the land had been offered for competitive leasing in July 1953 and that three leases had issued, all without notice to him: two leases to the Texas Company, effective September 1, 1953, totaling 916.21 acres; and one to Baker &amp; Taylor, effective October 1, 1953, for 38.30 acres. Thereupon Barash protested to the Secretary and requested cancellation of these competitive leases and the issuance of his lease. Subsequent administrative proceedings disclosed that the Bureau of Land Management had based its decision to offer the lands in question for competitive leasing on a memorandum to the Bureau from the Acting Director of the Geological Survey, in reply to an inquiry by the Department of Agriculture which exercised administrative control of the acquired lands in question. The memorandum, dated June 12, 1952 \u2014 a year before appellant filed his application\u2014 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">\u201c * * * The Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, has inquired of the Geological Survey whether it is in the best interests of the United States to offer for competitive lease sale certain lands in Gray County, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">\u201cThe records of the Geological Survey disclose that this land may be subject to drainage of its oil and gas content as the subject area is on the southern edge of the Panhandle field. In order that the extent and worth of the deposits in the field may be determined and development may proceed in an orderly manner, the Geological Survey <em>recommends </em>that the oil and gas rights owned by the United States within the area involved be offered for lease in accordance with the competitive leasing provision of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Following appellant\u2019s protest, the Bureau of Land Management requested the Geological Survey to \u201cbe advised as to the date on which this land was determined to be within the known geologic structure of the Panhandle Field and whether such determination was effective as to all the lands embraced in [appellant\u2019s] application.\u201d The Acting Director gave the following advice on February 11, 1955:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cAs of June 12, 1952, when the Geological Survey reported that the Lake McClellan Park Lands \u2018may be subject to drainage,\u2019 no determination had been made as to whether all of the lands were or were not within a known <em>geologic </em>structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">\u201cA review of the structural aspects of the lands involved has been made as of June 5, 1953, the date of filing of [appellant\u2019s] application. This review shows that part of the lands on which competitive leases were sold in July 1953 are not within a known geologic structure as those limits were deemed to exist on June 5, 1953.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-11\">\u201cThe lands believed to be within the known geologic structure are confined to surveys (sections) 9 and 10 of the subdivision of the Rockwell County School Land, Gray County, Texas [totaling 335.90 acres]. The remainder of the lands [totaling 618.61 acres] were not within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>known geologic structure on June 5, 1953.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Based upon the foregoing memorandum, the Bureau of Land Management held that (1) appellant was entitled to a lease on the 618.81 acres because they \u201cwere not then and are not now situated on a known geologic structure\u201d; and (2) appellant was not entitled to a lease on the remaining 335.90 acres because they \u201cwere actually defined as being on the known geologic structure of Panhandle Field prior to June 5, 1953 [the date of appellant\u2019s application].\u201d Upon appeal by both parties, the Secretary decided against appellant as to the entire 954.51 acres. Appellant thereupon brought this suit to review the Secretary\u2019s refusal to issue a lease to him. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court entered judgment for the Secretary and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In this appeal appellant contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that no determination has ever been made that the lands in question \u201care within any known geological structure of a producing oil or gas field,\u201d as required by 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 226 for competitive leasing. He says the Survey\u2019s memorandum of June 12, 1952 is merely a recommendation for leasing competitively and that this is confirmed by the following: (1) the Survey\u2019s memorandum of February 11, 1955 that \u201cno determination had been made [in connection with the June 12, 1952 memorandum] as to * * * all of the lands * * * \u201d; (2) the fact that no map showing the definition of the structure was ever prepared or filed as required by the Secretary\u2019s regulations; and (3) the fact that there was no publication of notice of definition in the Federal Register as was the Department\u2019s practice whether or not required by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(a) (2, 3), 1002(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">We think these contentions are not met by appellee\u2019s answer that, while the Survey\u2019s memorandum of June 5, 1952 merely \u201crecommends\u201d competitive leasing, in reality the Survey \u201cfound that it is within the known geologic structure [etc.].\u201d Otherwise, says appellee, \u201cone [would have to] assume that the Survey did not know its function under the law, or that, if it did know it, was refusing to discharge it, neither of which assumptions is at all tenable.\u201d The provisions of the law and regulations are too clear and unambiguous to permit reliance on such speculation. McKay v. Wahlenmaier, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 226 F.2d 35; see also Harmon v. Brucker, 1958, 355 U.S. 579, 78 S.Ct. 433, 2 L.Ed.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">These provisions require (1) a determination by the Survey that the lands \u201care\u201d within a known structure, and (2) the filing of a map reflecting this determination in the definition of the structure. These requirements were not observed in respect of either the parcel of 618.81 acres or the parcel of 335.90 acres. Even with respect to the latter parcel, the belated \u201cdetermination\u201d in the Survey\u2019s February 11, 1955 memorandum stated only that these are \u201clands believed to be within the known geologic structure.\u201d Before the statute was amended in 1946, the Secretary had authority to lease lands competitively which were \u201cbelieved\u201d to be with such a geological structure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The amendment, however, limited his authority for competitive leasing to lands which \u201care\u201d within such a structure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This change was adopted over the specific objections of the then Secretary. Under the view the Secretary advances here, this change is given no meaning or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">In this case the Secretary does not claim, as he did in McKenna v. Seaton, 103 U.S.App.D.C.-,-F.2d-, that his construction of the law and regulations is consistent with established practices of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The requirements of law involved here do not rest upon technical considerations. They are designed to assure fairness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>leasing publicly owned lands.' This case makes that plain. Appellant relying on the absence of any filing of a map showing the definition of a structure pursuant to a determination, applied for a noncompetitive lease. He had every reason to believe that the lands were subject to noncompetitive leasing. He had no reason to question it from the time he filed his application until the Secretary advised him that the lands had been leased competitively after the application had been filed. Thus, by the Secretary\u2019s failure either to take the prescribed steps or to give appellant actual notice that the lands were subject to competitive leasing before such leasing was accomplished, appellant was deprived of the opportunity of acquiring any kind of lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Appellee\u2019s final contention, that The Texas Company is an indispensable party, is disposed of by Work v. State of Louisiana, 1925, 269 U.S. 250, 254-255, 46 S.Ct. 92, 94, 70 L.Ed. 259. That case held that neither the United States nor homestead entrymen on the land were indispensable parties to the suit to restrain the Secretary of the Interior from rejecting Louisiana\u2019s claim to the land \u201cindependently of the merits otherwise, upon an unauthorized ruling of law * In the absence of The Texas Company as a party in the present case we do not now order cancellation of any of the Secretary\u2019s leasing agreements with The Texas Company. We leave to the District Court, in further proceedings consistent with this opinion, the resolution of issues relating to those agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\">. This included three parcels: \u201cParcel 1\u2014 462.57 acres, Parcel 2 \u2014 453.64 acres, and Parcel 3 \u2014 38.30 acres.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-12\">. Acquired lands are leasable under the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands of August 7. 1917, c. 513, 61 Stat. 913, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 351 et seq. Section 3 of that Act, 30 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 .352, and the regulations issued thereunder, 43 C.F.R. 200.4, make applicable to acquired lands the leasing provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-15\">.

As to the 335.90 acres, however, I would not disturb the Secretary\u2019s decision. I think that decision must be read as including a conclusion, or finding, that this acreage was within a known geologic structure when appellant\u2019s application was filed. Such conclusion, or finding, I think should not on this record be overturned by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
