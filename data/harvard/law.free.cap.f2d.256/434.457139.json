He properly applied the opinion of this court in Row-ton v. United States, 6 Cir., 229 F.2d 421, in which we held that the failure of a local Selective Service Board to post the names of advisors to registrants in the board\u2019s office, as required by regulations, did not prejudice nor deny procedural due process to three persons who, upon classification as conscientious objectors, had refused to do civilian work of national importance in lieu of induction into the armed forces, the three appellants having been afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to present claims of exemption based upon ministerial status as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">We think the opinion of the district court has made it abundantly clear that the local board in this case properly classified the defendant 1-0. In Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. 389, 396, 74 S.Ct. 152, 157, 98 L.Ed. 132, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Court said: \u201cIf the facts are disputed the board bears the ultimate responsibility for resolving the conflict \u2014 the courts will not interfere. Nor will the courts apply a test of \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d Of course, as was well pointed out by the district judge, the court held in the Dickinson case that there was no basis in fact for the board\u2019s refusal to give the defendant a 4-D classification, because of the facts involved; but the facts in the instant case do not correspond to those in the Dickinson case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Under the circumstances confronted here, thoroughly developed in the opinion of District Judge Freeman, it is apparent that neither the local board, nor the appeal board, nor the presidential board acted without basis in fact, or arbitrarily, or capriciously, or contrary to law, in refusing to grant the appellant here a 4-D ministerial classification. The district court demonstrated in its opinion that no other ground urged by appellant in the district court and repeated here was meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b489-6\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AfE\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The propriety of the local board\u2019s reclassification of appellant from 4-D (minister) to 1-0 (conscientious objector) on October 2, 1953, is not in question. \u201cWhat is at issue is the decision of [appellant\u2019s] local board to continue him in [1-0] * * * after he requested reclassification based on changed conditions in his vocation occurring subsequent to [October 2, 1953].\u201d Dickinson v. United States, 1953, 346 U.S. 389, 392, 74 S.Ct. 152,155, 98 L.Ed. 132. See, also, Jewell v. United States, 6 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 770, 771; Brown v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 258, 260; United States ex rel. Hull v. Stalter, 7 Cir., 1945, 151 F.2d 633, 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">On October 14, 1953, appellant informed the board that his abandonment of full-time religious activity (pioneering) had been occasioned by a need to put his affairs in order for the proper support of his family. He stated that it had always been his intention to resume his full-time ministry, having planned to do so by January 1, 1954, and that, under pressure of the board\u2019s action, he was about to resume his ministry without further delay. Shortly thereafter, appellant\u2019s employer notified the board on appellants behalf that appellant would thereafter work at his secular job only from 8:00 a. m. to noon. On November 1, 1953, appellant was given a \u201cpioneer appointment\u201d constituting him a full-time minister. Notice of this appointment was given to the board. His \u201cfull-time pioneer\u201d assignment, as he told the board, was as instructor at the Theocratic Ministry School. He was the only full-time pioneer in the forty to fifty member congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in his town.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">After a personal interview with appellant in the course of which the foregoing facts were discussed with him, the local board unanimously voted to retain him in class 1-0. Three of the four members of the board gave no reason for their action. The fourth declared that his vote was \u201c[b]ased on the evidence presented and the employment. * * * \u201d Two weeks later, the Appeal Board affirmed the denial to appellant of a 4-D reclassification \u201cbecause he is not devoting full-time to his ministerial duties. * * * effective November 1, 1953, he is working on a part-time basis [at a secular job].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">That a registrant engages in part-time secular work for subsistence purposes is not a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for denying him class 4-D status, if his religious activity is his primary and principal vocation. Dickinson v. United States, supra; United States v. Hurt, 3 Cir., 1957, 244 F.2d 46; Pate v. United States, 3 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 99; United States v. Ransom, 7 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 15; Brown v. United States, supra; Hacker v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 575. Appellant\u2019s showing that, as of November 1, 1953, his primary and principal vocation was his pioneer assignment is without the slightest contradiction in the record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>I can see no basis in fact, therefore, for the board\u2019s refusal to classify him 4-D. His 20-25 hours per week of secular work is, to be sure, more than the few hours involved in Dickinson, but it is probably less than the time devoted to secular work by the registrant in Pate, supra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What is significant is not the number of hours a week spent on secular work, but only whether, despite such secular work, appellant\u2019s religious activity is, as was said in Pate, 243 F.2d at page 102, \u201chis vocation and life\u2019s work\u201d and that he manages to perform that activity. There is no challenge in the record to appellant's declaration to the board that he was performing \u201cfull-time\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pioneer work and there is no suggestion that his part-time secular work precluded his doing the hundred hours per month of religious work which the trial judge found was required of a \u201cpioneer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">There are overtones in the record suggesting that the local board may have been suspicious of appellant\u2019s good faith in dropping his full-time secular work and obtaining a pioneer appointment as soon as he was classified 1-0. But the record does not show that disbelief of appellant was the basis of the board\u2019s action. Nor can this court now defend the board\u2019s action on that basis. The Supreme Court said in Dickinson v. United States, 346 U.S. at pages 396-397, 74 S.Ct. at page 157:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201cThe court below in affirming the conviction apparently thought the local board was free to disbelieve Dickinson's testimonial and documentary evidence even in the absence of any impeaching or contradictory evidence. The court manifested its own skepticism by pointing to Dickinson\u2019s youth, the unorthodox method of ordination by baptism, the failure to present stronger documentary evidence from Watchtower Society leaders, and the customary claim of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to ministerial exemptions. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">\u201c * * * But when the uncontro-verted evidence supporting a registrant\u2019s claim places him prima facie within the statutory exemption, dismissal of the claim solely on the basis of suspicion and speculation is both contrary to the spirit of the Act and foreign to our concepts of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">Dealing with the type of suspicions which one or two members of appellant\u2019s draft board may have entertained, the Ninth Circuit said in Brown v. United States, 216 F.2d at pages 259-260, note 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-16\">\u201cThe members of this court, after hearing a number of similar cases, are not without curiosity as to whether nineteen year old Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, about to be drafted, are customarily handed ministerial appointments. As put by Mr. Justice Jackson in his dissent in the Dickinson case (346 U.S. 389, 74 S.Ct. 158, [98 L.Ed. 132]); \u2018These events on the eve of his classification and in view of his youth may have raised doubt as to his good faith.\u2019 But even if a survey should show a general practice to make such appointments in a similar timely manner, the decision in the Dickinson case would make such a showing irrelevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">If, under the statute as construed by the Supreme Court, ministerial exemption can be too easily acquired, only Congress can change the law. Applying the existing law to the case before us, I see no basis in fact for denying appellant the claimed exemption. I would therefore hold that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">. Pate operated a 40-acre farm to support himself. The dissenting judge called attention to testimony <em>that Pate\u2019s </em>secular work may have occupied more of his time than his religious activity. 243 F.2d at page 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-18\">. At the trial appellant testified that he devoted 45 to 50 hours per week to his religious duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
