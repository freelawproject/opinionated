His first petition was denied with the suggestion that the petitioner\u2019s remedy was by a Section 2255 motion in the sentencing court, and petitioner filed such a motion. This motion denied, he-did not appeal and seems now to be reapplying for habeas corpus relief on the ground that he is entitled to do so since he did not get the relief he asked from the sentencing court. The law is otherwise declared.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-27\">The judgment dismissing his petition-was right, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-28\">.
