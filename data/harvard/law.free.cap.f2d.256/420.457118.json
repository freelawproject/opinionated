Sec. 47, allowing appeals in bankruptcy matters, and shown upon its face that it is not an appealable order under any provisions of the said section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">For the reasons briefly stated and upon the authorities cited below<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we agree that this is so and that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">It is, of course, conceded that the appeal is not from the order of the referee but from that of the district judge and that it is the district judge\u2019s and not the referee\u2019s order the finality or lack of finality of which we are considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Under General Order 47, it was for the district judge and the district judge alone to determine the nature and character of the order to be entered by him, whether final or interlocutory. Equitable Life Insurance Society of U. S. v. Carmody, 8 Cir., 131 F.2d 318, at pages 322-323.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Concluding that upon the record before him the proper order for him to make was not to finally adopt, modify, or reject the report in whole or in part, but to recommit the matter to the referee for further proceedings, he entered the order attempted to be appealed from, an order which, as we pointed out in City of Fort Lauderdale v. Freeman, supra, is not dispositive but purely procedural and interlocutory, and therefore not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-12\">. \u201cOn this the 19th day of December, 1957, there came on for consideration by the Court the Petition for Review filed herein by Houston Shell &amp; Concrete, a division of McDonough Company, creditor of said debtor, from the Order of the Referee in Bankruptcy dated June 6, 1957, denying said creditor\u2019s claim as a secured claim based upon Constitutional and Statutory Materialman\u2019s Lien against real property owned by debtor corporation and allowing said claim as an unsecured claim against the estate of debtor corporation in the amount of ?9,-092.85, and it appearing to the Court from the pleadings herein, the transcript of the evidence and exhibits, that said matter should be returned to the Referee in Bankruptcy for further proceedings for the taking of evidence on the questions raised by petitioner and objecting creditor, and thereafter to enter his findings of fact and conclusions of law and order thereon.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-26\">\u201cIt Is Therefore Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the Certificate of the Referee in Bankruptcy be set aside and said matter be returned to the Referee for further proceedings for the taking of evidence on the questions raised by petitioner and objecting creditor, and thereafter said Referee is directed to enter his findings of fact and conclusions of law and order on said claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-27\">.
