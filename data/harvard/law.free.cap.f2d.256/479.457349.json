At about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>11:30 a.m. on January 7, 1956, appellant was driving his 1953 Cadillac south on North Grant Street in Odessa, Texas, between 17th Street and 16th Street. North Grant was a four lane street, two lanes for southbound traffic and two lanes for northbound traffic. Appellant\u2019s car was in the left-hand lane for southbound traffic, next to the center line. About the middle of the block, the car immediately ahead of appellant\u2019s car came to a full stop preliminary to making a left turn to Sears Food Market on the east side of Grant Street. Appellant stopped his car. Due to oncoming northbound traffic, the car ahead could not immediately make its left turn, nor, of course, could the appellant pass that car to its left. Appellant could not turn to the right due to southbound traffic passing on his right. Stopping was the only thing that he could do. Appellee\u2019s pickup truck operated by its employee, Jimmy Ray Cooper, ran into the rear of appellant\u2019s car, resulting in personal injuries to Mrs. Johnson. There was a verdict and judgment for the defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Appellant\u2019s first insistence is that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the ground that the verdict was against the great preponderance of the evidence. There was evidence that the car ahead of appellant\u2019s car was making an improper left-hand turn in the middle of the block. Jimmy Ray Cooper, appellee\u2019s driver, testified that his attention had been diverted by some boys making collections from automobile occupants for the \u201cMarch of Dimes.\u201d \u201cWell, I was watching those boys, and then after I looked up to make sure I wasn\u2019t going to strike somebody on the right of me, and then I glanced up, and it was too late.\u201d There was evidence, we think, from which the jury might properly have found that reasonable prudence did not require Cooper to anticipate the sudden and unexpected emergency in which he was placed, and that after the emergency arose he was not negligent. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">At the close of his oral charge to the jury, the district judge stated: \u201cLet the record show, Mr. Reporter, that all requested charges by both parties which have been denied, automatic exception is taken to same.\u201d Special Charge 4, requested by plaintiff-appellant and refused by the court, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_g-\">\u201cYou are further instructed that if you find and believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant's driver, Jimmy Ray Cooper, was on the occasion in question, following too closely to the vehicle in which plaintiff and his wife were riding, and if you further find and believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the act of the defendant\u2019s driver in following too closely, if he did, to the vehicle in question, constitutes negligence, and if you further find and believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s damages and the injuries to his wife, Estelle Johnson, then you will find for the plaintiff and assess his damages at such sum as you may find him entitled to receive under the measure of damages to be hereinafter submitted to you by the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The complaint charged negligence on the part of appellee\u2019s driver in the following particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201c(a) In that said driver was guilty of negligence per se in operating defendant\u2019s pickup truck too closely behind plaintiff\u2019s vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\u201c(b) In that defendant\u2019s driver was operating defendant\u2019s pickup truck at a speed which was excessive for the conditions then and there existing ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201c(c) In that defendant\u2019s driver failed to keep a proper lookout;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u201c(d) In that defendant\u2019s driver failed to timely apply his brakes to avoid colliding with the rear of plaintiff\u2019s automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201c(e) In that defendant\u2019s driver failed to turn his pickup truck to the left in order to avoid colliding with plaintiff\u2019s automobile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201c(f) In that defendant\u2019s driver failed to turn the pickup truck to the right in order to avoid colliding with plaintiff\u2019s automobile * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The district judge in substance instructed the jury to find for the plaintiff if it found that the defendant\u2019s driver was guilty of negligence in any one of particulars (b), (c) or (d), above; (e) and (f) were not insisted on; the judge, in refusing plaintiff\u2019s special charge 4, declined to submit (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Appellee argues with much force that, upon the present state of the record, such refusal was not error. The appellant testified that his automobile had been stopped for more than \u201cabout two or three seconds\u201d before the collision. No evidence directly to the contrary was admitted. Appellee\u2019s driver, in his testimony <em>before the jury, </em>was not asked on cross-examination or otherwise anything about following appellant\u2019s automobile too closely. In such a state of the record, appellee insists that the specific issue was abstract, and that the district court did not err in refusing plaintiff\u2019s special charge 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In his testimony before the jury, Cooper estimated the speed of defendant\u2019s pickup truck at thirty miles an hour. He testified to no slowdown until immediately before the accident when he applied the brakes and left skid marks of some fifteen to twenty feet. The Texas statute, Section 61(a), Article 6701d, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">\u201cThe driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and the traffic upon the conditions of the highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axq-dedup-0\">The weight and credibility of appel-ant\u2019s estimate of the time that his automobile had been stopped, of Cooper\u2019s estimate of his speed, and of all of the other evidence in the case were matters for the jury\u2019s consideration. The issue of driving too closely could not properly be withdrawn from the jury, and the court erred in refusing plaintiff\u2019s special charge 4, and in failing and refusing to instruct the jury on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Before any evidence had been offered in the case, the defendant called to the court\u2019s attention that a police officer of the City of Odessa had issued a traffic ticket purporting to cite its driver, Jimmy Ray Cooper, for \u201cfollowing too closely,\u201d and that two or three days after the date of the accident Cooper paid a fine to the Corporation Court of the City of Odessa, Texas, in connection with said traffic ticket. Defendant moved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u201c * * * that counsel for the plaintiff, and through such counsel the plaintiff, his wife and all other witnesses of the plaintiff, be instructed that no mention is to be made during the trial of this cause in the presence and hearing of the jury of the issuance of the traffic ticket to Jimmy Ray Cooper or any subsequent act or action on his part in connection therewith, and particularly the payment of the fine on account thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">The court made the following endorsement on said motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-14\">\u201cThe Foregoing Motion, having been presented to the Court prior to the time that any evidence had been offered in this cause and the same having been in all things duly considered by the Court, such Motion is in all things (wemrie\u00e9) (sustained).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">\u201c(S.) R. E. Thomason,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-16\">\u201cJudge Presiding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-17\">After Jimmy Ray Cooper had testified upon the trial as a witness for the defendant, the court permitted the jury to retire from the courtroom and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-18\">\u201cMr. Barnes (Attorney for Plaintiff):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-19\">\u201cI have one thing that I want to put in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">\u201cAll right, you can do it now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cMi\u2019. Barnes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cWe offer the additional portion of the deposition of Jimmy Cooper which we have been instructed by the Court, in writing, or orally instructed by the Court not to put before the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201cWell, that ruling was made pursuant to a written motion made by the Defendant to exclude the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cMr. Barnes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">\u201cBeginning on Page ten:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">\u201c(Reading from deposition of Jimmy Cooper):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">\u201c \u2018Q. I see, did you get a ticket ? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-13\">\u201c \u2018Q. What did you get a ticket for? A. For following too close.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-14\">\u201c\u2018Q. Did you pay a fine on that? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-15\">\u201c \u2018Q. Did you go down to the City Court and plead guilty? A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t take it to the Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-16\">\u201c \u2018Q. What did you do with it? A. I paid it to the cashier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-17\">\u201c \u2018Q. Did you just walk in there and say, \u201cI have got a ticket,\u201d and paid them? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-18\">\u201c \u2018Q. How much did you pay ? A. Five dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-19\">\u201c \u2018Q. The ticket had written on it what the charge was? A. No, sir, it hadn\u2019t been turned in, to the cashier, and therefore he said he did not know what it would be, and so that is all he charged me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-20\">\u201c \u2018Q. Do you feel like you were guilty? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-21\">\u201c \u2018Q. Why don\u2019t you think you were guilty? A. I wasn\u2019t following the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-22\">\u201c \u2018Q. What do you mean by that, will you explain that? A. He was quite aways ahead of me, for me to be following too close.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-23\">\u201cMr. Barnes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-24\">\u201cAnd then the additional portion on Page 14 of this deposition of Jimmy Cooper:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-25\">\u201c \u2018Q. Now when you went down to pay that fine, you realized, of course, by paying the fine that you were entering a plea of guilty, is that right? A. Yes, sir, I guess I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-26\">\u201c \u2018Q. Well, you didn\u2019t go down and say, \u201cI am not guilty, but I will pay it,\u201d did you? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-27\">\u201c \u2018Q. You went down there, and you had a ticket, and you went down there to pay it, didn\u2019t you? A. I went down to pay it, because it was mine, and I didn\u2019t want it on my record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-28\">\u201c \u2018Q. That you had paid a fine ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-29\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-30\">\u201c \u2018Q. You didn\u2019t try to see the Judge, or tell anybody you were not guilty? A. No, sir.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-31\">\u201cMr. Barnes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-32\">\u201cThat is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-33\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-34\">\u201cThe Court granted the written motion of the Defendant to exclude that testimony to which the Plaintiff excepts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-35\">Cooper was not a party defendant. His employment was as a parts and delivery man. His authority to bind the defendant was limited to the scope of his employment. His action, several days after the accident, in paying a fine \u201cfor following too closely\u201d could not be introduced as an admission against his principal. See Liner v. United States Torpedo Co., Tex.Com.App., 16 S.W.2d 519; Annotation 18 A.L.R.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-36\">The evidence was, however, clearly admissible for the purpose of impeaching Cooper after he had testified as a witness for the defendant. Broadly speaking, his testimony tended to prove that he was free from any fault or negligence. The plaintiff then had a right to cross-examine him as to his payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>fine without insisting on a trial. The jury might have believed his explanation or, instead, it might have inferred that he paid the fine because he was not free from fault in causing the collision. Compare Sherwood v. Murray, Tex.Civ.App.1950, 233 S.W.2d 879, 882; Bush on Criminal Convictions as Evidence in Civil Proceedings, 29 Miss. Law Journal (May 1958), 277, 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">For the errors indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
