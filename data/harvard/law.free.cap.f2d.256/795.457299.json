Cochran, deceased, brought this action to recover $369,180.-86 with interest from May 31, 1943 paid by the executors because of an estate tax deficiency assessment which resulted from the disallowance of any charitable deduction for legacies distributed pursuant to Mrs. Cochran\u2019s will.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed the action on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">The testatrix by will left all her residuary estate to \u201csuch charitable, benevolent, religious or educational institutions as my executors hereinafter named may determine.\u201d Despite the fact that all institutions which received legacies are conceded to be \u201cso created and constituted that a legacy to any one of them is deductible under Federal law in determining the net estate subject to the Federal estate tax\u201d (Stip. of Facts, par. 15), the Commissioner disallowed all such legacy deductions \u201cupon the theory that the plaintiffs had power to appoint said remainder and residue exclusively to benevolent institutions that were not also charitable\u201d (Id. par. 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-16\">The question to be determined is whether the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d included with the words \u201ccharitable,\u201d \u201creligious\u201d or \u201ceducational\u201d is sufficient to deprive this estate of the tax benefits bestowed by Congress upon public-minded citizens who desire to devote their estates to public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-17\">The word \u201cbenevolent\u201d has no fixed meaning which is self-defining. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (1934 Ed.) defines it in part as \u201cdisposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable\u201d thus giving it a place within the category of \u201ccharitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-18\">\u201cBenevolent\u201d has been frequently used in combination with such words as \u201ccharitable.\u201d Where so employed the courts, almost invariably follow the rule succinctly summarized in American Jurisprudence (10 Am.Jur. p. 590) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0V\">\u201cThe word \u2018benevolent,\u2019 however, is thrust into many bequests and devises for charitable purposes and is intertwined in endless ways with other words of the context. If the word \u2018benevolent,\u2019 as used in such cases, or when coupled with the word \u2018charitable,\u2019 was plainly intended to be synonymous with the word \u2018charitable,\u2019 courts will give effect to the gift according to that intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akd-dedup-1\">Restatement of Trusts, section 398, comment d, singles out the phrase \u201ccharitable or benevolent\u201d as an example of the application of the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to uphold a charitable trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-19\">\u201cWhere by the terms of the trust a word is used which standing alone would be broader than charity, it may in view of the other terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the trust be interpreted as limited to charity. Thus, where a testator devises or bequeaths property to be applied to \u2018charitable or benevolent\u2019 purposes, the word \u2018benevolent\u2019 may be interpreted as a synonym for \u2018charitable,\u2019 and not as including purposes which are not charitable, even though the word \u2018benevolent\u2019 standing alone might be interpreted as including purposes which are not charitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Decisions by the courts holding \u201cbenevolent\u201d synonymous with \u201ccharitable\u201d are legion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Where the words are, as here, placed in the disjunctive, \u201cor\u201d is often construed as \u201cand\u201d where the testator\u2019s intent is clear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Since the primary purpose of her will was to enable the testatrix to carry out after death through her trusted executors her wishes as to the disposition of her property, her intent is to be found not only in the will itself where discretion as to the selection of beneficiaries</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">was vested in the executors but also from such tangible evidence of that intent as she may have exhibited and conveyed to her executors during her lifetime and from the executors\u2019 understanding of the testatrix\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The \u201cauthority [of the executors] to select the beneficiaries from the general class described\u201d and their actual selection of the beneficiaries must be given weight (St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. Burnet, 8 Cir., 1952, 59 F.2d 922, 926, 929). In that case the trustees, under a direction to devote the remainder of an estate \u201cto such benevolent purposes as, in their opinion will constitute a fitting testimonial or memorial for me, and in some degree, extend my usefulness and helpfulness to others,\u201d selected the YMCA and Washington University, both in St. Louis, Missouri. The court did not \u201ccontend that what the trustees have actually done is determinative of the petitioner\u2019s right to deduction\u201d but felt \u201cthis disposition of the fund is illustrative of the use essential to the creation of a fitting memorial for the testator, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>of the interpretation that has been, \u2014 \u25a0 naturally, we think \u2014 placed upon this article of the will\u201d (ibid.).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Four fact areas, therefore, must be investigated for clues as to intent: (1) the testatrix\u2019 deeds during her lifetime; (2) the circumstances relating to the making of her will; (3) the disclosure of her wishes to the executors in whom she placed the responsibility for selecting the institutions to receive her bounty; and (4) the manner in which the executors carried out her wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">\n<em>1. Benefactions by the Testatrix During Her Lifetime.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">During her lifetime, Mrs. Cochran gave generously to tax-exempt institutions. Invariably she exceeded the annual maximum allowable deduction for income tax purposes. In order to have additional funds available for charitable purposes she consulted with her financial advisor (and subsequent executor), H. Wadsworth Eight, to verify the tax-exempt character of the institutions to which she proposed to make gifts. Eer lists of contributions used in connection with the preparation of income tax returns in the two years immediately preceding her death, 1937 and 1938, set forth only tax-exempt institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\n<em>2. The Drafting of the Will.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Prior to the execution of her will in 1928, Mrs. Cochran had been for many years a resident of Massachusetts. The will was drawn in Boston by Albert M. Chandler, an attorney who had practiced in that city for many years. The executors appointed were her husband, Edwin Paul Cochran, her financial advisor, E. Wadsworth Eight, and her attorney, Albert M. Chandler. Eer residuary estate was left to \u201csuch charitable, benevolent, religious or educational institutions\u201d as these executors might determine. Since 1865 the settled law of Massachusetts has been that \u201cbenevolent\u201d used in the disjunctive with \u201ccharitable\u201d creates a valid gift to charity. Saltonstall v. Saunders, 93 Mass. 446. It is inconceivable that Mr. Chandler would not have been familiar with this case or the line of subsequent decisions adhering to the rule set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">\n<em>3. Disclosure by the Testatrix of Her Wishes With Respect to Institutions to Be Designated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">For the guidance of her executors, Mrs. Cochran prepared a list of charities all of which were tax-exempt (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit DD). She did this instead of naming specific institutions because she felt that changing circumstances might alter either the purpose of the institution or its worthiness and that discretion in the executors would enable her wishes better to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">Eer sister, Caroline Fox, who predeceased her, had directed that the residue of her estate be distributed to certain enumerated charities. After her death it developed that although some of these charities were not in need of additional funds, nevertheless they shared in the distribution. Mrs. Cochran, distressed over this result, was desirous that her estate would pass only to needy organizations, and to this end determined to rely upon the discretion of her executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">\n<em>Jt. The Manner in Which the Executors Distributed the Residuary Estate.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Mrs. Cochran died on January 24, 1939, a resident of New Eaven, Connecticut. The will was admitted to probate in New Eaven and the three executors qualified thereunder. In April 1940 they filed their federal estate tax return claiming a deduction for the entire residuary estate and the then present value of the remainder interest in a trust fund. These deductions were disallowed and an additional tax of $369,180.86 was assessed and paid in May 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">In December 1945 the executors filed their account in the New Eaven Probate Court showing that they had paid legacies in the total amount of $500,000 to some 64 institutions, all of which are concededly tax-exempt in character. In the same account they designated 18 institutions to participate in any federal estate tax refund and 31 institutions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>receive the remainder interest in the trust fund established by the will. All the designated institutions qualify as tax-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">From these facts there can be no doubt that Mrs. Cochran during her lifetime gave ample proof of the type of institution which she selected for her benefactions. Her wishes were conveyed to her executors both orally and in writing. The executors understood these wishes and explicitly carried them out. All institutions which received legacies as a result of the executors\u2019 designations were \u201cso created and constituted that a legacy to any one of them is deductible under federal law in determining the net estate subject to the Federal Estate Tax and were so during all years material herein.\u201d (Stipulation of Facts and Evidence, Para. 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The primary question presented is whether the legacies given pursuant to the will are within the exemption expressly granted by Congress. Conversely, in this tax case no question is raised as to whether the bequests are void for uncertainty because given to an indefinite class. For this reason decisions to the effect that gifts \u201cfor any and all benevolent purposes\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or \u201cto such objects of benevolence and liberalty as [the trustee] in his own discretion shall most approve of\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are too indefinite and hence void are inapposite. Equally inapplicable are federal estate tax cases in which deductions were not allowed because the charitable bequests were void under state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No court has held the residuary clause of Mrs. Cochran\u2019s will void and that question is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The ultimate decision as to tax exemption rests in the federal courts. The district court, in its opinion below, accurately and concisely stated the rule, saying .[151 F.Supp.2d 204]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-12\">\u201cWhat is meant by the words \u2018exclusively for * * * charitable * * * purposes\u2019in Sec. 303(a) (3) of the Federal estate tax law is for the Federal courts to say in the light of what they find the Congressional intent to have been regardless of what the State of the decedent\u2019s domicile may have to say about it or how strictly or liberally that State may define \u2018charitable\u2019 in the legal sense for different purposes. United States v. Pelzer, 1941, 312 U.S. 399, 402, 61 S.Ct. 659, 85 L.Ed. 913; Morgan v. Commissioner, 1939, 309 U.S. 78, 80, 60 S.Ct. 424, 84 L.Ed. 585; Lyeth v. Hoey, 1938, 305 U.S. 188, 193, 59 S.Ct. 155, 83 L.Ed. 119.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">In arriving at the conclusion that the use of the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d bestowed upon the executors the power to give to institutions not tax-exempt in character, and hence that the legacies here given were non-deductible, the district court was influenced by the opinion of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut in a case brought by the executors involving this very estate (Cochran v. McLaughlin, 128 Conn. 638, 24 A.2d 836, 839).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">\n<em>The Connecticut State Court Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aci-dedup-0\">Early in 1942 the executioners brought a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court of New Haven County to ascertain their right to create a corporation to which the residuary estate could be transferred to be paid over \u201cto such charitable, religious, and educational institutions, wherever situated, as may be selected by said corporation.\u201d The executors alleged a \u201cdoubt as to whether or not a corporation so formed would be within the provisions of said Articles Four (the trust) and Thirty (the residue) of said will and within the statutes of the State of Connecticut regulating exemptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>from taxation * * 'x\u2018 \u201d The defendants were the Connecticut Tax Commissioner and. the State Attorney General. No federal estate tax question was involved. The declaratory judgment sought answers to four questions, i. e., (1) whether such a corporation could properly be designated as the beneficiary under Articles Four and Thirty; (2) whether the executors could properly turn over the property to such a corporation ; (3) whether there would be a Connecticut estate tax if such action were taken; and (4) whether \u201cany class of beneficiary would be included under the designation \u2018benevolent\u2019 as used in said will which would not also satisfy the designation of \u2018charitable\u2019 as used in said will.\u201d The Superior Court answered the first two questions \u201cno\u201d and held that, in view of this answer, (3) was not then susceptible of answer and (4) became academic. The Supreme Court of Errors sustained the Superior Court as to questions (1) and (2), i. e., that the residue and the executors\u2019 powers of designation could not be turned over to a corporation. However, as to question (4) the Connecticut Supreme Court said \u201cThe word \u2018benevolent\u2019 standing by itself is broader than the word \u2018charitable.\u2019 \u201d Despite the concession here as to the tax-exempt character of the institutions given to the executors by Mrs. Cochran, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that \u201cthere is no finding, nor indeed any evidence on which to base a finding, that they were all charitable as distinguished from benevolent institutions, and the court could not take judicial notice that they were of the former character.\u201d Thus the Connecticut court did not pass upon the crucial element of intent or the tax-exempt nature (now conceded) of the selected beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">However, the court specifically upheld the validity of the disposition of residuary estate, thereby indicating that the term \u201cbenevolent\u201d was a sufficiently definite direction to her executors. The district court in the instant case distinguished the federal decisions allowing deductions where the devises were to \u201cbenevolent institutions\u201d on the ground that the Connecticut court had precisely delineated the term \u201cbenevolent\u201d so as to encompass \u201cinstitutions whose principal function is to provide pleasure and cheer to their members.\u201d However, had the Connecticut court reached such a conclusion, it would have had no alternative but to find the trust incapable of being enforced, and would have been compelled to strike out the disposition of the entire residuary estate as void for uncertainty and indefiniteness. See Adye v. Smith, 44 Conn. 60, 26 Am.Rep. 424. To forestall any such misinterpretation of its decision, the court pointed out that it was not \u201cconfronted with a situation where to give to the word \u2018benevolent\u2019 its natural meaning would make the gift invalid.\u201d 128 Conn. 638, 24 A.2d 836, 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The Connecticut court did no more than reiterate an abstract principle of Connecticut law, namely that absent some evidence of a contrary intent \u201cbenevolent\u201d is not synonymous with \u201ccharitable.\u201d Although state law determines whether a valid trust for indefinite beneficiaries has been created, once such a trust has, as here been held to be valid, \u201cthe taxability of the estate is not a matter of local law, but turns on the question of whether the particular gift is within the exemption of the federal statute\u201d (Sharpe\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 1945, 148 F.2d 179, 181). The decision of Cochran v. McLaughlin, supra, is, therefore, in no way dispositive of the issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The language of the First Circuit in Third National Bank and Trust Co. of Springfield v. United States, 1 Cir., 1956, 228 F.2d 772, 773, in rejecting a contention that a decree of the Massachusetts Probate Court pre-determined the question of deductibility under the federal estate tax statute aptly applies here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">\u201c * * * the decree only states an existing rule of law in Massachusetts, and no doubt elsewhere also, to be applied as a general proposition in the absence of indications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>to the contrary in the language of the will itself or in the circumstances surrounding its use. It is in effect a mere statement of abstract principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">The appellee would have us construe the Connecticut decision as holding as a matter of law that inclusion of the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d prevented the trust from being a charitable one,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and asks us to imply a holding by that court that the testatrix did not intend the residue of her estate to pass to institutions tax-exempt under Section 303(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926. Nothing in that decision gives rise to such an implication, and, in fact, the Connecticut court, in our opinion, did not make such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The overwhelming weight of authority supports the principle that the word \u201cbenevolent\u201d particularly when used with the word \u201ccharitable\u201d applies to institutions which are within the scope of Section 303(a)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (Chicago Bank of Commerce v. McPherson, 6 Cir., 1932, 62 F.2d 393, certiorari denied 289 U.S. 736, 53 S.Ct. 596, 77 L.Ed. 1484; St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. Burnet, supra; Michigan Trust Co. v. United States, supra; Gossett v. Swinney, supra). \u201cBenevolent\u201d is not a word of art connoting \u201cnon-charitable\u201d or \u201cnon-tax-exempt.\u201d To the contrary as used in ordinary speech and writing it is associated and is synonymous with \u201ccharitable.\u201d In granting tax deductions for bequests of the type listed in Section 303(a) (3), Congress could not have intended to encourage bequests for eleemosynary purposes only to have them defeated by narrow construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The judgment below is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Ccurt for recomputation of the tax and entry of judgment in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">In view of our decision, plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to include a refund of federal estate tax which might have resulted from the deduction of attorneys fees and expenses incurred in this refund proceeding from the decedent\u2019s gross estate is moot and the motion, accordingly, is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-12\">. Tlie applicable statute is section 303(a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 836, which provides for a deduction from the gross estate of \u201c[f]he amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers * * * for exclusively public purposes, or to or for the use of any * * * corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, including the encouragement of art and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals * * *\u201d. 26 U.S.O.A. 812(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\">.
