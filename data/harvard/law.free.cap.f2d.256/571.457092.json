The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Government for $2,000, the sum provided for in section 26(b) (1) of the Act. Motions for a new trial and judgment n. o. v. were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">The appellant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the verdict as a matter of law. We have accordingly examined the evidence. It would serve no useful purpose to recite it here in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>detail. It is sufficient to say that it furnishes adequate support for the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The appellant\u2019s remaining contention is that the recovery provided for by section 26(b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act is in the nature of a civil fine or penalty and was barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462 since the suit was not brought within five years after the claim first accrued, as section 2462 requires. This precise question has been decided against the contention of the appellant here by the recent decision of this court in United States v. Doman, 3 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 865, to which we adhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-25\">.
