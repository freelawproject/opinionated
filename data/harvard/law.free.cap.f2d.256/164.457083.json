The court\u2019s charge, emphasizing as it did: that the defendant could not be convicted unless the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that, knowingly and with intent to defraud, he smuggled and concealed the marihuana; that the defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent and the burden of proof is upon the government to establish every element of violation of the law to the satisfaction of the jury beyond any reasonable doubt; accorded the defendant full protection against being convicted without full and convincing proof of guilt being made as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-18\">Finally, it is clear that defendant stands no better upon his second ground that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. It is true that he and his co-defendant both took the stand and both denied knowledge of the marihuana found hidden in the car. It is also true, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ever, that it was for the jury to say whether, on the testimony as a whole, including the incriminating facts and circumstances under which the defendants came into possession of and were handling the car and its contents and the statements and answers made by them to the arresting officers, that they knew the contents of the car, their testimony, that they had no guilty knowledge, was credible and to be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">No prejudicial error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\">. (1) That the court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the appellant\u2019s requested charge No. 3, \u201cTo constitute possession of the marihuana in question, the defendant must knowingly have the condemned article in Ms possession or under Ms control\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"Alq\">(2) That the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict and Ms motion for acquittal should have been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
