On this basis libelant computed that $153.53 was due. Judge Dawson found that there was money due for vacation pay and accepted libelant\u2019s figure as the proper amount. However, in discussing the subject of vacation pay, Judge Dawson inadvertently cited as authority an obsolete section of the Panamanian Labor Code, Article 170, which provided for vacation pay at the rate of one day\u2019s pay for each eleven days worked. It is quite clear that the figure awarded is correct: only the citation of Article 170 was incorrect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
