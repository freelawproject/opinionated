The trial judge certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Counsel for appellant certifies that the trial was had before the District Judge without a jury. The error alleged is that, over objection, \u201cevidence was admitted concerning the transportation of stolen automobiles not charged in the indictment when there was no showing that defendant knew they were stolen.\u201d The primary defense was that defendant did not know the cars charged in the indictment were stolen. This is not sufficient showing by counsel for defendant of presumptive error. The Assistant United States Attorney who tried the case certifies that \u201cvirtually all evidence was introduced without any objections, including over 100 written documents which, among other things, consisted of certified copies of motor vehicle records of this State, the State of Washington, and other States,\u201d and that the \u201ccase was one which was primarily concerned with credibility.\u201d This showing by counsel for the government is sufficient in connection with the certificate of the trial judge in a case tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
