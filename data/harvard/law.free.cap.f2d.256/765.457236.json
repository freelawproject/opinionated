United States, 7 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 852 is our earlier discussion of operative facts and reversal of Repsholdt\u2019s recovery of damages under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 742. The current appeal is from a summary judgment in favor of the United States behind which lies the district court\u2019s opinion reported as Repsholdt v. United States, D.C.Wis.1957, 155 F.Supp. 465. In his reply brief plaintiff states: \u201cThe only contested issue is whether or not the negligence of the staff of the-United States hospital, in failing to keep records is grounds for an action under the Suits in Admiralty Act, or under Federal Tort Claims Act.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s opening brief contains an argument opposing <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-23\">The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2680(d), does not apply to any claims, for which remedy is provided by \u00a7\u00a7 741-752, 781-790 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, and, accordingly plaintiff\u2019s remedy, already litigated, under this latter Act was exclusive, United States Shipping-Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co., 1928, 276 U.S. 202, 48 S.Ct. 256, 72 L.Ed. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Repsholdt now wants damages in tort because, he alleges, the hospital staff failed to maintain records relevant to issues in the old law suit. But he omits any authorities for the basis of the purported duty he currently insists has been breached. It might also be pointed out that the pertinent statute of limitations has run, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b); and our opinion noted the absence of a visit during March or April, 1948. 205 F.2d 852, 856. Actually all the arguments put forward on plaintiff\u2019s behalf are without merit and are undeserving of further discussion despite our careful consideration of them. We think plaintiff had his day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
