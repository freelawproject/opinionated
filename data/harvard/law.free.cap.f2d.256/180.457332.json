The alleged ground for the writ is that the different four year sentences for which the petitioner is now being held are so indefinite and ambiguous that it cannot be determined with reasonable certainty that they are to be served consecutively, therefore, the petitioner is entitled to be released after having served one of the four year sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">The same matter was this day considered on proceedings instituted by this petitioner in the original cases under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. Section 2255, wherein we held that the different four year sentences which the petitioner is now serving were intended to run consecutively. Ward v. United States, 10 Cir., 256 F.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">For the reasons stated therein, it is manifest that the petitioner has not served the sentences imposed upon him and that he is not illegally held by the Warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
