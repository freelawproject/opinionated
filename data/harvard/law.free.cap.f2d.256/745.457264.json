At hearings on the motions December 9th and 10th, 1954 it developed that defendant had originally been suspected of having connections with some misfeasance by Internal Revenue Service employees. It is beyond question that attention first focused on defendant\u2019s tax returns because of this suspicion, so that when an audit was made it had the two-fold purpose of ascertaining whether the returns were correct and whether they would show involvement in the matter which was under special investigation. Evi-' dence on the latter point seems to have been sought primarily for the purpose of constructing a case against other suspects rather than against Wheeler. In any event the investigating agent revealed only the first of the two purposes to the defendant when he first approached him for the purpose of gaining access to defendant\u2019s records</p>\n<p id=\"azn-dedup-0\">In fact the investigation developed nothing on the point of involvement, but it did turn up evidence which the authorities apparently considered warranted indictment for income tax evasion. The investigation thus concluded with exactly what is a foreseeable result of any income tax return audit, should the audit develop evidence of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"aep-dedup-0\">On these facts Judge Miller on August 17, 1955, denied the motion for suppression of the evidence and for dismissal of the indictment, without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to object to the admission of the evidence at trial. On May 1, 1956, he entered an order denying defendant\u2019s petition for reargument and reconsideration of the motion. An appeal to this court was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"A2PO\">On August 27, 1956, defendant\u2019s new counsel filed another petition for rehearing 0f the motion to suppress evidence, Hearing was held on the petition on November 26, 1956, and on January 4, 1957 before Judge Gourley. On February 21, 1957, an order was entered by Judge Miller assigning the disposition of the petition for rehearing to Judge Gourley <em>nunc pro tunc </em>September 21, 1956, with eon-sent of Judge Gourley. It appears from the record that this was done that the matter might be speedily dispatched, as Judge Miller was involved in the trial 0f two lengthy cases and it would not be convenient for him to handle the petition,</p>\n<p id=\"A4_g\">On March 20, 1957, Judge Gourley granted the motion for suppression of the evidence. D.C., 149 F.Supp. 445. This order was not appealable. Carroll v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 394, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442. On September 3, 1957, the government petitioned l\u00b0r rehearing on the motion. The matter was heard on September 6, 1957, and denied on that date by Judge Gourley who simultaneously entered an order dismissing the indictment for having been returned as a result of presentation to the grand jury of the evidence ruled to have been illegfby acqaire&lt;L Tbe a\u2122ment appeal(* to th\\s. coart- We therefore reach the question for decislon\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">in TCF Film Corp. v. Gourley, 3 cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 711, 713 this court sitting en banc and speaking through Judge Maris reaffirmed for this circuit the rule \u201c * * * that judges of co-ordinate jurisdiction sitting in the same court and in the same case should not overrule the decisions of each other.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rule might be more fundamentally stated that judges should not, if possible, place themselves in a position whereby in rendering impartial judgment on a question they might be required to overrule the decisi\u00f3n of a judge of the same court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>same case. Cf. Price v. Greenway, 3 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In deciding the TCF case we refused to follow Dictograph Products Co. v. Sono-tone Corp., 2 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 131, any further than to recognize that the rule was not absolute and all-embracing and that there are exceptional circumstances which will permit one judge of a district court to overrule a decision by another judge of the same court in the same case. In other words there are occasional situations in which a judge cannot avoid placing himself in a position which may require him to reconsider a point already earlier decided in the same case by another judge of the same court. The TCF case in fact presented that very situation. The crux of the matter, then, is not whether a second judge on reconsideration of a question can or should overrule the first judge but whether he may properly entertain the reconsideration at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-25\">We thus have implicitly recognized that the rule is one regulating the exercise of discretion in acting rather than one denying power to act at all. Because the TCF case was a mandamus proceeding begun before entry of final judgment on the merits we decided only that the second judge had properly exercised discretion in reconsidering the case. We did not pass on whether the result he reached, which was also a matter of discretion, in permitting the amendment of the complaint was an abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-38\">The exceptional circumstances which Judge Gourley found to justify his acting in this case were that Judge Miller was \"unavailable\" and had assigned the case to him \"* * * because of its pressing urgency,\" and that \"* * * none of the matters presented in the hearings held before * * * [Judge Gourley] were presented to or considered by * * * Judge Miller.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b801-55\">TCF Film Corp. v. Gourley, supra, involved a situation where the judge who had first denied a motion to amend and supplement the complaint was unavailable to consider the petition for rehearing by reason of the termination of his temporary assignment to the district in which the case was pending. We pointed out that other exceptional circumstances of unavailability of the first judge would be if he had died or resigned; it waa obvious in these situations that if the petition for reconsideration were to be heard at all, it would have to be by another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-71\">This case does not present a situation in which the first judge is unavailable in the sense that it amounts to an exceptional circumstance permitting a second judge to take the matter on rehearing with the inherent accompanying possibility of overruling the first judge. Judge Miller was not even temporarily disabled, but was active in the handling of certain other time-consuming and, no doubt, wearing litigation. The briefs indicate that he in fact sat with Judge Gourley for part of the hearing in this matter. That it was not immediately convenient for him to consider the renewed motion did not make him unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-88\">The more than three years that this case had been pending at the time Judge Gourley took it illustrates that the only \"pressing urgency\" involved was the commendable concern to speed the dispensation of justice by maintaining as nearly current dockets as possible. But that usually desirable policy must sometimes give way to weightier or more delicate elements in the dispensation of justice. Here the element of \"orderly functioning of the judicial process\" <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> supersedes that of speeding a case to conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-102\">As we have pointed out, the heart of the matter is whether a second judge may properly entertain the reconsideration at all. We have indicated that if the first judge is available the matter should again be presented to him. But it is not always possible at the outset to determine whether the identical matter is simply being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>presented over again for reconsideration, or whether more accurately the matter is being reopened and additional matter presented bearing on the same question of law once decided on what was so far available.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that latter situation the question has not really been decided earlier and is posed for the first time; the second judge ought, therefore, be free to render a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AfHL\">, ,, , It is true that some different witnesses testified before Judge Gourley than were heard by Judge Miller, but from an atten-five perusal of the transcripts we fail to perceive that the substance of their testimony bearing on the motions to suppress the evidence and dismiss the indictment was any different. Therefore, though it was a proper exercise of discretion to take the new testimony, the decision on what was substantially the same testimony was nothing more than a review of Judge Miller\u2019s earlier decision and was an abuse of discretion. Such a review would under the circumstances have been , , , ,, , ,, an abuse even had the result been the same as Judge Miller\u2019s though the error would, of course, then have been harmless. And it would still under the circumstances have been an abuse of discretion even had the results reached by each judge on the merits been the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"A5y\">In this last conclusion at least we apparently are at odds with the Second Circuit in Dictograph Products Co. v. Sonotone Corp., supra. But if the second judge has as much chance of being in error on the merits as has the first judge in considering the same question, we fail to see why the fortuity (if it can be called that) of the second judge being right in the eyes of an appellate court should affect the operation of the rule designed to prevent shopping about by the defeated party for a judge more favorably disposed to whom a petition for reconsideration may be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"A_7W\">, . , , , We are driven to the conclusion that the result m Dictograph Products case ,was conditioned by the appellate fourt,s fiction that the second judge had bee* rlght in dismissing the complamt whereas the first judge had been wrong m not domg s0- The caae reaIIy Presents an argument favoring allowance \u00b0f appeaIs fr\u00b0m the denial of mterlocutory orders which if granted would end the litigation rather than requiring the case+to \u2122\u00bbd through trial to final judgment and then upon review to find that Jbe order was m error and that the trial had been unnecessary,</p>\n<p id=\"Aj-\">Jurisdiction to entertain this appeal has so far been assumed, but defendantappellee has pending a motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on the authority of United States v. Pack, 3 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 168, and United States v. Janitz, 3 Cir., 1947, 161 F.2d 19. The pertinent statute at the time Janitz was decided was 56 Stat. 271 (1942), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 682 (1946).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Pack opinion held, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>an exhaustive review of the legislative history, that the difference in wording of the revised \u00a7 3731 had not been intended to work any change from the substantive meaning of \u00a7 682.</p>\n<p id=\"AKZ\">In both Pack and Janitz the trial courts had entered orders suppressing certain evidence without which as a practical matter the government found itself unable to conduct an effective prosecution; the trial courts in both instances, frankly seeking to provide review for their suppression orders and ostensibly acting under Rule 48(b), Fed.Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., subsequently entered dismissals of the indictments. In Janitz, 161 F.2d at page 21, this court said.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azi\">\u201cWe think it clear * * * that the learned Judge\u2019s order of dismissal was not based on any objection brought against the indictment at all. The defendants had made no attack on the indictment. The Government\u2019s case failed because it had no testimony to support it. We think this is not the kind of a judgment to which the Criminal Appeals statute is directed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">_ _ , . . , , . ,,,,,, The Pack opinion determined that the revised statute called for the same result in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">What we have here, however, is .an appeal on behalf of the United States from a quashing and setting aside of an indictment, thought by the dismissing judge to have been illegally obtained. The dismissal was entered explicitly under Rule \u00cd2(b) (2) Fed.Rules Cnm.Pro-cedure and not solely because of the gov\u25a0ernment\u2019s failure or inability to prosecute. Nor was the dismissal, as appel-lees allege, simply a well-conceived device for putting before this court for review the interlocutory order suppressing the evidence. Consideration by us of whetn\u25a0er an indictment is defective if obtained as a result of presentation to the grand jury of evidence unlawfully acquired by the government would not necessarily have also entailed consideration of the different question of whether the evi-fence involved was subject to a suppression order. And were we to consider both questions, reinstatement of the indictment would not necessarily compel a reversal of the suppression order. Jurisdiction for this appeal, therefore, is conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.</p>\n<p id=\"ag3-dedup-0\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied. The order of March 20, 1957 granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, and the order of September 6, 1957 granting the motion to dismiss the indictment are vacated and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with his opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-59\">.
