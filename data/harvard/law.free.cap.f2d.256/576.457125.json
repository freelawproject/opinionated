S. Code and the Rules of Court of \u201cthe English Supreme Court.\u201d It is difficult to translate the document before us to anything more than the statement of these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">(a) \u201cCausa Et Origo Est Materia Ne-gotii\u201d is a Latin phrase correctly translated by petitioners as \u201cThe cause and origin is the substance of the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">(b) Petitioners, (looking at a certified copy of the amended indictment under which, in the state courts of California, petitioner Cardwell was charged with eight counts of sale of narcotics, and petitioner Jones with two counts of the sale of narcotics, and with one prior narcotic conviction), find the signature of the Grand Jury Foreman typed, rather than signed by hand. They apparently urge that this entitles them to their release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">This is a collateral attack upon an indictment. It is not an appeal. There is no such thing known to our law as a <em>writ </em>\u201cCausa Et Origo Est Materia Negotii.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\"> The most charitable interpretation we can arrive at is to consider this remarkable document as the equivalent of a Writ of Habeas Corpus, based upon the theory that petitioners\u2019 conviction was void. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(a), (c) (3) and \u00a7 2243. The sufficiency of an indictment upon which petitioner was convicted and sentenced may not be challenged by a petition for habeas corpus. Only when it plainly appears on the face of the record that no crime was charged in an indictment can a court by habeas corpus, inquire into validity of the indictment. Bergemann v. Backer, 157 U. S. 655, 15 S.Ct. 727, 39 L.Ed. 845; Brock v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 111 F.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">The Petition is denied as to each petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
