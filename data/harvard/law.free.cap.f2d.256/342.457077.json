In December 1957 he moved to vacate the judgment and sentence under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied his motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">His complaints are that he was illegally arrested, that the drug was not under his possession or control, that the evidence was more consistent with his innocence than with his guilt, and that evidence of his prior conviction was erroneously admitted. None of these matters render the judgment of conviction void or subject to collateral attack under a Section 2255 motion.
