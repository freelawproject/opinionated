Travelling in two trailers loaded with a tent and other equipment used to conduct religious \u201crevivals\u201d, they arrived in Buena Vista where they saw a vacant lot behind a \u201cSoft Serve\u201d restaurant. Mr. Spence approached Mrs. Hattie Griffin, the owner of the restaurant and the lot, and inquired whether he could rent the lot, erect his tent, and hold a revival. Mrs. Griffin replied that she would make no charge for the use of her lot \u201c[i]f you\u2019re a preacher and are going to preach\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">During the ensuing three weeks, the Spences conducted daily religious meetings in the tent erected on Mrs. Griffin\u2019s property. Although the Spences had parked their camper in Mrs. Griffin\u2019s yard and made connections with her water and electrical supplies, they accepted her invitation to sleep in her home. Mrs. Griffin gave Mr. Spence a key to her house and allowed him and his wife to eat without charge in her restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Earlier that year, Mrs. Griffin\u2019s estranged husband had threatened to kill her two children, born of a previous marriage, and to burn down her house if she did not consent to a divorce. Even though she had given her consent, her husband shot and killed her son in March 1983. Mrs. Griffin, who had undergone open-heart surgery several years before, was still under a doctor\u2019s care when the Spences arrived in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In search of spiritual comfort, Mrs. Griffin attended the revival meetings and, responding to Mr. Spence\u2019s public entreaties, had donated several hundred dollars to his ministry. At one of those meetings, Mr. Spence stood in front of his congregation and asked Mrs. Griffin if she would donate her lot for the building of a church. Mrs. Griffin agreed, but she later protested that \u201cit didn\u2019t hit me right, because I didn\u2019t think that should be brought out before everybody in there\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Mrs. Griffin testified that one night after she returned from work at the restaurant, Mr. Spence \u201casked me three or four times to see the deed\u201d by which she had acquired the lot. She brought him the deed, and after he had read it, she laid it on the \u201cgrand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>father clock in the living room.\u201d After the Spences had left on a trip to West Virginia, Mrs. Griffin \u201clooked on top of the clock to get the deed to put it away\u201d and discovered \u201c[t]he deed was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The Spences first took the deed to Wilson Miller, an attorney, and asked him to prepare a deed conveying the lot to them. Miller consulted Mrs. Griffin who told him that she was willing to donate the lot for the building of a church but if it ever ceased to be a church, the property was \u201c[t]o come back to me.\u201d Meanwhile, she wanted to reserve the right for customers of her restaurant to park on the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The Spences retrieved Mrs. Griffin\u2019s deed from Miller and employed another attorney, John Robert Lewis, Jr. Mrs. Griffin testified that Mr. Spence had told her that he had changed lawyers because Miller \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it quick enough for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">When Lewis contacted Mrs. Griffin, she told him, \u201cI give it for the church only, and, if it wasn\u2019t a church, it was to come back to me, that I did not give it to the Spences.\u201d She added, \u201cI will have to have parking back there.\u201d Speaking of Mr. Spence\u2019s first visit to his office, Lewis testified, \u201cApparently, at that time, Mrs. Griffin was going to deed the property outright to Mr. Spence.\u201d After talking with Mrs. Griffin, however, Lewis learned that \u201cif the land was no longer used for church purposes \u2014 that she would want the property reverted back to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Lewis drafted a \u201cDEED OF GIFT\u201d conveying the lot to Mr. and Mrs. Spence as tenants by the entirety. The stated consideration was \u201creligious interest and Christian affection\u201d. The draft contained language reserving to Mrs. Griffin \u201ca right of way across, over and through the said Lot... for the purpose of parking motor vehicles\u201d, but it did not include a reversionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Late in the afternoon on September 1, 1983, Mrs. Griffin was invited to leave her restaurant and meet Lewis and the Spences in the office of the clerk of the circuit court. She testified that Lewis \u201claid [the deed] down there. And he said, \u2018It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s drawn up like you had asked.\u2019 So I just went on and signed it to get back to my place of business, because we were busy up there when I left it.\u201d She acknowledged that she had not read the deed carefully but \u201cjust kind of sketched over it, and he said \u2018It\u2019s like you wanted it.\u2019 So that\u2019s the reason I signed it.\u201d She added, \u201cI trusted him as an attorney, and I trusted Spence as a preacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The deed of gift was admitted to record at 4:55 p.m. Before she left the clerk\u2019s office, Mrs. Griffin approached Mrs. Spence and said, \u201cI gave it for a church . . . [but] I\u2019ve got nothing here to show or take anything off of my income.\u201d At the Spences\u2019 request, a typist prepared a receipt. In her own handwriting, Mrs. Spence inserted the words, \u201cTo build a Church\u201d, and the Spences signed the receipt and handed it to Mrs. Griffin. In reply to the question, \u201c[A]t that time, what did you think the deed said?\u201d, Mrs. Griffin stated, \u201cI thought it was for the church and that . . . my parking would be on the first part of the lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Lewis testified that Mrs. Spence had paid him $25 to draft the deed of gift and that Mr. Spence\u2019s \u201cmain concern was that the property would be deeded to him and his wife outright, that they would have the decision to make whether or not to sell the property.\u201d Lewis acknowledged that Mrs. Griffin had told him that she wanted the lot used to build a church, but he said \u201cif I put in the language . . . that it was to be used for church purposes, then it would be, in fact, a reversionary situation . . . and Mr. Spence did not agree to that.\u201d Lewis said that, although he tried to explain the contents and effect of the deed to Mrs. Griffin before she signed it, \u201cI think that she didn\u2019t understand exactly what was in the deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">After the deed was admitted to record, the Spences obtained a permit to construct a building estimated to cost $40,000. The size of the building was to be 50 feet by 60 feet. The center was reserved for a sanctuary. \u201cWings\u201d planned on both sides consisted of bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. The Spences later decided to include a basement for their son to use as a place to store and sell carpets and rugs to raise money for the church. As construction progressed, it became clear that the project could not be financed by current contributions from the congregation, and the Spences applied for a construction loan. The bank refused the application on the ground that the broad definition of the parking easement made the property unmarketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Mr. Spence reported this to Mrs. Griffin, showed her the deed of gift, and asked her \u201cto take the easement off it and to get it fixed up right\u201d. Mrs. Griffin testified that she read the deed and, for the first time, learned that the lot had been conveyed to the Spences rather than to a church. She agreed to obtain a survey and modify the language defining the easement, but she insisted that, in order to \u201cfix it up right\u201d, the deed of correction should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>provide that \u201cif there wasn\u2019t a church built back there, it would come back to me, not to him and her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The parties were unable to agree, and construction of the building was discontinued in December 1983. At that time, $17,200 had been spent, $4,500 of which had been obtained by the Spences on a personal loan, and creditors were demanding payment of delinquent bills for building supplies. A real estate broker estimated the value of the unfinished building, absent mechanics\u2019 liens, at $20,000 and the value of the land, unencumbered by the parking easement, at $6,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Spences filed a bill in chancery praying that the parking easement \u201cbe removed due to mistake and fraud\u201d. They alleged that the provision \u201camounts to a taking of the real estate on the part of Defendant and unjust enrichment to the Defendant\u201d and that \u201cthe Defendant fraudulently induced Plaintiffs to construct a valuable building on the real estate knowing that the conveyance as made would prevent them from selling, mortgaging or using the real estate in any manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The evidence shows, as the commissioner found, that \u201cMr. Spence made it clear to all within his hearing that he was independent of any church affiliation, that he was the \u2018church\u2019 and would run it as he pleased.\u201d Mr. Spence insisted that title be transferred to him and his wife because, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be bound down to tie up thousands of dollars and no way to get it out.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019d outgrow the building,\u201d he continued, \u201cor if we just . . . found a better place ... we could sell this and move down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Mr. Spence testified that he had served as pastor of a church in Ohio and currently was pastor of a church in Charmco, West Virginia. The title to both churches had been conveyed to the Spences as individuals. Mr. Spence explained, \u201cI donate the church ... to the congregation to worship in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The Charmco church contained six apartments. The Spences collected the rent from the tenants and reported it on their individual income tax returns. Concerning real estate taxes, Mr. Spence said that \u201cI could put it in the church name, if I wanted to, and exempt it. But... I prefer to pay the tax on it, and that\u2019s the way I do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The rental income and all contributions collected at religious services conducted by the Spences were deposited in three checking accounts. All were opened in names of churches, but each was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>subject to withdrawal only on the Spences\u2019 personal signatures. The Spences pay the Charmco mortgage and the \u201cministry expenses\u201d they incur out of these funds, and when the balance in the accounts permit, they pay themselves a salary. According to Mr. Spence, \u201cWe take what we get out of the church . . . and that is our personal money. I can do anything I wanted to do with it.\u201d During the first week of the 1983 revival, the Spences used funds from these accounts to make the down payment on a 1983 Cadillac automobile titled in their names.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Mrs. Griffin had answered and denied the substantial allegations of the Spences\u2019 bill of complaint and had filed a cross-bill alleging fraud and undue influence and demanding rescission of the deed of gift. Although the commissioner found that the evidence was insufficient to prove fraud on the part of either party, he concluded that \u201cMr. and Mrs. Spence have obligated themselves as \u2018trustees\u2019 for the construction of a church\u201d and that they should be \u201cput to an election\u201d either to \u201cre-establish their congregation and solicit pledges (not collect money) for the purpose of determining whether or not there is sufficient interest in the community to continue the building project\u201d or to submit to rescission of the deed of gift and restoration of title to Mrs. Griffin. In event of rescission, he added, \u201cthe Spences would be required to pay off any indebtedness which may constitute a lien . . . [but] permitted to salvage whatever is possible out of the improvements already on the property\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Disagreeing with the commissioner, the chancellor ruled that \u201cthe evidence as a whole makes out a clear and convincing case of actual fraud\u201d on the part of the Spences. Based upon that ruling, the chancellor entered a final decree denying the Spences\u2019 prayer for reformation of the parking easement and directing instead that \u201cthe deed ... be rescinded forthwith\u201d; that a special commissioner \u201creconvey the land in dispute to Hattie A. Griffin\u201d; that the Spences \u201cliquidate any indebtedness which may constitute a lien on [her] interest\u201d and that the Spences \u201cbe permitted to salvage the improvements made by them\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">On appeal, the Spences urge us to uphold the commissioner\u2019s finding that the evidence was insufficient to satisfy the legal definition of fraud and to reject the chancellor\u2019s ruling to the contrary. We consistently have held that, when the commissioner and the chancellor disagree, \u201c[w]e must . . . review the evidence to ascertain whether, <em>under a correct application of the law, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>evidence supports the <em>findings </em>of the commissioner or the <em>conclusions </em>of the trial court.\u201d <em>Wiltshire </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>220 Va. 678, 680, 261 S.E.2d 542, 543 (1980) (emphasis added) (citations omitted); <em>see, e.g., Sprott </em>v. <em>Sprott, </em>233 Va. 238, 240, 355 S.E.2d 881, 882 (1987); <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>229 Va. 72, 75, 326 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1985); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 577, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296-97 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">We think the commissioner\u2019s finding was not based upon correct principles of the law of fraud and deceit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">The elements of actual fraud are: (1) a false representation, (2) of a material fact,<footnotemark>[*]</footnotemark> (3) made intentionally and knowingly, (4) with intent to mislead, (5) reliance by the party misled, and (6) resulting damage to the party misled. The burden is upon the party charging fraud to prove it by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Winn </em>v. <em>Aleda Const. Co., </em>227 Va. 304, 308, 315 S.E.2d 193, 195 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In support of the commissioner\u2019s finding, the Spences argue that the evidence fails to prove that they made any false representation that induced Mrs. Griffin to execute the deed of gift. They seem to assume that the only type of misrepresentation contemplated by the definition of actual fraud is an intentional, express verbalization of a falsehood. Concerning an allegation of actual fraud, we have said that \u201c[concealment of a material fact by one who knows that the other party is acting upon the assumption that the fact does not exist constitutes actionable fraud.\u201d <em>Allen Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holbert, </em>227 Va. 441, 450, 318 S.E.2d 592, 597 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">For purposes of an action for fraud, concealment, whether accomplished by word or conduct, may be the equivalent of a false representation, because concealment always involves deliberate nondisclosure designed to prevent another from learning the truth. A contracting party\u2019s willful nondisclosure of a material fact that he knows is unknown to the other party may evince an intent to practice actual fraud. <em>See Bossuyt </em>v. <em>Osage Farmers Nat. Bank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>360 N.W.2d 769, 774 (Iowa 1985); <em>Allstate Redevelopment </em>v. <em>Summit Assoc., </em>206 N.J. Super. 318, 326, 502 A.2d 1137, 1141 (1985); <em>Mitchell v. Straith, </em>40 Wash. App. 405, 410-11, 698 P.2d 609, 612 (1985); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7 161 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Applying that principle and the standard of proof required to establish fraud to the facts in this case, we find that Mrs. Griffin always intended her gift to be conditioned upon the construction and continued use of a church for religious purposes; that, in event of breach of that condition, she intended title to the lot to revert to her name; that the basic assumption inducing her to execute the deed was that the instrument she signed imposed that condition and contained a reversionary clause; that her mistaken belief that the deed contained those provisions was induced by the assurances given her at the time by the Spences\u2019 own agent; and that the Spences were aware that Mrs. Griffin was acting on that mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cWe have long adhered to the rule that \u2018a principal is bound by representations of his agent, made either in the scope of his employment or in furtherance of the object for which he is employed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>229 Va. 627, 632, 331 S.E.2d 490, 493 (1985) (quoting <em>Cerriglio </em>v. <em>Pettit, </em>113 Va. 533, 542, 75 S.E. 303, 307 (1912)). At the time the deed of gift was executed, the clerk\u2019s office was about to close for the day; Mrs. Griffin was anxious to 'return to her place of business; she trusted Mr. Spence \u201cas a preacher\u201d and Mr. Lewis \u201cas an attorney\u201d; and she was assured that the deed was \u201clike [she] wanted it.\u201d Under these circumstances, Mrs. Griffin did not read the deed of gift thoroughly and, as a general rule, a grantor\u2019s failure to read the deed does not relieve him of its obligations. The rule does not apply, however, where, as here, \u201cthe grantee . . . induced the grantor not to read it.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>223 Va. 505, 509, 291 S.E.2d 218, 221 (1982) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We are of opinion that good faith dealing required the Spences to correct Mrs. Griffin\u2019s mistake by disclosing the true contents and effect of the deed before she signed it and that their nondisclosure was the equivalent of a fraudulent assertion of a material fact, knowingly made with intent to mislead. Accordingly, we will uphold the chancellor\u2019s decision that execution of the deed of gift was induced by actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Ordinarily, \u201cwhere the transaction is avoided because of actual fraud, the grantee is not entitled ... to compensation for improvements he has made.\u201d <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>232 Va. 379, 385, 350 S.E.2d 637, 641 (1986) (citations omitted). Because Mrs. Griffin agreed otherwise in her exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, we will affirm the final decree in all its parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[*]\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\"><em>* </em>In fraud cases, \u201ca fact is material when it influences a person to enter into a contract, when it deceives him and induces him to act, or when without it the transaction would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Packard Norfolk </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>198 Va. 557, 563, 95 S.E.2d 207, 211-12 (1956) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
