The case was tried to a jury, and at the conclusion of Payne\u2019s evidence, the trial court struck her evidence as to each defendant. Payne appeals from the judgment entered in favor of Gloeckl and Fulgham.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">On May 25, 1984, an automobile operated by Gloeckl collided with an automobile operated by Fulgham in the City of Fredericksburg. Gloeckl was proceeding north on Interstate 95, travel-ling in the left or passing lane of the highway. Fulgham, also heading north, was entering Interstate 95 from the entry ramp off State Route 3. Payne was a passenger in the Fulgham automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>At trial, Payne called Gloeckl and Fulgham as adverse witnesses. Each defendant placed the blame for the collision on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Gloeckl testified that as he approached the intersection at an estimated speed of 57 miles per hour, Fulgham\u2019s automobile \u201ccame down the entrance ramp, pulled directly across the right-hand lane to the lefthand lane,\u201d forcing Gloeckl to apply his brakes and swerve to his right in an attempt to avoid a collision. The automobiles collided, and Gloeckl\u2019s automobile \u201cended up in the righthand lane\u201d with the front of his car \u201cagainst the concrete abutment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Fulgham testified that before he entered Interstate 95 from the ramp he \u201clooked back\u201d and observed that the right lane \u201cwas clear.\u201d As he approached the intersection he heard \u201ca screeching noise.\u201d Looking into his rear view mirror, he saw \u201cthis car out of control.\u201d Fulgham related that Gloeckl\u2019s automobile \u201ccame across . . . and hit the back fender of [Fulgham\u2019s] car,\u201d causing the car to go out of control and into an embankment on the right side of the highway. Fulgham further stated that he did not cross over into the left lane of Interstate 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The investigating police officer found skid marks leading from the left lane into the right lane. The officer testified that these skid marks and \u201cthe debris of the vehicles\u201d indicated that the collision occurred in the right northbound lane. The officer reported that the left front fender of Gloeckl\u2019s car was damaged and the left rear of Fulgham\u2019s vehicle was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">On direct examination, Payne testified only about her injuries. During cross-examination, however, counsel for each defendant questioned Payne concerning the accident. Gloeckl\u2019s counsel asked Payne: \u201cAre you able to categorically say that [Fulgham] didn\u2019t pull out in front of another car?\u201d Payne responded, \u201cNo, I am not able to say that.\u201d Thereafter, Fulgham\u2019s counsel inquired of Payne: \u201cTo the best of your memory, do you remember Mr. Fulgham coming off of the ramp and travelling across two lanes of traffic before you were hit?\u201d Payne answered, \u201cNo, we did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Fulgham, relying upon the doctrine of <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922), contends that Payne\u2019s last quoted answer bars a recovery by her against him. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In <em>Massie, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>No litigant can successfully ask a court or jury to believe that he has not told the truth. His statements of fact and the necessary inferences therefrom are binding upon him. He cannot be heard to ask that his case be made stronger than he makes it, where, as here, it depends upon facts within his own knowledge and as to which he has testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">134 Va. at 462, 114 S.E. at 656. Thus, where a party \u201cunequivocally testifies to facts within his knowledge and upon which his case turns, he is bound thereby.\u201d <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Mabin, </em>203 Va. 490, 493, 125 S.E.2d 145, 147 (1962) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The <em>Massie </em>doctrine, though subject to numerous exceptions, is established firmly in our law. <em>See, e.g., Travis &amp; Ludwig </em>v. <em>Bulifant, 226 </em>Va. 1, 4-5, 306 S.E.2d 865, 866-67 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">As defined, refined, and distilled in [subsequent] cases, the rule relevant to actions in tort is that a litigant whose testimony, <em>considered as a whole, conclusively absolves </em>an alleged tortfeasor of actionable negligence forfeits the cause of action against him ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\"><em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Carter &amp; Grinstead, 226 </em>Va. 361, 370, 310 S.E.2d 666, 671 (1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">We do not believe that Payne\u2019s scant testimony \u201cconclusively absolves\u201d Fulgham of negligence. The most she said in response to the particular question posed was that, to the best of her memory, Fulgham did not travel \u201cacross two lanes of traffic\u201d before his car was struck. Moreover, as previously noted, in another portion of her cross-examination, Payne stated that she could not \u201ccategorically say that [Fulgham] didn\u2019t pull out in front of [Gloeckl].\u201d Thus, Payne\u2019s statements, taken together, were equivocal, as well as scant; they do not conclusively absolve Fulgham of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Viewing, as we must, all of Payne\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to her, we believe a fact finder reasonably could conclude that Fulgham failed to keep a proper lookout, failed to keep his vehicle under proper control, and failed to yield the right of way before entering Interstate 95. We conclude, therefore, that Payne\u2019s testimony did not bar a recovery against Fulgham.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Gloeckl also contends that the trial court correctly struck Payne\u2019s evidence as it related to him. Gloeckl asserts that \u201c[w]hen [Payne] rested, there was no evidence from which the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>conclude that [he] was negligent.\u201d He says that Payne proved \u201conly that there was an accident.\u201d We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The physical evidence, as gleaned from the police officer\u2019s testimony, shows that the point of impact was in the right lane and that Gloeckl\u2019s automobile, for some reason, had swerved from the left to the right lane of the highway. Although Gloeckl testified that he swerved to avoid striking Fulgham\u2019s vehicle as it entered the left lane, Fulgham\u2019s testimony, and to some extent Payne\u2019s, indicates that Fulgham remained in the right lane at all times until the collision occurred. Thus, we conclude that a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence was presented against Gloeckl when Payne rested her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In our view, the present case is controlled by our decision in the factually similar case of <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Veney &amp; Raines, </em>220 Va. 947, 265 S.E.2d 707 (1980). There, as here, two automobiles collided. One was operated by Veney, the other by Raines. Newton, a passenger in the Raines automobile, sued both drivers. Newton testified that she did not \u201cknow exactly\u201d how the accident occurred. Newton, however, called each defendant as an adverse witness, and each blamed the other for the accident. When Newton rested, the trial court struck her evidence. In reversing the judgment of the trial court, we noted that the testimony, though sketchy, was adequate to establish that the accident was not unavoidable. We further said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">The issues which confront us on this appeal are whether the plaintiffs evidence raised jury questions as to negligence and proximate cause. The general rule is that negligence becomes a question of law only when reasonable men cannot differ. When the sufficiency of a plaintiffs evidence is challenged by a motion to strike, the trial court should resolve any reasonable doubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence in plaintiffs favor and should grant the motion only when it <em>conclusively appears </em>that the plaintiff has proved no cause of action against the defendant, or when it plainly appears that the trial court would be compelled to set aside any verdict found for the plaintiff as being without evidence to support it. While a jury may not find the necessary preponderance of the evidence to support a verdict against either Raines or Veney, we cannot, as a matter of law, say that such negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>gence is not shown. We conclude that the trial court erred in striking the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 951, 265 S.E.2d at 710 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Similarly, in the present case, the testimony was sufficient to show that the accident was not unavoidable. Here, as in <em>Newton, </em>it does not conclusively appear that Payne proved no cause of action against either defendant. Reasonable minds could differ as to whether the defendants, jointly or severally, were guilty of negligence that proximately caused Payne\u2019s injuries. Thus, jury issues were presented, and the trial court erred in striking Payne\u2019s evidence as to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
