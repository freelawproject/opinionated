The Alexandria Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends is affiliated with the Baltimore Yearly Meeting, an organization of Quakers established in 1672. Jack Ginsburg was duly selected Clerk by the membership of the Alexandria Meeting in accordance with Quaker discipline. He serves as the sole incumbent of that position. The Clerk of a Friends Meeting is its designated administrative official. Ginsburg meets with the members of the Meeting for weekly worship and \u201cperforms such ministerial duties in meeting for worship and meeting for business as are consistent with Quaker discipline.\u201d Quaker discipline provides for \u201cmarriage of members of the Meeting under the care of the Meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Mr. Ginsburg applied to the circuit court for authority to celebrate marriages under Code \u00a7 20-23, which provides for the licensing of ministers to celebrate marriages without the requirement of bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court determined that he did not qualify for licensing under that section and denied the application. Thereafter, Mr. Ginsburg obtained authority to celebrate marriages under Code \u00a7 20-26, which requires a $500 bond with surety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>posted a property bond but appealed the denial of his original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">On appeal, Mr. Ginsburg argues that he is a \u201cminister\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-23, but that if this Court should hold otherwise, then the statutory scheme which requires a bond as a prerequisite to the licensing of a Quaker Clerk to celebrate marriages, while dispensing with that requirement in the case of ecclesiastically ordained ministers, would violate the establishment clauses of Va. Const, art. I \u00a716 and U.S. Const, amend. I. Because we agree with his primary contention, we do not reach the constitutional issues he raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We construed Code \u00a7 20-23 in <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 875 (1974). There, we noted that the statute applies to \u201cministers\u201d who make proof of \u201cordination\u201d and of being in \u201cregular communion\u201d with a religious society. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 202 S.E.2d at 913. We held, however, that the term \u201cminister\u201d applies to those for whom ministry is less than a full-time vocation, and that the terms \u201cordination\u201d and \u201ccommunion\u201d are not used in the ecclesiastical sense, because the state has no concern with the religious aspect of the marriage ceremony. <em>Id. </em>at 564-65, 202 S.E.2d at 913-14. We noted that the word \u201cordain\u201d is subject to such definitions as \u201cappoint,\u201d \u201carrange,\u201d \u201corder,\u201d \u201cmanage,\u201d and \u201cto establish by appointment.\u201d We noted further that the word \u201ccommunion\u201d is subject to such definitions as \u201cmutual participation,\u201d \u201cjoint or common action,\u201d and \u201ca function performed jointly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 202 S.E.2d at 914. We did, in <em>Cramer, </em>define a \u201cminister,\u201d as the term is used in Code \u00a7 20-23, as one who \u201cis the head of a religious congregation, society or order. He is set apart as the leader. He is the person elected or selected in accordance with the ritual, bylaws or discipline of the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 202 S.E.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We hold that Mr. Ginsburg meets the definition of a \u201cminister\u201d who has furnished \u201cproof of his ordination and of his being in regular communion with the religious society of which he is a reputed member,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-23, as we construed it in <em>Cramer. </em>Accordingly, we will reverse the order appealed from and remand the case for the entry of an appropriate order authorizing the appellant to celebrate marriages in Virginia pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> Code \u00a7 20-23: When a minister of any religious denomination shall produce before the circuit court of any county or city in this State, or before the judge of such court or before the clerk of such court at any time, proof of his ordination and of his being in regular communion with the religious society of which he is a reputed member, or proof that he holds a local minister\u2019s license and is serving as a regularly appointed pastor in his denomination, such court, or the judge thereof, or the clerk of such court at any time, may make an order authorizing such minister to celebrate the rites of matrimony in this State. Any order made under this section may be rescinded at any time by the court or by the judge thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> Code \u00a7 20-26: Marriages between persons belonging to any religious society which has no ordained minister, may be solemnized by the persons and in the manner prescribed by and practiced in any such society.
