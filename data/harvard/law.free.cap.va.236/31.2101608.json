The respondents, the Board of Trustees of the Fairfax County Police Officers Retirement System (the Trustees) and the County of Fairfax (the County), filed demurrers and other special pleas. Upon consideration of the pleadings and oral argument, the trial court entered an order dated December 10, 1984 dismissing the County as a party respondent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By order entered August 19, 1985 incorporating a letter opinion, the court sustained the Trustees\u2019 demurrer and dismissed the bill of complaint with prejudice, and we granted Bonavita an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The only facts before us are those well-pleaded in the bill of complaint. The bill treats Bonavita as \u201cthe representative Plaintiff\u2019. As a result of injuries sustained in the performance of his duties, Bonavita was retired for disability in 1978. In order to determine whether, as Bonavita contends on appeal, the Trustees \u201ccalculated and paid retirement benefits . . . lower than the amount fixed by statute\u201d, we must examine the enabling statutes and the ordinance under which the Trustees acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">By Acts 1981, c. 595, the General Assembly amended and reenacted the enabling statutes codified in Title 51, Chapter 4, Article 4 of the Code. Code \u00a7\u00a7 51-127.10 to .30. As codified, the statutes reaffirmed the County\u2019s authority, first granted under Acts 1944, c. 303, to \u201ccreate and establish\u201d an administrative board to conduct a retirement system for Fairfax County police officers. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51-127.10. Code \u00a7 51-127.20 provided that any officer retired for service-connected disability would be entitled to a pension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>equal to \u201csixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the salary he would have received had he remained uninjured and continued in the performance of his duties.\u201d To finance the system, Code \u00a7 51-127.25 provided that the administrative board deduct \u201cfrom the salaries of the policemen, ten and one-half per centum of the amounts of their salaries or such per centum as may be determined by the county board of supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Following legislative approval of amendments to the Act, the board of supervisors enacted an ordinance entitled \u201cFairfax County Police Officers Retirement System\u201d. Fairfax County Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-7-1 to -7-47. The administrative board established under the 1944 Act was replaced by the \u201cBoard of Trustees\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-7-1. In language patterned after that employed in Code \u00a7 51-127.20, the ordinance fixed the service-connected disability pension at two-thirds \u201cof the salary that would have been received had no injury occurred and the performance of duty had continued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-7-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Unlike Code \u00a7 51-127.25, however, Fairfax County Code \u00a7 3-7-24 provided that the formula for computing deductions from paychecks should be a percentage of \u201ccreditable compensation\u201d rather than \u201csalary\u201d. The ordinance defined \u201csalary\u201d as \u201cthe compensation established for each position as approved in the County Pay and Compensation Plan\u201d and \u201ccreditable compensation\u201d as \u201cpayment of salary, roll call and holiday pay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-7-2(m), (f). According to the bill of complaint, the County and its police officers had entered into a contract several years before enactment of the ordinance that required officers \u201cto work an extra one-half <em>(V2) </em>hours per day.\u201d This work was \u201ccompensable at time-and-a-half\u201d and \u201cwas commonly referred to as a ROLL CALL PAY.\u201d The contract also required the County to pay its police officers the salary they would have earned if they had worked \u201ca certain number of holidays each year\u201d and such compensation \u201cis more commonly referred to as HOLIDAY PAY.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Bonavita argues that the enabling statutes do not define the term \u201csalary\u201d; that both Code \u00a7 51-127.20 and Code \u00a7 51-127.25 use that term; that the General Assembly intended the term to be given the same meaning in both sections of the statute; and, hence, that if the ordinance includes roll call pay and holiday pay in the formula used to calculate paycheck deductions, then the formula used to calculate retirement benefits must include such pay. Otherwise, Bonavita argues, the benefit formula defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the ordinance \u201cis beyond the grant of authority to the county and in direct conflict with the amount of pension benefits mandated by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Bonavita overlooks the fact that the General Assembly expressly authorized the County to modify the terms of the retirement system. Code \u00a7 51-127.12 provides that \u201c[t]he governing body of the county may by ordinance reserve the right to amend, suspend, or revoke the retirement plan and trust at any time [subject to constraints irrelevant to this appeal].\u201d In Fairfax County Code \u00a7 3-7-8, the board of supervisors reserved that right and, in \u00a7 3-7-24, exercised that right by requiring that the formula for calculating the paycheck deductions apply the percentage factor to roll call pay and holiday pay as well as to salary. Nothing in the enabling statutes required the County to include all those factors in the benefits formula, and we find no merit in Bonavita\u2019s argument that the ordinance conflicts with the enabling statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">We now consider another argument Bonavita advances on brief. The formula prescribed by the ordinance for computing benefits for retirement based on tenure of service applies the rate factor to salary, roll call pay, and holiday pay. Fairfax County Code \u00a7\u00a7 3-7-27, -7-2(c) and (f). Pointing to that fact, Bonavita raises what appears to be a constitutional challenge to the ordinance. \u201cTo add insult to injury,\u201d Bonavita complains, \u201cthe Trustees and County pay all other retired police officers their pension based on a figure which includes roll-call pay and holiday pay. It is only when it is time to pay the few, disabled, police officers that the County and the Board of Trustees exclude roll-call and holiday pay from their own definition of \u2018salary.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">If this is a charge of invidious discrimination, we reject it. In an opinion upholding the statutory classification of beneficiaries of social security benefits, the United States Supreme Court has said that \u201c[a]s long as the classificatory scheme . . . rationally advances a reasonable and identifiable governmental objective, we must disregard the existence of other methods of allocation that we, as individuals, perhaps would have preferred.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 235 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">Unless they involve such \u201csuspect classifications\u201d as race, sex, or religion, or affect fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of speech, legislative classifications will be upheld if they bear some rational relationship to a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>interest or purpose. Such a classification ordinarily will be upheld \u201cif any state of facts can be reasonably conceived that would support it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>Old Dominion Inc. </em>v. <em>Corp. Comm., </em>228 Va. 528, 534, 323 S.E.2d 123, 126-27 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Under the ordinance enacted by the County\u2019s board of supervisors, service retirees must work a prescribed period of time to earn their entitlement; disability retirees may become eligible the day they are employed. Service retirees will have made payments to finance the system for the prescribed term of service; disability retirees may have made no payment at all. In calculating the benefits earned by service retirees, the Trustees examine a written record reflecting the amount of roll call pay and holiday pay actually received each year; in calculating the benefits to which Bonavita says disability retirees should be entitled, the Trustees necessarily would have to speculate what roll call pay and holiday pay \u201cwould have been received had no injury occurred and the performance of duty had continued.\u201d Fairfax County Code \u00a7 3-7-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Considering this state of facts, we hold that the classification made by the board of supervisors was rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective, and we will affirm the chancellor\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> The other complainants in the court below were Richard DuVall, Robert Lockhart, and Paul Marshall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> Appellant Bonavita failed to assign error to the entry of the December 10, 1984 decree, and insofar as he names the County as an appellee, we will dismiss the appeal.
