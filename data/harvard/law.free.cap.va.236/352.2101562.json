The narrow issue is whether a billboard located 123.31 feet from the nearest edge of an interstate highway, but separated from the highway by a city street, is \u201cadjacent to\u201d the highway within the meaning of Code \u00a7 33.1-370.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Creative Displays of Norfolk, Ltd. (Creative), which owns and displays the billboard at issue, brought suit against the State Highway and Transportation Commissioner of Virginia (the Commissioner) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In its motion, Creative alleged that its billboard is not regulated by Code \u00a7 33.1-370 because the billboard is not \u201cadjacent to\u201d Interstate Highway 664. Following an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the trial court ruled in Creative\u2019s favor. Accordingly, the court enjoined the Commissioner from removing the billboard, and the Commissioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Creative\u2019s billboard is 12 feet by 25 feet and is located at the intersection of 39th Street and Acorn Avenue in the City of Newport News. The billboard is situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>ated on the south side of 39th Street and on the east side of Acorn Avenue. Thirty-ninth Street runs virtually parallel to Interstate 664 and lies between the billboard and the interstate. The billboard is 123.31 feet from the nearest edge of the right-of-way of the interstate and is visible from the main-traveled way of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\">Chapter 7 of Title 33.1 is entitled \u201cOutdoor Advertising in Sight of Public Highways.\u201d The General Assembly\u2019s policy, purpose, and intent respecting the regulation of outdoor advertising is set forth in Code \u00a7 33.1-351(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">In order to promote the safety, convenience and enjoyment of travel on and protection of the public investment in highways within this Commonwealth, to attract tourists and promote the prosperity, economic well-being and general welfare of the Commonwealth, and to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty or aesthetic features of the highways and <em>adjacent areas, </em>the General Assembly declares it to be the policy of this Commonwealth that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising in <em>areas adjacent to </em>the rights-of-way of the highways within this Commonwealth shall be regulated in accordance with the terms of this article and regulations promulgated by the State Highway and Transportation Commission pursuant thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">(Emphasis added.) Code \u00a7 33.1-378 provides that Code \u00a7\u00a7 33.1-351 through -378 \u201cshall be liberally construed with a view to the effective accomplishment of its purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Creative contends that its billboard is not regulated by Code \u00a7 33.1-370 because it is not \u201cadjacent to\u201d Interstate 664. This is so, Creative argues, because 39th Street lies between the billboard and the interstate. To support its contention, Creative points to the fact that in 1976 the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 33.1-370 by adding the words \u201cadjacent to.\u201d Acts 1976, c. 14. Creative asserts that the General Assembly would not have added the words if it had not \u201cmeant for them to have meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Although Code \u00a7 33.1-351 contains the definition of numerous words and phrases, it does not define \u201cadjacent.\u201d Thus, we must look to other sources for a definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>38 (5th ed. 1979) defines \u201cadjacent\u201d as \u201c[l]ying near or close to; sometimes, contiguous; neighboring. <em>Ad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>jacent </em>implies that the two objects are not widely separated, though they may not actually touch . . . while <em>adjoining </em>imports that they are so joined or united to each other that no third object intervenes.\u201d The \u201c \u2018natural and primary meaning of [adjacent] is, near to or neighboring. It is not inconsistent with the idea of something intervening.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Southgate, </em>149 Va. 683, 687, 140 S.E. 661, 662 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">The primary meaning of \u201ccontiguous,\u201d on the other hand, is \u201c \u2018in actual contact\u2019 or \u2018touching.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holston S. &amp; P. Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, Trustee, et al., </em>89 Va. 396, 398, 16 S.E. 274, 274 (1892). \u201cIt is not synonymous with \u2018adjacent,\u2019 although sometimes used in that sense, and <em>vice versa. </em>\u2018What is adjacent . . . may be separated by the intervention of some other object; what is contiguous must touch on one side.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Thus, although \u201cadjacent\u201d sometimes is used to mean \u201ccontiguous,\u201d this is not its primary meaning. We need not speculate why the General Assembly added to Code \u00a7 33.1-370 the words \u201cadjacent to.\u201d We are convinced, however, that if we were to give \u201cadjacent\u201d its secondary meaning and thereby reach the conclusion urged by Creative, we would fail to construe the outdoor advertising statute \u201cliberally . . . with a view to the effective accomplishment\u201d of the purposes and intent of the General Assembly as stated in Code \u00a7 33.1-351(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We conclude, therefore, that Creative\u2019s billboard is adjacent to Interstate 664 and is, therefore, regulated by Code \u00a7 33.1-370. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, vacate the injunction, and enter final judgment for the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
