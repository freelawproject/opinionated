He argues that the district court erred in increasing his base offense level by two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(3)(B) and assigning a base offense level of 20 pursuant to \u00a7 2Kl.l(a)(4)(B) because the pipe bomb found at his residence did not constitute a destructive device.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">We have determined that a pipe bomb is a destructive device under \u00a7 5845(f). <em>See United States v. Hunn, </em>344 Fed.Appx. 920, 921 (5th Cir.2009) (finding that homemade pipe bomb was a destructive device under \u00a7 5845(f)); <em>United States v. Charles, </em>883 F.2d 355, 357 (5th Cir.1989) (concluding that three pipe bombs were destructive devices under \u00a7 5845(f)). Thus, the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Rosa\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(3)(B) or in assigning a base offense level of 20 pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B). <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
