Goss argues, for the first time, that he was entitled to notice that he would receive a sentence above the advisory guideline range or, alternatively, to a continuance to prepare a response to the victim impact statements used to fashion his sentence. Goss also argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">The district court did not err, much less plainly err, in failing to give Goss notice of its decision to impose an above-guideline sentence or to <em>sua sponte </em>continue Goss\u2019s sentencing hearing. Goss was not entitled to notice that the district court intended to vary from the advisory guideline range. <em>See Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 713-14, 716, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2202-03, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). Although the district court used the word \u201cdepart\u201d to describe its discretionary authority to the victims who attended Goss\u2019s sentencing hearing and to explain that the sentence was atypical, the district court stated during the hearing and in its written statement of reasons that its sentencing decision was based on a variance from the advisory guideline range, not a departure under a provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009). The district court discussed the \u201cnature and circumstances of [Goss\u2019s] offense\u201d and his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d and then the district court explained that it was \u201cvarying from the advisory guideline range pursuant to the factors found at 18 USC Section 3553(a)\u201d because \u201cthe advisory guideline sentencing range [was] inadequate to address [either] the gravity of [Goss\u2019s] criminal conduct '... [or] the impact that [his] conduct ... had on the lives of victims in the community.\u201d And the district court was not required to <em>sua sponte </em>continue Goss\u2019s sentencing hearing to allow him investigate and respond to the victims\u2019 accounts of fraud. Goss had been forewarned of the import of the victim\u2019s statements in the presentence investigation report. The report stated that 25 individuals and 9 couples had submitted victim impact statements and that most of Goss\u2019s victims had been elderly and \u201ctrusted him\u201d because they had \u201cmet Goss at church, through Senior Citizen groups[,] ... had known him since he was a ehild[,]\u201d and, in some cases, \u201chad purchased insurance from him.\u201d Goss declined to cross-examine any of the victims during his sentencing hearing, and he did not request a continuance to respond to their statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Goss to 144 months of imprisonment. The district court varied upward from the advisory guideline range of 63 to 78 months based on the \u201cvictim statements and ... the quarterly reports ... that Mr. Goss sent to his investors,\u201d which revealed that Goss used a \u201cvery elaborate cover-up\u201d in the course of defrauding 41 individuals and 10 couples of almost $2 million over the course of nine years. In the light of these circumstances, the district court reasonably determined that a sentence above the recommended range was necessary to address the nature and circumstances of Goss\u2019s offense, his history and characteristics, and the seriousness of his offense and to promote respect for the law, impose a just punishment, deter similar future crimes, and protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Goss\u2019s sentence, which is well below the maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We AFFIRM Goss\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
