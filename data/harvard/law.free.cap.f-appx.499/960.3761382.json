For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Lockhart\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Lockhart was arrested after he sold eight grams of crack cocaine to a confidential source. The PSI classified Lockhart as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, due to him having at least two qualifying prior convictions, and, thus, he had an enhanced offense level of 34. After a 3-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), he had a total offense level of 31, a criminal history category of VI, and an applicable guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The PSI stated that, between 1989 and 1990, Lockhart was convicted of petit theft, battery, aggravated battery, three counts of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, improper exhibition of a weapon or firearm, possession of a firearm by a convicted felony, and possession of cocaine and cannabis. In 2000, he was convicted of fleeing and attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, reckless driving, criminal mischief, and trespass to the land of another. Other than various convictions for traffic offenses, his only other conviction until the instant offense occurred in 2003, for delivery of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Before sentencing, Lockhart requested a downward variance from the applicable guideline range. Specifically, he requested a sentence within the range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the guideline range that would have applied had he not been classified as a career offender. He argued that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the variance, noting that his offense was relatively minor and that the seriousness of his misbehavior had decreased over the past 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">At sentencing, the government objected to Lockhart\u2019s request for a downward variance because Lockhart\u2019s criminal history was violent, involved drug activity, and was extensive. Lockhart responded that his criminal history was \u201cproblematic,\u201d but most of-his violent history occurred when he was 18 or 19 years of age. Further, his last drug offense occurred in 2003. Lock-hart also had his daughter and his girlfriend provide statements concerning the positive role he played in their lives and the lives of his children. Lockhart, speaking on his own behalf, apologized for committing his offense and requested leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">In considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors, the district court stated that, although drug trafficking .was a serious problem in the United States, Lockhart\u2019s offense was minor, as it involved eight grams of crack cocaine. The district court had concerns about the severity of the enhancement in light of the circumstances of Lockhart\u2019s criminal history, which demonstrated that the most serious offenses occurred 20 years before the instant offense. The court stated that it was uncertain whether anything it did would deter the drug trade, but found that the need-to-deter factor, in this case, was not a mitigating factor. The court further stated that it was difficult to determine what sentence would promote respect for the law and just punishment in light of the fact that the career offender guideline applied. The court then imposed a sentence of 96 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the statutory factors, finding that the sentence was more than adequate and sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">On appeal, Lockhart argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. According to Lockhart, his offense of conviction was a minor, non-violent drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>crime. Further, his criminal history reflected that most of his previous convictions were from over 20 years ago. Thus, Lockhart contends that the career offender guideline should have had no role in the district court\u2019s analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court should have imposed a sentence within the guideline range that would have applied had he not been classified as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A district court\u2019s sentence need not be the most appropriate one, but rather need only be a reasonable one. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>bane). We may set aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable based on the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">In reviewing a sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, we examine the totality of the circumstances, which includes an inquiry into whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence in question. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2008). The district court must impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Where a defendant\u2019s criminal record shows that the defendant should be classified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, his offense level is driven by the statutory maximum penalty for the offense, rather than the quantity of drugs he was trafficking. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Yet, the Guidelines sentence range yielded pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1 is still advisory. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-56 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that the district court had applied the career offender guideline and that the resulting guideline range was advisory, and affirming the imposition of a sentence outside of the advisory guideline range, where the court had not imposed the sentence solely because of a disagreement with the Guidelines, but rather gave specific, valid reasons for its sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Lockhart has not shown that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. Lockhart\u2019s sentence of 96 months\u2019 imprisonment was well below the applicable guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The record demonstrates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence, and there is nothing in the record demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable based on those factors. Although the district court recognized several reasons for varying from the applicable guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, Lockhart still had a significant criminal history, involving previous drug convictions, aggravated assault on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>law enforcement officer, and aggravated battery. The court found that the sentence imposed was certainly sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory objectives, and Lockhart has not shown otherwise. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s decision to not sentence Lockhart within the guideline range that would apply in the absence of the career offender guideline was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Lockhart\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
