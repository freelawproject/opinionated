Monyenye did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision on her appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her motion to continue removal proceedings pending an appeal of the revocation of an 1-130 petition filed on her behalf. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-23\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the [BIA] ....\u201d\u00a7 1003.2(a). This court reviews the denial of a motion to reconsider under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-24\">Monyenye contends that the BIA made an error of fact in relying on the IJ\u2019s finding of \u201cfaulty facts\u201d regarding the reason the second 1-130 petition was revoked. She contends that the 1-130 petition was revoked because Moore did not respond to the notice of intent to revoke and not because of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 (USCIS) concerns about the bona fides of her marriage, as found by the IJ. This argument is belied by the record, and thus Monyenye failed to demonstrate any factual error by the BIA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-25\">She contends that the BIA failed to follow its precedential decisions regarding fraudulent marriages issued in <em>Matter of Agdinaoay, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 545, 547 (BIA 1978), and <em>Matter of Tawfik, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 166, 167 (BIA 1990). However, neither case concerned the issue involved in Monyenye\u2019s case \u2014 whether the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance of removal proceedings pending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>resolution of an appeal from the revocation of an 1-130 petition. Because the cases are inapplicable, Monyenye has not shown that the BIA erred by failing to follow <em>Agdinaoay </em>and <em>Tawfik </em>in deciding her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Monyenye asserts that the BIA misapplied <em>Matter of Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 785 (BIA 2009), in deciding her appeal and \u201cfailed, to consider that the fact that the issue of whether the underlying visa petition is prima facie approvable is not applicable to this case.\u201d Monyenye did not. cite to pertinent authority to support her assertion of legal error by the BIA in its prior decision, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), and has not done so in her petition for review. Moreover, the revocation of the second 1-130 petition was \u201ceffective as of the date of [its] approval,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1155, which was April 17, 2007. Thus, when Monyenye filed her application for adjustment of status in July 2007, and when she moved for a continuance in July 2009, she did not have a pending 1-130 petition, making her statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">As she did in her motion for reconsideration, Monyenye asserts that the procedural requirement that an appeal of the revocation of an 1-130 petition be filed with the USCIS, and not directly with the BIA, violated her right to due process. However, Monyenye cited no authority in her motion or in her petition for review for the proposition that she has either a freestanding substantive due process right or a procedural due process right to the adjudication of the appeal of the revocation of the 1-130 petition filed by her citizen-husband. Monyenye has shown no abuse of discretion in the'BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005). The petition for review is denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">For the first time in her petition for review, Monyenye asserts that the BIA and IJ legally erred by looking beyond the reasons for revocation stated in the notice of revocation to the reasons stated in the notice of intent to revoke. She asserts, also for the first time in her petition for review, that the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion for a continuance violated her right to due process. Because Monyenye failed to exhaust these issues by presenting them to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to address them. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d-314, 321 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004). The petition for review is dismissed in part as to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
