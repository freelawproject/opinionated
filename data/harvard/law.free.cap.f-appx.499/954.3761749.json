After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Stiggers pleaded guilty in 2005 to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and 841(b)(1)(C). As part of his plea agreement, Stiggers conceded he was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1, which meant his adjusted offense level was 32 and his criminal history category was VI. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Stiggers\u2019s guideline range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced him to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">On October 26, 2011, Stiggers filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 750 to the guidelines, which lowered the base level for crack-cocaine offenses. The district court denied the motion, finding that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentence because Stiggers was sentenced as a career offender. This is Stiggers\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence only where the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Stiggers argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750, which lowered the base level for crack-cocaine offenses. But he was not sentenced under the guidelines for crack-cocaine offenses. Rather, he was sentenced under \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender. The retroactive amendments did not change his guideline range, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) thus does not authorize a sentence reduction. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Stiggers also asserts that the district court\u2019s failure to reduce his sentence is contrary to Congress\u2019s intent in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to reduce the sentencing disparity between powder and crack-cocaine offenders. But the district court\u2019s discretion in considering a sentence reduction is constrained by \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009). As discussed above, here the district court lacked the authority to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Stiggers next argues that the exclusion of career offenders from the retroactive amendments violates his due process and equal protection rights. Like Stiggers\u2019s other arguments, this is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that sentencing a person as a career offender \u201cbears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">Finally, Stiggers contends that \u00a7 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which prevents a district court from reducing a sentence unless the underlying guideline range is reduced, is invalid because it is arbitrary and capricious, violates the notice and comment provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, and exceeds the Commission\u2019s authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). We need not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>these arguments, however, because the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) forecloses a sentence reduction when the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by subsequent guidelines amendments, regardless of whether \u00a7 1B1.10 is valid. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
