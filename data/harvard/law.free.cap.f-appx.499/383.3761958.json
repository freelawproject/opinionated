Luna contends: the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it fails to reflect, his cultural assimilation to the United States, his benign motives for returning to the United States, the harsh consequences of being an alien in prison, and the remoteness of his criminal history; his sentence reflects an unwarranted sentencing disparity because he could not participate in a fast-track program; and it is not presumptively reasonable because the Guideline on which it was based, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is unsupported by empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly-preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United, </em>States, 552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The district court considered and rejected Luna\u2019s reasons for a more lenient sentence. It determined a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate, especially in the light of Luna\u2019s criminal history. Luna seeks to have our court re-weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. But the fact that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district- court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Obviously, \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, Luna has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>He also has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>E.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">Luna recognizes his contentions regarding fast-track disparities are foreclosed in this circuit, <em>see id. </em>at 563 n. 4, as are those regarding the lack of empirical data concerning Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). He raises them here only to preserve them for possible future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
