(\u201cContinental\u201d). We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">Upon the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court determined that: (1) Lopez could not recover under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) Lopez could not recover under the Americans with Disabilities Act because he failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that (a) he was disabled, and (b) Continental\u2019s reason for his termination was pretextual; and (3) Lopez could not recover for breach of contract because he was an at-will employee. For these reasons, it granted summary judgment on all of Lopez\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-24\">Although we \u201cliberally construe\u201d the filings of <em>pro se </em>litigants and \u201capply less stringent standards to parties proceeding <em>pro se </em>than to parties represented by counsel,\u201d <em>pro se </em>appellants \u201cmust still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Rule 28.\u201d <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). The appellant\u2019s brief must include an argument that contains his \u201ccontentions and reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which appellant relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Arguments not adequately argued in the body of the brief are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). This court may, however, consider a noncompliant brief when doing so does not prejudice the opposing party. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Price v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Lopez\u2019s generally incoherent appellate brief does not comply with Rule 28; nevertheless, Continental addresses the relevant issues on appeal. Thus, we find no prejudice and perform a <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s summary judgment. <em>See Holt v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>627 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.2010) (noting that \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>\u201d). After consideration of the record on appeal, we agree with the district court that Lopez fails to present a genuine issue of material fact on all of his claims. For essentially the reasons stated by the district court, the summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
