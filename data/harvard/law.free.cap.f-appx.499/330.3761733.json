Ruiz was sentenced below the guidelines range of imprisonment to 30 months and to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-22\">Ruiz argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii) because the Oklahoma statute under which he was convicted did not except possessing an antique weapon. Ruiz is correct that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>because he did not raise this argument in the district court, it is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497 (5th Cir.2012). Ruiz fails to cite any case by this court or any other circuit deciding whether an offense under Oklahoma Statutes, title 21, \u00a7 1289.18(A), constituted a \u201cfirearms offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii) on the basis that it did not except antique weapons. Thus, he fails to demonstrate clear or obvious error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>327 F.3d 410, 415 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Ruiz\u2019s argument that the enhancement was improper under a clear error analysis because 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) must be read to include the definitions of a firearm under \u00a7 5845(d) and (f) fails. This court uses a categorical approach to classify his conviction for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(iii). <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.2005). Ruiz fails to show that the district court clearly erred because the Oklahoma statute under which he was convicted is broader than the generic definition of a firearm offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.(v)(II)); <em>Diaz-Diaz, </em>327 F.3d at 414; <em>cf. </em>\u00a7 5845(a); Okla. Stat. tit. 21 \u00a7 1289.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Ruiz argues that the district court erred in failing to consider his cultural assimilation when it sentenced him. The substantive reasonableness of Ruiz\u2019s sentence is reviewed for plain error because he failed to object after his sentence was imposed. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Ruiz fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded his below-guidelines sentence and, concomitantly, to show that the district court plainly erred when it did not sentence him below the guidelines range based on cultural assimilation. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Ruiz\u2019s argument that a term of supervised release was not warranted is also reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327-28 (5th Cir.2012). Contrary to Ruiz\u2019s suggestion, the district court was not required to give notice of an intent to depart upward regarding supervised release. <em>See id. </em>at 329. Moreover, insofar as the district court articulated why it was not following \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s hortatory language and because it addressed the need to deter Ruiz, the district court\u2019s term of supervised release accorded with \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 5D1.1(c) &amp; comment, (n.5); <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 329-30. Thus, Ruiz fails to satisfy his burden under plain error review. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
