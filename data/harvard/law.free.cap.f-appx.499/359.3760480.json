Navarrete argues that his sentence violates the Fifth and Eighth Amendments of the Constitution and is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that (1) his sentence is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of his crime of conviction, in violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; (2) enhancing his sentence based on a previous drug trafficking offense resulted in an unwarranted sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing disparity in violation of the Equal Protection Clause; and (3) the district court did not consider his particular circumstances, such as his benign motive for illegally reentering the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Ordinarily, we review constitutional claims de novo. <em>United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 377 (5th Cir.2000). However, because Navarrete did not raise any constitutional objections to his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d 878, 886 (5th Cir.2000). Likewise, because Navarrete failed to object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Navarrete\u2019s assertion that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is without merit. The Eighth Amendment prohibits a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime for which it is imposed. <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 288, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983). When evaluating an Eighth Amendment proportionality challenge, we make a threshold comparison between the gravity of the charged offense and the severity of the sentence. <em>McGruder v. Puckett, </em>954 F.2d 313, 315-16 (5th Cir.1992). In non-capital cases, successful challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences are \u201cexceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 272, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In the instant case, Navarrete\u2019s 70-month prison sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the severity of his illegal reentry crime when measured against the benchmark in <em>Rummel, </em>445 U.S. at 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133. Additionally, Na-varrete\u2019s sentence is within the properly calculated guidelines range, which is a \u201cconvincing objective indicator of proportionality.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (rejecting an Eighth Amendment challenge to a 100-month within-guidelines sentence imposed for attempted illegal reentry). Accordingly, Navarrete cannot demonstrate plain error. <em>See Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Equally without merit is Navarrete\u2019s claim that his sentence violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. We have previously concluded that the \u201cguidelines were devised to and do treat all\u201d similarly-situated defendants equally. <em>Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d at 1134. Given that Navarrete\u2019s guidelines range was calculated in the same manner as that of any other illegal reentry defendant who had previously been convicted of a drug trafficking crime, he cannot demonstrate plain error. <em>See Ferguson, </em>211 F.3d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">When reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we generally will infer that the district court considered the sentencing factors set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The record reflects that the district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Navarrete\u2019s arguments for mitigating his sentence but implicitly overruled those arguments and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Navarrete\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>His sentence, which is at the bottom of the guidelines range, is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gu-tierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 8553(a) factors are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Navarrete has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by sentencing him to a within-guidelines 70-month prison term. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
