In Sundale\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings, FACE sought a declaratory judgment regarding the extent, validity and priority of the claims it had that stemmed from secured loans it had made to Sundale; in response, Sun-dale asserted various affirmative defenses and filed counterclaims against FACE, including a claim of recoupment of more than \u25a0 three million dollars in payments Sundale had made to FACE concerning the secured loans. In this appeal, Sundale argues that: (1) the district court erred in concluding that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over Sundale\u2019s counterclaims; (2) the district court\u2019s review of the bankruptcy proceedings did not cure the bankruptcy court\u2019s unconstitutional exercise of jurisdiction; and (3) the bankruptcy court misapplied Florida law in ruling on the merits. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Adventure Outdoors, Inc. v. Bloomberg, </em>552 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2008). We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to affirm the bankruptcy court <em>de novo, </em>which allows us to assess the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment anew, employing the same standard of review the district court itself used.\u201d <em>In re Globe Mfg. Corp., </em>567 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2009). The bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Factual findings are clearly erroneous if \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Jones v. Childers, </em>18 F.3d 899, 904 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted). \u201cConclusions of law, whether from the bankruptcy court or the district court, are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d In re Jennings, </em>670 F.3d 1329, 1332 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted). Mixed questions of law and fact are also reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>de novo. In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1295 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The relevant facts are these. Phillip Scutieri, Jr. (\u201cMr. Scutieri\u201d) is the principal of both Sundale and KHS. Raymond G. Chambers (\u201cMr. Chambers\u201d), a successful businessman involved in leveraged buyouts in the 1980s, had a very close personal and professional relationship with the Scutieri family for over forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">On November 20, 1997, Mr. Scutieri\u2019s mother, Delphine Scutieri (\u201cMrs. Scuti-eri\u201d), advised her son that she believed that Mr. Chambers had taken certain assets from her husband\u2019s estate to begin Chambers\u2019s leveraged buyout business. After Mrs. Scutieri\u2019s suspicions were relayed to Mr. Chambers, Mr. Chambers sent a letter to Mrs. Scutieri in which he promised to \u201cshare everything\u201d with Mrs. Scutieri. Over the next five months, representatives from the two parties attempted to resolve the dispute between them, and eventually Mr. Scutieri relayed that the Scutieris would require $420,000,000 to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Thereafter, Mrs. Scutieri apparently asked Mr. Chambers to give $10 million to her son to develop a nine-acre tract of land in Miami, Florida owned by Sundale (the \u201cSundale Property\u201d), with the remaining amount due (approximately $410,000,000) to be worked out. According to Mr. Chambers, he said he would not loan the $10,000,000, but that he would tell his \u201cfinancial advisors that they, (A), help [Mr. Scutieri] get a conventional first mortgage loan on the [Sundale Property] and, (B), if that loan fell short of the $10,000,000, that [Chambers] would recommend to them that [Chambers\u2019s] entities provide up to $2 million in a subordinated second mortgage loan.\u201d A witness to a meeting between the parties testified otherwise, attesting that Mr. Chambers promised to give $10,000,000 as an \u201cinitial payment of getting the monies back to [Mrs. Scutieri].\u201d Shortly after this meeting, Mr. Chambers\u2019s representatives created FACE, the sole purpose of which was to provide funding for Mr. Scutieri\u2019s Sundale project.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Between July 30, 1999, and March 20, 2000, FACE (and/or its members) loaned Sundale a total of $7,300,000, through various promissory notes, personal guarantees, and mortgage and security agreements. On September 7, 2001, Sundale closed a $12,000,000 loan with Ocean Bank for the Sundale project (the \u201cOcean Bank Loan\u201d). The terms of the agreement provided for FACE\u2019S loans to be reduced to $3,250,000, and for FACE to subordinate its lien to the lien of Ocean Bank with respect to the remaining indebtedness. Sundale was obligated to make quarterly interest payments until November 29, 2002, and then monthly payments thereafter. Sundale made all interest payments due to FACE through May 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">On December 11, 2007, both Ocean Bank and FACE sent default notices to Sundale. The next day, Sundale filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and KHS did the same on January 30, 2008. On May 1, 2008, FACE initiated this adversary proceeding by filing a two-count complaint seeking a determination of the extent, validity, and priority of its asserted lien on the Sundale Property. On November 17, 2008, Sun-dale and KHS responded by denying FACE\u2019S allegations and asserting a number of affirmative defenses. On July 30, 2009, Sundale and KHS filed a Second Amended Answer, for the first time asserting two counterclaims, one seeking a declaration that FACE\u2019S liens were not valid and enforceable and one for recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Both Sundale\u2019s affirmative defenses and counterclaims relied upon the same factual and legal bases, namely that FACE\u2019S hen was invalid and unenforceable because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>funds advanced by FACE were intended to be a disguised loan as an initial payment by Mr. Chambers to the Seutieri family as partial payment of the monies Mr. Chambers wrongfully diverted from the estate of Mr. Scutieri\u2019s father. The Bankruptcy Court ultimately ruled in favor of FACE, finding that FACE \u201coverwhelmingly established a prima facie case that it holds a valid, perfected lien against the Sundale Property and the Trustee Property. Conversely, the Defendants failed to meet their burden of proof in every aspect with regard to their affirmative defenses and their counterclaims.\u201d The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination of the extent, validity and priority of FACE\u2019S claims against Sundale, and it also held&amp;emdash;following the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Stern v. Marshall, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2594, 180 L.Ed.2d 475 (2011)-that the bankruptcy court had the authority to rule on these claims. The district court noted, in the alternative, that if the bankruptcy court had exceeded its authority to enter a final judgment, it was treating the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as a report and recommendation, which the district court adopted and ratified. This timely appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">First, we are unpersuaded by Sun-dale\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter final judgment on its counterclaims. Congress has divided bankruptcy proceedings into three categories: (1) those that arise under title 11; (2) those that arise in a title 11 case; and (3) those that are related to a case under title 11. <em>Stern, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2603 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(a)). \u201cDistrict courts may refer any or all such proceedings to the bankruptcy judges of their district,\u201d and bankruptcy courts may \u201center final judgments in \u2018all core proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in a ease under title 11.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting \u00a7 157(a), (b)(1)). Congress has chosen 16 specific types of proceedings that are considered to be \u201ccore proceedings\u201d in which bankruptcy courts are statutorily authorized to render final judgments. <em>See id. </em>(citing \u00a7 157(b)(l)-(2)). Section 157(b)(2)(C) defines \u201ccounterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate\u201d to be one of these \u201ccore proceedings.\u201d \u201cParties may appeal final judgments of a bankruptcy court in core proceedings to the district court, which reviews them under traditional appellate standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2603-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\"><em>Stem </em>involved a tortious interference counterclaim, arising under state common law, which the bankruptcy court had determined to be a \u201ccore proceeding\u201d as defined by \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C). <em>See id. </em>at 2601-02. After determining it had jurisdiction over the matter, the bankruptcy court rendered a final judgment on the state law counterclaim. <em>See id. </em>at 2601. The Supreme Court determined that the bankruptcy court had the statutory authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b) to issue a final judgment on the state law counterclaim, but that it was a violation of Article III of the United States Constitution for Congress to confer that authority upon the bankruptcy court. <em>See id. </em>The Supreme Court ultimately held that \u201c[t]he Bankruptcy Court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor\u2019s proof of claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2620. The Supreme Court also made clear that it did not intend its decision in <em>Stem </em>to have broad implications: \u201cWe do not think the removal of counterclaims such as [the debtor\u2019s] from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the current statute; we agree with the United States that the question presented here is a \u2018narrow\u2019 one.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>As the district court explained, <em>Stem </em>is inapplicable here. That case involved a tortious interference counterclaim that was a \u201cstate law action independent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling on the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2611. The complaint in <em>Stem </em>was filed by a creditor seeking a declaration that his defamation claim was not dischargeable in the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 2601. The \u201cproof of claim\u201d at issue was \u201cfor the defamation action, meaning that [the creditor] sought to recover damages for [the claim] from [the] bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The debtor \u201cresponded to [the creditor]\u2019s initial complaint by asserting truth as a defense to the alleged defamation and by filing a counterclaim for tortious interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That counterclaim alleged that the creditor \u201chad wrongfully prevented [the debtor\u2019s husband] from taking the legal steps necessary to provide [the debt- or] with half his property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The counterclaim for tortious interference was the claim deemed by the Supreme Court to be a \u201cstate law action independent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling on the creditor\u2019s proof of claim in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2611.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">Here, the state law counterclaim Sun-dale travels on in its brief is recoupment\u2014 and as the Florida state courts have explained, recoupment is \u201ca purely defensive matter springing from the same transaction as the plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action, which is available only to reduce or satisfy a plaintiffs\u2019 claim.... A recoupment defense is analogous to a compulsory counterclaim, in that both \u2018spring\u2019 from the same transaction as the plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d <em>Kellogg v. Fowler, White, Burnett, Hurley, Banick &amp; Strickroot, P.A., </em>807 So.2d 669, 670 n. 2 (Fla.4th Dist.Ct.App.2001) (citing <em>Metropolitan Cas. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Walker, </em>151 Fla. 314, 9 So.2d 361, 362 (1942)). Sundale argues to us that FACE\u2019S proof of claim hinged on the money that Sundale <em>had not </em>paid FACE, whereas its recoupment counterclaim hinged on the money that Sundale <em>had </em>paid to FACE. Sundale thus argues that resolving the proof of claim would not resolve its counterclaim. This distinction is without merit. Indeed, the crux of Sun-dale\u2019s case theory is that <em>none </em>of the money FACE transferred to Sundale was ever intended to be a loan, but rather the first of many payments Mr. Chambers was to make to the Scutieri family to satisfy a $420,000,000 debt. Sundale relied on this theory to advance numerous affirmative defenses against FACE\u2019S proof of claim and as the premise for its recoupment (and declaratory judgment) counterclaims. All of the affirmative defenses and the counterclaims thus have one common thread\u2014 whether both the money FACE transferred to Sundale <em>and </em>the money that Sundale later transferred back to FACE was premised on a loan .by FACE (FACE\u2019S version) <em>or </em>a repayment by FACE (Sundale\u2019s version). As a result, a rejection of Sundale\u2019s version of the events as defenses to FACE\u2019S claims also undermines Sundale\u2019s counterclaims. Similarly, a finding in favor of Sundale on its defenses to FACE\u2019S claims would necessarily result in a favorable ruling for Sundale on its counterclaims. Either way, a resolution of the proof of claim necessarily resolves the recoupment and declaratory judgment counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Sundale also seems to suggest that under <em>Stem, </em>a bankruptcy court only has jurisdiction to enter final judgment on federal bankruptcy law claims \u2014 and no state law claims. However, the Supreme Court made no such distinction. Under the clear language of the decision, the Supreme Court held that bankruptcy courts lack \u201cthe constitutional authority to enter a final judgment on a state law counterclaim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number><em>that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor\u2019s proof of claim.\u201d </em>131 S.Ct. at 2620 (emphasis added). Because the underlined phrase is included, it must follow that a bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction to enter final judgment on state law counterclaims that are necessarily resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor\u2019s proof of claim. <em>See also id. </em>at 2618 (bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enter final judgment exists if \u201cthe action at issue stems from the bankruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In short, because Sundale\u2019s counterclaims are necessarily resolved by resolution of FACE\u2019S proof of claim, the self-declared narrow holding in <em>Stem </em>is distinguishable from the facts before us. Therefore, we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter a final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We also find no merit to Sundale\u2019s argument that the bankruptcy court erred in applying Florida law. As for Sundale\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy court misinterpreted Florida law by holding that Sundale could not have reasonably relied on FACE\u2019S misrepresentations because they were made in an adversarial context, the lower court relied on binding Eleventh Circuit case law, in the Florida law context, which concluded that \u201cplaintiffs were unjustified in relying on representations made by the defendants\u201d since, among other things, \u201cthe parties had been in an adversarial relationship since well before the execution of the Agreement.\u201d <em>Mergens v. Dreyfoos, </em>166 F.3d 1114, 1118 (11th Cir.1999). Moreover, all of the Florida state cases Sundale cites seem to rest on the principle that one party had no notice that the other party could not be believed. <em>See, e.g., Greene v. Kolpac Builders, Inc., </em>549 So.2d 1150, 1152 (Fla.3d App.Dist.1989) (allowing a misrepresentation claim \u201c[ajbsent circumstances which would have put Greene on notice that Kolpak\u2019s word could not be believed\u201d); <em>Schlapper v. Maurer, </em>687 So.2d 982, 984 (Fla.5th App.Dist.1997) (a lawyer\u2019s \u201cprofessional responsibility owed to the court and the opposing parties imposed on him an obligation not to lie about or misrepresent facts critical to the case\u201d (emphasis removed)). Given the history of the parties in this case, it cannot be said that Sundale had no notice of Mr. Chambers\u2019s dealings with them. Thus, the lower court did not misapply the Florida law of misrepresentation. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">As for Sundale\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy court\u2019s analysis of duress improperly relied on its speculative finding that Sundale could have obtained funds by mortgaging the undeveloped adjacent property, the bankruptcy court relied on various other factors in reaching the conclusion that Sundale was not under financial duress. Moreover, the bankruptcy court relied on record evidence to find that the undeveloped adjacent property was unencumbered, and Sundale fails to offer anything more than speculation to suggest that it could not have obtained a mortgage on that property at the time of the alleged duress as it did a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">As for Sundale\u2019s claim that the'bankruptcy court erred in finding that the debtors could not prove misrepresentations relating to the 1999 transactions based on the execution of the 2001 documents, as well as its claim that the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that FACE was entitled to seek subordination was circular, Sun-dale cites no case law or legal argument for these issues in his brief and therefore has waived them. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (providing that an appellant\u2019s brief must set forth his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d); <em>Continental Tech. Servs., Inc. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>927 F.2d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.1991). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>ther, because there was no error in the rulings on duress and misrepresentation, these arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Finally, Sundale claims that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that the notes payable to FACE and mortgages in FACE\u2019S favor were enforceable, because, it says, Sundale received no consideration from FACE. As an initial matter, Sundale does not dispute that FACE\u2019S subordination in 2001 of its security interest in the Sundale property to Ocean Bank\u2019s security interest constituted consideration. Sundale argues, nonetheless, that FACE\u2019S earlier \u201cloans\u201d to Sundale did not constitute consideration because the money came from Mr. Chambers\u2019s trusts or other sources, rather than from FACE itself. However, Sundale admits that some of these earlier transfers were in fact made in FACE\u2019S name, <em>see </em>Blue Br. at 5, and cites nothing for the proposition that these transfers could not be considered valid consideration from FACE.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
