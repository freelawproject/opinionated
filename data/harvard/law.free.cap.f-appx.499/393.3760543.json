The district court granted summary judgment to defendants. For the reasons outlined below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">Medicare is a federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled patients. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>Part A of the Medicare statute covers the costs of hospital stays, while Part B covers outpatient care. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395c \u2014 1395i; 1395j \u2014 1395w-5. Part E provides, among other things, that the federal government will reimburse hospitals for costs incurred in treating Medicare patients. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww. The statute also allows for \u201can additional payment\u201d for hospitals that serve \u201ca significantly disproportionate number of low-income patients.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(i). Whether a hospital qualifies for the extra payment- and the amount of that payment-is determined by calculating the hospital\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate patient percentage.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(v)-(vi). That percentage is the sum of two fractions, expressed as percentages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">(I) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of such hospital\u2019s patient days for such period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchap-ter and were entitled to supplementary security income benefits (excluding any State supplementation) under subchap-ter XVI of this chapter, and the denominator of which is the number of such hospital\u2019s patient days for such fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">(II) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of the hospital\u2019s patient days for such period which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, but who were not entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital\u2019s patient days for such period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">In determining a hospital\u2019s disproportionate patient percentage, therefore, the statute includes patients who are entitled to Medicare Part A <em>and </em>supplemental security income (SSI) benefits,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as patients who are eligible for Medicaid, but not for Medicare Part A. The plain meaning of the statute does not include patients who qualify for Medicare Part A and Medicaid, but do not qualify for SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Plaintiffs, four acute-care hospitals (\u201chospitals\u201d), nonetheless included these patients in their cost reports for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. Their fiscal intermediary<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> removed these patient days from the calculations. The hospitals appealed that decision to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a). The Board found that the plain language statute did not allow for the inclusion of non-SSI qualifying Medicare patients in the disproportionate patient percentage calculation. The Board found that it was without the authority to decide the question of whether a literal reading of the statute was legally valid, and granted the hospitals\u2019 request for expedited judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">The hospitals filed this action in the district court on January 14, 2011, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>judgment; the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on June 18, 2012.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the Supreme Court\u2019s two-step test for judicial review of agency interpretation, the district court found that as Congress had \u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u201d the court was bound by its \u201cunambiguously expressed intent,\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 887, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), that only Medicare Part A patients covered by SSI are included in the disproportionate patient percentage. The district court further found that excluding patients not covered by SSI did not yield a result \u201cso bizarre that Congress could not have intended\u201d it. <em>See Stiles v. GTE Sw. Inc., </em>128 F.3d 904, 907 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Duffy v. Leading Edge Products, Inc., </em>44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1995), \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the record reflects that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), later renumbered as 56(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s rubric in <em>Chevron, </em>\u201c[i]f Congress \u2018has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u2019 we \u2018must give effect to [its] unambiguously expressed intent.\u2019\u201d <em>Texas Clinical Labs, Inc. v. Sebelius, </em>612 F.3d 771, 775 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778). Only if the statute is \u201csilent or ambiguous\u201d does a court proceed to consider the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">The hospitals concede that non-SSI qualifying Medicare patients are excluded from \u201cthe payment formula as enacted,\u201d but argue that excluding these patients runs contrary to legislative history and intent. If \u201cthe intent of Congress is clear and unambiguously expressed by the statutory language at issue,\u201d that is \u201cthe end of [the court\u2019s] analysis.\u201d <em>Zuni Public School Dist. No. 89 v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>550 U.S. 81, 93, 127 S.Ct. 1534, 167 L.Ed.2d 449 (2007). \u201cCourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\u201d <em>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., </em>534 U.S. 438, 461-62, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The hospitals argue that even clearly expressed statutory language is not conclusive where there is \u201ca clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>507 U.S. 170, 177, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993). We agree with the district court, however, that the hospitals have not shown such a clearly expressed intent here. The hospitals cite cases noting that Congress intended the Medicare and Medicaid fractions to reimburse hospitals for the care of \u201clow income\u201d patients. <em>See Legacy Emanuel Hosp. and Health Ctr. v. Shalala, </em>97 F.3d 1261, 1265 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Cabell Huntington Hosp., Inc. v. Shalala, </em>101 F.3d 984, 985-86 (4th Cir.1996); <em>Jewish Hosp., Inc. v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>19 F.3d 270, 275 (6th Cir.1994). But the statute\u2019s plain language indicates that Congress chose SSI eligibility, rather than Medicaid eligibility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>as the income proxy for the Medicare fraction. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I). <em>See also North Broward Hosp. Dist. v. Shalala, </em>172 F.3d 90, 92 (D.C.Cir.1999) (\u201cHospitals typically qualify for an adjustment by showing that they serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients based on the proportion of inpatient days attributable to Medicaid patients and to Medicare patients qualifying for [SSI] ben-efitsSSI benefits are conditioned in part on an individual recipient\u2019s income, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a), and SSI recipients are defined as \u201ccategorically needy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1382(a)(10)(A)(i)(II).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The hospitals argue that the statute\u2019s legislative history indicates that eligibility for Medicaid, not for SSI, was intended as the income proxy for the Medicare statute. They cite to legislative history for the House of Representatives\u2019 version of the bill, which used Medicaid as the income proxy for the purpose of calculating disproportionate patient percentages. H.R.Rep. No. 99-241, pt. 1, at 16 (1985). But the conference agreement adopted the House bill with \u201cmodifications,\u201d which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">The percentage of low income patients will be defined as the total number of in inpatient days attributable to Federal Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries divided by the total number of medicare patient days, plus the number of medicaid patient days divided by total patient days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-453, at 461 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The hospitals argue that the phrase \u201cmedicaid patient days\u201d indicates that Congress intended for all Medicaid patient days, not just those for non-Medicare qualifying patients, to be included in the calculation. But the conference report language appears to be a summary of the calculation rather than an exact explanation: as well as failing to specify that the Medicaid fraction includes only non-Medicare patients, the agreement also fails to specify that the Medicare fraction includes only Medicare-eligible SSI beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>In light of the clear statutory language, we do not assume that these omissions reveal an intent to change the scope of the calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Finally, the hospitals argue that the statute as written \u201cdefies rationality ... by creating] an outcome so contrary to perceived social values that Congress could not have intended it.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>594 F.3d 883, 891 (D.C.Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Landstar Express Am., Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Fed. Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>569 F.3d 493, 498-99 (D.C.Cir.2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The hospitals note that all persons who qualify for Medicaid are low-income, even though they may not qualify for SSI. The hospitals question why a person who qualifies for Medicaid is factored into the disproportionate patient percentage at the age of 64, but is no longer included when she turns 65 and qualifies for Medicare. Like the district court, we are sympathetic to the hospitals\u2019 argument that this class of patients should be included in the disproportionate share calculation. However, we do not find that using SSI rather than Medicaid as an income proxy for Medicare patients is such a \u201cbizarre\u201d result that Congress could not have intended it. <em>Stiles v. GTE Sw. Inc., </em>128 F.3d 904, 907 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also Johnson v. Sawyer, </em>120 F.3d 1307, 1319 (5th Cir.1997) (distinguishing between an \u201cabsurd\u201d statutory result, inconsistent with other provisions of the statute or with legislative history, and a result that is \u201csimply personally disagreeable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

The district court dismissed Donald Ber-wick from the case on Defendants\u2019 motion, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1877(a)(2). Plaintiffs did not object to Berwick's dismissal and do not appeal it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-7\">. The two administrative decisions cited by the hospitals are also unconvincing. In <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital-Milwaukee v. BCBSA/National Government Services, </em>the Board explained the two fractions as follows: \"The Medicare low-income proxy, because it uses SSI as the low-income indicator, includes Medicare/Medicaid dual eligible patients. The Medicaid low-income proxy specifically excludes from its calculations patients entitled to Medicare Part A and limits its proxy to Medicaid-only eligible patients.\u201d No. 05-1370, 2009 WL 1973499 (June 24, 2009) at *3. The hospitals argue that this decision indicates that the Medicare fraction should include Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible patients, but the Board clearly noted that the fraction uses SSI rather than Medicaid as the Medicare income proxy. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the decision states that the Medicare fraction includes patients \"entitled to both Medicare Part A and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), <em>excluding patients receiving State supplementation only.\" Id. </em>at *1 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, reviewing a Board decision, acknowledged in <em>Edgewater Medical Center v. BCBSA/BCBS of Illinois </em>that for the Medicare fraction, \"the low-income status of Medicare patients ... is determined by their entitlement to SSI.\u201d Nos. 2000-D44, 2000-D45, 2000 WL 1146601 (June 19, 2000), at *5. The Administrator noted that \"in contrast,\u201d Medicaid eligibility defined low-income status for the Medicaid fraction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
