In 2008, following an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses (Amendment 706), the district court granted Taylor\u2019s motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to a total of 210 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-23\">In 2011, Taylor again moved pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a sentence reduction based on a subsequent amendment to the crack cocaine guidelines (Amendment 750). The district court denied Taylor\u2019s motion, and Taylor now appeals that denial. He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce a sentence after considering the applicable factors under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">A review of the record reveals that in denying Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, guideline policy statements, Taylor\u2019s self-improvement achievements, and Taylor\u2019s lack of disciplinary incidents. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Taylor has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
