On appeal, Rojo argues that his conviction for distribution of Alprazo-lam was not an aggravated felony because Alprazolam is not listed as a controlled substance in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>Accardo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>634 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">\u201cAny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). An \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as <em>defined in section 802 of Title </em>21).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">In turn, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802 defines \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \u201ca drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(6). Those five schedules of controlled substances are listed at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Importantly, section 812 explicitly instructs that its lists of controlled substances should be updated and republished annually. The \u201c[r]evised schedules are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1308 of Title 21, Food and Drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 812 n. 1. In other words, the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802 incorporates the revised schedules as published in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308. '</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Alprazolam is not listed in any of the five original schedules found in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812. However, it is listed in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.14(c) \u2014 and accordingly has been incorporated into \u00a7 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">We agree with the BIA that Rojo\u2019s conviction for distribution of Alprazolam is an aggravated felony because Alprazolam is a \u201ccontrolled substance ... as defined in section 802 of Title 21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
