On Johnson\u2019s motion, the district court sentenced her to the statutory minimum sentence in effect when she was first sentenced, but Johnson requested a greater reduction based on the lower minimum sentence under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Johnson\u2019s argument for a further reduction of her sentence is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374 (11th Cir.2012), that a defendant sentenced before the effective date of the Act is ineligible to have her sentence reduced. We held that the Act \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and ... does not serve as a basis for a ... sentence reduction\u201d under section 3582(c)(2). <em>Id., </em>701 F.3d at 377. Even if the Act could serve as a basis to reduce a sentence, we held in <em>Berry </em>that the lower mandatory minimum sentences did not apply retroactively to offenders sentenced before the effective date of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 377. As explained by the Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), \u201capplication of the new minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after August 3 create[d] a new set of disparities,\u201d that was an inevitable consequence of any \u201cnew law changing sentences\u201d and was consistent with \u201cthe ordinary practice ... to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that change from defendants already sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2335. The district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to reduce her sentence below the statutory minimum in effect at her original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">We AFFIRM the denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to reduce her sentence below the statutory minimum in effect at her original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
