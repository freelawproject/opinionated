Bilal lists four issues in his opening brief. There is no error, so we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-24\">Bilal claims he was denied due process when, he says, \u201cVioxx Pro Se Curator failed to assist him in producing a proper doctor\u2019s report need [sic ] to comply with [Pretrial Order] 28.\u201d But it was Bilal\u2019s obligation to produce evidence supporting his claim, and he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-25\">Bilal complains that he was not allowed to testify at a fairness hearing. He was heard through his briefs, however. He is civilly committed, and the district court was not obliged to require his release to testify or appear in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-26\">Bilal says he should have been appointed a guardian <em>ad litem. </em>Such appointments are required, however, only for incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tent persons, and Bilal does not aver that he is incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Bilal asserts he should have been appointed counsel. This is not the sort of extraordinary circumstance that compels appointed counsel in a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The judgment of dismissal is AFFIRMED. The motion to supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
