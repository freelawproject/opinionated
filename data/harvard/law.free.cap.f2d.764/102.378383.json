PRATT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">Defendants Champion Credit Corporation, Lexington Maintenance Corporation, Jerob Brokerage Corporation, and Jerome Garfield appeal from an amended judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Lloyd F. MacMahon, <em>Judge, </em>awarding $408,221.46 in damages and prejudgment interest to plaintiff Frank M\u00fasico, Jr., as personal representative of the estate of his father Francis G. M\u00fasico, Sr. The defendants had acted as agents for the M\u00fasico, Sr. estate in handling various aspects of the estate\u2019s taxicab business, and the district court held them liable to the estate for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion. Damages represented, first, moneys which the court found had been collected by the defendants on behalf of the estate, but which had not been passed on to the estate or otherwise accounted for; and second, agency fees which the estate had paid to defendants, but which were now forfeited because of defendants\u2019 breach of their fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">We affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand for recalculation of damages. We affirm that part of the district court\u2019s judgment holding defendants liable for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion, and that part imposing damages and prejudgment interest for the funds collected on behalf of the estate and unaccounted for. We reverse that part of the judgment requiring defendants to forfeit all agency fees. The agency fees were earned for separate tasks governed by four separate agency agreements, and for a number of those tasks there is no claim or proof of breach of duty to the estate, nor any claim or proof that performance of those tasks was tainted by defendants\u2019 misconduct. We therefore remand so that the district court may modify the computation of damages to eliminate the forfeiture of fees for services properly performed, while keeping the forfeiture of fees paid for services improperly performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b172-18\">During the 1970\u2019s Francis G. M\u00fasico, Sr. (\u201cM\u00fasico, Sr.\u201d) was the sole owner of forty-three New York corporations, each of which owned two New York City taxi medallions. In early 1977, three years before his death, M\u00fasico, Sr. sold the stock of thirty of these corporations, using conditional sales agreements which provided him with \u201cbuy-back\u201d options that could be exercised if the conditional purchasers default<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ed on their installment payments. At the same time the taxi medallions owned by the remaining thirteen corporations were also conditionally sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">M\u00fasico, Sr. died on January 25, 1980, while visiting New York from his home in Florida. At the time of his death, and since at least June of 1979, the business of collecting the installment payments on the sales of stock and taxi medallions was handled on an agency basis by Jerome Garfield (\u201cGarfield\u201d) and Champion Credit Corporation (\u201cChampion\u201d), a New York corporation wholly owned by Garfield. Within three days of M\u00fasico, Sr.\u2019s death his son, Frank M\u00fasico, Jr. (\u201cM\u00fasico, Jr.\u201d), met with Garfield and gave him a power of attorney which the parties intended as authorization for him to continue running the M\u00fasico, Sr. taxicab business in New York. This was the first of the four agency agreements relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In late March of 1980 the Surrogate\u2019s Court in Florida formally appointed M\u00fasi-co, Jr. as personal representative of his father\u2019s estate, and in that capacity he signed the other three agency agreements with Garfield and others on October 2, October 10, and November 20 of 1980. The October 2nd agreement gave Garfield, Champion, and Ronald Stoppelman agency powers to collect payments from the sale of stock of the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations. The October 10th agreement gave Garfield a special power of attorney to act on five specific matters, at least four of which apparently involved M\u00fasico, Sr. taxi corporations; this agreement was signed by M\u00fa-sico, Jr. not only as representative of the estate, but also as president of the corporations involved in the matters specified in the agreement. The November 20th agreement gave Garfield a general power of attorney with broad powers. All of the agency agreements continued in effect until August, 1982, when M\u00fasico, Jr. terminated them along with all of Garfield\u2019s powers of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Shortly after terminating these agreements, M\u00fasico, Jr. filed this lawsuit alleging that Garfield and his corporations, while acting as agents for the estate, had collected funds on behalf of the estate but had neither deposited those funds with the estate nor accounted for them in any other way. Federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The funds at issue came from the lease and sale, after M\u00fasico, Sr.\u2019s death, of taxicab medallions originally owned by ten of the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations. These medallions, or the corporations owning the medallions, had been conditionally sold in 1979 or 1980, but the buyers had defaulted and the \u201cbuy-back\u201d options were exercised. There is no disagreement over the fact that Garfield and his corporations handled these buy-backs, as well as the subsequent lease and sale of the reacquired medallions; there is, however, a great deal of disagreement over the exact details of how defendants handled these matters, as well as the extent to which M\u00fasico, Jr. knew and approved of what defendants did.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts is the following. On January 30, 1980, Garfield, acting under the power of attorney from M\u00fasico, Jr., signed an agreement leasing the reacquired medallions to an independent company, Four Square Operating Corporation, for rental payments of $800 per medallion per month. Under Garfield\u2019s direction these payments were first sent to Lexington Maintenance Corporation (\u201cLexington\u201d), a New York corporation controlled by Garfield; Lexington then remitted to Champion not the full $800, but only $528 for each rental payment received. Champion, which was also collecting the regular monthly installment payments from the earlier conditional sales made by M\u00fasico, Sr., provided monthly statements to M\u00fasico, Jr. and the estate, but these statements reflected payments of only $528 per medallion, the reduced amount paid to Champion by Lexington, and they made no mention of the full amount of $800 per medallion that Lexington had received. Plaintiff claims that neither he nor the estate was ever informed of this arrangement for reduced payments, and that Lexington held back, in all, over $38,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>rental payments which should have gone to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Plaintiff contends that similar unauthorized deductions at the time the reacquired medallions were finally sold deprived the estate of nearly $152,000. According to plaintiff, when the medallions were sold Garfield directed the payments to Jerob Brokerage Corporation (\u201cJerob Brokerage\u201d), which Garfield controlled, and only the reduced amount of these payments was reported and transmitted to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Defendants-\u2019 account of the medallion reacquisition, lease, and sale presents a somewhat different picture \u2014 or rather, several pictures, for defendants have given at least three different and partially inconsistent accounts of what occurred. One version, presented at trial and also in defendants\u2019 initial appellate brief, is that Garfield reacquired the medallions for M\u00fasico, Sr. in 1979 and 1980, but that in doing so he spent considerable amounts of his own money; the personal funds Garfield spent, he claims, constituted loans to M\u00fasico, Sr. which his estate was obligated to pay back. A second version of the crucial events, also presented at trial and in defendants\u2019 initial appellate brief, maintains that Garfield did not reacquire the medallions for M\u00fasico, Sr., but that Garfield took title to the medallions in his own name, taking over the installment payments due under the original conditional sales agreements. In this version the fact that Garfield retained title, or at least \u201cequitable\u201d title, to the medallions was actually part of a scheme designed by M\u00fasico, Jr. and the estate\u2019s accountants to reduce estate taxes by keeping the value of the medallions out of the estate. Finally, a third version is set out for the first time in defendants\u2019 reply brief on appeal. In this third account, Garfield spent his own money to acquire the medallions not in his own name, and not for M\u00fasico, Sr. personally, but for the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations which originally held them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In all these versions defendants claim that the channeling of payments through Lexington and Jerob Brokerage was fully understood by M\u00fasico, Jr. Under the first and third versions Garfield claims that any funds from the lease and sale of the medallions which he held back were, in fact, repayments of loans owed to him. He also claims that M\u00fasico, Jr. not only was informed about the loan repayments, but also understood and approved them. Under the second account there were no loans, but the funds were properly withheld because Garfield as the substitute purchaser and lessee was obligated to pay the estate only the amounts due on the original conditional sales contracts, and not the higher amounts earned under the new lease and sale of the medallions which occurred after M\u00fasico Sr.\u2019s death. Under any version of what happened, Garfield also contends that he had no personal duty to account to the estate, since the written agency agreement of October 2, 1980, places the duty to account only on Champion and not on Garfield personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The district court, after a four day bench trial in January 1984, completely rejected defendants\u2019 second version of the facts. The third version was not presented to the trial court, so no explicit determination on it was made; implicitly, however, the court rejected it, as is explained below. As for the first account, the district court did accept at least part of Garfield\u2019s story, but it found many of his contentions to be incredible. In its memorandum decision the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">It appears that Garfield did expend funds to buy back the conditionally sold medallions during M\u00fasico, Sr.\u2019s lifetime. Plaintiff admitted that he was aware that these reacquisitions were financed at least in part with Garfield\u2019s personal money. Furthermore, plaintiff discussed these expenditures with Garfield and knew that Garfield intended to reimburse himself out of estate income. Garfield, however, never revealed the exact figures to plaintiff. Nor did he ever specifically explain the manner in which he intended to repay himself. Obviously, even Garfield does not know how much he loaned the estate because he cannot document an exact figure. Moreover, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>no time prior to this lawsuit did Garfield assert any claim against the estate for this indebtedness. In light of Garfield\u2019s inability to produce credible and convincing evidence of these loans, we find that he has failed to prove their existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">The inescapable conclusion from Garfield\u2019s inability to produce adequate records or satisfactorily answer questions is that he diverted estate funds and freely commingled them with his personal funds and the funds of his companies. He cannot, or will not, unravel the re-cordkeeping fiasco he has created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The court\u2019s conclusions that the defendants are liable for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion followed from its finding that \u201cdefendants improperly retained certain moneys collected on behalf of the estate\u201d. Plaintiff had also made a RICO claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962 based on alleged violations of the federal mail fraud statute, but the district court found that plaintiff had not proved the elements necessary to show a RICO violation, and its decision on this point has not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Damages represented both the $190,-047.30 which the court found had been withheld from the estate, and $123,895 in agency fees already paid to the defendants by the estate, fees which the court determined were forfeited and must be repaid because of the defendants\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty. On plaintiff\u2019s motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(b), the court amended its judgment to increase the damage award to include prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">A. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">No challenge to federal jurisdiction was made in the district court or, indeed, in the initial briefs filed on this appeal. In their reply brief, however, defendants argue for the first time that the federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the case because there is no diversity of citizenship between plaintiffs and defendants, once the real parties in interest are recognized. Without a basis for diversity jurisdiction the case cannot be heard, defendants say, for it falls within no other area of federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">This challenge to jurisdiction rests on carefully distinguishing the M\u00fasico, Sr. taxi corporations from the estate which owns their stock. In their reply brief defendants argue that the taxi medallions involved in the present dispute were reacquired in 1979 and 1980 not for M\u00fasico, Sr. personally nor for his estate, but for his corporations. They then claim that the dispute over the lease and sale of those medallions concerns an agency agreement between the defendants and the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations which owned the medallions, and that the dispute does not involve the quite distinct agency agreement they had with the estate which dealt only with the sale of stock owned by the estate. The conclusion from all this, according to defendants, is that the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations are the real parties in interest here and that only the corporations can bring suit for breach of the fiduciary duty covering the sale and lease of the medallions. They maintain that plaintiff, as representative of the estate, has \u201cno standing to represent the interests of M\u00fasico, Sr.\u2019s New York corporations which conditionally sold their assets\u201d. Yet if the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations are viewed as the real parties in interest diversity jurisdiction is destroyed, since New York citizenship would then be shared by both the defendants and the corporate plaintiffs. The M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations and the three defendant corporations are all New York citizens; M\u00fasico, Sr. and M\u00fasico, Jr. are from Florida, and Garfield is a citizen of either New York or Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">The district court\u2019s decision did not explicitly address the points central to defendants\u2019 argument, but it implicitly rejected them by disregarding the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations\u2019 nominal role as owners of the taxi medallions, by treating the estate as the equitable owner of the medallions, and by treating the estate as the principal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the agency agreements covering the medallions\u2019 lease and sale. The district court\u2019s approach was fully in keeping with what counsel brought to its attention. Defendants, that is, never brought to the trial court\u2019s attention the argument they now make on appeal over distinguishing between the estate and the corporations. We therefore conclude that, in the circumstances of the present case, defendants have waived any right to argue on appeal that the estate is not the alter ego of the corporations and that the estate had no right to sue as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Finding a waiver on this point does not mean, of course, that there was anything misguided in the way the district court treated the estate and the estate\u2019s corporations. The court had ample reason in this case to view the estate as the real party in interest. The appropriateness of finding that defendants have waived their right to argue about the real party in interest is reinforced by the independent strength of the reasons for ignoring the separate status of the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations owned by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Well known New York case law involving taxicab corporations makes it clear that the distinction between a corporation and its owner may be disregarded \u201cwhenever necessary \u2018to prevent fraud or to achieve equity\u2019.\u201d <em>Walkovszky v. Carlton, </em>18 N.Y.2d 414, 417, 276 N.Y.S.2d 585, 223 N.E.2d 6 (1966) (quoting <em>International Aircraft Trading Co. v. Manufacturers Trust Co., </em>297 N.Y. 285, 292, 79 N.E.2d 249 (1948)). The question of whether to pierce the corporate veil usually comes up in a situation where an outside party would like to disregard the corporation\u2019s independent status, and where the corporate owner resists any such disregard. The present case is unusual because it raises the question of piercing the corporate veil in reverse, for it is the corporate owner who wants to disregard the corporations\u2019 separate status.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Although a number of courts have justified reverse disregard on the basis of equity, <em>see </em>W. Fletcher, 1 <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 41.70 (perm. ed. 1983), there are some New York cases which assert that \u201cthe corporate veil is never pierced [in reverse] for the benefit of the corporation or its stockholders.\u201d <em>Colin v. Altman, </em>39 A.D.2d 200, 202, 333 N.Y.S.2d 432, 433 (1st Dept.1972) (no authority cited); <em>Ipco Hospital Supply Corp. v. Consolidated Edison Co., </em>100 Misc.2d 789, 420 N.Y.S.2d 78, 80 (1979) (citing only <em>Colin v. Altman, </em>39 A.D.2d 200, 333 N.Y. S.2d 432 (1972)). Such a blanket statement is not quite accurate, however, for there are New York cases involving corporations owned by estates in which the separate status of the corporation was disregarded for the benefit of the owner, or in which the question of whether this should be done was not closed as a matter of law. For example, in <em>In re Weinstein, </em>25 A.D.2d 776, 269 N.Y.S.2d 475, 476 (2d Dept.1966), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>19 N.Y.2d 599, 278 N.Y. S.2d 387, 224 N.E.2d 883 (1967), the appellate division held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aju\">[T]he Surrogate possesses the equitable power to disregard the corporate entity and may proceed to treat the estate fiduciaries and their corporate problems with respect to disposition of the corporate assets, and its effect upon the estate, upon the realistic basis that the fiduciaries and the management of the corporations are one and the same [citations].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEE\"><em>Cf. In re Tuttle\u2019s Estate, </em>4 N.Y.2d 159, 173 N.Y.S.2d 279, 282, 149 N.E.2d 715 (1958) (\u201cbecause the estate owned virtually all of the stock of Kurlash [corporation] and because the executors became the controlling directors of Kurlash, their duties in the two capacities were indistinguishable and the corporate entity is to be disregarded in fixing the duties of the executors-trustees\u201d); <em>In re Hubbell\u2019s Will, </em>302 N.Y. 246, 254, 97 N.E.2d 888 (1951) (when a trustee holds working control of stock in a corporation owned by estate, trustee may be required to treat corporate transactions as though they were his own transactions as trustee); <em>In re Horowitz\u2019 Will, </em>297 N.Y. 252, 258, 78 N.E.2d 598 (1948) (position of director of corporation owned by estate may be \u201csuperimposed\u201d on position of ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>eeutor of estate); <em>In re Stulman\u2019s Will, </em>146 Misc. 861, 263 N.Y.S. 197, 217 (1933) (holding that \u201cunder normal circumstances\u201d a corporation is distinct from its owner, but leaving open the possibility that in \u201crare\u201d circumstances executors could disregard a corporate entity entirely owned by testator).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">To achieve equity in the present case, which deals with the overall relationships between the parties, it is fitting that <em>In re Weinstein </em>be followed and that the separate status of the corporations wholly owned by the estate be disregarded. The equities call for this because in dealing with one another the parties themselves disregarded the corporate form. When Garfield dealt with third parties such as Four Square Operating Corporation, which leased the reacquired medallions, he observed the distinction between the estate and the taxi corporations owned by the estate; when outsiders were not involved, however, Garfield simply treated the estate as the alter ego of the M\u00fasico, Sr. taxi corporations. The estates went along with this approach, evidently seeing little need to do otherwise. Garfield, after all, was not misled, since he had long-standing and intimate knowledge of the entire M\u00fasico, Sr. taxicab business, and he knew that the assets of the taxi corporations were being liquidated for the ultimate benefit of the estate and those the estate represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The underlying commercial relationships between the defendants, the estate, and the estate\u2019s corporations come out quite clearly in the monthly accounting reports sent by Champion to the estate from January 1980 until August 1982. During this time Champion collected payments from the lease and sale of medallions as well as the sale of stock in the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations. Champion\u2019s monthly accounting reports all begin by listing the total income received from payments made to Champion, and they then list various deductions for such things as advances \u201cto the M\u00fasico Estate\u201d, lease of cars, Internal Revenue Service payments in the name of particular taxicab corporations, other payments made in the name of particular taxicab corporations owned by the estate, and loan repayments to Chemical Bank which are not identified with any particular corporation. The bottom line in these accounting statements, though, is always the amount \u201cDue to Estate\u201d of M\u00fasico, Sr., as calculated by subtracting the deductions from the total payments received. In other words, the accounting made no effort to distinguish the income which might go to a particular corporation owned by the estate, from the income which went directly to the estate. The accounting was in terms of a lump sum \u201cdue to the estate\u201d. The commercial basis of the parties\u2019 relationships was the manifest understanding that the estate was the alter ego of the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Defendants\u2019 treatment of the estate as the alter ego of the taxi corporations continued, moreover, at the district court trial and even in the first stages of this appeal, as is made clear by the defendants\u2019 own brief. Adjacent lines of that brief indiscriminately attribute ownership of the medallions first to M\u00fasico, Sr. or his estate, and then to the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations, with no attempt to explain whether or not it makes any difference if title is held by one of these entities or another. On pages two and three of their brief, for example, defendants first say</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">At issue in this lawsuit is the income from the lease and sale of 10 of these 86 medallions which Garfield had (i) repurchased <em>for M\u00fasico, Sr. </em>in 1979 and 1980 with loans of Garfield\u2019s funds, then (ii) leased out to new operators <em>for M\u00fasico, Sr., </em>and (iii) finally resold <em>for the M\u00fasico estate. </em>[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The next two lines are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aro\">These 10 leased medallions <em>belonged to seven taxicab corporations, </em>wholly owned by M\u00fasico, Sr. at the time of his death. The conditional sales contracts had been reacquired <em>for M\u00fasico, Sr. </em>by Garfield when the buyers defaulted. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">Defendants\u2019 brief also cites directly to the trial transcript in support of claims that Garfield repurchased the medallions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1979 \u201con behalf of Musico\u2019s father\u201d, that Lexington was forwarding $528 of each $800 medallion rental payment \u201cto the estate\u201d, and that the money from the final sale of the medallions \u201cwould also go to the estate\u201d after a portion was deducted to repay Garfield for the funds he loaned \u201cthe estate\u201d when reacquiring the ten conditionally sold medallions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In short, because of the defendants\u2019 own disregard of the separate status of the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations from at least 1980, and because of their own acceptance during most of this litigation of the M\u00fasico, Sr. estate as the real party in interest in the lease and sale of the medallions, there was no error in the district court\u2019s regarding the estate as the proper plaintiff. Since the district court\u2019s approach was justified, and since defendants waived any right to question it on appeal, equity would only be frustrated, rather than achieved, if Garfield could now use the existence of the M\u00fasico, Sr. corporations as a means of escaping an unfavorable district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">B. <em>Defendants\u2019 Liability for Funds from the Lease and Sale of the Taxi Medallions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Five arguments are advanced by defendants for reversing that part of the district court decision holding them liable for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion of the funds withheld from the lease and sale of the taxi medallions. None of the arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">1. The first argument for reversal is that Garfield as an individual had no duty to account to the estate because the written agency agreement signed October 2, 1980, placed the duty to account on Champion alone, rather than on Garfield personally. True, that document places the primary duty to give a monthly accounting on \u201cThe Corporate Agent\u201d, but it also requires that Garfield \u201cprovide with the accounting a listing of all receipts received and copies of invoices paid.\u201d Moreover, by its own terms the agreement applies only to the sale of the M\u00fasico, Sr. stock and a few other particular matters, and not to the lease and sale of the taxi medallions. The alleged misdealing in this case concerns the medallions, whose lease and sale was authorized not by the October 2 agreement but by the other dealings of Garfield and M\u00fasico, Jr., including either or both of the powers of attorney signed in January and November 1980. Under those arrangements Garfield had broad authority to act for the estate, and nothing in the record exempts him from an agent\u2019s normal duty to account for his trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">2. Defendants\u2019 second argument for reversal is that there was no conversion because Garfield was authorized by M\u00fasico, Jr. to retain part of the funds from the medallions\u2019 lease and sale as repayment for loans made to M\u00fasico, Sr. or his estate. Whatever authority Garfield had, however, came with an accompanying duty to account, as explained in the previous paragraph, and since he could not account for what he had withheld he was liable for conversion. <em>See George Haiss Mfg. Co. v. Becker, </em>198 A.D. 123, 189 N.Y.S. 791 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The district court carefully explained the factual basis for its conclusion that Garfield had not accounted for the funds he withheld. This conclusion rested</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7-\">primarily on the constant inability of defendants to provide straightforward, or for that matter, even understandable records. * * * Garfield testified that he had used approximately $130,000.00 of his own money to finance the buy-backs. Nevertheless, at no time was he able to document this assertion with specific records of the expenditures or with can-celled checks clearly indicating their purpose. Defendants\u2019 Exhibit H, which purports to be buy-back checks, is practically meaningless absent some explanation which connects the checks to personal funds of Garfield. Garfield never provided any such explanation. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIC\">Similarly, Garfield asserted at trial that he retained the downpayments from the resales in order to repay himself for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the money used to finance the buy-backs. He was totally unable to produce records of the receipt of the downpayments or their distribution. * * * Garfield testified that he kept $94,000 of the $122,000 collected in downpayments as reimbursements and used the remaining $28,000 for expenses. He could not, however, account for the breakdown with any coherent records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Obviously, even Garfield does not know how much he loaned the estate because he cannot document an exact figure. * * In light of Garfield\u2019s inability to produce credible and convincing evidence of these loans, we find that he has failed to prove their existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Nothing before us on this appeal supplies the explanations and documentation which the district court found missing from Garfield\u2019s version of what happened. We therefore have no reason to reject the district court\u2019s findings or its holding that Garfield withheld funds without authorization because he failed to prove the existence of the alleged loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">As part of his argument that no conversion occurred, Garfield also claims that plaintiff should be estopped from complaining about the funds withheld from the estate because Garfield\u2019s actions were all part of plaintiff\u2019s plan to hide estate assets and reduce estate taxes. This estoppel argument was not pleaded as a defense in defendants\u2019 amended answer and was therefore waived. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c); <em>Tornello v. Deligiannis Brothers, Inc., </em>180 F.2d 553 (7th Cir.1950); 5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1394 (1969). Moreover, the district court implicitly rejected any claim that defendants were merely acting as part of a \u201cscheme\u201d designed by plaintiff, and on this record we cannot say that that rejection was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">3. Defendants\u2019 third argument for reversal is that Garfield is entitled to an offset for the funds he loaned the estate. As did the district court, we reject this argument for two reasons. One is that Garfield has simply been unable to document any specific loan, as explained above. The second is that to be binding on the estate any claim for repayment of a loan to the decedent should have been, but was not, filed in accordance with Florida law. By statute Florida requires that a claim against an estate must be \u201cpresented: (a) Within 3 months from the time of the first publication of the notice of administration, even though the personal representative has recognized the claim or demand by paying a part of it or interest on it or otherwise.\u201d Fla.Stat. \u00a7 733.702(1) (1976 &amp; Supp.1985). A claim is presented when it is filed. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 733.703. Absent any evidence that defendants made the required filing on the alleged loans prior to this suit, they cannot now claim them against the estate as a setoff. <em>See Fowler v. Hartridge, </em>156 Fla. 585, 24 So.2d 306 (1945); <em>Smith v. Fechheimer, </em>124 Fla. 757, 169 So. 395 (1936); <em>Price v. Davis, </em>180 So.2d 474 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">Defendants describe this reasoning, which was also part of the district court\u2019s opinion, as \u201ca <em>non sequitur </em>\u201d because Garfield was following the instructions of his principal, M\u00fasico, Jr., in paying himself back for the loans. The statute, however, expressly provides that the personal representative\u2019s recognition of a claim does not excuse a creditor from the filing requirement. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 733.702(1) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1985); <em>Harbour House Properties, Inc. v. Estate of Stone, </em>443 So.2d 136 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1983). An exception may be made on grounds of estoppel, but \u201cthere must, as a minimum, be some form of affirmative deception involved before the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be invoked\u201d to escape the bar created by \u00a7 733.702. <em>In re Estate of Peterson, </em>433 So.2d 1358, 1359 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1983) (citing <em>Rinker Materials Corp. v. Palmer First National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>361 So.2d 156, 159 (Fla.1978)). No such \u201caffirmative deception\u201d has been shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">4. Defendants\u2019 fourth argument is that the district court misapplied New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>York\u2019s dead man\u2019s statute, N.Y.Civ. Pract.Law and Rules \u00a7 4519 (McKinney 1983), when it prevented Garfield from testifying about conversations he had with M\u00fasico, Sr. Defendants rely on the rule that \u201cwhen the executor questions his adversary as to all or part of a personal transaction with the decedent, he has \u2018opened the door\u2019 as to that transaction and otherwise incompetent testimony is admissible to fully explain the personal transaction in issue.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Wood, </em>52 N.Y.2d 139, 146, 436 N.Y.S.2d 850, 852, 418 N.E.2d 365 (1981). The <em>Wood </em>case stresses, though, that this exception to the dead man\u2019s rule is \u201climited in application to the \u2018personal transaction\u2019 to which the executor ... forced another interested party to testify\u201d and that it \u201cdoes not \u2018open the door\u2019 to any or all personal transactions with the decedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case before us much of the particular questioning relied on by Garfield in his brief related to the medallion lease to Four Square. However, this was not a personal transaction between Garfield and M\u00fasico, Sr.; on the contrary it occurred after M\u00fasico Sr.\u2019s death. In the one instance in which the plaintiff inquired of Garfield as to a personal transaction between himself and M\u00fasico, Sr., the question addressed the existence of an agency relationship between the parties governing the repurchasing of the defaulted medallions. Garfield\u2019s answer was stricken, however, presumably in application of the New York dead man\u2019s statute. If this was error, it was unquestionably harmless, in light of the district court\u2019s express finding, well supported by the evidence, that Garfield acted as an agent for M\u00fasico, Sr. during the buybacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">5. Defendants\u2019 final argument, raised for the first time on appeal, is that the district court erred in not dismissing the suit for failure to join Ronald Stoppelman as an indispensable party. Defendants regard Stoppelman as indispensable because he was one of the signers of the October 2, 1980, agency agreement, and because he had a 47.5 percent ownership interest in Lexington; these facts, defendants claim, raise dangers to Stoppelman\u2019s interests because of the possibility of collateral estoppel in a future suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Garfield\u2019s belated argument is unconvincing. First, the October 2, 1980, agency agreement, to which Stoppelman was a party, covered the sale of the corporate stock, not the lease and sale of the taxi medallions which are the subject of this case. Second, the mere fact that Stoppelman has a major ownership interest in one of the defendant corporations does not, by itself, prejudice his personal rights in a future case. The decision of the district court does not find that Stoppelman breached a duty to the estate, converted the estate\u2019s funds, or engaged in fraud; and neither does our decision on this appeal. We see no reason for finding that Stoppelman is an indispensable party to this particular lawsuit. <em>See Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Company v. Patterson, </em>390 U.S. 102, 88 S.Ct. 733, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">C. <em>Forfeiture of Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Under the district court\u2019s view of New York law, an agent who breaches his fiduciary duty is not entitled to any compensation for services he has performed for his principal, even if the services were separate from those involving the breach of duty and were, in fact, properly performed. The court therefore ordered the defendants to forfeit all fees received from the estate, including fees for services with which the estate found no fault. Fees for the collection of installment payments on the conditional sales of stock, for example, were included in the forfeiture even though there was no complaint that those collections were mishandled. In short, there was no attempt to limit the forfeiture to compensation paid for services that were either improperly performed or tainted by the breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Whether New York rules out any apportionment of forfeiture is not, however, as simple an issue as the district court believed. Admittedly there are some older New York cases which suggest a broad rule prohibiting apportionment of forfei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tures. More recent cases, though, show a trend toward the position taken in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>(1958), which calls for apportioning forfeitures when an agent\u2019s compensation is allocated to periods of time or to the completion of specified items of work. As explained below, this trend, coupled with the persuasiveness of the <em>Restatement </em>position and with the position taken in an earlier second circuit case raising the apportionment issue, lead us to conclude that the defendants in the present case should not have to forfeit all their fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The older New York case law suggesting a strict rule against apportioning forfeitures of compensation can be traced to <em>Murray v. Beard, </em>102 N.Y. 505, 508, 7 N.E. 553 (1886), where the New York Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">An agent is held to uberrima fides in his dealings with his principal, and if he acts adversely to his employer <em>in any part of the transaction </em>* * * it amounts to such a fraud upon the principal as to forfeit <em>any </em>rights to compensation for services. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">While this passage has been reaffirmed since it was written in 1886, <em>Lamdin v. Broadway Surface Advertising Corp., </em>272 N.Y. 133, 5 N.E.2d 66 (1936), the trend in more recent cases has been away from any rigorous adherence to <em>Murray\u2019s </em>language. When faced with agencies where compensation has been apportioned to periods of time, courts in recent years have carefully phrased New York\u2019s forfeiture rule to allow the forfeiture to be correspondingly apportioned. <em>See Herman v. Branch Motor Express Co., </em>67 Misc.2d 444, 323 N.Y. S.2d 794, 796 (N.Y.Civ.Ct.1971) (careful analysis of New York law shows that a faithless employee is deprived of his right to compensation \u201conly for the period of his faithlessness\u201d); <em>see also Maritime Fish Products, Inc. v. World Wide Fish Products, Inc., </em>100 A.D.2d 81, 474 N.Y.S.2d 281, 287 (1984) (employer is entitled to return of compensation paid to employee \u201cduring the period of disloyalty\u201d); <em>St. James Plaza v. Notey, </em>95 A.D.2d 804, 463 N.Y.S.2d 523, 526 (1983) (\u201can employee may forfeit his right to compensation for services rendered by him during such periods of disloyalty\u201d); <em>Westwood Chemical Company, Inc. v. Kulick, </em>570 F.Supp. 1032, 1040 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (same); <em>Ability Search, Inc. v. Lawson, </em>556 F.Supp. 9, 15 (S.D.N.Y.1981) (same), <em>aff'd mem., </em>697 F.2d 287 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Consistent with these cases is the position taken by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>(1958), section 469 of which states that an agent who breaches his duty \u201cis not entitled to compensation even for properly performed services for which no compensation is apportioned.\u201d Comment b to \u00a7 469 explains that apportionment should be in accordance with \u00a7 456, and comment b to \u00a7 456 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">If an agent is paid a salary apportioned to periods of time, or compensation apportioned to the completion of specified items of work, he is entitled to receive the stipulated compensation for periods or items properly completed before his renunciation or discharge. This is true even if, because of unfaithfulness or insubordination, the agent forfeits his compensation for subsequent periods or items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Comment d to \u00a7 469 adds: \u201cThe fact that [an agent] has been disloyal or insubordinate in one transaction does not disentitle him to indemnity on account of other transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The recent case law cited above is limited, it must be admitted, to agencies where compensation is apportioned to periods of time, whereas the <em>Restatement </em>calls for apportionment of forfeitures where compensation is apportioned not only to time periods, but also to the completion of specific tasks. Yet no modern New York case specifically and unambiguously rules out apportionment corresponding to completion of specified tasks, and we see no principled basis for applying different rules to the two situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">Finally, the conclusion that New York would allow apportionment of forfeitures so that compensation is not lost for properly completed tasks was drawn by the second circuit- when it considered the issue some forty years ago. In <em>Trounstine v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Bauer, Pogue &amp; Co., </em>144 F.2d 379, 383 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>323 U.S. 777, 65 S.Ct. 190, 89 L.Ed. 621 (1944), Judge Swan, sitting with Judge Augustus N. Hand and Judge Clark, affirmed a district court decision which apportioned a forfeiture of fees so that the agents lost compensation only for tasks carried out improperly. Judge Swan reasoned that \u201c[t]o deprive the defendants of these commissions would be mere punishment because they had violated their duty as to other transactions\u201d, 144 F.2d at 383, and he distinguished <em>Murray v. Beard </em>and other similar New York cases by pointing out that they concerned breaches of duty which had tainted all the dealings between the parties. Since the breach of duty in the case before him did not taint all dealings, however, he found that apportionment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Like the situation in <em>Trounstine, </em>defendants\u2019 breach of duty in the present case did not extend to or taint all the dealings between the parties. Those dealings included separate tasks covered by four agency agreements, two of which were carefully limited to specific, distinct matters. The agreement of October 2, 1980, provided for agency fees only for the collection of the installment payments on the conditional sales of M\u00fasico, Sr.\u2019s stock; the agreement of October 10, 1980, did not mention fees but gave Garfield a special power of attorney for only five specific matters. Neither of these agency agreements appears to govern the separate tasks of reacquiring, leasing, or reselling the medallions, and it is only these separate tasks that were carried out in breach of defendants\u2019 fiduciary duties. The district court found no misdealing with the collection of payments on the original sales of stock, or for the five matters covered by the October 10, 1980, agreement. Moreover, there was no finding that the misdealing with respect to the lease and sale of the taxi medallions had tainted in any way the completion of the tasks governed by the October 2 and 10 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">What is before us, then, is a case where the parties have apportioned various agency tasks under a number of separate agreements, where the agents engaged in no misconduct at all in carrying out the specific tasks set out in two of those agreements, and where the agents\u2019 misdealing with respect to one task has neither tainted nor interfered with the completion of the other tasks. In these circumstances we hold that New York law, like the <em>Restatement, </em>requires us to apportion any forfeited compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We therefore remand to the district court to recalculate the amount, if any, of defendants\u2019 fees that are to be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">We affirm that part of the judgment holding defendants liable for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion, and we affirm that part of the judgment awarding damages based on the withholding of funds derived from the lease and sale of the medallions of the ten taxi corporations. We reverse the forfeiture of fees and remand so that the district court may recalculate the amount of the forfeiture, which should not include agency fees paid for untainted, properly performed tasks. On remand the amount of prejudgment interest must, of course, be recalculated after determination of the proper amount of forfeiture. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
