Robert L. Merrifield was convicted upon a guilty plea of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering. On September 22, 1983, he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on the first count and five years probation and a $10,000 fine on the second count. Merrifield filed a timely motion to reduce his sentence, and this was denied in a judgment docketed April 26, 1984. Mer-rifield filed a notice of appeal from the September, 1983, judgment on November 8, 1984, more than six months after the ruling on the motion to reduce and more than thirteen months after the entry of the judgment that he purports to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-29\">Fed.R.App.P. 4(b) provides that a notice of appeal in a criminal case \u201cshall be filed in the district court within 10 days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 26(b) expressly prohibits the court from enlarging \u201cthe time for filing a notice of appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>____\u201d Because the notice of appeal was filed well beyond the ten-day period, and because a timely notice of appeal \u201cis a \u2018prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d by this court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appeal must be dismissed as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that Merrifield has been proceeding <em>pro se </em>since his sentencing \u201cdoes not exempt [him] from compliance with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law,\u201d such as the requirement of timely filing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Even if we were to treat Merrifield\u2019s appeal as an appeal from the denial of his motion to reduce sentence, it still would be untimely. \u201cSuch a motion is a proceeding in the original criminal prosecution____ Accordingly, the ten-day limitation of Fed. R.App.P. 4(b) governs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9Z\">For these reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-18\">. <em>United States v.
