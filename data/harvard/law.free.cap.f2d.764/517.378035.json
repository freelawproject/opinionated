The government asserts that the district court erred in giving priority to attorney\u2019s liens filed by Richard Tegtmeier over tax liens filed by the Internal Revenue Service. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-18\">The Scottsbluff City Police Department seized $13,240 from Joe Richter as part of its investigation into Richter\u2019s involvement with controlled substances. Richter hired Tegtmeier to defend him in this criminal matter. After the criminal case was resolved, the IRS and Tegtmeier asserted competing claims to the seized money based on Richter\u2019s tax liabilities and on his unpaid obligations to Tegtmeier. The case was removed to federal district court, and after a series of hearings, the district court determined that Tegtmeier\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien was valid under Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 7-108. The district court determined the priorities among the liens in the order and amounts as follows: (1) reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of $2,400 for securing the return of the seized money; (2) unpaid tax liens of $5,794.70 assessed prior to May 29, 1981; (3) the remainder of the unpaid attorney\u2019s lien in the amount of $5,045.30; and (4) unpaid portions of tax liens assessed after May 29, 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-19\">The government challenges this determination of priorities on the ground that Tegtmeier did not perfect his attorney\u2019s lien under Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 7-108<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the seized money was not \u201cin the hands of an adverse party within the meaning of the statute.\u201d We find the cases cited by the government to be entirely inapposite, as they deal with court-appointed receivers. For purposes of the attorney\u2019s lien statute, we hold that seizure of money pursuant to a criminal investigation neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>sarily creates an adversarial relationship between the defendant-property owner and the state. This juxtaposition of interests is clearly distinguishable from the case of a neutral court-appointed receiver. Moreover, this case presents a situation in which the defendant benefited from advice of counsel whom the statute seeks to protect through the recognition of a lien. Thus, we find that the plain meaning of the statute creates a valid lien for the attorney under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The government also challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the $2,400 attorney\u2019s lien was entitled to a superpriority under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(b)(8).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Close reading of the statute confirms that its plain meaning supports the district court\u2019s interpretation: where an attorney holds a lien that is valid under local law, and where the lien is for \u201creasonable compensation for <em>obtaining such judgment </em>or <em>procuring such settlement </em>\u201d (emphasis added), the attorney\u2019s lien is entitled to priority. Because the record appears to support Tegtmeier\u2019s claim that his services were necessary to release these funds, we find that he obtained the judgment under the terms of the statute, and is entitled to lien priority as ordered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The government also argues implicitly that the second attorney\u2019s lien in the amount of $5,794.70 was improperly awarded to Tegtmeier because the government\u2019s tax lien arose upon assessment of the deficiency on April 12, 1981, which antedated Tegtmeier\u2019s lien. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6322. We note, however, that, although the district court relied upon the wrong dates, it used the correct method for determining when a lien becomes choate. That method, which the government does not challenge, rests upon the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Pioneer American Insurance Co., </em>374 U.S. 84, 89, 83 S.Ct. 1651, 1655, 10 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963) that state liens are \u201cperfected in the sense that there is nothing more to be done to have a choate lien \u2014 when the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established.\u201d Although the district court erroneously selected May 29, 1981 as the date Tegtmeier perfected his lien, we note that under <em>Pioneer, </em>the statement that Tegtmeier sent Richter on April 8, 1981 establishing the amount due and owing at $30,142.08 perfected the lien and made it choate as of that date. Because this lien was perfected before the government\u2019s tax lien, it is entitled to priority and we do not disturb the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-15\">. For clarity we note that the tax liens enjoy different priorities because they were perfected at different times; for the four tax years in question, the tax liens were perfected on six dates over three and a half years. The district court found that the first four of these tax liens enjoyed a higher priority than the second attorney\u2019s lien, while the latter two tax liens earned a lower priority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-16\">. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-20\">An attorney has a lien for a general balance of compensation upon any papers of his client which have come into his possession in the course of his professional employment; and upon money in his hands belonging to his client, and in the hands of the adverse party in an action or proceeding in which the attorney was employed from the time of giving notice of the lien to that party.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">. That section provides that a federal tax lien does not take precedence over attorney\u2019s liens under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">Attorneys\u2019 liens. \u2014 With respect to a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action, as against an attorney who, under local law, holds a lien upon or a contract enforcible against such judgment or amount, to the extent of his reasonable compensation for obtaining such judgment or procuring such settlement, except that this paragraph shall not apply to any judgment or amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action against the United States to the extent that the United States offsets such judgment or amount against any liability of the taxpayer to the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-15\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(b)(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b587-11\">McMILLIAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AjO\">concurring</p>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">I agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the attorney was entitled to a superpriority under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(b)(8) over the outstanding federal tax liens in the stipulated amount of $2,400. It appears from the record that the attorney\u2019s services were necessary to obtain the return of the money by the state authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">I do not agree, however, that the attorney has a valid attorney\u2019s lien. I am reluctant to disagree with the district court over a question of Nebraska law. Nonetheless, I do not agree that the seizure of money pursuant to a criminal investigation and its holding by the clerk of the state district court as evidence in the criminal prosecution necessarily makes the state an \u201cadverse party\u201d for purposes of the attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>lien statute, Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 7-108 (Reissue 1983). In the absence of forfeiture proceedings or some claim of ownership by the state, I would argue that, at least for purposes of the attorney\u2019s lien statute, the clerk of the state district court does occupy a position analogous to that of a court-appointed receiver. I would hold that the attorney did not have a valid attorney\u2019s lien in the money held by the clerk of the state district court and, accordingly, would reverse the district court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it holds the attorney\u2019s lien is valid and grants the perfected attorney\u2019s lien priority over the outstanding federal tax liens.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
