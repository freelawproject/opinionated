HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1544-21\">Appellant/creditor Chrysler Credit Corp. appeals from an order of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, which held that a $30 charge for \u201cdoc. preparation\u201d in an automobile finance contract constituted part of the finance charge (rather than the unpaid balance) in the contract, and thus that the creditor had imposed an excessive interest charge in violation of the Georgia Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (MVSFA), O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-30 <em>et seq. </em>We reverse, holding that there has been no violation of the MVSFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-22\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-23\">Appellee/debtor Ferris purchased an automobile, on credit, from Bob Maddox Dodge in 1978. The automobile finance contract included a $30 charge for \u201cdoc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>preparation,\u201d which was added to the unpaid balance on the loan as an \u201cother charge.\u201d This document preparation fee apparently was to cover the cost of an envelope in which to place the contracts, the cost of keeping a record of the key numbers so that duplicate keys could be obtained, the cost of notarizing certificates of origin or certificates of title in order to transfer the titles, certain costs incident to obtaining replacement certificates of title when titles are lost on trade-ins, and general overhead expenses. This finance contract was subsequently assigned to appellant/creditor Chrysler Credit Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-5\">At the time this contract was entered into, the maximum finance charge that could be computed on a new automobile under the MVSFA was eight percent add-on per year. The contract, as written, complied with this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-6\">In November, 1982, Ferris filed a voluntary Chapter 13 petition in bankruptcy court. Chrysler Credit filed its proof of claim based on the automobile finance contract. Ferris then commenced an adversary proceeding against \u00a1Chrysler Credit in bankruptcy court, allegmg that Chrysler Credit had violated the MVSFA by charging an excessive finance charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-7\">A trial was held in the bankruptcy court. At trial, the secretary of Bob Maddox Dodge testified that the dealer charged the $30 document fee to all consumer purchasers, whether for cash or credit, although the fee was not charged on sales to other dealers or government agencies. This testimony was not contradicted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-8\">The bankruptcy court, feeling itself bound by <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Spann, </em>153 Ga.App. 535, 265 S.E.2d 863 (1980), concluded that the document preparation fee had been added to the unpaid balance in the finance contract in violation of the MVSFA, since the various components of the fee were not individually itemized on the contract. Thus, the court deducted the $30 charge from the unpaid balance and added it to the finance charge, with the result that the maximum finance charge permitted by the MVSFA was exceeded by $16.56. Chrysler Credit was thus barred from recovering any of the finance charge on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-12\">The district court affirmed, 42 B.R. 374 (S.D.Ga.1984), again relying on the <em>Spann </em>decision. The court noted that the result appeared inconsistent with Fifth and Eleventh Circuit cases under the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) concerning the permissibility of unitemized documentary fees, but felt that it had to follow the Georgia precedent <em>{Spann) </em>in applying the MVSFA. In reaching its conclusions, the court stated that, \u201c[t]he dealer did not charge \u2018doc preparation\u2019 fees in all of its transactions (presumably for cash) with government agencies and other dealers. Thus, it appears that the \u2018doc preparation\u2019 fee was regularly and consistently charged only in <em>credit </em>transactions.\u201d 42 B.R. at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-14\">A. <em>Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Jurisdiction over Debtor\u2019s Adversary Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4M\">Initially, we are faced with appellant\u2019s argument that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the debtor\u2019s MVSFA claim. It contends that the debtor\u2019s claim is a \u201crelated proceeding\u201d unconnected to and independent from the bankruptcy proceeding which, under the Emergency Bankruptcy Rule (Interim Rule)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adopted by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia on December 24, 1982, should have been brought in Georgia state court. <em>See </em>Interim Rule 1f (d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-15\">The district court held that the debtor\u2019s complaint was in the nature of a counterclaim against the claim filed by Chrysler Credit, and thus was not a \u201crelated proceeding.\u201d 42 B.R. at 375-76; <em>see </em>Interim Rule 1) (d)(3)(A) (\u201cRelated proceedings do not include ... counterclaims by the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>in whatever amount against persons filing claims against the estate\u201d). We agree. Furthermore, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this was a \u201crelated proceeding,\u201d the district court complied with the Interim Rule by conducting <em>de novo </em>review and arriving at an independent judgment of the issues involved. <em>See </em>Interim Rule ([ (d)(3)(B), (e)(2)(A)(iii), (e)(2)(B); <em>Moody v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>734 F.2d 1200, 1209-10 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 386, 83 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-6\">B. <em>Alleged MVSFA Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"ahl-dedup-0\">The Georgia MVSFA limits the finance charge that may be imposed on a motor vehicle installment sales contract entered into in Georgia. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-l-33(a). Section 10-l-33(b) provides that the finance charge is to be computed on the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d of the purchase price, and requires that the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d be determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-7\">in accordance with Section 226.8(c) of Regulation Z promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to Title I (Truth in Lending Act) and Title V (General Provisions) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law 90-321, 82 Stat. 146 <em>et seq.), </em>as the same existed upon its becoming effective on July 1, 1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1546-8\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10 \u2014 1\u201433(b); <em>see Ford Motor Co. v. Spann, </em>153 Ga.App. 535, 265 S.E.2d 863, 865 (1980). Section 226.8(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of Regulation Z does not specifically refer to a document preparation fee, but it does provide that the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d of the purchase price shall consist of the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price,\u201d plus \u201c[a]ll other charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount financed but which are not part of the finance charge.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-8(c)(4) (1970); <em>Spann </em>265 S.E.2d at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-16\">Appellant Chrysler Credit contends that the specific components of a document preparation fee do not need to be individually itemized to be included in the unpaid balance of the loan as an \u201cother charge\u201d under Regulation Z and the MVSFA, citing to Fifth and Eleventh Circuit TILA cases interpreting section 226.8(c)(4) of Regulation Z. Appellee Ferris replies that, regardless of the federal courts\u2019 construction of the TILA, the Georgia courts have interpreted the MVSFA to require individual itemization of the components in the present situation, citing to <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Spann, </em>153 Ga.App. 535, 265 S.E.2d 863 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1546-17\">In TILA cases, binding precedents establish that, pursuant to section 226.8(c)(4), a document preparation fee (or other similar charge) which is not a part of the finance charge may be included in the unpaid balance in a finance contract if separately disclosed as an \u201cother charge;\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>further itemization of the specific components of the documentary fee is unnecessary. <em>Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., </em>703 F.2d 525, 528 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Knighten v. Century Dodge, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 1096, 1097 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Layfield v. Bill Heard Chevrolet Co., </em>607 F.2d 1097, 1099 (5th Cir.1979); <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 939, 100 S.Ct. 2161, 64 L.Ed.2d 793 (1980). <em>Meyers v. Clearview Dodge Sales, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 511, 519 (5th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Meyers, </em>431 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 2633, 53 L.Ed.2d 245 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-5\">In <em>Spann, </em>265 S.E.2d 863, the consumer purchaser\u2019s copy of an automobile finance contract contained a $25 charge, included in the amount financed, which was not identified at all. In fact, the charge was a documentary fee, which included license, title, and inspection fees and compensation for certain paperwork involved in obtaining these items. The Georgia Court of Appeals held that the seller violated the MVSFA in that the $25 was included in the unpaid balance \u201cwithout revealing to [the purchaser] what it was for.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865. In so holding, the court cited <em>Meyers, </em>539 F.2d 511, with approval. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1547-6\">The bankruptcy and district courts incorrectly interpreted the <em>Spann </em>case as requiring individual itemization of each specific component of a documentary fee. In our view, the Georgia court\u2019s interpretation of the MVSFA in <em>Spann </em>is entirely consistent with our interpretation of the TILA in <em>Meyers, Knighten, Layfield, </em>and <em>Wallace: </em>a TILA or MVSFA violation occurs if the document preparation fee is added to the unpaid balance of the purchase price without any identification or explanation of the fee; but there is no violation under section 226.8(c)(4) if the charge is identified in the contract as a \u201cdocument preparation\u201d fee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1547-10\">In the present case, the \u201cdoc. preparation\u201d fee, explicitly identified as such and added to the unpaid balance of the purchase price as an \u201cother charge,\u201d was not a finance charge, since it was charged to all consumer purchasers (both cash and credit).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the automobile finance contract complied with section 226.8(c) of Regulation Z of the TILA, and thus with the Georgia MVSFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-11\">The decision of the district court granting judgment to the debtor Ferris in the amount of $2185.89 is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1545-9\">. The Interim Rule was recently held constitutional by this court in <em>In re Committee of Unsecured Creditors of FS Communications Corp., </em>760 F.2d 1194 (11th Cir.1985). The history of the Interim Rule is described in <em>White Motor Corp. v. Citibank, N.A., </em>704 F.2d 254, 256-57, 261-64 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1546-9\">. Section 226.8(c) of Regulation Z as it existed on July 1, 1969, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c) (1970), provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-10\">(c) <em>Credit sales. </em>In the case of a credit sale, in addition to the items required to be disclosed under, paragraph (b) of this section, the following items, as applicable, shall be disclosed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-11\">(1) The cash price of the property or service purchased, using the term \u201ccash price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-12\">(2) The amount of the downpayment itemized, as applicable, as downpayment in money, using the term \"cash downpayment,\u201d downpayment in property, using the term \"trade-in\u201d and the sum, using the term \u201ctotal downpayment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-13\">(3) The difference between the amounts described in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, using the term \"unpaid balance of cash price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-14\">(4) All other charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount financed but which are not part of the finance charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-18\">(5) The sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, using the term \"unpaid balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-19\">(6) Any amounts required to be deducted under paragraph (e) of this section using, as applicable, the terms \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d and \"required deposit balance,\u201d and, if both are applicable, the total of such items using the term \u201ctotal prepaid finance charge and required deposit balance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-20\">(7) The difference between the amounts determined under subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this paragraph, using the term \"amount financed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-21\">(8) Except in the case of a sale of a dwelling:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-22\">(i) The total amount of the finance charge, with description of each amount included, using the terms \"finance charge,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1546-23\">(ii) The sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (1), (4), and (8)(i) of this paragraph, using the term \"deferred payment price.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1547-7\">. Without deciding, we suggest there may be an alternate ground for reversing. A Georgia statute (the MVSFA) defines and governs the claim, and the rule is that we look to the state court for the meaning of a state statute. However, the Georgia legislature elected to define \u201cunpaid balance\u201d in the MVSFA by the meaning of a federal regulation promulgated pursuant to a federal law. If the Georgia Court of Appeals had, in <em>Spann, </em>interpreted the <em>federal </em>regulation contrary to our reading of the same federal regulation in <em>Wallace, Knighten, Layfield </em>and <em>Meyers, </em>would we be bound to adopt its interpretation because we are deciding a Georgia case? We are not persuaded that we should. While the Georgia courts are entitled to our deference in the interpretation of Georgia law, we are at least as competent to interpret section 226.8(c) of Regulation Z as they are. It seems that, where two courts are required to interpret the same law, Georgia courts are unwilling to defer to an interpretation, different from theirs, by a court of a sister jurisdiction. <em>See Motz v. Alropa Corp., </em>192 Ga. 176, 15 S.E.2d 237, 238 (1941); <em>Slaton v. Hall, </em>168 Ga. 710, 715-17, 148 S.E. 741 (1929); <em>see also Frank Briscoe Co. v. Georgia Sprinkler Co., </em>713 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir.1983). Similarly, we might be unwilling to defer to a Georgia court\u2019s interpretation of a federal regulation contrary to our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1547-14\">Inasmuch as we find no conflict between ourselves and the state court in the interpretation of the federal regulation, we need not belabor this intriguing situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1547-15\">. The district court finding that the \"doc. preparation\u201d fee was charged only in credit transactions is clearly erroneous. The only evidence in the record is the testimony from the secretary of the Dodge dealer that this fee was charged to all consumer purchasers. Appellee had the burden of proving otherwise and failed to offer any contrary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
