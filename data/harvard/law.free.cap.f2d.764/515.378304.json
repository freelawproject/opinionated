On December 20, 1984, the District Court transferred all 52 cases, most of which originated in the District of Minnesota, to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court specifically stated that the transfer was granted \u201conly for the purposes of trial,\u201d <em>In re Flight Transportation Corp. Securities Litigation, </em>No. 4-82-874, slip op. 4 (D.Minn. Dec. 20, 1984), and directed the parties to continue to file all documents with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Petitioners object to the transfer on grounds of inconvenience and injustice to the parties. They also claim that some of the consolidated actions could not have been originally brought in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. However, at oral argument a question arose as to whether the District Court had the power under \u00a7 1404 to transfer the cases \u201conly for the purposes of trial,\u201d and we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing this question. These briefs have been filed, and we now hold that the District Court was without power under \u00a7 1404(a) to order transfer for the limited purpose of holding trial in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">The District Court\u2019s order in effect seeks to transfer the place of trial from Minneapolis to Philadelphia, but retain jurisdiction for all other purposes in the District of Minnesota. Section 1404(a) does not authorize such a limited transfer. It is well established that the transferor court under \u00a7 1404 loses all jurisdiction over a case once transfer has occurred. See <em>In re Nine Mile Limited, </em>673 F.2d 242, 243 (8th Cir.1982) (per curiam); 15 Wright, Miller, &amp; Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3846, pp. 228-29 (1976). Thus, once transfer to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania occurs, the District of Minnesota would lose all jurisdiction, and any appeals thereafter would go to the Third Circuit, not to us. Since the District Court\u2019s order attempts both to transfer the cases to Pennsylvania and to retain jurisdiction in Minnesota, it exceeds the transfer power conferred under \u00a7 1404(a). That section contemplates a plenary transfer, and so far as we know a transfer for purposes of trial only is an animal unknown to the law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(b) fortifies us in this conclusion. The Rule provides that \u201cno hearing, other than one ex parte, shall be conducted outside the district without the consent of all parties affected thereby.\u201d It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>true enough, as respondents say, that a rule of procedure should not be construed to restrict or enlarge the statutes pertaining to venue, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 81; but it is also true that the venue statutes, including Section 1404(a), should be construed so far as reasonably practicable not to conflict with the Rules of Civil Procedure. Such a harmonious construction is easy here: nothing in Section 1404(a) even remotely approaches a negation of Rule 77, and no case has ever interpreted the statute to authorize the sort of \u201ctransfer\u201d at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Respondents argue that <em>In re Multidis-trict Civil Actions Involving the Air Crash Disaster Near Hanover, New Hampshire, </em>342 F.Supp. 907 (D.N.H.1971), supports the District Court\u2019s action. We do not so read the case. In the <em>Hanover </em>case, the court transferred several cases which originated outside of the District of New Hampshire to that district for consolidated trial on the issue of liability. The transfer of the liability issue to the District of New Hampshire was not, as here, for the limited purpose of trial. Rather, it was for all purposes, in that all filings and appeals as to that issue were to occur in the District of New Hampshire and the First Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The clerk is directed to issue a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to vacate its order transferring this litigation for trial only to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-16\">.

Weiner, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation as a United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b583-17\">. The present petitioners are Fox &amp; Company, Norwest Bank Minneapolis, N.A., and Norwest Bank Calhoun-Isles, N.A. In addition, plaintiffs James W. Halbach, Robert W. Rhodes, and Charles M. Rogers filed a response to the petition in favor of granting the writ. Defendant Opperman &amp; Paquin has withdrawn its petition for mandamus pending final approval by the District Court of a settlement reached between it and the plaintiffs. American Home Assurance Co., a respondent, has also withdrawn its objections to the venue transfer pending approval of a settlement reached between it and Opperman &amp; Pacquin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">.

Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (1982) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\">. In a post-argument brief filed on March 22, 1985, respondents known as \"class plaintiffs\" or \u201cclaimants\u201d advised us that they intended to ask the District Court to amend its order to convert the transfer to one for all purposes, as is customary under \u00a7 1404(a). They apparently filed such a motion shortly thereafter. More than two months have passed, and so far as we have been advised the motion is still pending. We therefore proceed to address the case in its present transfer-for-trial-only posture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b584-16\">. No different result is required or authorized by the circumstance that the District Court got jurisdiction of some of these cases as a pretrial transferee forum under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407. Under that statute, transfer is for pretrial proceedings only, and when those proceedings are complete, the various cases, unless they have been sooner terminated or properly transferred under \u00a7 1404(a), must return for trial to the courts in which they were originally brought. Respondents now seem to agree that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 is not applicable to the order now under review.
