Resolving each of these issues in favor of the plaintiff-appellee, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">On December 28, 1980, Ronald Sandidge sustained multiple fractures to his mid-back area while employed by Salen Offshore Drilling Company (Salen Offshore). In February 1981, he returned to work in the employ of Salen Protexa Drilling Company (Salen Protexa) as a floorhand-roust-about aboard the rig Salen Energy 4 (formerly Nahautl). The rig was owned and operated by Salen Protexa. On March 10, 1981, Sandidge was struck in the back by an air-powered spinning wrench. Following the second accident, which involved an injury to the same mid-back area that had been injured in the December 1980 accident, Sandidge continued to work for Salen Protexa until August 1982. He received medical treatment as a result of both the December 1980 and March 1981 accidents. He presently suffers pain that allegedly prevents him from returning to his former work.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">On March 14, 1983, Sandidge filed this lawsuit under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, and the general maritime law against both Salen Protexa and Salen Offshore, seeking damages for the personal injuries he sustained in the December 1980 and March 1981 accidents. Discovery proceeded space until, on April 16, 1984, the morning of jury selection, Salen Offshore settled with Sandidge. Sandidge\u2019s claim against Salen Protexa then proceeded to trial with the jury returning a verdict for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Sandidge on April 18, 1984. The district court entered an order entitled \u201cFinal Judgment\u201d on April 23 and Salen Protexa filed its notice of appeal on May 21. Thereafter, on June 4, 1984, the district court dismissed Sandidge\u2019s claim against Salen Offshore with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On appeal, Salen Protexa contends that (1) the district court erred in not permitting Salen Protexa\u2019s counsel to inquire during voir dire whether the prospective jurors would give more weight to a videotaped deposition than to a written deposition; (2) the court abused its discretion in commenting on the modes of presenting deposition testimony; and (3) the court committed reversible error by commenting on an ultimate issue of fact when instructing the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Preliminarily we must consider on our own motion whether we have appellate jurisdiction. On May 21, Salen Protexa filed its notice of appeal from the April 23 judgment \u2014 a judgment that only disposed of Sandidge\u2019s claim against Salen Protexa. Although Sandidge had previously settled his claim with Salen Offshore, that claim was not dismissed from the case until June 4, after Salen Protexa filed its notice of appeal. Hence, regardless of the district court\u2019s nomenclature, the April 23 judgment did not constitute a final judgment at the time it was entered since Sandidge\u2019s claim against Salen Offshore was then still pending. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Moreover, Salen Protexa did not obtain a Rule 54(b) certificate that would have permitted it to take an appeal from the April 23 judgment. Nevertheless, we have consistently held that there is an exception to the requirements of Rule 54(b) that allows the separate appeal of a nonfinal judgment where a subsequent judgment of the district court effectively terminates the litigation. <em>See Alcorn County v. U.S. Interstate Supplies, </em>731 F.2d 1160, 1166 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Mesa Petroleum Co. v. Coniglio, </em>629 F.2d 1022, 1029 n. 7 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Tower v. Moss, </em>625 F.2d 1161, 1164-65 (5th Cir.1980); <em>Jetco Electronic Industries, Inc. v. Gardiner, </em>473 F.2d 1228, 1231 (5th Cir.1973); <em>see also Cape May Greene, Inc. v. Warren, </em>698 F.2d 179, 184-85 (3d Cir. 1983); <em>Martin v. Campbell, </em>692 F.2d 112, 114 (11th Cir.1982); <em>Pireno v. New York State Chiropractic Association </em>650 F.2d 387, 389-90 n. 4 (2d Cir.1981), <em>aff\u2019d sub nom. Union Labor Life Insurance Co. v. Pireno, </em>458 U.S. 119, 102 S.Ct. 3002, 73 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982); <em>Anderson v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>630 F.2d 677, 680-81 (9th Cir.1980). In <em>Jetco, </em>the district court dismissed the action as to one of three defendants, who then filed a premature notice of appeal, and several months later the court entered an agreed judgment as to the remaining defendants. We gave effect to the notice of appeal as of the date of the agreed judgment, heeding the admonition of <em>Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>379 U.S. 148, 152, 85 S.Ct. 308, 310, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), that \u201cpractical, not technical considerations are to govern the application of principles of finality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In the instant case, we do not confront any of the specific prohibitions against giving effect to premature notices of appeal that are enumerated in Fed.R. App.P. 4(a)(4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Alcorn County, </em>731 F.2d at 1166. \u201c[Tjhere is no danger of piecemeal appeal confronting us if we find jurisdiction here, for nothing else remains in the federal courts.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>630 F.2d at 681. Hence, because the June 4 dismissal of Salen Offshore, when viewed in conjunction with the April 23 judgment against Salen Protexa, effectively terminated this litigation, we find that we have appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, we turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">During the voir dire examination, which was conducted by counsel, Sandidge\u2019s at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>torney asked if any of the jurors felt they could not pay attention to evidence presented by videotape rather than by live testimony. The court allowed the question. During the voir dire by Salen Protexa\u2019s counsel, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">COUNSEL: [Sandidge\u2019s counsel] asked you if any of you had a problem with regard to a video deposition of the doctor. We will also be reading a deposition of an independent medical exam done by Dr. Greg Hanson____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">COUNSEL: What I want to ask about that, <em>whether anyone on this jury panel would give any more weight to the evidence presented by video deposition which is basically live deposition of a doctor, versus the written transcript or deposition that was taken out of court. </em>Is there anyone that feels the video is more substantial or consequential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">THE COURT: You can\u2019t ask the jury to give weight to it. <em>It is up to the jury to give how much weight to the testimony they want to give. </em>You can\u2019t ask what weight they will give. They don\u2019t know. They haven\u2019t heard either one, so they really can\u2019t answer your questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALo\">Jurors, let me explain something to you. Normally testimony comes to you in two forms in these trials. It comes in the forms of witnesses\u2019 testimony, that is, answers to questions that the lawyers ask witnesses on the witness stand and the answer the witnesses give under oath to the question to the lawyer is the evidence in the case for which you will decide]] whatever issues are submitted to you, whatever controversies are submitted to you for your decision. That\u2019s one form of evidence. It is ideal for it to be presented to you from the witness stand, where there are disputes, that\u2019s where one witness says one thing, another witness is saying something else or is saying the opposite. You have to figure out which witness is right, which witness is wrong, which one is being truthful and which one\u2019s not being truthful or which \u25a0is correct and which is mistaken. <em>So, obviously, when you sit and observe the witness and listen to the witness\u2019 testimony it enables you to better perform this function. </em>Sometimes a witness cannot be questioned until a deposition is taken and the deposition is taken much like testimony is given in a courtroom. That is, lawyers from both sides in turn ask the witness questions. The witness answers the questions and there is a video camera trained on the witness and you see him and observe him as you would someone talking on television. Here again, you have an opportunity to observe the witness\u2019 mannerisms and his demeanor as he testifies whether or not he delays in his answers or whatever. Sometimes neither of those systems for whatever reasons, neither of those systems are available, so you have what we call a written deposition. While the witness is orally asked questions by the lawyer, then those questions are transcribed in the form of a little book and then questions and answers are read to the jury in the courtroom. <em>This is not an ideal way to present testimony because you jurors are not able to judge the witness by observing him as he speaks, </em>but it is certainly better than being deprived of the testimony completely. So, you as jurors will have to do the best you can with the situation you are faced with. <em>You decide of how much you heard, what credible evidence is and what the believable evidence is. </em>So, it\u2019s handled this way because it\u2019s the best way it can be done under the circumstances. <em>You are entitled, jurors, to give all the testimony or any part of the testimony whatever weight you think it\u2019s entitled to. </em>Right now you can\u2019t be asked what you believe \u2014 what you would believe and what you wouldn\u2019t believe, because you don\u2019t know. But, that\u2019s basically the way it is done. I think that\u2019s what counsel is trying to say. It may be presented in different forms. You will just have to pass judgment on it as best you can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">Is that clear to everybody now?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Record Yol. Ill at 26-29 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Salen Protexa argues that the court\u2019s action in not allowing its question regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing the videotaped deposition, and in permitting Sandidge\u2019s, established a prejudicial double standard which was exacerbated by the court\u2019s statements concerning the credibility and weight to be attributed to the depositions. Salen Protexa contends that its \u201cquestioning of potential jurors was not as to what weight they would give to one particular witness as opposed to another, rather it was directed to the credibility of the two classes of testimony, written and video depositions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6. Salen Protexa insists that the court\u2019s comments indicated to the jurors the amount of credibility they should give to the two types of testimony and, as such, were clearly prejudicial. Hence, Salen Pro-texa concludes, the court\u2019s actions did not meet the essential demands of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Not unexpectedly, Sandidge offers an altogether different view of the exchange, arguing that the trial judge merely prevented Salen Protexa\u2019s counsel from attempting to commit the jury in advance to give weight to testimony that had not yet been presented and that the judge instructed the jury accordingly. Further, Sandidge states that the court\u2019s comments merely reflect the oft-repeated, common-sense notion that greater deference is due credibility determinations by factfinders who have been able to observe the demeanor of a witness giving testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Before addressing the parties\u2019 contentions, we note that Salen Protexa bears a difficult burden on its claim of error regarding the court\u2019s actions and comments during voir dire. First, rulings on the scope of voir dire are committed to the discretion of the trial court and the failure to permit certain questions is not grounds for reversal absent a showing of error and prejudice. <em>See Keyes v. Lauga, </em>635 F.2d 330, 333 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also DeLaCruz v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>405 F.2d 459, 462 (5th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 908, 89 S.Ct. 1749, 23 L.Ed.2d 221 (1969). Second, because Salen Protexa failed to object to the trial court\u2019s allegedly erroneous comments, we must consider its contentions on appeal under the plain error standard. <em>See Peel v. American Fidelity Assurance Co., </em>680 F.2d 374, 377 (5th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cReversal is not required under that standard unless there has been a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Morreale v. Downing, </em>630 F.2d 286, 290 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing Salen Protexa\u2019s question. Salen Protexa\u2019s counsel expressly asked whether anyone on the jury panel would give more weight to evidence presented by videotaped deposition than to that presented by a written deposition. In not allowing the question, it must have been the court\u2019s view that the question in effect asked the jury how it would weigh evidence it had not heard. Clearly, this would not be a proper line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">We have held in a personal injury case that the trial court was not required to put to prospective jurors on voir dire questions as to whether they would be impressed by certain types of testimony on damages. <em>DeLaCruz, </em>405 F.2d at 462. In <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>448 F.2d 539, 542-43 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1063, 92 S.Ct. 750, 30 L.Ed.2d 775 (1972), a criminal case, we held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to ask the jurors on voir dire if they were more apt to believe the testimony of a police officer solely because he was a police officer than they were the defendant, observing: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the question, as framed, amounts to an ingenious effort to commit a juror in advance as to how he will handle credibility choices between <em>a government official and the defendant, </em>before either of them takes the witness stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542-43 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>United States v. Caggiano, </em>667 F.2d 1176, 1178 (5th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Gassaway, </em>456 F.2d 624, 626 (5th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Vadino, </em>680 F.2d 1329, 1336-37 (11th Cir.1982) (following Fifth Circuit rule established in <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Gassaway), cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1082,103 S.Ct. 1771, 76 L.Ed.2d 344 (1983); <em>Ross v. United States, </em>374 F.2d 97 (8th Cir.) (not error for court to refuse to ask venirepersons whether testimony of government investigator was entitled to more weight than testimony of any other witness) (Blackmun, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 882, 88 S.Ct. 130, 19 L.Ed.2d 177 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In <em>Hinkle v. Hampton, </em>388 F.2d 141 (10th Cir.1968), the Tenth Circuit held that the trial court properly refused to permit the plaintiff in an automobile accident case to question a jury panel on voir dire as to whether members of the panel had the same confidence in osteopathic physicians and medical doctors and would give equal credence to a member of either profession who testified as a witness. Acknowledging the impropriety of questioning jurors as to the weight they would give the testimony of one particular witness as opposed to another, the plaintiff in <em>Hinkle </em>contended that the question he posed probed whether equal credence, not weight, would be given to classes of witnesses. The court rejected this contention, reasoning that the plaintiffs question sought a commitment in advance that the jurors would give \u201cequal credence\u201d to the witnesses regardless of factors other than their profession. Thus, the \u201c[p]laintiff s question, if followed out, could have restricted the jury\u2019s deliberations,\u201d and the trial court properly refused it. <em>Id. </em>at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Likewise, in the case at bar, it could be said that Salen Protexa\u2019s question whether the jurors would give more weight to a videotaped deposition than a written deposition sought a commitment in advance as to the amount of credit they would give to that class of evidence. The thrust of the question did not further the purpose of voir dire \u2014 i.e., discerning bias or prejudice in prospective jurors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 and the district court was well within its discretion in not allowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Nor did the court set a double standard in allowing Sandidge\u2019s question and refusing Salen Protexa\u2019s. The principle distinguishing proper from improper inquiry on voir dire is that examination cannot search the result of a case in advance. <em>See Hinkle v. Hampton, </em>388 F.2d at 143 (quoting <em>Chavez v. United States, </em>258 F.2d 816, 819 (10th Cir.1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 916, 79 S.Ct. 592, 3 L.Ed.2d 577 (1959)). This principle informed the <em>Hinkle </em>court\u2019s explanation that \u201c[h]ad the question been whether the jurors would have credited a medical doctor over an osteopath simply because he was a medical doctor, or if it had been an inquiry whether the jurors would discount the testimony of an osteopath simply because he was an osteopath, the <em>Sellers </em>principle [holding that a question directed to the credibility of two classes of witnesses was proper] would be pertinent.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 388 F.2d at 143. In the instant case, Sandidge\u2019s inquiry was simply directed at whether the jurors would pay attention to videotaped testimony or would harbor prejudice against the party presenting it. Hence, the query furthered the voir dire\u2019s traditional function of discerning bias or prejudice in prospective jurors and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not seek to elicit a pledge from the jurors as to the amount of credit they would give certain evidence. In contrast, Salen Pro-texa\u2019s question expressly asked whether the jurors would give more weight to a videotaped deposition than to a written deposition, thereby impermissibly searching the result of the case in advance. Like the <em>Hinkle </em>court, we could possibly formulate a permissible question that presumably would have attained Salen Protexa\u2019s objective in posing its question during voir dire, but such is not our task. <em>But see United States v. Jackson, </em>448 F.2d at 542-43. It is enough to state here that Salen Pro-texa\u2019s question, if followed out, could have restricted the jury\u2019s deliberations. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">A trial court may not properly instruct a jury that a written deposition is entitled to less weight than live testimony. <em>See Wright Root Beer Co. v. Dr. Pepper Co., </em>414 F.2d 887, 889-90 (5th Cir.1969); <em>see also In re Air Crash Disaster, </em>635 F.2d 67, 87 (2d Cir.1980) (Mansfield, J., dissenting); 8 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2146, at 458 (1971) (\u201cThough live testimony is preferred, depositions, when admissible, are not to be treated as a form of second-class evidence.\u201d). By analogy, it is not proper for a trial court to instruct a jury that a written deposition is entitled to less weight than a videotaped deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Salen Protexa contends that the district court did just this by telling the jury panel that the testimony from a witness by videotape was substantially better than testimony by written deposition. This contention mischaracterizes the nature of the court\u2019s comments regarding the depositions. The court merely suggested that it was more difficult to determine how much weight to accord written testimony, not that it was entitled to less weight.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, both in its comments to the jurors during voir dire and in its charge to the jury after trial, the district court explicitly stated that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine how much weight should be given to the testimony. Clearly, the district court\u2019s unobjected-to comments, when reviewed in context, do not amount to fundamental error resulting in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">One of Salen Protexa\u2019s defenses at trial was that the March 1981 accident did nothing more than temporarily aggravate the injury Sandidge sustained in December 1980 while in the employ of Salen Offshore. The evidence at trial showed that Sandidge returned to work in February 1981, after the first accident, although he continued to suffer pain and was under pain medication. After the March 1981 accident, Sandidge again returned to work, even performing a one-week hitch as a roustabout, but he continued to suffer pain. He later switched to less strenuous duty but nonetheless worked on the rig through at least July 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Salen Protexa asserts that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the aggravation issue by reaching beyond the evidence presented at trial to comment upon an ultimate issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The trial judge instructed the jury that Sandidge would be entitled to recover against Salen Protexa if the jury found that Salen Protexa caused him injury that aggravated a pre-existing condition. He illustrated his instruction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">Let\u2019s say at the time of the injury Mr. Sandidge was suffering pain, but he wasn\u2019t disabled. He could work despite his pain but after the injury and because of it he couldn\u2019t work any more. <em>Let\u2019s just suppose </em>\u2014 forget <em>this case for a moment. </em>Let\u2019s say you have a case where a person has an injury and as a result of that injury he suffers pain but he works and is able to work. Then he has another accident and as a result of that accident, he still suffers pain, the same pain he had before and let\u2019s say the proof in that case showed that irrespective of the second injury he would have had pain anyway, the same amount of pain, but now he is also disabled. Now he is disabled because of the second injury when superimposed on the first injury rendered him disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">Then, in that instance all the disability would be attributable under the law to the second injury, you see, because he didn\u2019t have the disability before the second injury, even though in his condition, even though had he been perfectly healthy he might not have had that kind of an affect [sic] from the second injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">By the same token, this second injury did not in any way cause any increase in his pain or change in his painful condition, so he already had that pain so he lives with it, he wouldn\u2019t recover for the pain, but for the second injury, the pain from his first injury would have gone away or from the second injury he suffered additional pain, then he\u2019d be entitled to recover for that additional pain. Or had the pain gone away from the first injury but it didn\u2019t because of the second injury, he\u2019d be entitled to recover for that pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\n<em>I\u2019m just giving you that example to be sure you don\u2019t get confused on this question we have here because of the two injuries.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">In other words, if you believe from the evidence in this case, for example, that Mr. Sandidge had his first injury then he had the second injury and you don\u2019t believe he suffered any pain because of his second injury, then he wouldn\u2019t be entitled to recover for pain and because all the pain would be from the first injury whether he had the second injury or not. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here on this question about aggravation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">Record Vol. IV at 260-62 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Out of the presence of the jury, Salen Protexa\u2019s counsel objected to the court\u2019s instruction, asserting that (1) the court had not instructed the jury that, if the second injury was only temporary, Sandidge was not entitled to recover for injuries sustained in the first accident; (2) the court had recited the evidence in a manner prejudicial to Salen Protexa by stating that San-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>didge had no disability when he returned to work after the first accident but that he was incapable of working after the second accident because, in fact, he did work for sixteen months after the second accident; and (3) the court should have instructed the jury that, if it found that Sandidge\u2019s present and possible future problems were caused by the first accident, it should not consider these problems as arising from the March 1981 accident. Although the district judge disagreed with Salen Pro-texa\u2019s representation of his instruction, he agreed to issue a supplemental instruction. When the jury returned, he further charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">I\u2019ll have to give you some additional instructions. I want to give you some instructions. As I said, <em>during my instructions I made some illustrative comments to try to explain the application of the rule of law and at times I resorted to certain hypothetical matters. </em>Of course, I did not mention every scrap of evidence you have heard, nor did I use much of the evidence that was related to you in my charge, but <em>those part that I did use were simply for illustrative purposes. </em>I did not intend for you to give any additional emphasis to those particular things. That\u2019s not the purpose of it. <em>You are the judges of the evidence and the weight of the evidence and you consider all the evidence, whether I mentioned it or not in my charge, in deciding this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Further, one of the counsel has indicated that I said to you when Mr. San-didge returned to work that he had no disability after the first injury. If I did say that, I certainly did not intend to say that because I didn\u2019t intend to say he did have a disability or didn\u2019t have a disability. <em>You heard the evidence in the case so you decide if he was disabled when he went back to work or not and, if so, how much. That is for your determination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">So, if I made any comment like that, it was unintentional on my part. <em>I\u2019m not saying either way, because that\u2019s not my prerogative, it's yours, it is your prerogative as jurors.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">When you go back into the jury room to deliberate and finally, of course, as I asserted in my original charge, but there is some question about it, certainly as I told you earlier the defendant is not liable for any disability or injury or pain that Mr. Sandidge may have suffered in the first accident. That accident is in this case only because of the second accident. That\u2019s all. The defendant is not liable for anything that happened in the first accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">What I did say was the fact a person was injured previously does not diminish any right that he has to damages if he is subsequently injured as to any damages that flow from the second accident as it may have aggravated the condition he had from the first accident or condition he may have had from birth or whatever. That was my intended purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Record Vol. IV at 265-67 (emphasis added). Salen Protexa made no objection to the supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Salen Protexa contends that, in charging the jury on the aggravation issue, the district court improperly commented upon the ultimate fact issue of disability. Specifically, Salen Protexa points to the first hypothetical posed by the court in which the court assumed that \u201cat the time of the injury Mr. Sandidge was suffering pain, <em>but he wasn\u2019t disabled,\u201d </em>and Salen Protexa asserts that this statement was not supported by the evidence. The district court, Salen Protexa concludes, committed prejudicial error by impressing its own view of the facts on the jury and thereby invading the province of the factfinder. At no point does Salen Protexa argue that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The standard for reviewing an instruction is whether the jury was misled in any way and whether it had an understanding of the issues and its duty to determine those issues. <em>See Pierce v. Ramsey Winch Co., </em>753 F.2d 416, 424-26 (5th Cir. 1985); <em>Robert v. Conti Carriers &amp; Termi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>nals, Inc., </em>692 F.2d 22, 24 (5th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe function of the reviewing court with respect to instructions is to satisfy itself that the instructions show no tendency to confuse or to mislead the jury with respect to the applicable principles of law.\u201d <em>Rohner, Gehrig &amp; Co. v. Capital City Bank, </em>655 F.2d 571, 580 (5th Cir. 1981) (citing 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2558). No harmful error is committed if the charge viewed as a whole correctly instructs the jury on the law, even though a portion is technically imperfect. <em>See Pierce v. Ramsey Winch Co., </em>753 F.2d at 424-26. A district judge has wide discretion to select his own words and to charge in his own style, <em>see Andry v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>478 F.2d 758, 759 (5th Cir.1973) (citing <em>Bass v. International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, </em>630 F.2d 1058, 1061 (5th Cir.1980)), which includes the use of illustrations to clarify an instruction. <em>See Martin v. Texaco, Inc., </em>726 F.2d 207, 214 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Andry v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>478 F.2d at 759. \u201cMoreover, the trial court has a duty to give instructions that are meaningful and translated into terms the jury can understand.\u201d <em>Martin v. Texaco, Inc., </em>726 F.2d at 214. Although the district court has the right to comment on the evidence, it may not comment on the ultimate factual issues to be decided. <em>See Belton v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>724 F.2d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>see also Travelers Insurance Co. v. Ryan, </em>416 F.2d 362, 364 (5th Cir.1969); <em>cf Quercia v. United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933) (trial judge\u2019s instruction in criminal case that testifying defendant\u2019s mannerisms indicated that he was lying constituted prejudicial error). \u201c[Ejxplanatory comments are prejudicial only when the court fails to make clear to the jurors that they alone have the burden of decision.\u201d <em>Reyes v. Wyeth Laboratories, </em>498 F.2d 1264, 1292 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1096, 95 S.Ct. 687, 42 L.Ed.2d 688 (1974); <em>see </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2886. Although Salen Protexa objected to the court\u2019s instruction at the charge conference between court and counsel, it failed to raise any objection to the court\u2019s supplemental instruction, which was issued at the bidding of Salen Protexa to correct any error the court may have made in its previous instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When no objection is raised to a jury charge in the trial court, we cannot consider it on appeal, Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, unless the error is so fundamental as to result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Higgins v. Smith International, Inc., </em>716 F.2d 278, 283 n. 4 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Whiting v. Jackson State University, </em>616 F.2d 116, 126-27 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Reviewing the court\u2019s instruction as a whole in the light of the foregoing principles, we find that the charge was not improper, much less on error so fundamental as to result in a miscarriage of justice. The allegedly prejudicial remarks pointed to by Salen Protexa are clearly made in the context of a hypothetical involving a work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>er who becomes disabled after a second accident. The remarks did not convey the sense that there was but one way to view the evidence. In the supplemental charge, the court expressly indicated that its prior remarks had been made in hypothetic form for illustrative purposes. Moreover, the court\u2019s instruction included a hypothetical incorporating Salen Protexa\u2019s theory of the case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These illustrations were utilized to clarify the court\u2019s instruction on the law and did not amount to impermissible comment upon an ultimate issue of fact. The court\u2019s instruction further emphasized that the jury bore the burden of decision on the issue of disability. Because the court made it plain that the jury bore this burden, and because its instruction did not mislead or confuse the jury as to the applicable law, we find that the court did not plainly err in charging the jury on the aggravation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Finally, Sandidge contends that this appeal is frivolous and warrants an award of double costs and attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cCourts of appeals may award damages, including attorney\u2019s fees and single or double costs, to an appellee when an appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Hagerty v. Succession of Clement, </em>749 F.2d 217, 221 (5th Cir.1984); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912; Fed.R.App.P. 38. Although Salen Protexa does not challenge the evidentiary support for the jury\u2019s findings on liability and damages, its claims of error, though not compelling, are hardly so devoid of merit as to be frivolous. Therefore, Sandidge is not entitled to an award of fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court and decline to award Sandidge costs or fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">.

The <em>Sellers </em>court held that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to ask the jury whether any of the jurors were inclined to give more weight to the testimony of a police officer merely because he was a police officer than other witnesses in the case. <em>Contra United States v. Jackson, supra, </em>and its progeny; <em>Chavez v. United States, </em>258 F.2d 816 (10th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 916, 79 S.Ct. 592, 3 L.Ed.2d 577 (1959) (holding that the trial court did not err by refusing to ask whether prospective jurors would place a greater amount of weight upon the testimony of law enforcement officers over that of the defendants).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\">. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 99 A.L.R.2d 7 (1965 &amp; Supp.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b327-5\">. Courts often refer to the factfinder\u2019s unique advantage in evaluating evidence which comes from observing the demeanor of witnesses appearing in court. <em>See, e.g., Onaway Transp. Co. v. Offshore Tugs, Inc., </em>695 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1983); <em>Caradelis v. Refineria Panama, S.A., </em>384 F.2d 589 (5th Cir.1967). Appellate courts are prone to give greater deference to the findings of fact of a district court that has had the opportunity to observe a witness give his testimony. <em>See Onaway Transp. Co., </em>695 F.2d at 200. In his comments during voir dire, the district judge was not suggesting, however, that the jurors should prefer, in the sense of assigning weight, the videotaped evidence over the evidence presented by written deposition. Instead, the court was merely intimating that the jurors could more easily assign weight and make credibility choices given evidence that allowed them to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. In <em>United States v. Tunnell, </em>667 F.2d 1182 (5th Cir. 1982), we observed of a videotaped deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">The videotape made it possible for the trial court to gauge [the witness\u2019] attitude more accurately than would have been possible with just a cold deposition record. This is a very persuasive argument for the use of videotape depositions in lieu of the traditional transcriptions. The trial judge was able to note [the witness\u2019] attitude reflected by his motions, facial expressions, demeanor, and voice inflections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1188. This has been the constant refrain of courts and commentators discussing the advantages of videotaped depositions. <em>See, e.g., Lamb v.
