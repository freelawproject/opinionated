By meeting the requirements of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-221, Title V, \u00a7 501, 94 Stat. 161 (1980) (codified at 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1735\u00cd-7 note) (the \u201cAct\u201d) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), <em>see </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4, certain financing agreements preempt state law interest ceilings, thereby enabling creditors to charge a rate of interest in excess of state law limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-26\">In the other case, a panel of this Court had held that, although a contract need not contain express terms tracking the provisions of the statute or regulations to qualify for preemption, \u201ca creditor cannot obtain the benefits of preemption if the financing agreement contains express provisions authorizing conduct <em>contrary </em>to the statute or regulations.\u201d <em>Quiller v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., </em>727 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>1067 (11th Cir.1984). That panel opinion has now been reinstated by the <em>en banc </em>court. <em>Quitter v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 1400 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc). In this case the Court now decides that the different contract provisions before us are not clearly contrary to the requirements of the statute and regulations, so the creditors are entitled to the benefits of federal preemption. The district court\u2019s dismissal of this action is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\">\n<em>The Grants\u2019 Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">In February 1982, plaintiffs Jack and Evelyn Grant purchased a mobile home from Hutchinson Homes, Inc. The parties entered into a retail sales installment agreement on a form contract prepared by defendant General Electric Credit Corporation (GECC), to which Hutchinson Homes assigned the contract shortly after the Grants took possession of the mobile home. The interest rate on the contract exceeded an add-on rate of 13.6%, 3.6% higher than the 10% maximum finance charge then allowed under the Georgia Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10-1-30 to -38 (Michie 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">In March 1983, the Grants instituted a class action against GECC in federal district court alleging a violation of Georgia Usury law and seeking damages and in-junctive relief. Anticipating that GECC would raise the defense that the interest rate was valid under section 501 of the federal Act, the Grants alleged that the GECC contract lacked the consumer protections required by the Act as a condition to exempting the finance charge from the state usury law interest ceilings. The district court dismissed the action as preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-7\">The Grants contend the GECC contract failed to comply with the FHLBB regulations in five particulars. Four of these instances involve the following language contained in one sentence of the GECC contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1474-8\">In the event of Buyer\u2019s default in payment when due, Seller may declare immediately due and payable any and all installments due or to become due hereunder, less the unearned portion of that part of the <em>FINANCE CHARGE </em>designated as Time Price Differential calculated by the Pro-Rata Method provided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure default before Seller is permitted to exercise that right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1474-10\">Following the holding in <em>Quitter, </em>we examine separately, in the order in which they were presented, arguments that the GECC contract is directly contrary to the federal statute and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-11\">\n<em>Right to Notice Prior to Acceleration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-12\">The Grants contend that the phrase \u201cSeller may declare immediately due and payable any and all installments due or to become due hereunder ...\u201d is a \u201cterm or condition\u201d of the contract that fails to comply with 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h), which states that \u201cno action ... to accelerate payment of the entire outstanding balance of the obligation ... may be taken against the debtor until 30 days after the creditor sends the debtor a notice of default.\u201d The contract language, the Grants argue, reserves for GECC the right to declare the entire contract \u201cimmediately due and payable,\u201d contrary to the 30-day notice required by the regulations. The GECC contract contains, however, the qualifying clause \u201cprovided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure default before Seller is permitted to exercise that right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-13\">As held in <em>Quitter, </em>the federal preemption statute does not require a disclosure in the contract of the notice rights given by the Act and regulations, nor does it eliminate the creditor\u2019s right to accelerate upon default. A creditor is required to send the debtor a notice of default providing a 30-day grace period during which the debtor may correct the default and continue with the contract as though the default had not occurred. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h). The GECC contract\u2019s qualifying clause, which is cast in mandatory terms, unambiguously informs the debtor that he or she \u201cshall be given notice of right to cure default\u201d before \u201cseller is permitted\u201d to exercise its right to accelerate. Although the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>does not reveal that the debtor has 30 days in which to cure the default, there is no contention that notices sent to the Grants failed to notify them of the 30-day grace period. That grace period is prominently revealed in the sample notice of default and right to cure contained in the regulations. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-5\">This \u201cterm or condition\u201d of the contract is not contrary to the statute and regulations governing federal preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"AKI\">\n<em>Acceleration of the Entire Balance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-6\">The Grants also contend that the acceleration provision of the contract is contrary to the following portion of the FHLBB regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1475-7\">In the case of default in payments, the sum stated in the notice may only include payments in default and applicable late or deferral charges. If the debtor cures the default within 30 days of the postmark of the notice and subsequently defaults a second time, the creditor shall again give notice as described above. The debtor is not entitled to notice of default more than twice in any one-year period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1475-8\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h). The Grants argue that the contract provision allowing GECC to accelerate \u201call installments due or to become due hereunder, less the unearned portion of the finance charge\u201d is contrary to the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-9\">The quoted portion of the regulations, however, refers to the content of the notice of default, not to the provisions of the contract. There is no allegation that GECC sent the Grants a notice of default with language contrary to that of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-10\">\n<em>Provisions Concerning Right to Cure Default</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-11\">The Grants argue that because 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) requires that a debtor be given the right to cure any default for 30 days, and because notice of that fact must be communicated to the debtor, the GECC contract\u2019s reference to an undefined \u201cnotice of right to cure\u201d is inadequate. Again, however, the Grants take the regulation\u2019s requirements for the notice of default and attempt to apply them to the terms of the contract itself. The regulation does <em>not </em>provide that \u201cno contact qualifies for preemption\u201d unless it discloses the 30-day notice, but rather that \u201cno action ... to accelerate ... may be taken\u201d without the notice. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h); <em>see Quiller, </em>727 F.2d at 1070. Thus, the notice section of the regulations is in direct contrast with other sections of the regulations which expressly require disclosure of certain information within the loan contract. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(d) (\u201cThe right to prepay shall be disclosed in the loan contract____\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 590.4(f) (\u201cNo late charge may be assessed, imposed, or collected unless provided for by written contract between the creditor and debtor.\u201d). As the <em>Quiller </em>court held, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) does not require creditors to recite in the loan contract the specific rights of a defaulting debtor. 727 F.2d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-15\">\n<em>Right to Notice Prior to Repossession or Foreclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-16\">The Grants contend that the Act itself requires that preemption contracts disclose a defaulting debtor\u2019s right to 30 days notice prior to repossession or foreclosure. The GECC contract is silent with regard to foreclosure and repossession. Thus, in the absence of express contractual terms authorizing conduct contrary to federal law, this argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Quiller </em>that \u201cto qualify for federal preemption under the Act the financing agreement need not contain an express term guaranteeing the debtor thirty days notice before repossession or foreclosure.\u201d 727 F.2d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-17\">Although the Grants have not claimed that the GECC contract contains terms or conditions contrary to the right to a 30-day notice prior to repossession or foreclosure, they contend that absence of any reference to that right permits the creditor to repossess without notice by operation of Georgia law. In Georgia, a creditor may repossess by self help without notice unless the contract contains a specific provision to the contrary. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-9-503; <em>see also Ford Motor Credit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number><em>Co. v. Hunt, </em>241 Ga. 342, 245 S.E.2d 295 (1978). A creditor may also foreclose upon 7-days notice pursuant to a judicial writ of possession. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-231, -232(b). The Grants' argument fails for the simple reason that the issue before us is not what Georgia law requires, but what the federal preemption scheme requires, as there appears to be no question of fact as to whether the parties intended to enter a federal preemption contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-4\">We recognize that in individual cases the lack of specific contract language might allow an unscrupulous creditor to foreclose or repossess without notice by preying on consumers unaware of their notice rights under federal law or by litigating before state court judges who might interpret the agreement under Georgia law due to unfamiliarity with the complexities of the federal preemption scheme. But there is no allegation that GECC conducted its business in such a manner. Such an argument would convert the law into a disclosure act. Arguments for such a change must be addressed to the FHLBB or Congress, not to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-5\">\n<em>Right of Prepayment Without Penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"al--dedup-0\">As a final challenge to the contract itself, the Grants focus on the requirement of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-6\">A debtor may prepay in full or in part the unpaid balance of the loan at any time without penalty. The right to prepay shall be disclosed in the loan contract in type larger than that used for the body of the document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1476-7\">The Grants argue the type size of the print was not larger than that used in the body of the contract. A review of the contract reveals that the prepayment clause is set in type clearly larger than that of the text surrounding it which comprises the \u201cbody\u201d of the contract. Although certain headings and clauses in other parts of the contract are set in larger or bolder type, the type size used here is larger than \u201cthe body of the document\u201d and fulfills the regulation\u2019s purpose to call attention to the provision. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. 43684 (June 30, 1980). The regulation does not require the disclosure in the largest type used in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-9\">Significantly, the version of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(d) originally proposed by the FHLBB required that the prepayment clause be \u201cconspicuously disclosed in the loan contract.\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. 31124 (May 5, 1980). The FHLBB replaced that phrase with the current type-size requirement because \u201cthe Board agree[d] that [the \u201cconspicuous\u201d requirement] may be potentially troublesome.\u201d 45 Fed.Reg. 43684 (June 30, 1980). This litigation demonstrates that the alteration in the regulations failed to eliminate \u201ctroublesome\u201d disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-10\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Failure to Show Loan\u2019s Entitlement to Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcmE\">As an alternative ground for reversal, the Grants urge that GECC made no showing that the financing transaction was a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d eligible for preemption under the Act. Throughout the proceedings in the district court, however, the Grants never suggested that given an appropriate contract this financing transaction would fail to qualify for preemption. For instance, in their complaint plaintiffs admitted that \u201c[f]ederal law would have allowed additional interest to be charged had the lender complied with certain prerequisites specified in the federal statute,\u201d and then proceeded to enumerate the alleged contractual shortcomings. The closest the Grants came to raising the \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d argument in the district court was in their opposition to GECC\u2019s motion to dismiss, which remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1476-11\">Defendant has made no showing in that regard but assuming, for the sake of argument, that the transaction would meet the definition of a \u201cfederally-related mortgage loan,\u201d the next question is whether the terms and conditions of the credit sales contract allow it to be preempted from the state law that would normally govern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1476-12\">Aside from this isolated statement, which hardly amounts to much more than conceding the issue, the Grants never mentioned, much less argued, to the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>court that their financing transaction could not come under the Act. The thrust of the complaint and other papers filed there reflect only the central argument that the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the GECC contract failed to satisfy the requirements of the Act and regulations. Having failed to raise the issue before the district court, the Grants cannot raise the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Case v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>294 F.2d 676, 678 (5th Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-6\">The provisions of the GECC contract before us differ significantly from those in the contract found to be contrary to the federal statute and regulations in <em>Quiller. </em>We held that the language in the <em>Quiller </em>contract inaccurately stated the creditor\u2019s rights under the federal preemption scheme by permitting the creditor (1) to foreclose on the loan \u201cwithout notice;\u201d (2) to repossess \u201cwithout notice or demand for performance or legal process;\u201d and (3) to demand payment of the full balance upon the debtor\u2019s default or the creditor\u2019s insecurity \u201cwithout notice.\u201d 727 F.2d at 1072. The contract\u2019s qualification that these express contractual powers of the creditor were \u201csubject to any notice of right to cure\u201d was held to be vague and equivocal, and in any event, inconsistent with the three specific reservations of creditor\u2019s rights to be exercised \u201cwithout notice.\u201d In contrast, GECC\u2019s contract makes no mention of the creditor\u2019s right to foreclose or repossess upon the debtor\u2019s default, nor does it purport to assume such powers in the event of the creditor\u2019s general \u201cinsecurity.\u201d The only specific reservation that GECC did make concerns the right to accelerate upon default. This right is expressly conditioned in clear, mandatory terms upon the debtor\u2019s receipt of notice of right to cure a default prior to acceleration. In sum, the affirmative misrepresentations of the debtor\u2019s federal statutory guarantees that existed in the agreement in <em>Quiller </em>are not present in the GECC contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-7\">Having held that the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of the GECC contract satisfied the prerequisites for obtaining the protection of the Federal preemption scheme, we need not address defendant\u2019s argument that the Grants\u2019 state law claim is foreclosed by Georgia\u2019s one-year statute of limitations for usury actions. The order of the district court dismissing the Grants\u2019 complaint is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-10\">KRAVITCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom GODBOLD, Chief Judge, and VANCE, Circuit Judge, join:</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-11\">I respectfully dissent. In <em>Quiller v. Barclays American/Credit, Inc., </em>727 F.2d 1067 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), this court reinstated the panel\u2019s opinion, which held that a contract containing terms contrary to the requirements of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735f-7 (note), and regulations promulgated thereunder, is not entitled to the protection of federal preemption of state interest rate ceilings. In this case, the majority perceives sufficient distinctions between the language, of the <em>Quiller </em>contract and the one under scrutiny here to warrant assertion of the preemption defense. Although I agree that General Electric Credit Corporation\u2019s (GECC) contract does not suffer from the same defects as the <em>Quiller </em>contract, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that GECC\u2019s contract is entitled to protection under the federal preemption scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-12\">In <em>Quiller, </em>we began our analysis of the contract by admonishing that \u201cwe should examine the contract through the eyes of the typical consumer and determine whether the lender could use the terms of the contract to impose illegal burdens on a debtor with no knowledge of his statutory rights.\u201d 727 F.2d 1061 at 1071. This rule of interpretation is consistent with Congress\u2019s decision to include manufactured home financing in the preemption scheme only on the condition that consumer-debtors would enjoy certain protections under finance agreements. Further, we determined that it would be unrealistic to assume that all inaccurate statements of rights and actions taken pursuant thereto would be remedied through litigation. Although we concluded that to qualify for preemption a financing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>agreement need not contain an express term guaranteeing the debtor thirty days notice prior to repossession or foreclosure, we held that contracts that affirmatively allowed a creditor to take action inconsistent with the debtor\u2019s right to notice and right to cure were not federal preemption agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">GECC\u2019s credit agreement provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1478-5\">In the event of Buyers\u2019 default in payment when due, Seller may declare <em>immediately </em>due and payable any and all installments due or to become due hereunder, less the unearned portion of that part of the FINANCE CHARGE designated as Time Price Deferential calculated by the Pro-Rata Method <em>provided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure default before Seller is permitted to exercise that </em>right\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">(emphasis in italics added). Because the contract grants the creditor the right, upon default, to accelerate immediately payment of any or all installments, it is contrary to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h), which prohibits initiation of any action to accelerate payments until 30 days after the creditor sends the debtor a notice of default and right to cure. Further, section 590.4(h) provides that the \u201csum stated in the notice of default may only include payments in default and applicable late or deferral charges____\u201d A provision allowing <em>all </em>future payments to become due <em>immediately </em>upon default is thus an inaccurate statement of the creditor\u2019s rights, in that under section 590.4(h), the debtor has the right to cure the default, by paying the amount in default plus any late charges, <em>before </em>the creditor may accelerate payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-10\">The majority relies on the qualifying clause (\u201cprovided that Buyer shall be given notice of right to cure default before Seller is permitted to exercise that right\u201d) to conclude that the contract unambiguously informs the debtor of the right to cure the default before the creditor may accelerate payments. Although this provision is not as vague or equivocal as the qualifying clause in the <em>Quiller </em>contract, 727 F.2d at 1071-72, in my view it fails to remedy the inaccurate statement of rights already conveyed by the agreement. Read as a whole, the challenged passage could be fairly construed by a consumer-debtor to transmit conflicting messages: the creditor\u2019s right to declare immediately upon default that all installments are due, and the debtor\u2019s right to cure before the creditor exercises that right. Moreover, there is no explanation that the right to cure means paying only the amount in default plus any late charge. As the majority observes, there is no requirement that this be explained in the contract; yet, given the creditor\u2019s right under the contract to accelerate immediately upon default, the unexplained right to cure fails to offer a statement sufficient to qualify the agreement as a preemption contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As in the <em>Quiller </em>contract, a debtor who reads this provision may receive an accurate impression of his or her rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>upon default, if he or she had independent knowledge of the applicable statute and regulations. Absent this, however, a debt- or could easily conclude that the creditor can accelerate immediately upon default, subject to some unspecified right to cure. At best, the language of the agreement is ambiguous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-4\">The focus of our <em>Quiller </em>decision was to prevent creditors from exercising leverage over unwary consumer-debtors faced with default. Congress sought to ensure that consumer-debtors would not immediately lose their homes upon the failure to tender a single payment on time, by guaranteeing the debtors\u2019 right to cure and right to notice before repossession, foreclosure or acceleration. I do not believe that GECC\u2019s credit agreement fulfills this purpose. Accordingly, I would hold that the GECC contract is not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1478-7\">. In an effort to reconcile the GECC contract with section 590.4(h), the majority explains that the portion of the regulation setting forth the amount due upon default refers only to the notice of default, not to provisions that must be contained in a preemption contract. 727 F.2d at 1070. I believe the majority overlooks the fact that the agreement grants the creditor the right to accelerate payments immediately upon default. The regulation provides that the sum stated in the notice of default may not exceed the amount in default plus an applicable late charge; thus, a creditor is forbidden to accelerate payments immediately upon default of one payment. The debtor must have the opportunity to cure by paying the amount stated in the notice of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-8\">Twice the majority observes that there is no allegation that GECC sent the Grants a notice of default that contradicted the form set forth in the regulations. 727 F.2d at 1071. This ignores <em>Quitter's </em>focus on the language of the agreement. To await the creditor\u2019s actual performance upon default would allow a creditor who drafts a contract that contradicts every right granted to the consumer-debtor by the regulations to claim a preemption defense if there is no effort to enforce the unlawful provisions. We would not know, however, whether the creditor attempted to enforce the unlawful provision unless the debtor filed a lawsuit. As we observed in <em>Quitter, </em>\"It would be unrealistic to assume that every illegal act will be corrected through litigation.\u201d 727 F.2d at 1071 (citing <em>General Finance Corp. of Georgia v. Sprouse, </em>577 F.2d 989 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1479-12\">. Language, of course, can be inherently ambiguous, and some debtors may not understand their rights under an agreement no matter how clear the terms. Nonetheless, although the statute and regulations do not require that certain provisions be set forth explicitly in an agreement, the onus is on the creditor who wishes to claim the preemption defense to draft a document that does not contradict rights guaranteed by the regulations. When doing so, the creditor must employ language that makes the contract readily understandable by a reasonable consumer-debtor. <em>Quiller, </em>727 F.2d at 1071. <em>Cf. Jeter v. Credit Bureau, </em>760 F.2d 1168 (11th Cir.1985) (to determine whether Fair Debt Collection Practices Act has been violated, court is obligated to decide whether least sophisticated consumer would be deceived, mislead, or harassed by creditor\u2019s actions).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
