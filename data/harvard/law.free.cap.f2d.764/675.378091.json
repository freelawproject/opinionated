The second paragraph of footnote 13 shall be deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">In addition, we note that had proper procedures been followed, the plenary adjudication of Flynt\u2019s contempt charges would have taken place before another judge since Flynt\u2019s remarks constituted highly personal derogatory attacks leveled at Judge Real. Where plenary adjudication is appropriate, and where the alleged contempt has in it the element of personal attack, due process ordinarily requires that the defendant be tried before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor. <em>See Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 466 [91 S.Ct. 499, 505, 27 L.Ed.2d 532] (1971); <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. [488] at 501 [94 S.Ct. 2697 at 2704, 41 L.Ed.2d 897]; <em>cf. </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 42(b).</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
