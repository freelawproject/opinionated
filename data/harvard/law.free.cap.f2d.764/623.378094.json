The Hou Hawaiian tribe appeals the judgment of the U.S. district court for Hawaii, Fong, J., which dismissed their complaint for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-17\">In 1920, Congress created the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust to provide lands for the use and benefit of native Hawaiian people of at least 50 percent native blood. <em>See </em>Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, Pub.L. No. 67-34, 42 Stat. 108 et seq. (1921). The Home Lands Trust was incorporated into the Constitution of the State of Hawaii when Congress admitted the State into the Union in 1959. <em>See </em>Hawaii Admission Act, P.L. No. 86-3, \u00a7 4, 73 Stat. 4, 5 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">Under section 5(f) of the Admission Act, the United States conveyed the bulk of its Hawaiian land holdings to the newly formed State, with the instruction that the lands and all property subsequently conveyed by the United States to the State be held by the State as a public trust. The lands which had already been reserved for disposition by the Hawaiian Homes Commission under the 1920 Act were included in the section 5(f) trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-19\">Proceeds from the section 5(f) trust are to be devoted to \u201cone or more\u201d of five statutory purposes, one of which is \u201cfor the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians.\u201d 73 Stat. 6. Section 5(f) places no other express limitations on the State\u2019s use of the trust fund proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-20\">The Hou Hawaiians sued in federal district court alleging that the State of Hawaii had breached its trust obligations to the United States and to the native Hawaiians by failing to expend any section 5(f) funds \u201cfor the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians.\u201d The Hou also alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that the State was spending section 5(f) funds on \u201cthe maintenance of the State of Hawaii governmental structure,\u201d a purpose not authorized by the statute. The Hou requested an accounting of all section 5(f) lands; \u201cjust and fair\u201d compensation for the State\u2019s prior neglect and a \u201cjust and fair portion\u201d of future revenues produced by section 5(f) lands; and the use of the award to secure matching federal funds to implement the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The district court granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss, on the ground that our decision in <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Association v. Hawaiian Homes Commission, </em>588 F.2d 1216 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 826, 100 S.Ct. 49, 62 L.Ed.2d 33 (1979) <em>(\u201cKeaukaha I\u201d), </em>compelled a finding that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Hous\u2019 suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Following the dismissal, the United States Secretary of the Interior notified the Hou that it would not intervene in the action at this point. The district court subsequently denied the Hous\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration, rejecting the Hous\u2019 argument that <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Association v. Hawaiian Homes Commission, </em>739 F.2d 1467 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(\u201cKeaukaha II\u201d), </em>affected the jurisdictional issue. The Hou timely appeal; we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">I. <em>Do the Hou qualify for \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In both their Opening Brief and extensive supplemental briefing submitted at our request, the Hou contend that they are an \u201cIndian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior,\u201d 28 U.S..C- \u00a7 1362, and hence may bring this suit under \u00a7 1362. Because neither the Hou nor their governing body have been \u201cduly recognized\u201d by the Secretary, they do not qualify for \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction even if we assume that they are an \u201cIndian tribe or band.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">A. Statutes governing tribal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">No statute explicitly details the procedure by which a tribe may become \u201cduly recognized by the Secretary\u201d for purposes of establishing \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction. We note, however, that the Secretary must approve the organization or incorporation of a tribe. If the Hou had been formally organized or incorporated as a tribe, they could thus argue that they had been \u201cduly recognized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">The statutes governing the formal organization and incorporation of an Indian tribe, <em>see </em>25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 476-477, explicitly do not apply to \u201cany of the Territories, colonies, or insular possessions of the United States [except for] the Territory of Alaska.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 473. In 1934, when \u00a7 473 was enacted, Hawaii was such a territory. Therefore, Congress did not originally intend the statutes governing the organization of new Indian tribes to apply to aboriginal groups in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">Even if we assume that \u00a7\u00a7 476-477 do apply to Hawaii today because it is now a State, the Hou have neither 1) adopted a constitution and bylaws ratified by majority vote of the adult members of the tribe and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, as required by \u00a7 476, nor 2) received a charter of incorporation, pursuant to \u00a7 477. Therefore, neither provision provides support for a claim of \u201crecognition by the Secretary of the Interior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">B. Regulations governing tribal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">Nor can the Hou claim \u201crecognition\u201d under the regulations by which the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs acknowledges tribal existence. <em>See </em>25 C.F.R. Part 83 (1984). The regulations establish tribal existence as \u201ca prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits from the Federal Government available to Indian tribes. Such acknowledgment shall also mean that the tribe is entitled to the immunities and privileges available to other federally acknowledged Indian tribes____\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.2. However, the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>tions are explicitly limited to \u201conly those American Indian groups indigenous to the continental United States____\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.3(a). The Hou Hawaiians acknowledge that they have not been \u201crecognized\u201d under these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">C. Factors for determining tribal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Although no statute or regulation governs recognition of the Hou for purposes of establishing \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction, we conclude that the same factors which govern eligibility for federal benefits and \u201cimmunities and privileges,\u201d <em>see </em>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.7, also provide some guidance for the jurisdictional inquiry. These factors, however, do not demonstrate that the Hou or their \u201cgoverning body\u201d have been \u201cduly recognized\u201d for \u00a7 1362 purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">1. Historical continuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">We first examine whether the group petitioning for recognition \u201chas been identified from historical times until the present on a substantially continuous basis, as \u2018American Indian,\u2019 or \u2018aboriginal.\u2019 \u201d 25 C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">\u00a7 83.7(a). The importance of a tribe\u2019s longstanding existence is underscored by the regulations\u2019 exclusion of \u201cassociations, organizations, corporations or groups of any character, formed in recent times,\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.3(c), from eligibility for Bureau of Indian Affairs benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Although native Hawaiians <em>in general </em>may be able to assert a longstanding aboriginal history, the issue before us is whether the particular subgroup seeking recognition \u2014 the Hou Hawaiians \u2014 can establish that they are a longstanding aboriginal sovereign rather than a recently formed association. To allow any group of persons to \u201cbootstrap\u201d themselves into formal \u201ctribal\u201d status \u2014 thereby obtaining the federal economic and legal benefits attendant upon tribal status \u2014 simply because they are all members of a larger aboriginal ethnic body would be to ignore the concept of \u201ctribe\u201d as a distinct sovereignty set apart by historical and ethnological boundaries. <em>Cf </em>F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law </em>5 &amp; n. 17, 229 (1982). Because the Hou <em>ohana </em>was founded in 1974, it does not satisfy the historical requirement for tribal status implicit in \u00a7 83.7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">2. Longstanding tribal political authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">The BIA regulations also consider whether \u201cthe petitioner has maintained tribal political influence or other authority over its members as an autonomous entity throughout history until the present.\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.7(c). The Hou have alleged no facts indicating longstanding actual political authority over its members. To contrary effect, the Hou have submitted \u201cMinutes of a General Meeting of the Elder Council\u201d that indicate that their Chief and Elder Council were <em>first </em>elected on <em>January 27, 1985. </em>This recent election was apparently prompted by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 request that the Hou formalize their political trappings in order for them to obtain Health and Human Services\u2019 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">3. Other factors considered in BIA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-17\">The Hou have not alleged that \u201ca substantial portion of the petitioning group inhabits a specific area or lives in a community viewed as American Indian and distinct from other populations in the area____\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.7(b). Nor have they alleged that their members obey certain formal \u201cprocedures through which the group currently governs its affairs and its members,\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.7(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">D. Non-statutory standards for determining tribal recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">Apart from the BIA regulations, we are also guided by a 1974 letter from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, in which the BIA reviewed its policies of recognizing Indian tribes over the previous twenty years. The letter describes five factors that the BIA used prior to the 1978 promulgation of the regulations discussed above, <em>see </em>25 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Part 83, in determining eligibility for BIA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The Hou fail to satisfy at least four of these five factors. The Hou 1) have not had treaty relations with the United States; 2) have not been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive order; 3) have not been treated as a tribe by other Indian tribes;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 4) have not demonstrated that the tribe exercises political authority over its members. It is unclear from the record whether the Hou share collective rights in tribal lands or funds, the fifth factor employed by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In summary, under both the BIA\u2019s current regulations for determining eligibility for federal benefits and \u201cprivileges and immunities,\u201d <em>see </em>25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.7, and the BIA\u2019s pre-regulation standard for recognizing a tribe, the Hou fail to demonstrate eligibility for recognition. In the absence of explicit governing statutes or regulations, we will not intrude on the traditionally executive or legislative prerogative of recognizing a tribe\u2019s existence. <em>See United States v. Sandoval, </em>231 U.S. 28, 46, 34 S.Ct. 1, 5, 58 L.Ed. 107 (1913) (recognition of tribe is \u201cto be determined by Congress, and not by the courts\u201d); <em>United States v. Holliday, </em>70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 407, 419, 18 L.Ed. 182 (1865); F. Cohen, <em>Handbook of Federal Indian Law </em>4-5 (1982). We therefore hold that the Hou do not qualify for \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">II. <em>Federal question jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The Hou also assert jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. \u201cFor this case to be within the purview of \u00a7 1331(a), a right or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States must be an essential element of . plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\u201d <em>League to Save Lake Tahoe v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>507 F.2d 517, 519 (9th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 974, 95 S.Ct. 1398, 43 L.Ed.2d 654 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">We have recently held that \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act creates a federal \u201cright\u201d enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Keaukaha II, </em>739 F.2d at 1472. The Act\u2019s trust obligation is \u201crooted in federal law, and power to enforce that obligation is contained in federal law, <em>see Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1218. Congress imposed the trust obligation as a condition of (statehood and as a \u2018compact with the United States.\u2019 \u00a7 4, 73 Stat. 4.\u201d <em>Keaukaha II, </em>739 F.2d at 1472. Under <em>Keaukaha II, </em>the Hou have properly invoked federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The Hous\u2019 \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction alternatively rests on our holding in <em>Keaukaha II </em>that \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act imposes a trust obligation that constitutes a \u201ccompact with the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>739 F.2d at 1472; <em>but cf. Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1227 n. 12 (the Commission Act has not been incorporated as a federal-state compact). Unlike typical provisions of state law, this trust obligation is expressly protected from any amendments by the State legislature unless the United States has consented to those amendments. \u00a7 4, 73 Stat. 5; \u00a7 15, 73 Stat. 11. The terms of this federal-state compact, which has been recently reaffirmed by the Hawaii Supreme Court, <em>see Ahuna v. Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, </em>64 Hawaii 327, 640 P.2d 1161, 1168 (1982), have been set forth in the plain language of the Hawaii State Constitution. <em>See </em>Hawaii Const., art. XII, \u00a7 2 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">\u201c[A] ease involving the construction of an <em>interstate </em>compact which requires a judicial determination of the nature and scope of obligations set forth therein \u2018arises\u2019 under the \u2018laws\u2019 of the United States within the meaning of \u00a7 1331(a).\u201d <em>League to Save Lake Tahoe v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>507 F.2d at 522 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted); <em>see also Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm\u2019n, </em>359 U.S. 275, 278, 79 S.Ct. 785, 788, 3 L.Ed.2d 804 (1959); <em>League to Save Lake Tahoe v. B.J.K. Corporation, </em>547 F.2d 1072, 1073 (9th Cir.1976); Comment, Federal Question Jurisdiction to Interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Interstate Compacts, 64 <em>Geo.L.J. </em>87 (1975). Because a compact between two states \u201cderiv[es] its authority from powers conferred upon Congress,\u201d <em>Jacobson v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>566 F.2d 1353, 1359 (9th Cir.1977), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds sub nom. Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979), and has been arrived at only through the consent of Congress, <em>see </em>U.S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 10 cl. 3, the enforcement of an interstate compact may properly be sought in federal court. 566 F.2d at 1358 (citing <em>League to Save Tahoe, </em>507 F.2d at 523 &amp; n. 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Congress\u2019 role in the formation of a compact between the United States and a State is at least as great as Congress\u2019 role in approving a compact between two States. In addition, federal law is \u201can essential element\u201d of a suit that charges a violation of a compact incorporating \u201cthe spirit of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act looking to the continuance of the Hawaiian homes projects.\u201d Hawaii Const., art. XII, \u00a7 2; art. XII, \u00a7 4; art. XVI, \u00a7 7; <em>see Keaukaha II, </em>739 F.2d at 1472. We therefore hold that the enforcement of the \u00a7 5(f) compact presents a federal question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">III. <em>Sovereign immunity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\"><em>A. </em>Claims against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The State of Hawaii argues that it has not waived its sovereign immunity, and hence this suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. \u201cIn deciding whether a State has waived its constitutional protection under the Eleventh Amendment, we will find waiver only where stated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1360, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974) (quoting <em>Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., </em>213 U.S. 151, 171, 29 S.Ct. 458, 464, 53 L.Ed. 742 (1909)); <em>see Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 907, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) <em>(\u201dPennhurst II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Although the text of the Admission Act unmistakably authorizes the United States to bring suit against the State, we find no express language or legislative history proving that the State has lost its sovereign immunity from suit by the Hou. The Hous\u2019 claims against the State of Hawaii, its Department of Transportation, and its Department of Budget and Finance are therefore dismissed. <em>See Hoohuli v. Ari-yoshi, </em>741 F.2d 1169, 1173 &amp; n. 5 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">B. Claims against George Ariyoshi.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">The Hou have also named George Ariyoshi, in his capacity as governor of Hawaii, as a defendant in this suit. The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that \u201cwhen a plaintiff sues a state official alleging a violation of federal law, the federal court may award an injunction that governs the official\u2019s future conduct, [although] not one that awards retroactive monetary relief.\u201d <em>Pennhurst II, </em>104 S.Ct. at 909 (citing <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. at 666-67, 94 S.Ct. at 1357-58); <em>see Hoohuli v. Ariyoshi, </em>741 F.2d at 1174. Because the Hou have alleged a violation of the Admission Act and its incorporation of the federal-state compact to preserve \u201cthe spirit of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act,\u201d <em>see </em>Hawaii Const., art. XII \u00a7 2, they have alleged a violation of federal law, <em>see </em>discussion <em>supra </em>section II; <em>Keaukaha II, </em>739 F.2d at 1472, and may properly seek prospective injunctive relief in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">We reject the argument that all relief, both retroactive and prospective, will ultimately be paid by the State and hence is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. While we agree that the Eleventh Amendment bars a request for retroactive damages, <em>see Pennhurst II, </em>104 S.Ct. at 911 (citing <em>Edelman, </em>415 U.S. at 665, 94 S.Ct. at 1356); <em>Hoohuli v. Ariyoshi, </em>741 F.2d at 1174, we view the effect on the Hawaii State treasury of the requested injunctive relief as \u201cthe necessary result of compli-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>anee with decrees which by their terms [are] prospective in nature ... [and] an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in <em>Ex parte Young </em>[209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908)].\u201d <em>Edel-man, </em>415 U.S. at 667-68, 677, 94 S.Ct. at 1357-58, 1362 (permitting prospective in-junctive relief in a \u00a7 1983 action brought by public aid recipients), and discussing <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (Eleventh Amendment does not bar federal court from enjoining state officials who were denying welfare benefits to otherwise qualified aliens); <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970) (enjoining termination of welfare payments without prior hearing). We therefore hold that the Hou may properly seek prospective injunctive relief against George Ariyo-shi in his capacity as governor. We make no comment on the merits of such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">IV. <em>Standing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">To establish standing, a plaintiff must allege personal injury that is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the defendant\u2019s conduct and \u201clikely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3325, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (citing <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The Hou have suffered an economic injury that can be \u201cfairly traced\u201d to the State\u2019s decision to fund other purposes than section 5(f)\u2019s \u201cthe betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians.\u201d Such an injury is analogous to competitors\u2019 injuries in a long line of Supreme Court cases that have upheld standing to challenge regulatory benefits and licenses granted by the government to competitor companies. <em>See e.g., Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971); <em>Arnold Tours, Inc. v. Camp, </em>400 U.S. 45, 91 S.Ct. 158, 27 L.Ed.2d 179 (1970) (per curiam); <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 1, 80 S.Ct. 1570, 4 L.Ed.2d 1527 (1960); <em>see generally </em>4K. Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 24:13 (2d Ed.1983). The Hou have \u201ccredibly allege[d]\u201d a realistic threat from the future administration of the section 5(f) trust. <em>See Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 107 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1667 n. 7, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">It is also clear that the Hous\u2019 economic injury would be \u201clikely\u201d to be redressed, <em>see Allen v. Wright, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3325 (citing <em>Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., </em>426 U.S. 26, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 1976)), if we enjoined Governor Ariyoshi from allowing executive agencies to continue to expend trust funds in the manner alleged by the Hou.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Because the Admission Act broadly allows the State to expend trust funds on \u201cone or more\u201d of five statutory purposes, however, the State argues that it has acted well within its discretion in refusing to grant any funds at all to the Hou. Therefore, the State concludes that the Hou have no right to any trust funds, and they cannot claim an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d sufficient to satisfy Article III standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The State\u2019s argument would require the Hou to establish a formal legally protected right, rather than an economic interest which has been arguably affected by the State, merely to get into court. Such a \u201clegal interest\u201d test was replaced in the 1970\u2019s by the more lenient \u201cinjury in fact\u201d test. <em>See Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, for purposes of determining standing, we reject the State\u2019s invitation to examine whether the Admission Act gives the Hou a legally protected right to trust funds. We hold that the Hou have standing to seek prospective injunc-tive relief against Governor Ariyoshi.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>V. <em>Implied private cause of action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">We now consider whether the Hou may bring a private cause of action under the Admission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Under the \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d doctrine, Indian tribes may claim a private cause of action when the United States is a trustee and is entitled to sue to protect the tribe\u2019s rights. <em>See e.g., Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1224 n. 7; <em>Agua Caliente Band of Mission Indians v. County of Riverside, </em>442 F.2d 1184, 1186 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 930, 30 L.Ed.2d 809 (1972); <em>see also Poafpybitty v. Skelly Oil Co., </em>390 U.S. 365, 366-72, 88 S.Ct. 982, 982-86, 19 L.Ed.2d 1238 (1968). But because the United States is not a formal trustee of the \u00a7 5(f) homelands trust, <em>see Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1224 n. 7, and nothing in the legislative history or case interpretation indicates that Congress intended a different result for the \u00a7 5(f) ceded land trust at issue here, we hold that the Hou cannot claim a private cause of action under the \u201cco-plaintiff\u201d doctrine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Furthermore, our holding in <em>Keaukaha I </em>that individual Hawaiians do not have an implied cause of action under the Admission Act, <em>see </em>588 F.2d at 1223-24, applies with equal force to bar the Hou Hawaiians from claiming a cause of action. Although the Hou are members of a \u201cclass for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 2088, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975) (emphasis in original), nothing in the legislative history of the Admission Act indicates that Congress intended native Hawaiian groups, as distinguished from individual Hawaiians whose claims were rejected in <em>Keaukaha I, </em>to enjoy a private cause of action. \u201cIndeed, the rare references in the Committee reports to enforcement of section 5\u2019s trust provisions refer exclusively to the public cause of action.\u201d <em>Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1223. Because the remaining two elements of the <em>Cort v. Ash </em>test \u2014 the general scheme of the Admission Act and the magnitude of the State\u2019s concern in this area\u2014 have also been decided by <em>Keaukaha I </em>in favor of the State, the Hou cannot claim an implied private cause of action. <em>See id. </em>at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">VI. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The Hou have not established that they are \u201cduly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior,\u201d and hence cannot claim jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362. However, both the federal nature of the section 5(f) trust and the state-federal compact that led to its creation support general federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The Hou have also alleged an \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d sufficient to confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Because the State has not waived its sovereign immunity, we must dismiss the Hous\u2019 claims against all parties except George Ariyoshi in his capacity as governor. This claim against Ariyoshi, however, must be dismissed as well because the Hou cannot claim a private cause of action under the Admission Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\">. Although the Hou argue that they have been treated as a tribe by \"the larger, federally recognized tribe of the Native Hawaiian people as a whole,\u201d the Hou have not shown that the Native Hawaiian people have themselves been \"duly recognized\u201d as a tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. <em>See also </em>Chayes, Foreword: Public Law Litigation and the Burger Court, 96 Harv.L.Rev. 4, 15 (1982); Note, Analyzing Taxpayer Standing in Terms of General Standing Principles: The Road Not Taken, 63 B.U.L.Rev. 717, 742-43 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-20\">.
