GM, of course, supports the Commission\u2019s conclusion that a violation of the regulation was not established. GM, however, seeks to contest a prior decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>by the Commission in this action in which the Commission held that an occupational safety and health standard may not be challenged in an enforcement proceeding on the ground that its predecessor standard was improperly amended before the standard\u2019s adoption under the OSH Act. The Secretary argues in favor of the Commission\u2019s earlier holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Two questions are presented on this appeal: (1) whether the Commission erred in holding that the validity of a safety and health regulation may not be challenged in an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement proceeding, on the ground that its ancestor standard was improperly amended; and (2) whether the Commission\u2019s finding, that the Secretary failed to establish that GM had actual or constructive knowledge of alleged hazards at its Westwood, Massachusetts and Chamblee, Georgia facilities, is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Since we hold that the Commission correctly found that the Secretary did not establish GM's actual or constructive knowledge of a hazard, which required the use of personal protective equipment, we need not determine whether a safety and health regulation may be challenged in an OSHA enforcement proceeding, or whether the ancestor regulation to 29 C.F.R. 1910.-132(a) was improperly amended. Hence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">At issue in this case are the safety procedures at GM\u2019s automotive parts warehouses in Westwood, Massachusetts (Westwood) and Chamblee, Georgia (Chamblee). At both facilities, the employees handle automotive or truck parts which weigh from a few ounces to over one hundred pounds. Parts that are too heavy to be moved by hand are moved by forklifts or other lifting devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">At the Westwood facility, which employs between 150 to 168 persons, there were five injuries to the feet over a two and one-half year period prior to its inspection. At the Chamblee facility, which employs approximately 25 parts handlers or \u201ccheckers,\u201d there were twelve injuries to the feet over an eight year period prior to inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">GM does not require employees at either facility to wear steel-toed safety shoes. It does, however, require that substantial leather footwear be worn. In addition, it encourages employees to purchase and wear steel-toed safety shoes through a payroll deduction plan that enables employees to purchase the shoes at a substantial discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In response to an employee complaint, the Westwood facility was inspected by an OSHA compliance officer on the 24th of February, 1978. As a result of the inspection, and upon the recommendation of the inspecting officer, the Secretary of Labor, the statutory head of OSHA, cited GM with a \u201cnon-serious\u201d violation of section 5(a)(2) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2), and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a), based on GM\u2019s failure to require its employees to wear steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">On July 30, 1979, in response to an employee complaint, the Chamblee facility was inspected by an OSHA compliance officer. As a result, the Secretary cited GM with a \u201cserious\u201d violation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a), for failing to require that its Chamblee employees wear steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">\n<em>The Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">GM contested the Secretary\u2019s allegations pertaining to its Westwood and Chamblee facilities, contending that the precursor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>regulation 1910.132(a) was improperly amended. The Secretary, on the other hand, argued that section 6(f) of the OSH Act precluded a challenge to an ancestor standard in an enforcement proceeding, and that since GM had knowledge of the hazards existing in its facilities, it violated regulation 1910.132(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">After a hearing on the Westwood citation, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert P. Weil granted GM\u2019s motion to dismiss the citation on the ground that the standard adopted by the Secretary in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a) was improperly amended. On February 23, 1981, the Commission reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision, and remanded the case for further proceedings. On April 3, 1981, GM petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for review of the Commission\u2019s order. On the ground that the Commission\u2019s order was not a final order within the meaning of section 11(a) of the OSH Act, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition. On remand, in a decision dated July 26,1982, ALJ Foster Furco-lo affirmed the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On October 31, 1981, a hearing on the Chamblee citation was held before ALJ Jess D. Ewing. Upon reassignment of the case, AU Edwin Salyers affirmed the citation. In an opinion dated August 30, 1982, AU Salyers found that the Secretary had established that injuries to the feet, from falling automotive parts, constituted a hazard, and that GM had knowledge of the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">On June 29, 1984, the Commission, upon consolidating the Westwood and Chamblee proceedings, reversed the AUs\u2019 respective decisions, and vacated the citations on the ground that the Secretary had not established GM\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge that there existed hazards requiring the use of steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Regulation 1910.132(a) establishes a broad personal protective standard for industry generally. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">(a) <em>Application. Protective equipment, including personal protective equipment for </em>eyes, face, head, and <em>extremities, </em>protective clothing, respiratory devices, and protective shields and barriers, <em>shall be provided, used and maintained </em>in a sanitary and reliable condition <em>wherever it is necessary by reason of hazards of processes or environment, </em>chemical hazards, radiological hazards, or mechanical irritants encountered in a manner capable of causing injury or impairment in the function of any part of the body through absorption, inhalation or physical contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.132(a) (Emphasis added). The Secretary may establish a violation of regulation 1910.132(a) by showing that an employer had either actual or constructive knowledge of a hazard in its facility which required the use of \u201cpersonal protective equipment.\u201d <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard Div. of the New Bedford Gas and Edison Light Co. v. OSHRC, </em>512 F.2d 1148, 1152 (1st Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Since the question whether GM had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged hazards is one of fact, the court will not disturb the Commission\u2019s finding if \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 464, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951); <em>American Petroleum Institute v. EPA, </em>540 F.2d 1023, 1028-29 (10th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 922, 97 S.Ct. 1340, 51 L.Ed.2d 601 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">To establish that a hazard actually exists, it must be demonstrated that there is a <em>significant </em>level of risk. <em>Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft v. Secretary of Labor, </em>649 F.2d 96, 104 (2d Cir.1981). While all human endeavor entails some element of risk, the presence of this element of risk, in and of itself, does not suffice to establish that a hazard actually exists. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\"><em>[Sjafe is not the equivalent of risk-free. </em>There are many activities that we engage in every day \u2014 such as driving a car or even breathing city air \u2014 that entail some risk of accident or material health impairment; nevertheless, few people would consider these activities \u201cunsafe.\u201d Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>ilarly, <em>a workplace can hardly be considered \u201cunsafe\u201d unless it threatens the workers with a significant risk of harm.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><em>Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Inst., </em>448 U.S. 607, 642, 100 S.Ct. 2844, 2864, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1980) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In this case, the Secretary contends that, since there existed a \u201cgeneric hazard\u201d in GM\u2019s facilities, as indicated by the history of injuries to the feet of employees at both facilities, as well as the considerable weight of the automotive parts, GM had actual knowledge of the hazards at its facilities. The Secretary further contends that, since GM had encouraged its employees at both facilities to purchase and use steel-toed safety shoes, GM was aware of the hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">GM, on the other hand, contends that the Secretary failed to carry his burden of proof since he offered no evidence that steel-toed shoes would have prevented or significantly reduced the injuries which occurred at its facilities. GM also contends that, on the basis of <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard Div. of the New Bedford Gas and Edison Light Co. v. OSHRC, </em>512 F.2d 1148, 1154 (1st Cir.1975), GM\u2019s encouragement of its employees to purchase and use steel-toed safety shoes cannot be construed as actual knowledge of a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">After reviewing the record, the Commission reversed both AU Furcolo\u2019s and AU Salyers\u2019 decisions by a 2-1 vote, and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">[W]e are unconvinced that the number of injuries gave GM actual knowledge ... [and we are also] reluctant to attach much importance to the fact that GM encouraged employees to wear safety shoes____ Accordingly, we conclude that the Secretary failed to establish that GM had actual knowledge of a hazard requiring safety shoes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\n<em>Actual or Constructive Knowledge of Hazards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">An examination of the OSH Act reveals that, although its declared purpose is to assure \u201csafe and healthful working conditions,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b), it does not establish as a <em>sine qua non </em>any specific number of accidents or injuries. <em>See Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. v. Brennan, 497 </em>F.2d 230, 233 (5th Cir.1974). In addition, the mere fact that an automotive part may weigh in excess of one hundred pounds does not, in and of itself, render it dangerous. Hence, we find ample evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary did not establish a \u201cgeneric hazard\u201d based solely upon the inherent risk in handling heavy automotive parts, and the history of injuries at West-wood and Chamblee.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Furthermore, we cannot agree with the Secretary\u2019s contention that, by encouraging its employees to purchase and use steel-toed safety shoes, GM had actual knowledge of hazards existing in its facilities. Although a safety program, in some instances, may be considered as evidence of knowledge that a hazard exists, <em>see Puffer\u2019s Hardware, Inc. v. Donovan, </em>742 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1984), a safety recommendation made by an employer to its employees does not establish that the precaution was necessary in order to comply with an OSHA regulation. <em>See United States Steel Corp., </em>82 OSAHRC 62/A2, 10 O.S.H.Cas. (BNA) 2123, 2131, 1982 O.S.H.Dec. (CCH) 1[26,297, p. 33,235 (1982). Indeed, this Court, in the <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard </em>case, recognized that to establish such a rule \u201cwould needlessly discourage an employer from exhorting employees to take every possible safety precaution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1154. <em>See also Cotter &amp; Co. v. OSHRC, </em>598 F.2d 911, 915 (5th Cir.1979); <em>Diebold, Inc. v. Marshall, </em>585 F.2d 1327, 1338 (6th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Therefore, since our review of the record reveals substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding, that there did not exist a significant level of risk in either facility, we affirm the Commission\u2019s finding that the Secretary failed to establish that GM had actual knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>existence of hazards which required the use of steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">The Secretary may also establish a violation of regulation 1910.132(a) if he can demonstrate that an employer has constructive knowledge of a hazard. This test is met by the Secretary showing that \u201ca reasonably prudent man familiar with the circumstances of the industry would have protected against the hazard\u201d in the manner asserted by the Secretary. <em>Cape &amp; Vineyard, supra, </em>at 1152. Moreover, this Court recognized that in most instances \u201creference to industry custom and practice will establish the standard of conduct.\u201d <em>Id.; accord General Dynamics Corp. v. OSHRC, </em>599 F.2d 453, 464 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Thus, in the absence of a showing of actual knowledge, or of a clear articulation by the Commission that industry custom and practice is not controlling, due process requires that the Secretary establish that a prudent person familiar with the automotive parts warehousing industry would have determined that steel-toed safety shoes were necessary in GM\u2019s facilities. <em>See Cape &amp; Vineyard, supra, </em>at 1152; <em>S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>659 F.2d 1273, 1275 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Secretary contends that, since he presented credible testimony that the practice of the \u201cwarehousing industry was to require the wearing of safety shoes,\u201d the Commission\u2019s finding, that GM lacked constructive knowledge of the hazards existing at its facilities, is not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The record in this case reveals that although the Secretary presented witnesses familiar with the custom and practice of the general warehousing industry, they had little, if any, first-hand experience with the operation of an automotive parts warehouse. In fact, the only \u201cexpert\u201d witness offered by the Secretary who had actually visited an automotive parts warehouse testified that his last visit was in 1952, more than twenty-five years before the inspections at Westwood and Chamblee. GM\u2019s witnesses, on the other hand, had substantial and recent experience in the automotive parts warehousing industry. Indeed, two of GM\u2019s witnesses testified without contradiction that the custom in the automotive parts warehouse industry is to encourage, but not require, the use of steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The record shows that the practice of the majority of persons most familiar with the automotive parts warehousing industry, that is, the employees themselves, was <em>not </em>to wear steel-toed safety shoes. For example, a GM employee who had worked at the Chamblee facility for twenty-three years testified that, although he was concerned that falling automotive parts presented a potential danger, he chose to continue to wear leather shoes despite the payroll deduction and discount plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The record also reveals a relatively low incidence of injury. For example, the one hundred and sixty-eight employees at Westwood handled from six to nearly sixteen million parts per year, yet the approximate injury rate was one injury for every million parts handled. Similarly, although the number of employees and parts handled at the Chamblee facility is considerably lower than at Westwood, the injury rate is not significantly different.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">From our review of the record, we have concluded that the custom and practice of the automotive parts warehousing industry is to encourage, but not to require, the use of steel-toed safety shoes. We also find ample evidence in the record to support a finding that a reasonably prudent person, familiar with the automotive parts warehousing industry and the facts of this case, would not have determined that steel-toed safety shoes were necessary in GM\u2019s facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">Consequently, we conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole to support the Commission\u2019s finding that the Secretary failed to establish that GM had constructive knowledge of the existence of hazards in its facilities which required the use of steel-toed safety shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Since we hold that the Commission\u2019s factual findings, that the Secretary failed to establish GM\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged hazards existing in its facilities, were supported by substantial evidence, the Commission\u2019s order of June 29, 1984 vacating the citations, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">.
