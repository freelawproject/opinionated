The court found that an earlier protest against liquidation, which had succeeded in obtaining reliquidation at a reduction of the tariff rate, had nevertheless failed to request GSP duty-free treatment. Thus, such treatment had not been sought in a timely manner, and the protest against reli-quidation, in contravention of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514(d) (1982), raised a \u201cquestion not involved in such reliquidation,\u201d removing the suit from the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade delineated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">Upon our review of the submissions and arguments of the parties, we affirm the dismissal below on the basis of the opinion of Judge DiCarlo. 598 F.Supp. 387 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
