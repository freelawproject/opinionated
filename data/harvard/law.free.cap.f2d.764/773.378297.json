Baldwin was seriously injured when a government vehicle operated by David L. White, a civilian employee of the United States government, collided with Baldwin\u2019s motorcycle. All parties to this litigation concede that the accident was caused by White\u2019s negligence and acknowledge that, pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346, as interpreted in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), the defendants, Mr. Baldwin and his wife, Denise Baldwin, cannot recover from either the United States of America or its employee-agent, Mr. White.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-20\">The Baldwins have three vehicles insured with the plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>APPENDIX A \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\">Each vehicle has uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of $10,000.

Both parties have cited authority from this and other jurisdictions generally dealing with the interpretation of uninsured motorist provisions similar to the one before us, but all of those cases are distinguishable, factually or otherwise, from the present case. Nevertheless, we find two Alabama cases cited by the Baldwins, <em>Higgins v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>291 Ala. 462, 282 So.2d 301 (1973), and <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Griffin, 51 </em>Ala.App. 426, 286 So.2d 302 (1973), which apparently was relied upon by the United States District Court, to be most helpful in our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In <em>Higgins, supra, </em>a minor plaintiff was injured in a one-vehicle accident while being transported as a student/passenger in an uninsured Jefferson County school bus. She sought to recover damages for her injuries under the uninsured motorist provision of her father\u2019s automobile liability policy. That provision contained an exclusion expressly denying coverage if the uninsured vehicle causing the claimant\u2019s injuries was \u201can automobile which [was] owned by the United States of America, Canada, a state, a political subdivision of any such government or any agency of any of the foregoing.\u201d In determining that this exclusion did not prevent plaintiff\u2019s recovery against her father\u2019s insurer this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">\u201cThe purpose of Act No. 866 [now codified at Code 1975, \u00a7 32-7-23] is to provide coverage \u2018for the protection of persons insured thereunder\u2019 against injury, including death, caused by the wrongful act of an uninsured motorist. <em>Gulf American Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Gow-an, </em>283 Ala. 480, 218 So.2d 688 [ (1969) ]. While there may be argument for not including motor vehicles owned by the United States, Canada, a state or a political subdivision or agency of any of these, since governmental bodies are likely able to respond in damages, the fact remains that the Legislature did not provide this exclusion in the Act. It might have undertaken to do so, had it desired, <em>Jones v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Co., </em>251 S.C. 446,163 S.E.2d 306 [ (1968) ], but not having done so, it is mandatory that Act No. 866, the governing law be read into the policy contract as it exists. Where the inclusion of uninsured motorist coverage is mandatory under an act, unless specifically waived, the governing act states what the coverage shall include. <em>Page v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>256 Cal.App.2d 374, 64 Cal. Rptr. 89 [ (2 Dist.1967) ]; <em>Standard Accident Insurance Co. v. Gavin, </em>184 So.2d 229 (Fla.App. [1966]); <em>Ampy v.

Trials, \u00a7 6, p. 86, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-11\">\u2018Where a statute [an Act] requiring uninsured motorist coverage is broad and comprehensive in scope, it establishes as a matter of public policy that every bodily injury motor vehicle policy should provide uninsured motorist coverage; the code [Act] becomes in effect a part of every policy of insurance to which it is applicable, as if it were written out in full in the policy itself. * * <em>Hendricks v.

Noble </em>[148], Ind.App. [297], 265 N.E.2d 419 [(1970)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">\u201cIn <em>Safeco Insurance Co. of America v. Jones, </em>286 Ala. 606, 615, 243 So.2d 736, 742 [ (1970) ], the restriction on uninsured motorist coverage under consideration was a contractually imposed limit on the total amount recoverable, if more than one insurer became liable to pay under its policy. In rejecting the unauthorized attempt to limit coverage this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">\u2018 * * * [W]e cannot permit an insurer to avoid its statutorily imposed liability by its insertion into the policy of a liability limiting clause which restricts the insured from receiving that coverage for which the premium has been paid.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201cWe think that in the absence of any language in the act authorizing the exclusion, no exclusion of governmentally owned motor vehicles may be created in the policy. An attempt to include such in the policy provisions conflicts with the mandate of the act. The act provides such insurance protection for insureds without limitation or restriction as to whether or not the uninsured motor vehicle is governmentally owned or operated, and restricting the act\u2019s scope thwarts its purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">291 Ala. at 465, 466; 282 So.2d at 303-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">The language of <em>Higgins </em>clearly shows this Court\u2019s belief that the obvious legislative purpose behind the uninsured motorist act was to protect those financially and ethically responsible enough to obtain automobile liability insurance from injuries caused by those not so responsible. <em>Griffin, supra, </em>51 Ala.App. at 430, 286 So.2d at 305. In other words, this Court recognizes, as did the legislature in enacting \u00a7 32-7-23, that one who wishes to protect himself against the negligence of an uninsured driver should be able to contract with an insurer and, by paying an appropriate premium, receive such coverage. It is for this reason that the legislature made uninsured motorist coverage mandatory in every automobile policy issued in this state, unless such coverage is rejected by the insured, and it was this legislative mandate that moved insurers, such as State Farm, to promulgate uninsured motorist provisions, like the present one, almost tracking the language of \u00a7 32-7-23. <em>Higgins, supra, </em>291 Ala. at 465, 282 So.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">If an insured chooses not to reject the protection afforded by the uninsured motorist statute and suffers a loss at the hands of an uninsured motorist, it is not necessary, as a condition precedent to his recovering in a direct action against his insurer, that he first secure judgment against the uninsured motorist. <em>Griffin, supra, </em>51 Ala.App. at 430, 286 So.2d at 306, instead, he need only prove that he is \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d against the uninsured motorist, within the meaning of \u00a7 32-7-23. In defining this term, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abm-dedup-0\">\u201cOne must, then, make a determination as to what the words, \u2018legally entitled to recover damages,\u2019 mean. They mean that the insured must be able to establish fault on the part of the uninsured motorist, which gives rise to dam-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>APPENDIX B \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">ages, and must be able to prove the extent of those damages. In a direct action by the insured against the insurer, the insured has the burden of proving in this regard that the other motorist was uninsured, legally liable for damage to the insured, and the amount of this liability. Note that the insurer would have available, in addition to policy defenses, the substantive defenses that would have been available to the uninsured motorist. See <em>Winner v. Ratzlaff, </em>[211 Kan. 59, 505 P.2d 606 (1973)]; <em>Application of Travelers Indemnity Company, </em>Sup., 226 N.Y.S.2d 16 [(1962)]; Cox, Uninsured Motorist Coverage, 34 Mo.L.Rev. 1, 34 (1969).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\"><em>Griffin, supra, </em>51 Ala.App. at 431, 286 So.2d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The reasoning expressed by the Court of Civil Appeals in <em>Griffin </em>was later adopted by this Court in <em>Quick v. State Farm Automobile Insurance Co., </em>429 So.2d 1033, 1034 (Ala.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">State Farm contends that, as noted in <em>Griffin, </em>it may assert not only those defenses arising from its policy with the Baldwins but also those substantive defenses available to White and the United States Government, the operator and the owner of the uninsured vehicle in question. State Farm argues that one of these substantive defenses is the immunity afforded by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, which provides that no cause of action arises against the United States Government or its employees for injuries incurred by a member of the military arising out of and/or in the course of his active military service. <em>Feres, supra. </em>Because the <em>Feres </em>doctrine precludes any cause of action in such situations, and because Baldwin was on duty at the time of his injury, State Farm asserts that Baldwin was never \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d against either White or the Government, within the meaning of \u00a7 32-7-23, and, therefore, is not entitled to recover in a direct action against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">While State Farm is technically correct, that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine is a defense available to it under the holding of <em>Griffin, supra, </em>this Court must decide if the legislative policy of the uninsured motorist statute would allow State Farm to assert that defense and deny the otherwise valid claim of the Baldwins. Using the previous decisions of this Court and construing the intent of the legislature in adopting the uninsured motorist statute, we hold that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">As this Court stated in <em>Higgins, </em>the purpose of \u00a7 32-7-23 is to \u201cprovide coverage.\u201d Considering our decision in <em>Higgins, </em>holding that insurers cannot expressly exclude from uninsured motorist coverage injuries resulting from collisions with government vehicles, it would be completely anomalous to hold that insurers may enforce the same exclusion, by implication, because of an anomaly of statutory construction created by the interaction of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine and \u00a7 37-7-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Thus, it is this Court\u2019s opinion that, because the undisputed facts are that Baldwin was injured as a proximate result of White\u2019s negligent operation of an uninsured vehicle, it is in keeping with the intent of the uninsured motorist statute and with our principles of statutory construction to hold that the Baldwins are \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d against White and the Government, within the meaning of \u00a7 32-7-23, regardless of the fact that David Baldwin is otherwise prohibited from such recovery by the <em>Feres </em>doctrine. Therefore, they are entitled to recover under their policy with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">FAULKNER, JONES, ALMON, SHORES, EMBRY, BEATTY and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">TORBERT, C.J., recused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
