We reverse for lack of substantial evidence supporting the AU\u2019s decision, and we instruct the District Court to remand the case to the agency for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-18\">A number of relevant facts are undisputed. Appellant Leon Cunningham is a 49-year-old male with arthritic and other difficulties in his arms that make it impossible for him to work as a carpenter, his occupation for the last two decades. On or about January 10, 1981, the appellant suffered a stroke that immediately disabled him for purposes of the Social Security Act. The critical issue in this case is the duration of the appellant\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">The appellant has a high-school education. On achievement tests administered after the stroke, Mr. Cunningham scored at the third- to sixth-grade level. His relevant Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is 70,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a single point above that which would by itself be likely to qualify him as disabled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant has been hospitalized for alcoholism and arrested for driving while intoxicated, although there is no indication that the appellant is currently suffering from alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-20\">The procedural history of this case can be briefly recounted. When the appellant first applied for disability payments, the AU examined the medical evidence and consulted the \u201cgrid\u201d regulations of the Social Security Administration (SSA).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>ALJ ruled that the appellant had been disabled after his stroke until February 24, 1982, when the disability ceased. Opinion of AU at 9, Record on Appeal 38 [hereinafter cited as \u201cR.\u201d]. The Appeals Council of the SSA remanded the case to the AU for further proceedings on the cessation of disability, because \u201cabsent the testimony of a vocational expert, the record does not substantially support the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that the claimant could engage in a wide range of sedentary and light work as of February 24, 1982.\u201d Order of Appeals Council at 2, R. 20. The AU then took testimony from two vocational experts and reached the same conclusion as before. The District Court affirmed the decision as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">We have examined the record to determine whether the AU considered \u201call the relevant facts\u201d in making his decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In light of the Appeals Council\u2019s decision, the testimony of the vocational experts in this case is especially important. Dr. Richard Lawrence appeared at the request of the AU and Dr. James Kuhagen testified at the request of the appellant\u2019s counsel. Their qualifications as vocational experts are undisputed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Dr. Lawrence specified five jobs available to the appellant in significant numbers in the local economy:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> uniform supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>clerk, flagman, custodian, watchman, and light porter. Dr. Kuhagen disputed a number of Dr. Lawrence\u2019s conclusions. We discuss in turn how each of three different characteristics of the appellant \u2014 his mental skills, his ability to walk or stand, and his involvement with alcohol \u2014 might affect the appellant\u2019s prospects for employment. We conclude that the AU lacked substantial evidence for the determination that the appellant was capable of performing a wide range of light and sedentary work. We are constrained to do so primarily because there is no substantial evidence that the appellant can find employment in at least four of the five types of jobs whose listing by a vocational expert was the only record \u25a0evidence that the appellant can hold down any job.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Our scope of review in cases involving disability determinations under the Social Security Act is a narrow one. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982) (\u201cThe findings of the Secretary as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive____\u201d). It is clearly the duty of this court, however, as it is the duty of the District Court, to engage in a careful review of the record for substantial evidence to support the conclusions of the AU. <em>See Vance v. Heckler, </em>757 F.2d 1324 (D.C.Cir. 1985). We note at the outset that discharging our duty in this case is made significantly more difficult by the poor quality of the transcript of the crucial hearing. We reproduce excerpts from the transcript exactly as they appear in the record to illustrate our point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">A. <em>Appellant\u2019s General Mental Skills</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5h\">Mental skills may properly be considered as a non-exertional factor in determining disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505 (1984) (\u201cThe law defines disability as the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical <em>or mental </em>impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the appellant\u2019s mental skills, in light of his exertional limitations, border on those low enough to qualify him automatically for disability payments,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> proper consideration of the effect of appellant\u2019s mental skills upon the availability of employment is especially important.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">Dr. Kuhagen performed two different types of intelligence tests on the appellant. The first type was an IQ test, which yielded IQ measures in the categories of \u201cverbal IQ,\u201d \u201cperformance IQ,\u201d and \u201cfull-scale IQ.\u201d The second type was a series of achievement tests, which yielded grade-equivalent scores in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. The findings of these tests are described above. <em>See supra </em>p. 911. A summary of the test results, dated March 21, 1983, was included as Exhibit 42 in the second hearing. <em>See </em>R. 158-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">The AU appears to have asked Dr. Lawrence if the latter had seen Dr. Kuhagen\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-14\">Q You\u2019ve had an opportunity to review the prosed or not to propose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>exhibits which have been received in evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-4\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-5\">Q And you had an opportunity to review in detail the report of Dr. Kuhagen, dated March 21, 1983?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">Q With Phycological evaluation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Tr. at 6, R. 49. The AU then asked Dr. Lawrence to express an opinion as to which jobs the appellant could hold in light of the appellant\u2019s mental skills:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-10\">Q ... Now considering [appellant\u2019s problems] from an exertional standpoint, and considering further the results of the testing that\u2019s set forth in Dr. Kuhagen\u2019s report namely that he has a verical I.Q. of \u201982, and a performance I.Q. of \u201970, and a full scale I.Q. of '76, and the results of the testings as set forth in that report. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not there are any jobs in existance and have been since February of 1982, which Mr. Cunningham could perform from an exertional stand point and whether or not the I.Q. and other facters as set forth in the report would further have a bearing on his ability to perform (INAUDIBLE)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-11\">A I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">Q And would you express your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-13\">A Yes, the types of work that I will note in the light and are seditary qualifications, would be worked or could be done by a person with a twelfth grade education which I believe is what Mr. Cunningham has, which would be a level-four on the indication alone with the scale of the dictionar of dictionary occupational titles. It would also be consis-tant with a person\u2019s functional ability in the little average range or dominal range of verbal capacity under waste (Phonetic) it would not require more of the low average ability in respect to arithmatic and spelling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">Tr. at 7, R. 50. Dr. Lawrence then went on to describe five suggested jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Reading this exchange as best we can, it appears that the AU noted that Dr. Lawrence was to consider both the IQ testing and the grade-equivalent testing. He mentioned all three of the IQ test scores determined by Dr. Kuhagen <em>\u201cand </em>the results of the testing.\u201d Logically, this latter phrase should refer to the non-IQ tests performed for Dr. Kuhagen\u2019s report, one set of which was the grade-equivalent tests and the other set of which was a test of manual dexterity. We think it unlikely that the AU had in mind only the manual-dexterity tests when he mentioned \u201ctestings.\u201d The AU\u2019s reference to \u201cI.Q. and other factors as set forth in the report\u201d similarly indicates that he wished Dr. Lawrence to consider all aspects of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-17\">It also seems likely that Dr. Lawrence referred to both the IQ testing and the achievement testing in his reply, although for us to reach this conclusion requires a bit of deductive reasoning. A popular subspecies of the IQ test, and the one administered to the appellant, is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. <em>See </em>R. 161 (appellant\u2019s IQ test score sheet). Its acronym, WAIS, sounds similar to the \u201cwaste\u201d that the transcriber considered the phonetic equivalent of the word spoken by Dr. Lawrence in the last sentence quoted above. In addition, we note that the grade-equivalent tests have discrete categories for ability in spelling and arithmetic (and a third category for reading ability). <em>See </em>R. 162. The IQ test has a component labelled \u201carithmetic,\u201d but none labelled \u201cspelling.\u201d It seems reasonable to assume that Dr. Lawrence\u2019s reference to \u201clow average ability in respect to arithm[e]tic and spelling\u201d is therefore a reference to the grade-equivalent tests rather than to the IQ test.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-18\">We are disturbed, however, by Dr. Lawrence\u2019s statement that the jobs he mentioned \u201cwould be worked or could be done by a person with a twelfth grade education which I believe is what Mr. Cunningham has.\u201d It is undisputed that the appellant has in fact completed the twelfth grade. Since that achievement, however, the appellant has suffered a stroke and been addicted to alcohol, two illnesses that may have significantly diminished his mental faculties. The testing that he has undergone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>since those illnesses in fact shows mental skills far below the twelfth-grade level. We note that the SSA\u2019s regulations state that \u201c \u2018[education\u2019 is primarily used to mean formal schooling or other training <em>which contributes to your ability to meet vocational requirements.\u201d </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1564(a) (1984) (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 404.1564(b) (formal education completed many years before impairment began may no longer be useful or meaningful in terms of ability to work). We therefore believe that it would have been clearly incorrect for the vocational expert to have considered the appellant\u2019s mental skills as equivalent to those of the average recipient of a high-school diploma, and that any evidence adduced on that basis could not serve as substantial evidence for determining that the appellant could hold the jobs available to the average high-school graduate.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Dr. Lawrence did state that the jobs he mentioned were open to those with a twelfth-grade education and \u201cwould <em>also </em>be consistent with a person\u2019s functional ability\u201d in a range that appears to describe appellant\u2019s mental skills. It is possible to infer from this statement that Dr. Lawrence considered both the appellant\u2019s schooling and the appellant\u2019s functional limitations. The AU in his opinion similarly noted that the appellant \u201cpossesses a high school education (but has limited intellectual abilities and cognitive skills).\u201d Opinion of AU at 7, R. 14. Certainly the mere fact that Dr. Lawrence or the AU mentioned the appellant\u2019s twelfth-grade education does not mean that they were incapable of also taking into account the appellant\u2019s mental skills as revealed by recent testing. Nonetheless, the appellant\u2019s high-school education is essentially irrelevant if it makes no contribution to his ability to meet vocational requirements, and we hesitate to infer from the garbled testimony before us that the jobs that \u201ccould be done by a person with a twelfth grade education\u201d are exactly the same as those that could be done by someone functioning at the fourth- to sixth-grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The second exchange between the AU and Dr. Lawrence regarding the appellant\u2019s mental skills does not dispel completely our fears that Dr. Lawrence credited the appellant with the mental skills of a high-school graduate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-9\">Q ... Now you\u2019ve mentioned several jobs here that he could perform within the exertional limitations. Has the non-exertional factors as set forth in the report of Dr. Kuhagen, have they all been considered in reaching our determination, your opinion rather that he can perform these jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-10\">A I believe so but I would need to look over his report again to make certain that he (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-11\">Q Exhibit 42, that\u2019s so much a conclusion, but the results of the I.Q., his test results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-12\">A The only factor your Honor that I did not consider is the records to alchol abuse,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1 did not consider that because it is unfare as to the fact of a portion of limitations, that of a particular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-13\">Q I wasn\u2019t concerned about that, I was primarily concerned of as a result, you considered his I.Q. as somewhat plus the results of the various of the various tests which were administered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-14\">A I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">Tr. at 10-11, R. 53-54. Once again, it would be charitable to characterize the transcript as clear. Nonetheless, both the AU and Dr. Lawrence do seem to be discussing both the IQ and the grade-equivalent tests, and Dr. Lawrence seems to acknowledge that he has taken these factors into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-16\">Dr. Kuhagen, the vocational expert called by the appellant, clearly believed that the appellant\u2019s mental skills would increase the difficulty of the appellant\u2019s obtaining employment. His opinion as to how the appellant\u2019s mental skills would affect his chances of obtaining a particular job was somewhat more pessimistic than that of Dr. Lawrence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Q The ... question was what will low I.Q. have a baring on jobs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-4\">A I\u2019m not sure exactly how to answer that except that it certainly doesn\u2019t help____ Seventy is the [I.Q.] level in which he is functioning, and it\u2019s going to impare his performance on these kinds of jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">T. at 26-27, R. 69-70. Nevertheless, the AU may choose one expert\u2019s opinion over the other so long as there is substantial evidence to support the chosen view.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">On balance, we would hesitate to reverse the AU\u2019s decision on the basis of his treatment of mental skills alone. The AU appears to have made a conscientious effort to ensure that Dr. Lawrence examined the results of intelligence testing administered to the appellant; Dr. Lawrence may have considered all of those limitations before proffering the five jobs he thought suitable. Nonetheless, the poor state of the record makes it difficult for us to say flatly that the AU\u2019s treatment of mental skills was correct, particularly since we cannot be certain that Dr. Lawrence considered only that portion of the appellant\u2019s education still contributing to the appellant\u2019s ability to hold a job. On remand, the AU should therefore take particular care to ensure that the vocational experts are aware at every step of their analysis that the appellant\u2019s IQ indicates borderline mental skills well below what one might expect from someone with a high-school education. If the vocational experts consider any job in which a high-school diploma contributes to the likelihood of a person\u2019s being hired, the experts must consider how a prospective employer is likely to treat an individual who has recently suffered a stroke that may have led to a diminution in mental capacity and who currently functions with significantly less mental acuity than one ordinarily garners from a high-school education.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">B. <em>Appellant\u2019s Writing Skills and the Uniform Supply Clerk Job</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Dr. Lawrence suggested that the appellant could be employed as a uniform supply clerk. Tr. at 8, R. 51. His description of that job indicates that some ability to write is a prerequisite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-12\">Q What does a uniform supply clerk do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-13\">A Be a person that would work in settings such as industrial settings or perhaps in hospitals, large nursing homes, and with issues applying and fitting uniforms and lenins and things such as this, and would have to keep records of the amount of supplies that would be issued. That\u2019s simply a tally of the but not required any extensive writing or record keeping of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">Tr. at 8-9, R. 51-52. Under questioning from his attorney, the appellant testified that he has a good deal of difficulty in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-15\">Q ... Mr. Cunningham are you able to write.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-16\">A No, just sign my name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-17\">Q Is there anything other than signing your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-18\">A Well I can make a few figures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-19\">Q What problem have if any do you have with writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-20\">A Well as I said I can sign my name and make a few figures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-21\">Q Why can\u2019t you do anything more, that\u2019s what we want to know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-22\">A I can write a little bit but (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-23\">Q Well I would say the record is subject a course agreement that the claimant signed his name deliberately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-24\">A I have trouble with my thinking ability, if I could think you know I could do a number of things, I think I could. See you asked me a question and I have to think of it for two minutes before it come out and I can answer it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-25\">Tr. at 22, R. 65. The appellant\u2019s limited range of writing skills might be sufficient to qualify him as a uniform supply clerk if he could write quickly. In fact, however, the evidence is uncontradicted that the appellant\u2019s writing is extremely labored. <em>See </em>Tr. at 24, R. 67 (testimony of Dr. Kuhagen) (\u201cI did note ... that in administering the spelling section of the wide ranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Achievement Test to Mr. Cunningham that he must write the words, that it took an extremely long time to administer due to his labored attempts to print the words.\u201d); Reconsideration Disability Report of Leon Cunningham, Social Security Administration, at 5, R. 107 (\u201cThe [appellant] had extreme difficulty in signing his name. It took him a considerable amount of time to sign all these forms.\u201d). This is unsurprising given that the right-handed appellant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> has significant degenerative changes in his right elbow, and that his stroke affected his right-side motor functions. <em>See </em>R. 119, 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">After a good deal of confusion during the proceedings, Dr. Lawrence agreed that significant difficulty in writing might prevent the appellant from obtaining employment as a uniform supply clerk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-6\">Q With respect to the uniform supply clerk\u2019s job, there are records to be kept, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">A There would be a tally that would need to be kept on the basis of the number of the expense (Phonetic) or taking. Yes, that I would be able to count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-8\">Q Would you consider the claimant, Cunningham\u2019s right arm would have an adverse effect on his ability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-9\">A Not on the basis of the assumption that Judge Dirlam (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-10\">Q Do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-11\">A Yes, on an, as evidence in the record I can\u2019t put my finger on it which indicates that the claimant has difficulty writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-12\">Q His ability in the exhibits, you may have come across it. Do you recall that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-13\">A That\u2019s no kind of question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-14\">Q Answer my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-15\">A I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-16\">Q Opposed to a hypothetical question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-17\">A The claimant has difficulty writing, he can barely write his hand, his name, but that has not effect on his ability to perform the job of supply clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-18\">AU: The job would not require writing, but it would require taking account and taking numbers and doing this amount of record keeping. I don\u2019t know, if he can\u2019t write his name he can\u2019t (Tape turned).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-21\">Q (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-22\">A Checks in some other places you\u2019de have to make numbers to keep track of the amount of supplies for example that would dealing out or brought in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-23\">Q But there is some writing on that job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-24\">A Oh yes you would have to be alble to use a writing instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-25\">Q If you assume that he\u2019d even have as difficulty writing his signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-26\">A What do you base that on, the doctor reports that, your own physician say\u2019s \u201che can write his name legibly with his right hand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-27\">Q But that\u2019s with difficulty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-28\">A Where does it say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-29\">Q Well.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-30\">A Let\u2019s see the report you submitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-31\">Q Well....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-32\">A Alright it\u2019s hypothetical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-33\">Q Well, if he has difficulty of signing his name does that make any difference with respect to the job that you say he could do as a supply clerk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-34\">A It\u2019s, I would say that it would probably require longer for him to keep the records and make the marks, therefore his work productivety would be slowed, the exact amount of reduction in produc-tivety is uncertain based upon the hypothetical that you\u2019ve noted. If it should be reduced by as much as fifteen percent then this would significantly reduce his capasity to work. If it is less than that then it would not significantly reduce that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-35\">Tr. at 18-20, R. 61-63. The record at no place reveals any estimate of the percentage loss in productivity that the appellant might suffer because of his writing problem. The only quantitative measure available that would appear relevant is a man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>ual-dexterity test on which the appellant scored below the 1st percentile. R. 163. We are further disturbed by the reasonable inference from the testimony above that Dr. Lawrence did not consider the appellant\u2019s writing difficulty in compiling his list of possible jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Dr. Kuhagen was skeptical of the appellant\u2019s ability to hold the job of uniform supply clerk in light of his writing difficulties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-5\">[Bjased on my observation in giving [the spelling portion of the achievement test] is to how long it did take that would significantly reduce his production. I would seriously question that he would be able to meet what ever production quota\u2019s might be demanded of him in a job such as that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Tr. at 24-25, R. 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">In light of all the factors discussed above, we are constrained to conclude that no substantial evidence supports the AU\u2019s determination that the appellant could be employed as a uniform supply clerk. If the supply-clerk job is to be considered on remand as suitable for the appellant, the evidence must show that the appellant\u2019s writing difficulties would not prevent him from obtaining such a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">The jobs of flagman<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or watchman,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> two of the five jobs suggested by Dr. Lawrence, require significant standing or walking.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There was some controversy at the hearing as to the appellant\u2019s ability to stand or to walk:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Q Mr., Dr. Lawrence, with respect to the job of flaggman, that would require him to stand practically all day?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-16\">Q And have you observer the (INAUDIBLE) that the claimant feels that his right foot feels frozen (Phonetic)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-17\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-18\">Q And you don\u2019t think that that would make any difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-19\">A That was not a part of the hypothetical question, that I considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-20\">Q You will consider it as part of your consumption, would that make a difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-21\">A What restrictions would that place upon Mr. Cunningham?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-22\">Q [A?] I am assuming then his ability to stand and walk, I know it, or I see that his walk is not a normal walk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-23\">A If it interferrs with his ability to stand and walk to a point where he could not do that for a certain amount during the day, and if you could specify that time demention, then I could respond to you with respect to each of these positions. The only way that I can do that is to question the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-24\">Dr. Lawrence Examines Claimant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-25\">Q Well when I said that I didn\u2019t have any further testimony that was related to his past history. But Mr. Cunningham with respect to your ability to stand and walk, does your right foot make any difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-26\">A Yes, sometimes it does. In the mornings I can't walk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-27\">Q You cannot walk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-28\">A Yes, some mornings I can walk good my feet feel like they\u2019re swollen in the morning, infact they feel that way all</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>the time. Like they\u2019re swollen or like they\u2019re sleeping and then some mornings I can barely walk on them, and some mornings I can walk good on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-5\">Q Do you, could you stand all day or most of the day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-7\">Q Do you walk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">A Yes, I could walk around some days and some days I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-9\">Q Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">A Because of my leg. The foldum (Phonetic) of my leg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">Q Your right leg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">A Yea. It\u2019s in the feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">Q In light of the testimony of the claimant (INAUDIBLE) gives me the conclusion that he could be a flaggman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">Q It depends on the number of days that he can walk, he would have to be able to function at least five out of seven days of the week. He would have to be able to function anywhere from six to eight hours per day in order to be able to function in this type of position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-15\">A [Q?] His testimony would seem to be non relyable, the fact that he said he can\u2019t get through it sometimes but he can get through it other times. If it\u2019s more than twice a week and he has no control over when it is then it is absentyism and probably would be more than approximately a day a month, this would be considered excessive and with significantly reduced to passitive work and a particular type of work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">Tr. at 11-13, R. 54-56. The testimony of Dr. Kuhagen on this issue was more focused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-17\">Q Dr. Kuhagen, with respect to the job of flaggman, in your opinion, could Mr. Cunningham perform on such a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-18\">A I think that it would be very difficult for him in light of a couple of factors: one the limitation imposed on him by the stroke and particularly into problems with his foot and leg as he has noted in earlier testimony in terms of standing for long periods of time. Secondly, the difficulty with regard to the alchol abuse____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">Tr. at 23-24, R. 66-67. Dr. Kuhagen had similar reservations with respect to the appellant\u2019s ability to be a custodian:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-21\">Q With respect to the job of building custodian, do you have any opinion to whether Mr. Cunningham could fold in such a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-22\">A Again I think, there the physical limitations of a strong (Phonetic) remember quite a bit. Mr. Cunningham does walk cautously (Phonetic) and as we stated before, just in terms of standing for a long period of time that that would be difficult for him. So putting those two factors together I would have a hard time seeing that he could qualify for a position such as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-23\">Q Because of his walking limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-24\">A Yes. He is cautious in the terms of the way he does walk, and even as we noted earlier as a flaggman just standing for a period of time would be very difficult. So to add to that the continuous need for lifting and walking around, to dust and sweep things and so on. I think fatigue facter would enter into that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"as--dedup-0\">Tr. at 25, R. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-25\">Although once more the transcript is so garbled as to cast into doubt the validity of any inference we might make, we believe it is reasonable to infer several points from this testimony of the appellant and the two vocational experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-26\">First, we note that the ability to stand and walk on a regular basis is a crucial component of the jobs offered by Dr. Lawrence as suitable for the appellant. Both experts agreed that, given some sporadic absenteeism, an applicant would have a difficult time obtaining the flagman job. After briefly questioning the appellant, Dr. Lawrence, who had not in his search for potential jobs considered the appellant\u2019s complaints about his legs, stated that the appellant could still be a flagman despite the appellant\u2019s testimony that his legs bothered him a great deal on some occasions. Dr. Kuhagen, who had some contact with the appellant before the hearing, concluded that the appellant\u2019s difficulties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>his legs were severe enough to combine with the appellant's other problems to make it very difficult for the appellant to hold the jobs of flagman, custodian, or watchman, <em>see </em>Tr. at 25-26, R. 68-69. The appellant testified that he had sporadic but debilitating problems with his legs. No other testimony rebutted the appellant\u2019s assertions. If one were to consider only the hearing testimony, therefore, one would be forced to conclude that the appellant had significant problems with his legs, that there was no substantial evidence to show that he could overcome these problems and hold a job as a custodian or watchman, and that there was a serious question as to whether the appellant could be employed as a flagman.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Testimony by a claimant as to a particular disability is insufficient evidence, however, unless supported by medical evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1508 (1982) (\u201cA physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not only by your statement of symptoms.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1528(a) <em>(\u201cSymptoms </em>are your own description of your physical or mental impairment. Your statements alone are not enough to establish that there is a physical or mental impairment.\u201d) (emphasis in original). The ALJ based his decision that the appellant could stand long enough to perform the offered jobs on the appellant\u2019s medical records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-5\">While the claimant alleges on-going problems with prolonged standing, it is noted that none of the recent medical reports make mention of any significant impairment or functional limitations of the lower extremities. Therefore, [I] do[] not find such allegations to be supported by the objective medical evidence of record and consequently believe[ ] that the claimant presently retains the residual functional capacity to stand long enough to carry out the duties of light and sedentary work activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Opinion of AU at 5, R. 12. An examination of those medical records reveals a steady improvement in the appellant\u2019s ability to walk.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There is no specific evidence, however, that the appellant\u2019s right leg has improved so much that it could not give him sporadic but serious trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">Upon the appellant\u2019s admission to the hospital for treatment of his stroke on January 10, 1981, he could not move his right side at all. R. 119. A few weeks later, an employee of the SSA who interviewed the appellant noted that he \u201cwalked slowly [and] with difficulty.\u201d R. 96 (interview of Feb. 23, 1981). Seven months after the stroke, an examining physician stated that the appellant\u2019s gait was \u201cvery good\u201d but that the appellant \u201cstill ha[d] significant and persistent disorganization of motor function in the right arm and right leg with marked disturbance of dextrous movements in spite of the good gait and station.\u201d R. 113 (report dated Aug. 11, 1981). The patient\u2019s physician reported in February of 1982 that the appellant had had a \u201cremarkable improvement\u201d in response to treatment for the stroke, with some continuing difficulties in his arms but \u201cno other abnormalities.\u201d R. 116 (report dated Feb. 24, 1982). At the time of the appellant\u2019s discharge from the Providence Hospital after treatment for alcoholism on June 24, 1982, the examining physician noted that he had a \u201crelatively normal\u201d gait. R. 151. And finally, a summary of a medical examination of the appellant on March 14, 1983, recounts that the appellant was \u201cable to ambulate in [the physician\u2019s] presence without any difficulty.\u201d R. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The examining physician on this most recent exam did note the appellant\u2019s complaint that \u201chis right foot feels as if it is frozen and that he can\u2019t walk some mornings on arising.\u201d R. 155. Despite this complaint \u2014 perhaps because the visit was apparently designed chiefly to examine the appellant\u2019s upper-body difficulties \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>physician did not go on to examine the appellant\u2019s legs or feet, but seems rather to have assumed on the basis of the appellant\u2019s gait that day that the appellant\u2019s complaint was groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Although we find the trend in the medical evidence in this case to be clearly towards a normal gait, and thus towards a concomitant absence of standing difficulties, we are unable to say that this trend towards health is sufficient evidence from which to conclude that its endpoint has been achieved. No one has recently examined the appellant\u2019s legs and feet and pronounced them healthy, despite his relatively recent documented problems and his continuing complaints. We particularly believe such an examination to be necessary in light of the fact that, as Dr. Lawrence testified, the appellant need only suffer occasional difficulty with standing or walking to make him unable to hold the flagman\u2019s job. There is no evidence from which to assume that employers for other light, unskilled jobs are more tolerant of absenteeism.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">After an arrest for driving while intoxicated, the appellant entered Providence Hospital on June 5, 1982, for treatment of alcoholism. The results of this treatment were apparently encouraging. <em>See </em>R. 151 (\u201csignificant progress was noted by the staff and by the patient toward the end of the program\u201d), 152 (condition on discharge described as \u201cStable. Good understanding. Good motivation.\u201d). There was no evidence submitted that the appellant has any continuing problems with alcoholism. The issue before us is rather whether the AU adequately considered the effect of the appellant\u2019s history of alcoholism upon his prospects for employment. We note again that the AU must consider \u201call relevant facts\u201d in determining whether the appellant can obtain employment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">Dr. Kuhagen testified that the history of the appellant\u2019s bouts with alcohol would greatly harm his chances of employment as a flagman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">[T]he difficulty with regard to the alchol abuse which has been mentioned, I think that would pose a tremendous problem in terms of qualifying in a job as a flaggman when that record gets revealed as well as his arrests for drunk and driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Tr. at 24, R. 67. Dr. Kuhagen had similarly based doubts about the appellant\u2019s abilities to obtain a job as a watchman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">Again I think his arrest for driving while intoxicated would enter into that. I believe people who serve as guards and watchmen need to have a fairly clear police record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Tr. at 25, R. 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">Dr. Lawrence\u2019s opinion about the matter is somewhat more difficult to discern, but he appears to have considered only whether continued alcohol abuse was present rather than whether the stigma of past abuse might make it more difficult for the appellant to obtain the suggested jobs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">Q You have not considered the claimant\u2019s alcoholic addiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-15\">A No I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-16\">Q That in the presence of that and there is in evidence I believe a statement signed by the claimant to the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-17\">[Page Missing from Transcript]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-18\">CONTINUED EXAMINATION OF ATTORNEY:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-19\">Q In the light of the history of alcholism, he was hospitalized for some time in \u201982, and he was arrested for drunk and driving. Would that have any affect on his reliability with respect to the job to mention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-20\">A It potentially could, it would depend upon with enough cause to continue to drink a frequency with he drink\u2019s, the amount of consumption as well as when this consumption takes place. Obviously during this 4/43 to 9/21/83 at which time he was incarcerated. He would certainly not be alble to work during that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-21\">Q Well I have no questions about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>A In '82, depending on how long he was involved in treatment, the nature of the treatment and then, (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-4\">Q \u25a0 Well that\u2019s a matter of record, we have a report on that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-5\">A As I said, that was not part of the original assumption, so you are going to have to provide me with some functional limitations that are imposed as a result of the alcholism for me to be able to respond to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-6\">Q You (INAUDIBLE).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-7\">A I am not instructed to provide functional limitations that pose as the result of either medical or physical examines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-8\">Q In your practice, if you are confronted with such a report and you have the excess (Phonetic) or potential vocational ability of an individual would you take that, would you feel qualified</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-9\">A Which report are you referring to Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-10\">Q The report of his hospitalization, and the problem of the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-11\">A Oh akay. In June of \u201982,?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-12\">Q Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-13\">A Exhibit 39.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-14\">Q In other words, would you feel qualified to asses the affect this would have on the potential for a vocational employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-15\">A I could make assesments, in other setting I do not do that in this setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-16\">Q Well, asuming that you asked to make an assesment, what would it be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-17\">A I would decline to do so, unless I was constructed to do by the Administrative Law Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-18\">Q Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-19\">AU: You can put any questions up that you want to up and then I\u2019ll rule out department (Phonetic) request if he doesn\u2019t want to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-20\">A Well what's the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-21\">Q The question is in your practice if you are confronted with a report similar to this and you had asses vocational de-tentionals, would you feel qualified to asses it\u2019s impact on his ability to work. And then the doctor said that he didn\u2019t want to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-23\">AU: Yes, you can answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-24\">Dr. Lawrence: May I see the report then Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-25\">AU: Are you referring to the Exhibit 39 [the records concerning appellant\u2019s hospital stay for treatment of alcoholism]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-26\">ATTORNEY: I have it handy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-27\">AU: This is the admission of June 5, 1982, is that the one that you are looking at?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-28\">ATTORNEY: Yes, June five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-29\">Dr. Lawrence: Based upon this report then I would suggest that they thought the condition was stablized. If there was insight of good motivation, the prognosis qould seem to be positive, there was an absence of black out tremmer seizes (Phonetic) there is not an indication of how much had been drunk daily, so I would say on the basis of this there seemed to be nothing that would indicate any ominous signs of potential continuation. That would not negatively influence me in the types of jobs that I have included.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-30\">Tr. at 13-17, R. 56-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-31\">Dr. Lawrence\u2019s conclusion in the final sentence quoted above apparently refers only to \u201cpotential continuation\u201d as the factor that would not negatively influence his conclusions about the appellant\u2019s ability to obtain the suggested jobs. Similarly, the AU\u2019s discussion of the appellant\u2019s alcoholism mentions only that the appellant does not currently appear to be an alcoholic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-32\">[I am] aware that the claimant has had problems with alcoholism and was hospitalized for such in the summer of 1982; however, the record fails to demonstrate any on-going alcohol abuse or significant associated mental or physical residuals. Thus, [I do] not find that the claimant\u2019s problems with alcoholism to be such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>to significantly interfere with work activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Opinion of AU at 5, R. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">In light of the fact that Dr. Kuhagen specifically testified that the appellant\u2019s history of alcoholism and arrest for drunken driving would significantly reduce his chances of obtaining jobs as flagman or watchman, and that Dr. Lawrence and the AU concluded only that the appellant was not currently addicted to alcohol, on remand the AU must consider how the appellant\u2019s record of alcoholism and arrest for drunken driving affects his chances for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Because we do not find substantial evidence to support the AU\u2019s determination that the appellant is capable of a wide range of light and sedentary work, we remand the case to the District Court with instructions for it to remand the case to the SSA. On remand, the agency should ensure that any vocational expert proffering jobs suitable for the appellant take into account only that portion of the appellant\u2019s education that still contributes to his functional abilities. The agency should have before it the results of a recently obtained medical exam of the appellant\u2019s lower extremities before deciding whether the appellant\u2019s complaints of severe but occasional problems with walking or standing are credible. Finally, the agency must consider the impact of the appellant\u2019s prior history of alcoholism and his arrest for driving while intoxicated upon his chances for future employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">\n<em>Vacated and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-14\">.
