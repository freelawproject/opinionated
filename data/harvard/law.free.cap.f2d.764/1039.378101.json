This status was to continue until December 20, 1984, and was conditioned on his pursuing a full course of study. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(F)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(f)(5)-(6) (1985). Igbatayo received a master\u2019s degree from the Texas Arts and Industry University in December 1982; after receiving this degree he did not re-enroll as a full-time student, but remained in the United States. In February 1984, Igbatayo ordered a .22 caliber rifle from Paul Basca, a federally-licensed firearms dealer. In conjunction with this purchase, Igbatayo completed Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division Form 4473, on which question 8(g) asks whether the purchaser of the firearm is an alien \u201cillegally in the United States.\u201d Igbatayo answered this question in the negative. On May 24, 1984, an immigration judge ordered Igbatayo\u2019s deportation as a result of his failure to maintain student status as required by his visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">Igbatayo was indicted and convicted by a jury on the basis of his negative answer to question 8(g) on form 4473. The only issue of any note which Igbatayo raises in this appeal is whether he was an \u201cillegal alien\u201d prior to the date that he was actually ordered deported. Igbatayo argues that the language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(9), which provides \u201cAny alien in the United States (including an alien crewman) shall, upon the order of the Attorney General, be deported who \u2014 ... was admitted as a non-immigrant and failed to maintain the non-immigrant status in which he was admitted ...,\u201d merely renders him \u201cdeportable,\u201d not \u201cillegal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">This argument is not convincing. Although the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., does not define the term \u201cillegal alien,\u201d it is clear that an alien who is in the United States without authorization is in the country illegally. After failing to maintain the student status required by his visa, Igbatayo was without authorization to remain in this country. He thus was in the same position legally as the alien who wades across the Rio Grande or otherwise enters the United States without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">Igbatayo\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction are also without merit. His challenge to the sufficiency of the information under which he was charged also fails, since it is clear that read as a whole and in a practical fashion, the information gave Igbatayo entirely adequate notice of the charge and its elements. See <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2907, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>United States v. Lennon, </em>751 F.2d 737, 743 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
