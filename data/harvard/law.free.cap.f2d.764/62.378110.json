Because equitable relief must, by its very nature, be tailored to the facts of a particular dispute, we shall proceed to set forth the factual background of this appeal before addressing the relevant legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">In 1937, Joseph M. Scott, Sr. \u2014 the father of the principal participants in this action\u2014 established Scott House and Garden Service, the predecessor to Scott Swimming Pools, Inc. (\u201cSSPI\u201d). Although the design and construction of swimming pools constituted only a small fraction of the business in its incipiency, by the 1950\u2019s it had become the firm\u2019s primary source of income. By the time of its incorporation in 1969, SSPI had gained a reputation throughout the state of Connecticut as a builder of quality swimming pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">Joseph M. Scott, Sr. has two sons, James Scott (\u201cJames\u201d), and Joseph M. Scott, Jr. (\u201cJoseph Jr.\u201d), who worked in the family business during their youth. James\u2019s participation with the company was more constant than Joseph Jr.\u2019s, and he eventually purchased the firm from his father. In 1969, James became president of SSPI, and his father remained as vice president. Following a ten-year period during which Joseph Jr. lived and worked in Texas, he returned to Connecticut in 1965 and rejoined the family business. Until 1972, he was employed by SSPI as a salesman and customer relations representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">Over the course of time, the two brothers frequently disagreed about the structure and operation of the company and, in 1972, Joseph Jr. left SSPI to embark on his own career. To this end, Joseph Jr. established a firm called Scott AquaScapes (\u201cAquaS-capes\u201d), and the brothers entered into an agreement pursuant to which the new company was to serve as the sole residential sales agent for SSPI in Fairfield County, Connecticut. The agreement further provided that AquaScapes would receive a commission equal to ten percent of the price of each SSPI pool that it sold. AquaScapes performed certain peripheral work (e.g., site clearing, rock placement and deck construction) for its own benefit, and assumed sole responsibility for customer relations. Finally, AquaScapes explicit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ly agreed to promote SSPI\u2019s good will in Fairfield County.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In 1974, the two companies entered into a new agreement, whereby AquaScapes continued to act as the sole residential sales agent for SSPI in Fairfield County, but no longer sold SSPI pools on a commission basis. Instead, AquaScapes agreed to enter into two contracts with each customer. First, Joseph Jr., as president of AquaScapes, would contract on SSPI\u2019s behalf for the purchase and installation of the basic SSPI pool shell. A second contract was to be made for AquaScapes to provide all landscaping and pool servicing. The 1974 agreement permitted AquaScapes to perform additional work, thus providing a correspondingly greater profit potential. All contracts made by Joseph Jr. for the basic SSPI pool were subject to review by SSPI\u2019s principal office. As was the case with the earlier agreement, AquaScapes promised to promote the good will of SSPI. Until 1983, SSPI referred all inquiries from potential customers in Fairfield County to AquaScapes. And during this period Joseph Jr. acquired a reputation, in his own right, as a designer of quality custom pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">In 1983, Joseph Jr. decided to terminate the agency relationship between AquaS-capes and SSPI. He filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation under Connecticut law changing the name of the firm to the \u201cJoseph Scott Company.\u201d The new company did not sell SSPI pools, but instead hired sub-contractors to build basic pools shells. The Joseph Scott Company\u2019s logo prominently featured the word \u201cSCOTT,\u201d positioned above a tree and pool motif. The slogan adopted by the Joseph Scott Company stated \u201cSwimming Pool Craftsmen &amp; Landscape Designers for Three Generations.\u201d Following its formation, the Joseph Scott Company removed the SSPI identification plaques from existing pools it had installed in Fairfield County, and replaced them with new ones that read \u201cJOSEPH SCOTT COMPANY, For Three Generations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">SSPI quickly and vehemently objected to Joseph Scott Company\u2019s use of its mark and logo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response, in May 1984, Joseph Scott Company sought a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut permitting the use of its name and the name of its president, Joseph M. Scott, Jr., in all aspects of the swimming pool business. SSPI answered in a timely fashion and moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining Joseph Scott Company, <em>inter alia, </em>from infringing SSPI\u2019s rights in the mark \u201cSCOTT\u201d and its logo, and prohibiting the use of the name \u201cJoseph Scott, or any colorable imitation thereof, as a company name, trade name, trademark, or service mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The parties agreed to the entry of a Temporary Restraining Order on Consent and, in June 1984, a six-day hearing was held on SSPI\u2019s motion for preliminary in-junctive relief. During the proceedings before Judge Daly, James Scott\u2019s secretary testified that she had received a telephone call from a client inquiring whether Joseph Scott, Sr. had formed his own business. Bruce Fishkin, a consultant to both firms, stated that the marketing strategy he had developed for Joseph Jr. was \u201cstrategically identical\u201d to the one he had designed previously for SSPI, and that he had warned him of the similarity. Moreover, he opined that if two hundred prospective \u201cScott\u201d pool purchasers were asked \u201cif ... they could make a distinction [between SSPI and the Joseph Scott Company], I think they\u2019d be confused between the two.\u201d Betty Ajay, an established landscape designer, testified that the name Joseph Scott, Jr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>was synonymous with SSPI in Fairfield County. Similarly, James Fox, a landscape architect, stated, \u201cI know that Joe Scott [Jr.] is Scott Pools and that\u2019s what I care about.\u201d When asked which company would build a pool if he were to refer a customer to Joseph Jr. personally, Fox replied, \u201cJoe Scott Pools, Scott AquaScapes, Scott Pools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">From this testimony, the district court concluded that \u201cconfusion was evident____ Witnesses repeatedly and inadvertently referred to pools built by the Joseph Scott Company as \u2018Scott Pools.\u2019 \u201d He found that the Joseph Scott Company\u2019s logo was \u201ccuriously similar and almost identical to the registered logo\u201d of SSPI. The court also focused on the Joseph Scott Company\u2019s slogan, which bore a striking resemblance to SSPI\u2019s slogan, \u201cthe <em>Preferred </em>Builder of Quality since 1937.\u201d Judge Daly noted that the Joseph Scott Company\u2019s slogan was factually erroneous, and improperly suggested that the firm was related to SSPI. In sum, the district court concluded that the Joseph Scott Company\u2019s entire marketing strategy \u201c[h]as caused, and [is] likely to continue to cause, confusion on the part of an appreciable number of consumers.\u201d Accordingly, Judge Daly held that there existed \u201can actual and imminent threat of irreparable harm\u201d to SSPI, and granted injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">The preliminary injunction issued by the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is divided into two sections. Section I specifically prohibits the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the word \u201cSCOTT\u201d in the name of Joseph Jr.\u2019s company, and contains general prohibitions against unfair competition. Section II delineates those specific circumstances in which the new company may demonstrate Joseph Jr.\u2019s affiliation with the firm. The injunction provides that the name Joseph M. Scott Jr. may be used only as a full signature, and may be no larger than one-fourth the size of the lettering used in the company name. Moreover, the signature may appear only in the \u201clower right-hand portion of [a] label, advertisement, or page,\u201d provided it appears \u201cin direct conjunction with a disclaimer stating, \u201cNot Connected with Scott Swimming Pools, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Joseph Scott Company timely filed a notice of appeal from the order granting the preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The standards for granting preliminary injunctive relief are well established in this Circuit. The moving party must show (a) the possibility of irreparable injury, and (b) either (1) likelihood of success on the merits, or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting injunctive relief. <em>Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, </em>754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir.1985); <em>Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>Caulfield v. Board of Educ., </em>583 F.2d 605, 610 (2d Cir.1978). In a trademark case, irreparable injury will be found where \u201cthere is any likelihood that an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers are likely to be misled, or indeed simply confused, as to the source of the goods in question.\u201d <em>McGregor-Doniger, Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126, 1130 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s disposition of a motion for a preliminary in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>junction, factual findings will be upheld unless they are found to be \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). There was ample testimony upon which Judge Daly could find that actual confusion existed in the relevant market, and that the potential for further confusion was acute. Experienced professionals expressed some confusion regarding the affiliations of the Scott brothers to the respective firms. Moreover, a visual comparison of the two companies\u2019 marketing materials revealed striking similarities. In sum, our review of the transcript below reveals that the district court\u2019s findings are not reversible pursuant to a strict application of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In assessing the remaining requirements for a preliminary injunction, we agree with Judge Daly\u2019s conclusion that, based on <em>Taylor Wine Co. v. Bully Hill Vineyards, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 731 (2d Cir.1978), SSPI is likely to succeed on the merits or, alternatively, that there exist sufficiently serious questions going to the merits, and that the balance of the hardships tips decidedly in favor of SSPI. Accordingly, we hold that SSPI\u2019s motion for preliminary injunctive relief was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\n<em>The Scope of the Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">By its very nature, a preliminary injunction is a specific equitable remedy and, thus, must be framed in such a way as to strike a delicate balance between competing interests. By necessity, the scope of the injunction must be drawn by reference to the facts of the individual case, reflecting a careful balancing of the equities. Where, as in the instant case, a decree serves to limit an individual\u2019s use of his own name in a business that he has nurtured, a court must be particularly cautious to enjoin only those uses that are likely to create appreciable confusion, and no more. <em>See Waterman Co. v. Modern Pen Co., </em>235 U.S. 88, 35 S.Ct. 91, 59 L.Ed. 142 (1914). The ultimate aim is to frame an injunction that will avoid confusion in the marketplace, protect a prior company\u2019s property interest in its name, and permit an individual to exploit his own identity and reputation in a legitimate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">With these principles in mind, we are troubled by the breadth of the injunctive relief fashioned by the district court. Evidence adduced at the hearing below demonstrated that the use by Joseph Jr. of the company name \u201cJoseph Scott Company\u201d caused actual confusion in the marketplace. Accordingly, the decree prohibiting him from further use of the word \u201cScott\u201d in the name of the firm seems appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are not convinced, however, that the more onerous restrictions placed upon the use of his name are necessary under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">Indeed, courts have often noted their concern that injunctions in cases such as this be drawn as narrowly as possible. In <em>Waterman, supra, </em>235 U.S. 88, 35 S.Ct. 91, the Court permitted an alleged infringer, who intentionally used his own name to capitalize on the established reputation of another company bearing the same name, to use his full name provided it was followed immediately by a statement disclaiming any connection with the more established firm. Similarly, in <em>Stetson v. Stetson, </em>85 F.2d 586 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 U.S. 605, 57 S.Ct. 232, 81 L.Ed. 446 (1936), this Court upheld a preliminary injunction that placed some limitations upon the use of the name Stephen L. Stetson. Stephen Stetson had founded a hat manufacturing firm long after the better known and established John B. Stetson company had acquired a reputation as a premier maker of hats. A disclaimer stating that the defendant was never connected with the John B. Stetson Company was found sufficient to avoid confusion between the two firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">More recently, in <em>Taylor Wine Co., supra, </em>569 F.2d 731, we modified a preliminary injunction prohibiting Walter S. Taylor from infringing the registered trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>marks of the Taylor Wine Company. Taylor\u2019s sole connection with Taylor Wines was filial; he was the grandson of its founder. He had no financial interest in the company and, in fact, had sold his own wines since 1970, under the name Bully Hill Vineyards. In 1977, he marketed a new line of wines under the brand name \u201cWalter S. Taylor.\u201d In reviewing the preliminary injunction entered by the district court, we concluded that an absolute prohibition against use of the word \u201cTaylor\u201d in connection with labeling, packaging, or advertising was unnecessarily restrictive. We stated: \u201cIf ... the second comer owns the company and evinces a genuine interest in establishing as enterprise in which his own skill or knowledge can be made known to the public, that argues in favor of allowing him to use his own name in some restricted fashion.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[particularly when the infringer is a son or grandson ... the courts have given qualified relief which reflects a judicious balancing of the countervailing interests of protecting an individual\u2019s use of his own name and the avoiding of confusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Friend v. H.A. Friend &amp; Co., </em>416 F.2d 526, 534 (9th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 914, 90 S.Ct. 916, 25 L.Ed.2d 94 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The matter was remanded to the District Court with instructions to permit Taylor to show his personal connection with Bully Hill through the use of his signature on a wine label or advertisement, provided it was accompanied by a statement disclaiming any affiliation with Taylor Wines. We explicitly stated, \u201cto the extent that Walter S. Taylor can exploit his <em>own </em>knowledge or techniques as a person, he may do so with the limitations noted, if he refrains from trading on the goodwill of the plaintiff company by competing unfairly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Returning to the present dispute, we note the striking similarity between the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Daly and the one fashioned by the <em>Taylor </em>court. There are, however, important factual distinctions between the two cases that impel us to conclude certain of the injunction\u2019s terms extend further than is necessary to avoid confusion and prevent Joseph Jr. from capitalizing on the good will of SSPI. First, Joseph Jr. has a legitimate and compelling interest in using his name in the swimming pool business, having spent twelve years cultivating a personal reputation as a designer of quality custom built pools. It is true that Joseph Jr. was contractually obliged to promote the good will of SSPI in connection with the sale of its basic pools. During the early 1980\u2019s, however, sales of SSPI pools comprised an ever smaller portion of his business. As is particularly evident by the terms of the 1974 agreement, Joseph Jr. was given the freedom to develop an independent business, the success of which was predicated on his personal design expertise and sales ability.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Moreover, we note that the <em>Taylor </em>injunction was designed to avoid confusion among ordinary consumers of wine. There is an enormous difference, however, between the time and expense necessary to purchase a bottle of wine and that required to purchase a swimming pool that may cost more than $50,000. An absolute prohibition against the use of one\u2019s given name, except as a small signature in the corner of a label, may be necessary to eliminate confusion in connection with an ordinary wine purchase. But we believe such a requirement to be unnecessarily restrictive when applied to sales of expensive swimming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>pools, requiring countless hours of contemplation and negotiation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Under these circumstances, we believe Joseph Jr. should be permitted to use his name to describe his past accomplishments and expertise in connection with the design, construction and sale of swimming pools. Of course, he must make perfectly clear that his firm is no longer associated with, and is not a successor to, SSPI. We do not believe, however, that narrow restrictions regarding type size or design are necessary to avoid confusion among potential pool purchasers. A modification of this kind will minimize the hardship on Joseph Jr., while at the same time maintaining the requisite safeguards to protect SSPI\u2019s position in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Accordingly, in the interest of judicial expediency and with the hope that the parties will soon proceed to the merits of this case, the order of the district court is modified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(1) The portion of paragraph II that provides \u201cby using the full signature of Joseph M. Scott, Jr. on labels and in advertising and promotional materials\u201d shall be deleted, and in its place the following language shall be inserted: \u201cby using the full name of Joseph M. Scott, Jr. on pool signage, and in advertising and promotional materials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(2) The word \u201csignature\u201d in paragraph 11(a) shall be changed to the words \u201cfull name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(3) The language of paragraph 11(c) that provides \u201cthe size of the lettering of the signature is no larger than one-fourth the size of the lettering of the words in the company name\u201d shall read \u201cthe size of the lettering of the name is no larger than the lettering of the company name.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">(4) Paragraph 11(d), prohibiting the use of the signature without a disclaimer, is deleted and the following is substituted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201c(d) the name shall appear only in direct conjunction with the following dis-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">claimer: \u201cNot Connected with, Or a Successor to, Scott Swimming Pools, Inc.\u201d, which disclaimer shall be the same size and no less prominent than the name;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">(5) Paragraph (e), prohibiting the signature from appearing other than in the lower right-hand portion of a label, advertisement or page, is deleted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">(6) Paragraph 11(f), permitting the signature to appear on checks, legal or business documents, is deleted as unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-15\">In all other respects, we deem the injunction framed by Judge Daly to be proper. Accordingly, the order of the district court is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-6\">. In 1975, SSPI was granted a Connecticut Certificate of Registration Number for its logo mark \"SCOTT\u201d and its \u201cKidney Design,\u201d as well as its slogan, \u201cthe <em>Preferred </em>Builder of Quality since 1937.\u201d In 1978, it received a U.S. Registration Number for its service mark \"Scott\u201d in connection with the construction and maintenance of swimming pools.

In August 1984, Joseph Scott Company filed a Notice of Appeal, and moved for modification of the preliminary injunction. The District Court denied that motion. Following the District Court\u2019s issuance of its Finding of Fact and Conclusions of Law in December 1984, Joseph Scott Company moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b), to add additional findings. Pending a decision on the second motion, Joseph Scott Company withdrew its Notice of Appeal without prejudice. Following the denial of its Rule 52 motion, the appeal was reinstated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">. It appears from the record that Joseph Jr.\u2019s firm has been operating under the name \u201cThe Glen Gate Company\u201d since the issuance of the preliminary injunction in August 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-5\">. Following the remand, the case once again came before this court, and specific provisions of the injunction were modified to allow Taylor to use his name as a signature in the lower right-hand corner of any label or advertisement when accompanied by a notice of disclaimer. The size of the signature was limited to one-fourth the size of the lettering used for the words \"Bully Hill\u201d on any label or advertisement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. That he took advantage of this opportunity is evidenced by 1983 sales figures demonstrating that AquaScapes total sales equaled approximately $1,800,000, and only $450,000 of that amount was attributable to sales of SSPI pools.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-11\">. The district court\u2019s repeated use of the term \"label\u201d evidences its wholesale reliance on the language of the injunction framed by this Court in <em>Taylor. </em>\"Labels\u201d are obviously of great significance in the marketing of wine, but it is less clear that they play any role in the sale or promotion of expensive swimming pools.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
