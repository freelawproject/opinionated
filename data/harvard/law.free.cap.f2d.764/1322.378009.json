BLAINE ANDERSON, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">Donald James Kalgaard appeals the order of the United States Tax Court disallowing his claimed contributions to a chartered congregation of the Universal Life Church. On appeal, the plaintiff raises four issues: 1) whether the decision of the Tax Commissioner to disallow the plaintiff\u2019s claimed contributions was proper; 2) whether the church records allegedly establishing plaintiff\u2019s contributions to the church should have been admitted into evidence; 3) whether the Tax Court decided constitutional issues not in its jurisdiction; and 4) whether the Tax Court improperly imposed additions to the plaintiff\u2019s tax deficiencies as allowed by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">In response, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue asserts that the claims made by the plaintiff are without merit and are raised in intentional disregard of applicable rules. The Commissioner therefore seeks the imposition of sanctions against the plaintiff and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">We affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decision and impose double costs and $1,000.00 attorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiff and his counsel being jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">I. DISALLOWANCE OF TAX DEDUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">The findings of the Tax Court disallowing claimed deductions by a taxpayer will be upheld unless such findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 290, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1199, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). A decision by the Commissioner disallowing deductions \u201chas the support of a presumption of correctness, and the petitioner has the burden of proving it to be wrong.\u201d <em>Welch v. Helvering, </em>290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 9, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933). Taxpayers may deduct charitable contributions made \u201cto or for the use of\u201d an organization operated \u201cexclusively for religious, charitable,\u201d or similar purposes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 170(c)(2)(B). \u201cThe courts have repeatedly held that exemptions for parent churches do not automatically carry over to local congregations.\u201d <em>Hall v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>729 F.2d 632, 634 (9th Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-17\">In this instance, because the plaintiff has failed to prove that the local congregations he contributed to were organized and operated exclusively for religious purposes, the plaintiff has not overcome the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d in favor of the Commissioner. The plaintiff has also failed to show that his contributions to the local chapter of the Universal Life Church did not inure to his own benefit. <em>See Hall, </em>729 F.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-18\">We find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to disallow the plaintiff\u2019s claimed contributions is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-19\">II. EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-20\">The Tax Court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kearney, </em>560 F.2d 1358, 1369 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 971, 98 S.Ct. 522, 54 L.Ed.2d 460 (1977). \u201cThe contents of ... records ... may be presented in the form of a ... summary____ The originals ... shall be made available for examination____ The court may order that they be produced in evidence.\u201d Federal Rules of Evidence 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>Without the source documents being made available to the Tax Court, reliability of the summaries presented by the plaintiff to the court was not capable of verification. Exclusion of the plaintiffs summaries as hearsay evidence was proper and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">III. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES IN THE TAX COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">\u201cCourts routinely permit cursory questioning in the Tax Court to determine whether an organization is entitled to a religious exemption.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>729 F.2d at 635 (citation omitted). This allows the court to determine whether the organization meets the objective criteria for tax-exempt status pursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 170. <em>Id. </em>The entitlement to a tax exemption claimed by Kalgaard in this case raises \u201cno real questions regarding \u2018religion\u2019 as referred to in the First Amendment ____\u201d <em>United States v. Dykema, </em>666 F.2d 1096, 1100 (7th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 983, 102 S.Ct. 2257, 72 L.Ed.2d 861 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the Tax Court impermissibly decided a constitutional issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">IV. ADDITIONS TO TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">Appellate review of the findings of the Tax Court will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1199, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). If any part of underpayments of taxes due is a result of \u201cnegligence or intentional disregard of rules and regulations\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service, then \u201cthere shall be added to the tax an amount equal to 5 percent of the underpayment.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6653.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">The Tax Court did not err in assessing the 5 percent addition to plaintiff\u2019s taxes. Plaintiff failed to sustain his burden of showing that his underpayment of tax was not due to negligence or intentional disregard of the revenue laws. The additions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-13\">V. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-14\">The court of appeals may assess damages against a plaintiff and his or her attorney for filing a frivolous appeal, for delay, or for vexatious litigation. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(c)(4); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927; Fed.R.App.P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-15\">The attorney representing the plaintiff in this case also represented the plaintiffs in <em>Hall v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>729 F.2d 632 (9th Cir.1984). He was on notice of the law governing this ease and the lack of merit in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-16\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-17\">We affirm the holdings of the Tax Court. We also impose double costs and award to the Commissioner $1,000.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees, plaintiff and his counsel being jointly and severally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
