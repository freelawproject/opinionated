The underlying suit stems from Dennis J. Ryan\u2019s conviction for failure to file his 1977 and 1978 tax returns, in violation of I.R.C. \u00a7 7203 (1982). Because the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict at Ryan\u2019s first trial, the presiding judge \u2014 District Judge Richard M. Bilby \u2014 declared a mistrial and reset the case for a second trial. At the second trial, the jury found Ryan guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">On November 23,1983, Ryan filed a complaint in district court seeking damages for various alleged civil rights violations. Ryan\u2019s suit named Judge Bilby, the prosecutor, Ryan\u2019s own attorney, two magistrates involved in Ryan\u2019s prosecution, and the IRS agents responsible for investigating Ryan\u2019s case as defendants. Ryan alleged that Judge Bilby and the two attorneys conspired to violate his Fifth Amendment immunity from double jeopardy by holding a second trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His claim against the magistrates and the IRS agents, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), apparently asserted that the tax laws are unenforceable, a contention which Ryan renews on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">Throughout December 1983, Ryan filed and recorded various common-law liens and writs of attachment on the defendants\u2019 property. Judge Bilby and the two magistrates moved the district court to release the liens. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion and enjoined Ryan from filing similar liens in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">The district court then disposed of the case. He dismissed Ryan\u2019s claims against the three judicial defendants and the prosecutor under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), finding that each enjoyed absolute immunity from civil suits seeking damages. And he granted summary judgment to the IRS agents, finding that they enjoyed absolute immunity from lawsuits alleging common-law torts and qualified immunity from Ryan\u2019s allegations of constitutional torts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">On appeal, Ryan challenges the dismissal of his suit and contests the district court\u2019s order releasing his common-law liens. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-14\">First, we reject Ryan\u2019s contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to release his baseless common-law liens and writs of attachment. The district court properly exercised its power under I.R.C. \u00a7 7402(a) (1982) to \u201crender such judgments and decrees as may be necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the internal revenue laws.\u201d We agree with courts in other circuits that section 7402(a) empowers the district court to void common-law liens imposed by taxpayers on the property of government officials assigned to collect delinquent taxes. <em>See United States v. Ekblad, </em>732 F.2d 562, 563 (7th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Hart, </em>701 F.2d 749, 750 (8th Cir.1983); <em>see also United States v. Van Dyke, </em>568 F.Supp. 820 (D.Or.1983) (enjoining tax protesters from filing common-law liens to harass IRS employees and thereby deter enforcement of the tax laws). We find, therefore, that the district court ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-15\">Second, the district court properly dismissed Ryan\u2019s claims against the judicial defendants and the prosecutor and properly granted summary judgment to the IRS-agent defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-16\">Ryan\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that, as Congress has never enacted Title 26 of the United States Code into positive law, the defendants violated his constitutional rights by attempting to enforce it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, he concludes, the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>by dismissing his suit. This contention is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Congress\u2019s failure to enact a title into positive law has only evidentiary significance and does not render the underlying enactment invalid or unenforceable. <em>See </em>1 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (1982) (the text of titles not enacted into positive law is only prima facie evidence of the law itself). Like it or not, the Internal Revenue Code is the law, and the defendants did not violate Ryan\u2019s rights by enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">Moreover, the district court properly found that all of the defendants were immune from civil suits seeking damages. Both the judicial defendants and the prosecutor are absolutely immune from suit. Judicial officers enjoy absolute immunity from civil damages liability for judicial acts not taken in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 355-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1104-05, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>e.g., United States v. Claiborne, </em>727 F.2d 842, 845 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 113, 83 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Nevada, </em>686 F.2d 749, 750 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1071, 103 S.Ct. 491, 74 L.Ed.2d 633 (1982). And the prosecutor enjoys an absolute immunity from civil damages liability when he acts in a quasi-judicial capacity. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Demery v. Kupperman, </em>735 F.2d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 810, 83 L.Ed.2d 803 (1985). At no point has Ryan maintained that the magistrates\u2019 actions or Judge Bilby\u2019s decision to order a second trial were not judicial acts or that the judicial defendants \u201cacted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stump, </em>435 U.S. at 357, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 (quoting <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872)); <em>O\u2019Neil v. City of Lake Oswego, </em>642 F.2d 367, 369 (9th Cir.1981). Nor can he establish that the prosecutor\u2019s actions in securing a conviction were anything but \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>Demery, </em>735 F.2d at 1144 (quoting <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 430, 96 S.Ct. at 995). The district court correctly concluded that all these defendants enjoy absolute judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">The IRS agents are immune as well. To the extent Ryan\u2019s complaint alleges common-law torts, the agents are absolutely immune. <em>See Owyhee Grazing Association v. Field, </em>637 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201c[A] federal official cannot be held personally liable in tort for \u2018acts committed within the outer perimeter of his line of duty.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Clifton v. Cox, </em>549 F.2d 722, 726 (9th Cir.1977)); <em>Miller v. De-Laune, </em>602 F.2d 198, 200 (9th Cir.1979) (same). And the agents are immune from liability for constitutional torts \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); <em>accord, e.g., Capoeman v. Reed, </em>754 F.2d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1985). Ryan\u2019s sole contention in the face of the district court\u2019s finding that the agents\u2019 conduct satisfied the <em>Harlow </em>standard, <em>see </em>Clerk\u2019s Record 73, at 4, is that the agents violated his constitutional rights by enforcing the tax code. Ryan makes only \u201cbare allegations of malice\u201d which the Supreme Court intended district courts to dispose of by summary judgment. <em>See Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 817-18, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. The district court properly did so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">We have discretion to impose sanctions for frivolous appeals. Fed.R.App.P. 38; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 (1982); <em>e.g., Gattuso v. Pecorella, </em>733 F.2d 709, 710 (9th Cir. 1984). However heartfelt, we find Ryan\u2019s contentions on appeal utterly without mer-</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>it. Even though Ryan appears pro se, we award double costs to the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">. Ryan also sought unspecified mandamus relief, apparently directed at the United States Attorney\u2019s office, based on the assertion that Judge Bilby illegally tampered with the jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">. Ryan\u2019s claim against his own attorney was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1395-17\">. Ryan erroneously relies on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. That statute applies only to actions taken under color of state law. We assume, however, that Ryan\u2019s complaint states a <em>Bivens </em>action to redress the deprivation of constitutional rights by federal officials. <em>See Bivens </em>v. <em>Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 390-97, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2001-05, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1396-10\">. Judicial immunity is not limited to judges. All those who perform judge-like functions are immune from civil damages liability. <em>Richardson v. Koshiba, </em>693 F.2d 911, 913 (9th Cir.1982). Because the role of a magistrate is \"functionally comparable\u201d to that of a judge, magistrates enjoy immunity as well. <em>Cf. Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 511-14, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2913-14, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978) (extending judicial immunity to administrative law judges and hearing examiners employed by the executive branch); <em>Sellars v. Procunier, </em>641 F.2d 1295, 1301-04 (9th Cir.) (parole board officials), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1102, 102 S.Ct. 678, 70 L.Ed.2d 644 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
