The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that the bylaw violates the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and is unconstitutional on its face because it gives commercial speech more protection than noncommercial speech. Under the circumstances present here, we agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The Town of Needham enacted a sign bylaw to prohibit virtually all off-premise outdoor signs. Excepted, however, are those outdoor signs \u201cpertaining exclusively to the premises on which they are located or to the products, accommodations, services or activities on the premises.\u201d Need-ham Sign Bylaw \u00a7 4.3. Section 5 of the bylaw lists signs that are permitted in Needham. Included in this section are signs denoting the name and/or profession of the owner or occupant of the building, temporary signs erected for a charitable cause, temporary signs relating to the sale, rental or lease of the premises or stating the name and address of the parties involved in construction on the premises, and one bulletin board for and on the premises of a public, charitable, or religious institution. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5.1. <em>See </em>appendix A attached hereto. Signs not expressly allowed are prohibited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Plaintiffs, Daniel Matthews and Philip Lindsay, seek to post temporary 28\" X 22\" political signs on their houses and lawns. Political signs are not listed among the exceptions noted in the bylaw and are therefore prohibited. Consequently, the plaintiffs filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the defendants, primarily on the ground that the sign bylaw violates their first amendment right to freedom of speech. In particular, the plaintiffs sought an injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing the bylaw with regard to the posting of political signs. The plaintiffs also sought a declaration that the bylaw is unconstitutional on its face, and as applied to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The parties agree that there are no material facts at issue. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment and, after holding a hearing, the district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, holding that the bylaw violates the plaintiffs\u2019 first amendment right to freedom of speech and is unconstitutional on its face. <em>See Matthews v. Town of Needham, </em>596 F.Supp. 932, 935 (D.Mass. 1984). The court subsequently issued an order declaring the bylaw unconstitutional and enjoining the defendants from enforcing the bylaw with respect to the posting of political signs. The defendants, after an unsuccessful attempt to have the order amended to their satisfaction, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201cabove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its <em>content.\u201d Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (emphasis added). A restriction, however, on the \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d of speech is permissible if it advances a significant governmental interest, is justified without reference to the content of the speech, and leaves open \u201cample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>See Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 771, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976); <em>Metromedia v. City of San Diego, </em>453 U.S. 490, 516, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2897, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981). The defendants contend that the restriction contained in the bylaw at issue in the instant case is of this latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>type. A review of the facts and the law negates this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">No political signs are allowed in any district in the Town of Needham; yet such signs as \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs, professional office signs, contractors\u2019 advertisements, and signs erected for charitable or religious causes are allowed in all districts. Furthermore, in business and manufacturing zones, large commercial advertising signs are permitted which pertain to products, accommodations, services, or activities on the premises on which they are located, but no political signs are permitted. <em>See </em>Need-ham Sign Bylaw \u00a7\u00a7 4.3, 5.3, 6(g) &amp; (h). Thus, it appears that the bylaw is concerned with the content, as opposed to the time, place, or manner, of the speech. As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Metromedia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">[W]e reject appellees\u2019 suggestion that the ordinance may be appropriately characterized as a reasonable \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d restriction. The ordinance does not generally ban billboard advertising as an unacceptable \u201cmanner\u201d of communicating information or ideas; rather, it permits various kinds of signs. Signs that are banned are banned everywhere and at all times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">453 U.S. at 515-16, 101 S.Ct. at 2896-97. The instant bylaw, then, cannot legitimately be seen as a \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d restriction. Rather, it is more properly viewed as discriminating on the basis of content.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The defendants respond by asserting that the bylaw does not discriminate on the basis of \u201ccontent,\u201d but rather on the basis of \u201cfunction.\u201d This argument is unpersuasive. The \u201cfunction\u201d of any sign is to communicate the information written on it. The defendants\u2019 preference for the \u201cfunctions\u201d of certain signs over those of other (e.g., political) signs is really nothing more than a preference based on <em>content. Cf. Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro, </em>431 U.S. 85, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 52 L.Ed.2d 155 (1977) (striking down an ordinance prohibiting the posting of \u201cFor Sale\u201d and \u201cSold\u201d signs on the ground that it violated the first amendment by impermis-sibly regulating signs on the basis of content).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\"> Of course, the government is not utterly without power to regulate content. Despite the strong wording in <em>Mosley, see supra, </em>there can be no argument that the right to free expression \u201cis subject to some qualifications.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>408 U.S. at 103, 92 S.Ct. at 2294 (Burger, C.J., concurring); <em>see also </em>L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 12-2, at 581-82 (1978). For example, speech may potentially be suppressed if it poses a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d <em>see Schenck v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct. 247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919), constitutes a defamatory falsehood, <em>see Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 347, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974), or rises to the level of \u201cfighting words,\u201d <em>see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942). Furthermore, a restriction on otherwise protected commercial speech is valid if it seeks to implement a substantial government interest, directly advances that interest, and reaches no further than necessary to accomplish the given objective. <em>See Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 507, 101 S.Ct. at 2892; <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 557, 563-66, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980). Still, if the government seeks to regulate speech on the basis of content, it must, of course, meet a much more exacting standard than would be the case if only time, place, or manner were implicated. Essentially, it is necessary for the government to prove that the regulated speech \u201cfalls on the unprotected side of one of the lines the Court has drawn to distinguish those expressive acts privileged by the first amendment from those open to government regulation with only minimal due process scrutiny.\u201d L. Tribe, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12-2, at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In the instant case, the defendants have failed to establish that the bylaw\u2019s regulation of content is permissible. Here, we are concerned with political speech \u2014 a form of speech generally accorded great protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion. <em>See Members of the City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2135, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984) (stating that \u201cpolitical speech is entitled to the fullest possible measure of constitutional protection\u201d). Despite the preeminent status given to political speech and the lack of any reason (e.g., clear and present danger) to suppress it here, the bylaw in question suppresses this form of speech as well as almost all other noncommercial speech. This is particularly surprising inasmuch as the bylaw permits several forms of commercial speech \u2014 speech consistently given less protection than noncommercial speech. <em>See generally Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 513, 101 S.Ct. at 2895 (\u201c[0]ur recent ?bvc=commercial speech cases have consistently accorded noncommercial speech a greater degree of protection than commercial speech.\u201d). By giving more protection to commercial than to noncommercial speech, the bylaw inverts a well-established constitutional principle. The Supreme Court has examined this very situation and declared that such a law is unconstitutional on its face. <em>See Metromedia, </em>453 U.S. at 512-13, 521, 101 S.Ct. at 2894-95, 2899. The bylaw here, then, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The defendants, in arguing that the bylaw is constitutional, rely heavily on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Members of the City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for </em>Vincent,-U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Vincent, </em>the Court upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting the posting of <em>any </em>signs on <em>public </em>property. The Court concluded that the ordinance was a valid \u201ctime, place, and manner\u201d restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\"><em>Vincent </em>is distinguishable from this case in two important respects. First, <em>Vincent </em>involved a law that prohibited the posting of all signs, regardless of content. The Needham bylaw, on the other hand, is not content-neutral for it permits certain types of speech but prohibits others. We discussed the implications of this content-based discrimination earlier. Second, the ordinance in <em>Vincent </em>was limited to the restraint of signs on public property, whereas the bylaw in the instant case touches on private property. The <em>Vincent </em>Court suggested that the special nature of private property may justify a greater degree of first amendment protection when it concluded that the failure to extend the ordinance to private as well as public property did not invalidate the law. The Court stated: \u201c[T]he validity of the esthetic interest in the elimination of signs on public property is not compromised by failing to extend the ban to private property. The private citizen\u2019s interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the disparate treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 2132. The <em>Vincent </em>case, then, is clearly distinguishable from the case under consideration. Thus, <em>Vincent </em>does not alter our conclusion that the bylaw here is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">Section 5.1 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-15\"><em>All Districts. </em>The following signs are allowed in all zoning districts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-16\">a) One sign, either attached or freestanding, indicating only the name and/or profession of the owner or occupant, and the street number, not to exceed two square feet in area.

Sections 3.2 and 5.1 of the Needham Sign Bylaw are the sections of the bylaw most pertinent to this litigation. Section 3.2 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\"><em>Permits. </em>No sign shall be erected ... without a sign permit issued by the Building Inspector following authorization by the Sign Committee, unless specifically exempted from this requirement in Section 5.
