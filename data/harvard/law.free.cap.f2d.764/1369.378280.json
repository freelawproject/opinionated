Appellant raises two contradictory objections to our holding on abuse of the writ. First, appellant suggests that our decision improperly held that the state had to meet a \u201cheavy burden\u201d to establish abuse of the writ. <em>Potts v. Zant (Potts II), </em>734 F.2d 526, 529 (11th Cir.1984). Second, appellant suggests our decision erred because it \u201csimply concluded without the benefit of an eviden-tiary hearing being held in district court, that the ends of justice-required the district court to consider the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d It therefore appears that some clarification may be in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-21\">Our earlier decision did not hold that the state must meet a particularly stringent burden in <em>pleading </em>abuse of the writ. Under <em>Price v. Johnston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948) and Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (28 U.S.C. foil. \u00a7 2254), it is clear that the government\u2019s only burden in pleading abuse of the writ is \u201cto make that claim with clarity and particularity in its return to the order to show cause.\u201d <em>Price, </em>334 U.S. at 292, 68 S.Ct. at 1063. Once the state has properly raised the issue, the petitioner then has the burden of answering the allegation and proving that he has not abused the writ. <em>Id. </em>The state could meet the initial burden of sufficient pleading here. It faced a considerably more difficult task, however, once the petitioner responded: to convince the court that the abuse was sufficiently grave that nothing, not even the \u201cends of justice,\u201d would warrant consideration of the merits of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>tioner\u2019s claims. The state\u2019s position would be particularly difficult where \u2014 as in the present case \u2014 the petitioner has not yet secured a determination on the merits of his claims. <em>Potts v. Zant (Potts I), </em>638 F.2d 727, 741-42, 751-52 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 877, 102 S.Ct. 357, 70 L.Ed.2d 187 (1981). Thus, \u201c[i]f a petitioner is able to present some \u2018justifiable reason\u2019 explaining his actions, reasons which \u2018make it fair and just for the trial court to overlook\u2019 the allegedly abusive conduct, the trial court should address the successive petition.\u201d <em>Potts I, </em>638 F.2d at 741 (quoting <em>Price, </em>334 U.S. at 291, 68 S.Ct. at 1063).</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\">That is precisely what occurred in the present case. Although the state carried its burden of pleading abuse of the writ, the district judge concluded that the uncontroverted evidence presented to him did not establish that the petitioner had acted with the intent to \u201cvex, harass, or delay.\u201d <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 18, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). Our opinion simply noted that even if the district court had concluded that Potts acted in bad faith in withdrawing his first set of petitions, it would still be within the trial court\u2019s discretion to review the second set o\u00ed petitions under the \u201cends of justice\u201d rationale set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Sanders. </em>In any event, we believe that the trial court correctly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to Potts\u2019 motives for withdrawing his initial set of petitions. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Price </em>suggests merely that a hearing \u201cmay be necessary\u201d where there is a \u201csubstantial conflict\u201d as to the actual facts. <em>Price, </em>334 U.S. at 292, 68 S.Ct. at 1063. Since no such conflict was present here, the district court properly concluded that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">Appellant also claims that this court erred in condemning the prosecutor\u2019s use of a quotation from <em>Eberhart v. State, </em>47 Ga. 598 (1873), in closing argument. It argues that although the use of the statement is not favored, it does not rise to the level of constitutional error. We note that the en banc court has subsequently supported our reasoning in <em>Drake v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1449, 1460 (1985) (en banc). The <em>Drake </em>court found that the inflammatory passage was \u201cmisleading, legally incorrect and prejudicial,\u201d at 1460 and that the prejudice was serious enough to warrant resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-8\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED. No member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 26), the petition for rehearing en banc is also DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
