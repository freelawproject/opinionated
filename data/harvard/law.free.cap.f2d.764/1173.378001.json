RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1242-20\">James Nealy appeals from his conviction and life sentence for the murder of Leo Davis. Nealy contends that his trial attorney failed to secure the testimony of three persons whose testimony might have established an alibi for him, thereby depriving him of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because the trial boiled down to a swearing match between a prosecution witness, who admitted committing the crime, and Nealy, who denied any part in it, and because the missing testimony might have affected the jury\u2019s appraisal of the truthfulness of the state\u2019s witness and its evaluation of the relative credibility of the conflicting witnesses, Nealy has stated a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. We, therefore, reverse the decision of the district court denying Nealy\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus and remand for entry of an order granting him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-22\">Leo Davis was murdered in his grocery store located in Clay County, Mississippi, in 1976. A post-mortem examination revealed that he had been stabbed a number of times, slashed across his throat, and struck on his head and jaw with a blunt instrument. The examining physician concluded that any one of these injuries would have caused Davis\u2019 death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-23\">After the police discovered Davis\u2019 body, they arrested Wiley Ewing and charged him with Davis\u2019 murder. Ewing confessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>to the killing, and assisted the police in recovering a pair of gloves, a knife, and a sawed-off shotgun used in the murder. Ewing also admitted taking some money from Davis\u2019 cash register and two $100 bills from his billfold. Ewing stated that he had travelled to and from Davis\u2019 store in a car borrowed from Nealy, and that he had hidden the $100 bills in the hubcaps of Nealy\u2019s car. Nealy was present when Ewing was arrested. He allowed the police to search his car, and two $100 bills were found inside a hubcap. Ewing did not implicate anyone else in the crime, and Nealy was not arrested at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">Several days later, however, after conferring with his attorney, Ewing gave a statement to the police in which he again confessed to the crime, but in addition, implicated both Nealy and T.L. Cunningham. According to Ewing, the three men had visited the home of Dorothy Belk where they stayed for five to fifteen minutes. From there, they set out in Nealy\u2019s car, and, after beginning their ride, decided to rob Davis\u2019 store. They parked approximately a quarter-mile from the store and walked to it, arriving between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. Cunningham entered the store first in order to distract Davis. Ewing and Nealy then came in, and Nealy struck Davis across the face with the shotgun. After Davis fell to the floor, Ewing began to stab him, and, in the course of the melee, Nealy again struck Davis with the gun, Cunningham kicked him, and Ewing cut his throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">After the men returned to Nealy\u2019s car, Ewing asserted, they drove to a country store and pool hall operated by Tom Bill Avant, arriving between 8:30 and 9:00. No other customers were there. The three men shot pool and left at approximately 9:30. After Ewing drove Cunningham and Nealy home, he borrowed the car from Nealy and drove himself home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">At trial, Ewing appeared for the prosecution and repeated his version of the facts. In addition, Tom Bill Avant, testifying for the state, related that he saw Nealy, Cunningham, and Ewing shooting pool at his place around 9:00 p.m. He further testified that two of the three pool tables were busy when the three men arrived, but he could not remember any of the other customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">The state also called Mary Sanders, Davis\u2019 landlady and next door neighbor. She explained that her home was \u201cwithin hollering distance\u201d of Davis\u2019 store, and in addition, that a microphone located in the store transmitted to a speaker in her home. On the night of the murder, she said, she heard voices in the store between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. and saw a car leaving the store around 8:00. On cross-examination, however, she added that her \u201ctalker\u201d was on \u201creal low\u201d that night, and that her television was on extremely loud \u201cto where you could hear it on the road.\u201d Therefore, she could not recognize the number of voices she heard on her loudspeaker or their identity. She also said that she went to bed at 9:00 that evening and did not hear any other voices or cars at the store that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-9\">Nealy testified on his own behalf. He claimed that the three men (Ewing, Cunningham, and he) went to Dorothy Belk\u2019s home shortly after 8:00 p.m. and stayed for fifteen or thirty minutes. They left about 8:30 and went to Avant\u2019s pool hall, arriving at approximately 9:00. He testified that other people were at Avant\u2019s when he arrived, including Richard and \u201cDuck\u201d Jones. He stated that the three men and the two Jones brothers left together shortly after 9:20, and that, after he drove Cunningham and the Joneses home, he drove himself home and lent Ewing his car. He denied complicity in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-10\">The jury convicted Nealy of the murder of Leo Davis and sentenced him to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After exhausting all available state remedies, Nealy sought federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney, Richard Bur-dine, failed to investigate and secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>testimony of Dorthy Belk (otherwise known as Dorthy Cummings) and the Jones brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">A U.S. Magistrate held an evidentiary hearing on this claim. He found that Bur-dine was aware that Belk was a potential alibi witness because Nealy contended that he was at her house with Ewing and Cunningham at approximately the time Ewing stated the murder took place. Moreover, Burdine knew Belk personally because they had worked together in the same legal services office. Nonetheless, Belk did not testify at Nealy\u2019s trial because Burdine was unable to communicate with her. Burdine spoke with Belk\u2019s grandmother who supplied him with a telephone number for Belk in Wisconsin. He tried to call her there, and left messages for her to return the calls. He made no effort, however, to discover her address or to secure her attendance at trial. Burdine also made no attempt to obtain her presence through the use of the Uniform Witness Attendance Law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">The Magistrate further found that Nealy had told Burdine about the Jones brothers because Burdine\u2019s line of questioning at trial strongly indicated that he was aware that the brothers could corroborate at least a portion of Nealy\u2019s version of the facts. Burdine testified that he had made no ef-. fort to reach the Joneses, claiming at the evidentiary hearing that he did not remember Nealy telling him about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\">Belk appeared at the hearing before the Magistrate. She testified that she met Ewing, Nealy, and Cunningham at a neighbor\u2019s house \u201caround 6:00 or maybe 6:30\u201d and left them at her house \u201caround 7:00, or it could have been 7:30.\u201d On cross-examination, she said that she left her home \u201cprobably around 8:00.\u201d Later, she said that she left her house \u201cbetween 7:30 and 8:00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-15\">The Jones brothers also testified at the evidentiary hearing. They both remembered seeing Nealy, Ewing and Cunningham at Avant\u2019s place, and catching a ride home with them. Neither could remember with certainty whether this occurred on the night of the murder, but both thought that their memories might have been more clear if they had been questioned earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-17\">The Magistrate concluded that, even if Burdine\u2019s failure both to take more vigorous steps to interview Belk and to interview the Jones brothers constituted incompetent representation, Nealy was not prejudiced by these failures. Burdine\u2019s conduct, therefore, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in derogation of the sixth amendment. The district court expressly adopted these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-18\">The scope of our review is governed by <em>Strickland v. </em>Washington.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201calthough District Court findings are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. 52(a) ... the ineffectiveness inquiry [involves] mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is consistent with a long line of Fifth Circuit cases holding that whether a defendant has received effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law rather than purely a question of fact.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-19\">\u201cThis Court must,\u201d therefore, \u201cmake an independent evaluation based on those subsidiary findings in determining whether counsel\u2019s representation satisfied the standards dictated by the sixth and fourteenth amendments.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are required to make our own determination whether Burdine\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>representation passes constitutional muster,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and do not defer to the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court enunciated the two-component standard to be applied when reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArD\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">The Court stressed that the purpose of the constitutional requirement of effective assistance is \u201cto ensure a fair trial,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a fair result.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">A. <em>Burdine\u2019s performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaV2\">\u201cThe proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our inquiry into the adequacy of Burdine\u2019s performance, therefore, must focus on \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nealy argues that Burdine failed in his duty to investigate. To determine the reasonableness of Burdine\u2019s conduct in this situation, we must take into account two different, and potentially antithetical, considerations. First is the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because of the danger of over-zealous post-trial inquiry into an attorney\u2019s decisions made during the litigation, \u201ca particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-18\">A substantial body of Fifth Circuit case law insists, however, \u201cthat \u2018effective, counsel conduct a reasonable amount of pretrial investigation.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the scope of the required investigation is a function of the \u201cnumber of issues in the case, the relative complexity of those issues, the strength of the government\u2019s case and the overall strategy of trial counsel,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> this circuit has recognized that, at a minimum, counsel has the duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the ease.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This duty is reflected in the American Bar Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Standards for Criminal Justice,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> a proper guide for determining what is reasonable under the circumstances.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> These specific obligations inherent in counsel\u2019s duty to investigate must temper the amount of deference we give Burdine\u2019s on-the-spot actions in evaluating his performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">Burdine admittedly made no attempt whatsoever to interview the Jones brothers. Although he tried to telephone Belk in Wisconsin, he made no other efforts to discover her address or to secure her attendance at trial. He also made no attempt to compel Belk\u2019s attendance at trial through the use of the Uniform Witness Attendance Law in effect in both Mississippi and Wisconsin. Nealy has thus identified specific omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">\u201cDefense counsel is not required,\u201d we have said, \u201c \u2018to investigate everyone whose name happens to be mentioned by the defendant.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In all of the cases in which this axiom has been applied, however, the court found either that counsel\u2019s decision not to investigate was part of a clearly developed defensive strategy, or that the defendant could point to no specific evidence that would have been uncovered by a more thorough investigation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Here, however, Nealy has identified specific missing testimony, and has argued that there was no reason for Burdine not to have at least attempted to locate the Jones brothers or to contact Belk. Burdine did not testify that such efforts would have been fruitless, nor did he claim that the decision not to investigate was part of a calculated trial strategy. He simply failed to make the effort to investigate. Burdine, therefore, \u201cdid not <em>choose, </em>strategically or otherwise, to pursue one line of defense over another. Instead, [he] simply abdicated his responsibility to advocate his client\u2019s cause.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Burdine\u2019s failure to investigate thus resulted in a \u201cfactual vacuum\u201d and cannot withstand sixth amendment scrutiny.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-16\">B. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-17\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court articulated \u201cthe appropriate test for prejudice\u201d as follows: \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the results of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cA reasonable probability,\u201d in turn, was defined as, \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201c[A] defendant need <em>not </em>show that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Court found this \u201coutcome-determinative\u201d standard imposed too heavy a burden on defendants, and that its use was not appropriate.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Instead, \u201cthe question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>fact-finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">The Magistrate concluded that Nealy was not prejudiced by Burdine\u2019s failures because neither Belk nor the Jones brothers could have provided adequate alibis on which Nealy could rely. The Magistrate found that, even if Belk and the Joneses had testified at trial, all they could have established was that on the night of the murder, Nealy, Cunningham and Ewing were together at Belk\u2019s home, and that later, the same three men met the Joneses at Tom Bill Avant\u2019s. To the Magistrate, all this would merely have shown that Nealy and Ewing were together at times and places Nealy claimed, that neither one was at Davis\u2019 store at those times, and that consequently, Davis was killed at some other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">The claim that Davis was killed at some other time, however, is precisely Nealy\u2019s theory of the case. He contends that Ewing killed Davis later in the evening after both Nealy and Cunningham had gone home and Ewing was alone. The entire thrust of Nealy\u2019s defense was that the killing occurred at some time other than when the three men were together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">Belk\u2019s testimony would have been important for two reasons. First, it might have helped to establish the whereabouts of the three men early in the evening. Second, it might have discredited Ewing\u2019s version of the facts as implausible, in that there would not have been enough time for the robbery and murder to have been planned and committed after the men left Belk\u2019s home and before they arrived at the pool hall if they remained at Belk\u2019s home for as late as Nealy maintained. Nealy testified that all three men arrived at Belk\u2019s home about 8:00 p.m. and stayed for between fifteen and thirty minutes. Belk\u2019s testimony, although more ambiguous than Nealy\u2019s, might also place the men at her home as late as 8:00. If the jury found this to be true, that would have allowed only thirty minutes after the men left Belk\u2019s home and before they arrived at the pool hall for the planning and consummation of the robbery, the concealment of the weapons, and the travel to the pool hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">The Jones brothers also would have lent credibility to Nealy\u2019s version of the events. At the evidentiary hearing before the Magistrate, both brothers testified that they caught a, ride home from Tom Bill Avant\u2019s with Nealy, Ewing and Cunningham on the night of the murder. At the trial, without the testimony of the Joneses, there was a conflict between the testimony of Nealy, who testified that the three men gave the Joneses a ride, and Ewing, who said that Nealy, Cunningham, and Ewing were the only three customers in the pool hall that evening and that they left alone. Had the Jones brothers testified and supported Nealy on this point, it would have improved Nealy\u2019s credibility with the jury, and concomitantly, diminished Ewing\u2019s. Credibility was of major importance because the state\u2019s case could not be established if Ewing had been discredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">Although \u201cthe defendant [must] affirmatively prove prejudice,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> there are no easily applied or specific guidelines for us to use in determining whether the inadequate performance of a defendant\u2019s counsel harmed his client \u201cenough\u201d to constitute a violation of the sixth amendment. The Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>recognized this problem, and, rather than develop mechanical rules, the Court directed us to place our \u201cultimate focus of inquiry ... on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Following this instruction, we find that Nealy has adequately established that he was prejudiced by Burdine\u2019s failure to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">The verdict against Nealy rests primarily on the testimony of Wiley Ewing, Davis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>confessed killer, and is only weakly supported by other evidence. Such a verdict \u201cis more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Ewing also admitted that he actually killed Davis, but he was later prosecuted only for manslaughter, sentenced to fifteen years, and has since been released on parole. He has benefitted by his assistance to the state and his testimony might have been influenced by the hope of such benefit although he denied this at the trial and did not testify at the habeas corpus hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Given that the missing witnesses directly contradict Ewing\u2019s testimony and support Nealy\u2019s theory of the case, Nealy has met his \u201cburden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Even though .Burdine\u2019s errors cannot be shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome of Nealy\u2019s trial, they were of sufficient gravity to undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceeding and to suggest that a new trial is necessary to ensure that Nealy receives a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">For these reasons, the decision of the district court denying Nealy\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for entry of an order granting the writ unless the state shall again commence proceedings against Nealy within a reasonable time to be fixed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">. <em>Nealy </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>354 So.2d 788 (Miss.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">.
