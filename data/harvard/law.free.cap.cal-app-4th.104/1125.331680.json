Const., art. IV, \u00a7 19, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>Larry Flynt, a card room owner, and Hustler Casino and Normandie Casino, state-licensed card rooms located in Los Angeles (collectively appellants), challenge the legality of agreements entered into by the State of California with 62 Native American Indian (Indian)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> tribes pursuant to Proposition 1A. Specifically, appellants claim that the tribal-state gambling agreements, known as compacts, which permit Indian tribes to conduct gaming prohibited to appellants and others by state law, violate the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and infringe upon appellants\u2019 right to equal protection of the laws (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).) They appeal from a judgment entered after a demurrer to their amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend. We reject these arguments and affirm the judgment dismissing appellants\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">On November 26, 2001, appellants filed a first amended complaint for declaratory relief asking the superior court to declare the respective rights, duties, and responsibilities of the California Gambling Control Commission and Attorney General Bill Lockyer (respondents) under specified Penal Code sections prohibiting certain forms of gambling (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7330, 330a &amp; 330b) and the Gambling Control Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 19800 et seq.). Respondents were named as defendants in the lawsuit because they have the authority to license appellants and to impose administrative and criminal sanctions upon appellants for violation of California statutes and regulations dealing with gambling. The Indian tribes that have entered into compacts with the state are not parties to this litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>Appellants\u2019 complaint points out that under various state laws, they are not allowed to conduct class III games, such as banked games<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or percentage games,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nor are they allowed to operate slot machines. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 330, 330a &amp; 330b; see generally <em>Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees Internal Union </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 585, 592-594 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 56, 981 P.2d 990] <em>(Hotel Employees).) </em>Instead, state law authorizes appellants to offer only controlled games, such as nonbanked card games, where players pay a fee to play on a per-hand or per-hour basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The complaint explained that on March 1, 2000, the voters of the State of California adopted Proposition 1A, which authorized members of federally recognized Indian tribes to operate slot machines, lottery games, and banked and percentage card games only on tribal lands and only under the terms of duly negotiated and ratified compacts. It was alleged that the Governor of California had entered into compacts with 62 Indian tribes in California allowing such games to be offered to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Appellants alleged that if they \u201cwere to offer such games to the public they would be subject to sanctions . . . pursuant to the Gambling Control Act including loss of license, fines, and referral for criminal prosecution.\u201d Appellants further alleged that they \u201cdirectly compete with Indian owned casinos for customers who wish to patronize casinos. The banked and percentage card games, 21, and slot machines which [respondents] authorize only Indian[-]owned casinos to offer to the public are more attractive to the public than the non[-]banked card games allowed [appellants].\u201d Appellants alleged that this \u201cstate sanctioned monopoly\u201d in gambling operations put them at a \u201ccompetitive and economic\u201d disadvantage that threatens their ability to stay in business.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Appellants also alleged that the IGRA, the federal statute governing the operation of games conducted by Indian tribes, \u201cdoes not authorize a state to establish a classification such as that in California wherein only Indian Tribes and Native Americans which comprise their membership are allowed to offer class III gaming while non-Indians are subject to criminal and other sanctions for engaging in the same conduct.\u201d Appellants claimed that, to the extent provisions of the Penal Code and Gambling Control Act enforced by respondents prevented appellants from offering the games that were legally offered at tribal casinos, these provisions were \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, and void\u201d under the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. (See U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (a).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>Consequently, appellants sought declaratory relief removing the legal obstacles that prohibited them \u201cfrom offering to the public bank[ed] and percentage games, \u201821\u2019, and slot machines.\u201d They requested a decision \u201cthat such games are controlled games which may be offered by [appellants] pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Gambling Control Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">On December 21, 2001, respondents filed a demurrer to appellants\u2019 first amended complaint, arguing that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Respondents challenged the viability of appellants\u2019 legal theories and argued that nothing in appellants\u2019 complaint entitled them to declaratory relief allowing appellants to operate slot machines and banked and percentage card games otherwise prohibited by California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On February 11, 2002, the trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend. Following entry of a judgment of dismissal, this timely appeal followed. On appeal, this court must determine independently whether the facts alleged by appellants and the matters that may be judicially noticed entitle respondents to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 438, subds. (c)(l)(B)(ii) &amp; (d); <em>Schabarum </em>v. <em>California Legislature </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 745]; <em>Aubry </em>v. <em>Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The issues raised in this appeal need not embroil this court in questions concerning the wisdom, policy implications, or economics of allowing Nevada-style gaming on Indian land in California, or elsewhere. Despite ongoing debate in some political quarters, as well as in the media,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the fact remains that these complex questions of public policy were largely answered when voters resoundingly approved Proposition 1 A, thereby paving the way for the operation of slot machines and lottery games as well as banked and percentage card games by federally recognized Indian tribes on Indian lands in California. Our only task is to determine whether the tribal-state gambling compacts that were entered into pursuant to Proposition 1A\u2014which grant an exclusive franchise to certain Indian tribes to conduct such games\u2014violate provisions of the IGRA and/or create an unconstitutional monopoly in violation of the guarantee of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>To date, there is no decision by a California state court addressing these issues. However, on August 5, 2002, shortly after the instant appeal became fully briefed, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California issued an opinion rejecting the identical arguments that appellants make in this appeal. <em>(Artichoke Joe\u2019s v. Norton </em>(E.D.Cal. 2002) 216 F.Supp.2d 1084 <em>(Artichoke Joe\u2019s).)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> Lower federal court decisions on federal questions, while not binding, are persuasive and entitled to great weight in state court. (See, e.g., <em>Yee v. City of Escondido </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1349, 1351 [274 Cal.Rptr. 551]; <em>People v. Estrada </em>(1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 136, 145 [44 Cal.Rptr. 165, 11 A.L.R.3d 1307].) In deciding these identical questions, we find the analysis in <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s </em>persuasive, and therefore, we are moved to give it the great weight to which its compelling rationale is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a long and well-established principle of Federal Indian law as expressed in the United States Constitution, reflected in Federal statutes, and articulated in decisions of the Supreme Court, that unless authorized by an act of Congress, the jurisdiction of State governments and the application of state laws do not extend to Indian lands. In modem times, even when Congress has enacted laws to allow a limited application of State law on Indian lands, the Congress has required the consent of tribal governments before State jurisdiction can be extended to tribal lands. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kansas v. U.S. </em>(10th Cir. 2001) 249 F.3d 1213, 1223, fn. 6, quoting the Senate Report accompanying the IGRA\u2019s passage.) \u201c \u2018[T]he policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm\u2019n </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 164, 168 [93 S.Ct. 1257, 1260, 36 L.Ed.2d 129], quoting <em>Rice v. Olson </em>(1945) 324 U.S. 786, 789 [65 S.Ct. 989, 991, 89 L.Ed. 1367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">In the mid-1980\u2019s, Indian tribes began to engage in significant gaming operations. <em>(Proposition 1A, supra, </em>36 U.S.F. L.Rev. at p. 1038; see also Wolf, <em>Killing the New Buffalo: State Eleventh Amendment Defense to Enforcement of IGRA Indian Gaming Compacts </em>(1995) 47 Wash. U. J. Urb. &amp; Contemp. L. 51, 69 <em>(Killing the New Buffalo); </em>Henderson, <em>Symposium: Indian Gaming: Social Consequences </em>(1997) 29 Ariz. St. L.J. 205, 206.) Such activities were controversial because the tribes generally refused to comply with state gambling laws, a situation that developed into a serious point of contention with state governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Prior to the enactment of the IGRA, numerous bills were introduced in Congress to address the issue of gaming on Indian lands. In 1987, the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>States Supreme Court decided <em>California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 202 [107 S.Ct. 1083, 94 L.Ed.2d 244] <em>(Cabazon), </em>which finally spurred the passage of federal gaming legislation. The issue in <em>Cabazon </em>was whether the State of California could apply its gaming regulations to tribal bingo and card games. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 205 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1086].) The state regulations did not prohibit such games, but restricted them to charitable organizations and imposed limitations on the amount of prizes that could be awarded and restricted the use of profits to charitable purposes. <em>(Ibid) </em>Recognizing that \u201cIndian tribes retain \u2018attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory,\u2019 \u201d the court first held that Congress had not allowed the state to assume jurisdiction over gaming activities under Public Law No. 280<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> because the state\u2019s regulations relating to these forms of gaming were civil and regulatory in nature and not criminal and prohibitory. <em>(Cabazon, </em>at p. 207 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1087].) Because California allowed a substantial amount of gambling activity and even promoted gambling through its state lottery, the court concluded, \u201cCalifornia regulates rather than prohibits gambling in general and bingo in particular.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 211 [107 S.Ct. at p. 1089].)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">The court next addressed whether state regulations would interfere with reservation self-government or would impair a right granted or reserved by federal law. <em>(Cabazon, supra, </em>480 U.S. at p. 216 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1091-1092].) Acknowledging the tribe\u2019s interest in raising revenues and the efforts of the federal government in promoting economic development through Indian gaming, the <em>Cabazon </em>court concluded that \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in preventing the infiltration of the tribal bingo enterprises by organized crime does not justify state regulation of the tribal bingo enterprises in light of the compelling federal and tribal interests supporting them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 222 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1094-1095].) The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that states generally may not enforce their gambling laws on Indian lands because this would undermine the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence and economic development. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 218-222 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 1093-1095].) In sum, the <em>Cabazon </em>decision provided tribes the right to conduct any form of gambling activity, regardless of state laws, unless the state <em>prohibited, </em>rather than <em>regulated, </em>gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The congressional response to <em>Cabazon </em>was swift, and within a year Congress passed the IGRA. (See <em>Rumsey, supra, </em>64 F.3d at p. 1257.) By enacting the IGRA, Congress intended \u201cto provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>(\u00a7 2702(1).) The IGRA was also intended to prevent the infiltration of organized crime and other corrupting influences, to ensure that Indian tribes were the primary beneficiaries of the gaming operation, to assure that gaming on Indian lands was conducted fairly and honestly, and to establish federal authority and standards over gaming. (\u00a7 2702(1)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The IGRA establishes three classes of gaming activity, each subject to differing degrees of tribal, state and federal jurisdiction and regulation. Class I gaming is limited to social games solely for prizes of minimal value or gaming connected to traditional tribal ceremonies or celebrations. (\u00a7 2703(6).) This class of gaming is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indian tribes. (\u00a7 2710(a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Class II gaming includes bingo and related games and certain nonbanked card games. (\u00a7 2703(7)(A)(i), (ii).) Class II gaming is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribes but is subject to oversight by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). (\u00a7\u00a7 2710(l)(b), 2704 [description of NIGC].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Class III gaming includes all other forms of gaming. (\u00a7 2703(8).) It encompasses the most important part of the IGRA because it includes high-stakes casino-type games that can be a source of substantial revenue for the Indian tribes and a significant rival for traditional private sector gaming facilities, such as those run by appellants. The regulation of class III gaming has been the most controversial part of the IGRA and the subject of considerable litigation between various Indian tribes and the states. (See, e.g., <em>Mashantucket Pequot Tribe v. State of Conn. </em>(D.Conn. 1990) 737 F.Supp. 169, affd. (2d Cir. 1990) 913 F.2d 1024, cert. den. (1991) 499 U.S. 975 [111 S.Ct. 1620, 113 L.Ed.2d 717]; <em>Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v. U.S. </em>(6th Cir. 1998) 136 F.3d 469, 474, cert. den. (1998) 525 U.S. 929 [119 S.Ct. 335, 142 L.Ed.2d 277]; <em>U.S. v. Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska </em>(8th Cir. 1998) 135 F.3d 558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The IGRA requires that class III gaming may be conducted only after a tribe has negotiated a compact with the state for the regulation of the gaming, the Secretary of the Interior has approved the compact, and the tribe has adopted an ordinance or resolution approved by the chair of the NIGC. (\u00a7 2710(d); see also <em>Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe v. State </em>(D.Idaho 1994) 842 F.Supp. 1268, 1282-1283, affd. (9th Cir. 1995) 51 F.3d 876 [under the IGRA, class III gaming activities could not lawfully be conducted on Indian reservation absent a tribal ordinance and a tribal-state gaming compact].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Any Indian tribe having jurisdiction over lands where class III gaming is to be conducted \u201cshall request the State in which such lands are located to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>enter into negotiations for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact .... Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.\u201d (\u00a7 2710(d)(3)(A).) The compact mechanism gives the state an opportunity to either influence or directly regulate class III gaming on Indian lands. (\u00a7 2710(d)(3)(A).) The compact can even extend state civil and criminal jurisdiction onto Indian lands. (\u00a7 2703(d)(3)(C)(i)-(vii); <em>Killing the New Buffalo, supra, </em>47 Wash. U. J. Urb. &amp; Contemp. L. at p. 61.) In this state/tribe negotiation over the conduct of class III gaming, the tribe is recognized as a sovereign entity entitled to negotiate on a roughly equal footing with the state, another sovereign entity\u2014\u201calbeit sovereigns subordinate to the federal union.\u201d <em>(Hotel Employees, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 612.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"> To ensure that states negotiated with tribes in good faith, the IGRA provides the United States District Courts with jurisdiction over \u201cany cause of action initiated by an Indian tribe arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-State compact ... or to conduct such negotiations in good faith.\u201d (\u00a7 2710(d)(7)(A)(i).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In such a suit, a mediator appointed by the court, rather than the parties, would choose the terms of Indian gaming in the state, which the Secretary of the Interior would then implement. (\u00a7 2710(d)(7).)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">However, Congress stopped short of giving tribes the unilateral power to force any state to grant tribes full casino-style class III gaming when such gaming is not permitted by the laws and public policy of that state. Instead, Congress provided that states are required to negotiate with Indian tribes only as to those class III gaming activities permitted under state law. The IGRA recognizes that \u201cIndian tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming activity on Indian lands if the gaming activity is not specifically prohibited by Federal law and is conducted within a State which does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming activity.\u201d (\u00a7 2701(5).) Thus, in the key provision we are called upon to construe in this appeal, the IGRA provides that \u201cClass III gaming activities shall be lawful on Indian lands only if such activities are . . . ffl] . . . [f] . . . located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>or entity . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 2710(d)(1)(B).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cConsequently, where a state does not \u2018permit\u2019 gaming activities sought by a tribe, the tribe has no right to engage in these activities, and the state thus has no duty to negotiate with respect to them.\u201d <em>(Rumsey, supra, </em>64 F.3d at p. 1256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Following the enactment of the IGRA, the State of California and various tribes in California attempted to conclude tribal-state compacts. However, the state and the tribes disagreed about the forms of gaming that would be permitted and the content of the compacts. (See, e.g., <em>Rumsey, supra, </em>64 F.3d at p. 1255; <em>Hotel Employees, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Against this backdrop, proponents of tribal gaming sought voter approval of an initiative designed to facilitate tribal-state compacts. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 98001, subd. (b) [measure intended to end \u201cuncertainties\u201d regarding class III gaming by tribes].) In November 1998, state voters approved The Tribal Government Gaming and Economic Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998, otherwise known as Proposition 5. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 98000 et seq.) The proposition, which amended state law but not the State Constitution, required the state to enter into a model \u201cTribal-State Gaming Compact\u201d with Indian tribes to allow certain class III gambling activities, such as banked card games and slot machines. (See <em>Hotel Employees, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 606.) Proposition 5 obligated the Governor to execute compacts as a ministerial act within 30 days after any federally recognized Indian tribe requested such an arrangement. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 590.) Under the plan, the compacts were deemed approved if the governor took no action within 30 days. <em>(Ibid) </em>The measure won overwhelming support from California voters, but the victory was short-lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">In August 1999, Proposition 5 was ruled unconstitutional by our Supreme Court in <em>Hotel Employees, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 585, because it was found to be inconsistent with a 1984 amendment to the state\u2019s constitution banning casino-type gambling in California. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 612-613; see Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 19, subd. (e) [\u201cThe Legislature has no power to authorize,, and shall prohibit casinos of the type currently operating in Nevada and New Jersey.\u201d].) The court ruled that the federal IGRA did not preempt application of this state constitutional anti-casino provision to tribal gaming. <em>(Hotel Employees, </em>at pp. 611-612.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Proponents of Indian gaming addressed this deficiency with the passage of Proposition 1A. Unlike the statutory provisions of Proposition 5, Proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>1A amended article IV, section 19 of the California Constitution, giving the Governor the constitutional authority to negotiate and conclude compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature, for the operation of slot machines, lottery games, as well as banked and percentage card games, by federally recognized Indian tribes on Indian lands in California in accordance with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The passage of Proposition 1A led to the tribal-state compacts that are at issue in this case. These compacts are effective until December 31, 2020, and are identical in most respects. The compacts permit each signatory tribe to operate \u201cgaming devices\u201d or slot machines, banked or percentage card games, as well as any devices or games that the California State Lottery is authorized to offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The compacts contain the following language: \u201cThe exclusive rights that Indian tribes in California . . . will enjoy under this Compact create a unique opportunity for [each] Tribe to operate its Gaming Facility in an economic environment free of competition from the Class III gaming . . . on non-Indian lands in California. The parties are mindful that this unique environment is of great economic value to the Tribe .... In consideration for the exclusive rights enjoyed by the tribes, and in further consideration for the State\u2019s willingness to enter into this compact, the tribes have agreed to provide to the State, on a sovereign-to-sovereign basis, a portion of its revenue from Gaming Devices.\u201d The compacts also require gaming tribes to fund an Indian Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, which is a mechanism for redistributing some of the wealth generated by gambling for the benefit of tribes in California that do not conduct gaming. (See <em>In re Indian Gaming Related Cases </em>(N.D.Cal. 2001) 147 F.Supp.2d 1011; <em>Proposition 1A, supra, </em>36 U.S.F. L.Rev. at pp. 1047-1049.) Thus, under these compacts, California has exchanged statewide exclusivity of class III gaming rights for the tribes\u2019 agreement to share revenues with the state to offset expenses related to tribal gaming and with other tribes that are not engaged in gaming. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12012.75, 12012.85; see generally <em>Proposition 1A, supra, </em>36 U.S.F. L.Rev. at p. 1051.)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">In opposing respondents\u2019 demurrer, appellants argued that the \u201cIGRA does not attempt to grant a monopoly to Indian tribes on Class III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>gaming, nor does it authorize states to establish a system which grants a monopoly to Indian tribes while prohibiting the conduct of Class III gaming by non Indians.\u201d Appellants\u2019 arguments revolve around the section 2710(d)(1)(B) provision of the IGRA, which states that class III gaming activities are only lawful on Indian lands if such activities are \u201clocated in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity.\u201d Thus, appellants contend that section 2710(d)(1)(B) precludes California from granting Indian tribes exclusive class III gaming rights because Congress intended that such gaming would only take place in states that permitted non-Indians to conduct similar gaming activities. If appellants\u2019 statutory interpretation is correct, the state must permit the tribes\u2019 non-Indian competitors to conduct similar types of gaming as a precondition for entering into a class III tribal gaming compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In rebuttal, respondents argue that the tribal-state class III gaming compacts, standing alone, are sufficient state authorization to satisfy the provision of the IGRA that the state \u201cpermits\u201d class III gaming to \u201cany person, organization or entity.\u201d Respondents contend that appellants, in essence, are rewriting the statute to read, \u201cClass III gaming activities shall be lawful on Indian lands only if such activities are . . . located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose \u2018by any person, organization or entity . . . <em>in addition to an Indian Tribe.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we decide de novo. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>Schwetz v. Minnerly </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 296, 302 [269 Cal.Rptr. 417].)  Our task is to \u201c \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] In determining that intent, we first examine the words of the . . . statute[]: \u2018If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cWhere the statute is clear, courts will not \u2018interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d\u2019 [Citation.] If, however, the terms of a statute provide no definitive answer, then courts may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] \u2018We must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">We find the text of section 2710(d)(1)(B) ambiguous. (But see <em>Rumsey, supra, </em>64 F.3d at p. 1257.) Without resort to legislative history, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>context, or purpose, it is not possible to discern its textual meaning. In so doing, we conclude that there is nothing to indicate that the purpose of section 2710(d)(1)(B) was to achieve economic parity between tribes and commercial gaming establishments, thus leveling the playing field, so to speak, by granting tribes gaming rights only to the extent they are afforded to non-Indian gaming establishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Instead, the IGRA was crafted to accommodate disparate interests between tribes and state governments; that is, to reconcile the claims by tribes that their sovereignty prevented state control over the use of Indian lands, while preserving state autonomy to prohibit gambling within its borders. Thus, section 2710(d)(1)(B), as an initial step, required that states approve the form of proposed gaming before it would be allowed on Indian land under the IGRA. \u201cThe State must first legalize a game, <em>even if only for tribes, </em>before it can become a compact term.\u201d <em>(American Greyhound Racing Inc. </em>v. <em>Hull </em>(D.Ariz. 2001) 146 F.Supp.2d 1012, 1067, italics added, vacated on procedural grounds by <em>American Greyhound Racing, supra, </em>305 F.3d 1015; <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s, supra, </em>216 F.Supp.2d at p. 1122.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">This is a vastly different interpretation than that urged by appellants. Quite simply, Congress exhibited no desire to command states<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to enact gaming laws so that private non-Indian enterprises would enjoy the same rights as Indian tribes. The court in <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s </em>comprehensively analyzed section 2710(d)(1)(B) and came to a similar conclusion. The court reasoned, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s decision to \u2018permit\u2019 tribes to operate class III gaming facilities within the context of IGRA and the compacts, while denying those rights to other persons, organizations, and entities, is a policy judgment, which whether one agrees with it or not, does not conflict with IGRA\u2019s goal of maintaining state authority while protecting Indian gaming from discrimination. By contrast, to interpret IGRA to require the states to cho[o]se between no class III gaming anywhere and class III gaming everywhere would not further any of IGRA\u2019s goals and would limit the states\u2019 authority and flexibility without any resulting benefit to the tribes.\u201d <em>(Artichoke Joe\u2019s, supra, </em>216 F.Supp.2d at p. 1126.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We believe the <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s </em>court has correctly perceived the practical public policy repercussions of this case and has adopted an interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>section 2710(d)(1)(B) consistent with the statutory language that gives significance to the statutory framework as a whole. We concur in its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\"> Appellants alternatively contend the \u201cenforcement of gambling laws which prohibit appellants from offering Class III games but allow tribal Indians to offer such games\u201d violates both their state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law. (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Equal protection analysis requires a reconciliation of the constitutional promise that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws with the practical reality that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting advantage or disadvantage to various groups or persons. <em>(Romer v. Evans </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 620, 631 [116 S.Ct. 1620, 1626-1627, 134 L.Ed.2d 855].) \u201cIndividuals receive, or correspondingly are denied, governmental benefits on the basis of income, disability, veteran status, age, occupation and countless other grounds.\u201d <em>(Coalition for Economic Equity </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 122 F.3d 692, 702.) As a general rule, such legislative classifications are presumptively valid. If the law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, a court will uphold the classification as long as there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose. <em>(Heller v. Doe </em>(1993) 509 U.S. 312, 319-320 [113 S.Ct. 2637, 2642-2643, 125 L.Ed.2d 257]; <em>Board of Supervisors v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1992) 3 </em>Cal.4th 903, 913 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 838 P.2d 1198].)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">However, when such a classification is based on a suspect class, such as race, the court must apply strict scrutiny and uphold the legislation only if it is a narrowly tailored measure that furthers compelling governmental interests. (See, e.g., <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena </em>(1995) 515 U.S. 200, 227 [115 S.Ct. 2097, 2112-2113, 132 L.Ed.2d 158] [remedial race-based preference is subject to strict scrutiny].)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Appellants insist that the strict scrutiny test applies here. They argue: \u201cThe first amended complaint alleges facts which demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>appellants and tribal Indians are similarly situated in that both operate businesses which offer gambling to the general California public; that the classification established by California law which allows tribal Indians to offer Class III gaming is racial and thus subject to strict scrutiny review, and that it cannot be constitutionally justified based on that review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">We are satisfied that the rational relationship test applies to this case, rather than the more stringent strict scrutiny test. The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he decisions of this Court leave no doubt that federal legislation with respect to Indian tribes, although relating to Indians as such, is not based upon impermissible racial classifications.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Antelope </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 641, 645 [97 S.Ct. 1395, 1398, 51 L.Ed.2d 701].) Instead, tribal Indians belong to a political group that is specifically recognized by federal law as a sovereign nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">These principles underlie the United States Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision in <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Mancari </em>(1974) 417 U.S. 535 [94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290] <em>(Mancari). </em>In <em>Mancari, </em>non-Indians challenged an employment preference for Indians of one-quarter blood or more used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) on the ground that it discriminated on the basis of race. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 539 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2477].) The court disagreed, grounding its decision on \u201c[t]he plenary power of Congress to deal with the special problems of Indians\u201d and \u201cthe assumption of a \u2018guardian-ward\u2019 status.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 551-552 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2483].) As the court noted, Congress has directed innumerable laws to Indians; and \u201c[i]f these laws, derived from historical relationships and explicitly designed to help only Indians, were deemed invidious racial discrimination, an entire Title of the United States Code (25 U.S.C.) would be effectively erased and the solemn commitment of the Government toward the Indians would be jeopardized.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 552 [94 S.Ct. at pp. 2484-2485].) Applying this broad mandate, legislation preferring Indians is constitutional when applying the rational basis test \u201c[as] long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress\u2019 unique obligation toward the Indians.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 555 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Justice Harry Blackmun, writing for the court, explained the court\u2019s view of the employment preference for Indians as a nonracial classification: \u201cContrary to the characterization made by appellees, this preference does not constitute \u2018racial discrimination.\u2019 Indeed, it is not even a \u2018racial\u2019 preference. Rather, it is an employment criterion reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government and to make the BIA more responsive to the needs of its constituent groups.\u201d <em>(Mancari, supra, </em>417 U.S. at pp. 553-554 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2483], fn. omitted.) The court\u2019s position was further explained in a related footnote: \u201cThe preference is not directed towards a \u2018racial\u2019 group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>consisting of \u2018Indians\u2019; instead, it applies only to members of \u2018federally recognized\u2019 tribes. This operates to exclude many individuals who are racially to be classified as \u2018Indians.\u2019 In this sense, the preference is political rather than racial in nature. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 553, fn. 24 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2484].)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Relying on the reasoning in <em>Mancari, </em>respondents argue that granting Indians exclusive gaming rights pursuant to the IGRA does not benefit a racial group (Indians), but rather benefits members of a political group (members of federally recognized tribes), essentially all of whom also happen to be members of that racial group. Respondents contend: \u201cThe voter-enacted initiative, Proposition 1A, authorized federally-recognized Indian <em>tribes, not </em>Indians individually or generally, to conduct specified class III gaming under limited and narrowly delineated circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Respondents\u2019 argument is materially advanced by the parallel analysis in <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s. </em>\u201cAs <em>Mancari </em>illustrates, a tribal preference is not transformed from a political to a racial classification that requires strict scrutiny merely because the vehicle for the preference consists of individual members of tribes.\u201d <em>(Artichoke Joe\u2019s, supra, </em>216 F.Supp.2d at p. 1132.) The <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s </em>court concluded its analysis on this point in the following passage: \u201cIndividual members are benefited not because they are Indian per se but because they are members of tribes that have entered into compacts and distributed the resulting income to their members. A contrary holding would both distort <em>Mancari </em>and hamstring the political branches in the exercise of their trust obligation to the Indian tribes.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Although legal commentators have criticized Mancari\u2019s characterization of preferences based on tribal membership as being \u201cpolitical\u201d rather than \u201cracial,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to date, <em>Mancari </em>has not been overruled. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly embraced the <em>Mancari </em>rationale in numerous cases. (See, e.g., <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Fishing Vessel Assn. </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 658, 673, fn. 20 [99 S.Ct. 3055, 3068, 61 L.Ed.2d 823] [court \u201chas repeatedly held that the peculiar semisovereign and constitutionally recognized status of Indians justifies special treatment on their behalf when rationally related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>the Government\u2019s \u2018unique obligation toward the Indians,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Mancari, supra, </em>417 U.S. at p. 555 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2485]]; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Yakima Indian Nation </em>(1979) 439 U.S. 463, 500-501 [99 S.Ct. 740, 761, 58 L.Ed.2d 740] [\u201cIt is settled that \u2018the unique legal status of Indian tribes under federal law\u2019 permits the Federal Government to enact legislation singling out tribal Indians, legislation that might otherwise be constitutionally offensive,\u201d quoting <em>Mancari, supra, </em>417 U.S. at pp. 551-552 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2483]]; <em>Delaware Tribal Business Comm. </em>v. <em>Weeks </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 73, 85 [97 S.Ct. 911, 919, 51 L.Ed.2d 173] [\u201cthe legislative judgment should not be disturbed \u2018[a]s long as the special treatment can be tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress\u2019 unique obligation toward the Indians,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Mancari, supra, </em>417 U.S. at p. 555 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2485].)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">Indeed, when applying <em>Mancari, </em>the court \u201chas never overturned a statute or treaty affecting Indians or natives.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 115 F.3d 657, 663 <em>(Williams')) </em>At the same time, the court has repeatedly found \u201cthe argument that such classifications [based on tribal status and land tenure] are \u2018suspect\u2019 an untenable one.\u201d <em>(Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, supra, </em>439 U.S. at p. 501 [99 S.Ct. at p. 761].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Faced with the weight of this authority, appellants seek to limit the effect of the <em>Mancari </em>decision here by arguing its reach is limited to classifications \u201cbased on tribal status as a political entity which is limited to uniquely Indian matters such as self governance.\u201d Thus, appellants contend the rationale for the <em>Mancari </em>rule is absent if \u201cCongress extendfs] that special treatment to matters beyond self governance and similarly uniquely Indian issues.\u201d At that point, \u201cthe classification becomes racial and fails strict scrutiny review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">In support of this argument, appellants direct our attention to <em>Williams, supra, </em>115 F.3d 657. In an opinion written by Judge Alex Kozinski, the Ninth Circuit held unconstitutional on equal protection grounds an administrative interpretation of the federal Reindeer Industry Act of 1937, which prohibited non-Indians from herding reindeer in Alaska. The court applied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>strict scrutiny analysis and rejected arguments that <em>Mancari </em>authorized blanket preferences for Indians. The court stated: \u201cWhile <em>Mancari </em>did not have to confront the question of a naked preference for Indians unrelated to unique Indian concerns, [the administrative] interpretation of the Reindeer Act would force us to confront that very issue. According to [the administrative agency], the Reindeer Act provides a preference in an industry that is not uniquely native, whether the beneficiaries live in a remote native village on the Seward Peninsula or in downtown Anchorage. The Act in no way relates to native land, tribal or communal status, or culture.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The court observed that no law giving \u201cnatives so broad a preference\u201d in any particular industry was known to exist. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>115 F.3d at pp. 664.) The court explained that <em>MancarV </em>s rationale embraced legislation that affected \u201cIndian land, tribal status, self-government or cultur[al]\u201d issues. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court clarified that \u201c[w]hile <em>Mancari </em>is not necessarily limited to statutes that give special treatment to Indians on Indian land, we do read it as shielding only those statutes that affect uniquely Indian interests. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 665.) Consequently, the court indicated it was \u201cseriously doubt[ful]\u201d whether Congress could grant Indians \u201ca <em>complete monopoly on the casino industry </em>or on Space Shuttle contracts.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Applying a strict scrutiny standard, the court held the Department\u2019s interpretation of federal law could not withstand analysis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>(Williams, </em>at pp. 665-666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Appellants believe <em>Williams </em>lends substantial support to their argument \u201cthat this situation involves a racial classification and violates appellants[\u2019] right to equal protection under the law.\u201d However, we note that the monopoly over the casino industry hypothesized in <em>Williams </em>makes no mention of the IGRA or the federal policies it seeks to implement. We believe that Judge Kozinski\u2019s provocative dicta, when considered in context, can best be understood as casting constitutional doubt on Indian-run gaming monopolies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>formed solely for business purposes untethered to any declared federal objective of strengthening tribal self government or promoting the tribe\u2019s economic development. That is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">We conclude that the challenged tribal-state compacts, granting Indians the exclusive right to conduct class III gaming in California pursuant to the IGRA, are rationally related \u201cto the fulfillment of Congress\u2019 unique obligation towards Indians\u201d and therefore passes constitutional examination under the rational basis test. <em>(Mancari, supra, </em>417 U.S. at p. 555 [94 S.Ct. at p. 2485].) As already noted, the predominant purpose of the IGRA is: \u201cto provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\u201d (\u00a7 2702(1).) Additionally, the IGRA requires that all gaming proceeds, with very limited exceptions, be allocated for tribal government purposes only (see \u00a7 2710(b)(1)(B)), such as \u201c(i) to fund tribal government operations or programs; [f] (ii) to provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members; [f] (iii) to promote tribal economic development; [f] (iv) to donate to charitable organizations; or [10 (v) to help fund operations of local government agencies.\u201d (\u00a7 2710(b)(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The model tribal-state compact, which is part of our record on appeal, similarly indicates that its purpose is to \u201c[djevelop and implement a means of regulating Class III gaming, and only Class III gaming, on the Tribe\u2019s Indian lands to ensure its fair and honest operation in accordance with IGRA, and through that regulated Class III gaming, enable the Tribe to develop self-sufficiency, promote tribal economic development, and generate jobs and revenues to support the Tribe\u2019s government and governmental services and programs.\u201d Consistent with this goal, a portion of the money generated by gaming tribes is to be paid into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund pursuant to the terms of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of making distributions to non-compact tribes. Our record discloses that the first $25 million paid into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund has recently been distributed to non-gaming tribes. <em>(Proposition 1A, supra, </em>36 U.S.F. L.Rev. at p. 1044.) This mechanism is intended to ensure that the wealth generated by gambling is not just limited to tribes who have entered into compacts, but will be redistributed for the benefit of all tribes in California.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">In light of all of the foregoing, we conclude, as the <em>Artichoke Joe\u2019s </em>court did, that granting certain federally recognized tribes exclusive class III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>gaming rights through the tribal-state compacts challenged herein passes constitutional muster under the rational basis test and does not constitute a denial of equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Kline, P.

Pena </em>(1996) 1996 BYU L.Rev. 503, 509-510 (\u201cTo say, as the <em>Mancari </em>Court did, that the criteria was \u2018not even a \u201cracial\u201d preference\u2019 stretches the imagination, and is comparable to suggesting that discriminating on the basis of pregnancy is not the same as discrimination on the basis of gender\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Appellants claim that <em>Mancari </em>has been limited by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rice v.

However, appellants\u2019 attempt to limit <em>Mancari </em>is unconvincing. <em>Rice </em>involved native Hawaiians, who do not possess a tribal form of organization and have no formally recognized sovereign-to-sovereign relationship with the United States. Furthermore, <em>Rice </em>did not involve a 14th Amendment equal protection claim, but only dealt with the right to vote guaranteed by the 15th Amendment, which is a fundamental right evoking strict scrutiny review.

For example, <em>in Alaska Chapter Associated Gen. Contr. </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 694 F.2d 1162, another panel of that court cited cases where the United States Supreme Court relied upon <em>Mancari </em>and applied the rational basis test to interests \u201cwhich are much broader than tribal self-government.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>These cases include <em>Mae v.
