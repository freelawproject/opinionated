CYA believes Baker was killed by a ward (who has been charged with her murder), and Henderson failed to investigate after hearing her arguing with the ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Henderson contested his dismissal, and, after hearing evidence, an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a proposed decision allowing CYA to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>dismiss Henderson. However, the State Personnel Board (SPB) did not adopt the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision but instead issued its own decision revoking Henderson\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">CYA appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of CYA\u2019s petition for a writ of administrative mandamus seeking to overturn the SPB\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> CYA contends SPB\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record, and, in measuring the evidence, this court must pay special deference to findings of the ALJ based on witness credibility. We requested supplemental briefing on the potential applicability of a statute not cited by the parties\u2014Government Code section 11425.50, which requires a reviewing court to give great weight to certain credibility determinations in administrative adjudications. (Undesignated statutory references are to the Government Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In the published portion of the opinion, we shall conclude section 11425.50 applies to credibility determinations by an ALJ in SPB administrative adjudications of employment disciplinary actions (\u00a7 19570 et seq.), but the ALJ in this case did not make the type of credibility determinations that would trigger section 11425.50. Thus, in reviewing the administrative record for substantial evidence, we shall not give special weight to the credibility determinations of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">We shall also conclude that, in evaluating the substantiality of the evidence in this appeal, we shall consider all relevant evidence in the administrative record, including evidence that fairly detracts from the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">In an unpublished portion of the opinion applying these rules, we shall conclude that substantial evidence supports the SPB\u2019s determination. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Henderson began working for CYA in 1978 and in 1989 achieved the classification of senior youth counselor (now known as senior youth correctional counselor). At the time in question, he was assigned to the \u201cC/D Company\u201d at CYA\u2019s Hern\u00e1n G. Stark Youth Training School (the facility) in Chino, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">On August 9, 1996, youth counselor Baker, who was also assigned to C/D Company at the facility, worked a 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. shift, as shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>coordinator. Henderson worked the 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. shift that day. He was Baker\u2019s relief, but he did not make verbal or visual contact with her that day. He did, however, hear Baker\u2019s voice, the circumstances of which are in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The following day, August 10, 1996, Baker\u2019s family phoned the facility around 4:00 a.m. and again at 7:20 a.m., because Baker never returned home on August 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Evidence was adduced at Henderson\u2019s administrative hearing regarding conversations which were held throughout the day (August 10, 1996) in which staff discussed the situation and during which Henderson stated he had heard Baker\u2019s voice around 1:00 p.m. on August 9. According to Henderson, he was walking down the hall toward his office when he heard Baker\u2019s voice speaking loudly, which was not unusual for her. According to Henderson, that was the only time he heard Baker\u2019s voice that day. According to some other participants in the August 10 conversations, Henderson commented on August 10 that when he heard Baker\u2019s voice on August 9, he was in the control center, and when he made the comments on August 10 he demonstrated that when he heard Baker\u2019s voice on August 9 he leaned over to look down the hallway, did not see anything, and went back to his paperwork. The witnesses also said Henderson said he heard Baker arguing with someone and her voice stopped abruptly in midsentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It is undisputed, however, that whatever Henderson said on August 10 did not cause any immediate reaction among those participating in the conversations (though some later testified they thought to themselves at the time that Henderson should have investigated).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Also on August 10, 1996, it was discovered that Baker\u2019s car was still in the parking lot. It was then discovered that she had not picked up her overtime check, her purse was still in supervisor Rivera\u2019s office, and her chewing gum was discovered outside her locker. A ward had fresh scratches on his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">About 8:45 a.m., the facility was placed on \u201clockdown,\u201d and a search commenced. Baker was not found.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">On August 11, 1996, her dead body was found in a trash dump site in Pomona, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">In April 1997, CYA sent to Henderson a notice of adverse action dismissing him from his position as a s\u00e9nior youth counselor effective April 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>1997, for the following causes under the following subdivisions of section 19572:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c(d) Inexcusable neglect of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c(e) Insubordination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c(f) Dishonesty.

[f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201c(t) Other failure of good behavior either during or outside of duty hours which is of such a nature that it causes discredit to the appointing authority or the person\u2019s employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">The notice of adverse action alleged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Henderson failed to relieve Baker properly at the end of her shift on August 9, 1996, by failing to make verbal and visual contact with her. Henderson failed to investigate Baker\u2019s well-being in response to circumstances which should have caused him to investigate, in that (1) after Baker failed to report to work on August 10, 1996, Henderson commented to others that he had heard Baker engaged in a verbal confrontation with a ward the previous day and her voice had stopped in mid-sentence; and (2) within one-half hour of the end of Baker\u2019s shift on August 9, 1996, two employees had inquired as to her whereabouts because they had not seen her leave through the recreation yard as was her usual routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">The notice of adverse action also alleged Henderson was dishonest during an administrative interview with CYA investigators on December 26, 1996, in that he denied hearing or saying he heard the verbal confrontation between Baker and a ward. It alleged Henderson failed to write an incident report as directed and was dishonest in denying that a supervisor told him to write an incident report. The notice alleged that when a supervisor instructed Henderson to maintain an accurate accounting of his on-duty staffs whereabouts at all times, he refused to be responsible and refused to keep track of \u201cgrown folks.\u201d It was also alleged that Henderson offered to bet another employee $100 that search dogs would not find any evidence in the room of the ward who at that time was suspected of being involved in Baker\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">In response to the notice of adverse action, Henderson requested an administrative hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>After the administrative hearing, the ALJ in November 1998 issued a proposed decision to sustain CYA\u2019s dismissal of Henderson. The ALJ determined Henderson inexcusably neglected his duty by failing to make visual or verbal contact with Baker at the end of her shift and by failing to investigate after he heard Baker\u2019s voice abruptly stop while speaking to a ward, particularly after two workers asked where she was because they had not seen her leave. The ALJ also concluded Henderson was dishonest in the investigative interview, and he was insubordinate and willfully disobedient in failing to comply with his supervisor\u2019s instructions. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision was to sustain CYA\u2019s dismissal of Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">However, SPB at its November 17, 1998, meeting rejected the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision and asked the parties to brief various issues, including (1) whether any written directive required Henderson to make contact with Baker at the beginning of his shift, (2) whether any written directive required Henderson to investigate when he heard Baker involved in an argument, and (3) what is the appropriate penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Both parties submitted written argument and presented oral argument before SPB on April 6, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The SPB issued a decision revoking Henderson\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">SPB thereafter denied CYA\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">In April 2000, CYA filed in the trial court a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5) requesting the court to find SPB\u2019s decision unsupported by substantial evidence and to command SPB to set aside its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The trial court denied the writ petition, stating that after \u201cfull consideration of the evidence,\u201d it ruled \u201c[SPB] wrote a very careful and good decision. There is substantial evidence to support [SPB\u2019s] findings of credibility and fact.\u201d The court accordingly entered judgment in favor of Henderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">CYA appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">We shall first discuss the appropriate standard of review to be applied by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">We shall then recite the raw evidence adduced at the administrative hearing before the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>We shall then summarize the SPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Finally, we shall discuss and reject CYA\u2019s contention that no substantial evidence supports the SPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">A. <em>This Court Determines Whether Substantial Evidence Supports the Decision of the SPB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">When a state civil service employee contests disciplinary action, \u201cthe board [SPB] or its authorized representative\u201d shall hold a hearing.

Under that constitutional grant, [SPB] is empowered to \u2018review disciplinary actions.\u2019 In undertaking that review, [SPB] acts in an adjudicatory capacity. \u2018The State Personnel Board is an agency with adjudicatory powers created by the California Constitution.\u2019 [Citation.] As such [SPB] acts much as a trial court would in an ordinary judicial proceeding. Thus, [SPB] makes factual findings and exercises discretion on matters within its jurisdiction. On review the decisions of [SPB] are entitled to judicial deference. The record must be viewed in a light most favorable to the decision of [SPB] and its factual findings must be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence.

[Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cIn 1970, the [Sjupreme [C]ourt made it clear that the so-called isolation test <em>(i.e., </em>isolating evidence supporting the agency\u2019s findings and disregarding conflicting relevant evidence in the record) was outmoded and that the substantial evidence test requires the trial court to review the entire record. [Citing inter alia <em>Boreta Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 85, 94, which involved the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, an agency constitutionally endowed with adjudicatory powers.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">\u201cIn reaffirming that the trial court must review the entire record when the substantial evidence test is involved, the [S]upreme [C]ourt in <em>[Bixby v. Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143, fn. 10 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]], cited <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. [Labor Bd.] </em>(1951) 340 US 474 [71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456], which according to the court in <em>Neely v. California State Personnel Bd. </em>(1965) 237 [Cal.App.2d 487, 489, 47 Cal.Rptr. 64], had not been adopted in California. Assuming that the rule in <em>Universal Camera </em>now fully applies in California, as appears from the holding in Bixby, \u2018a court reviewing the evidentiary basis of an agency\u2019s decision must consider all relevant evidence in the administrative record including evidence that fairly detracts from the evidence supporting the agency\u2019s decision.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>Scope of Review Under CCP \u00a7 1094.5, \u00a7 4.162, pp. 205-206.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-12\"><em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 130, which reviewed a decision of the Commissioner of Corporations subject to substantial evidence review rather than independent judgment review, specified in a footnote that the case then before the court did. <em>not </em>involve an agency upon which the Constitution had conferred adjudicative powers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141, fn. 7.) However, <em>Bixby </em>was at that point merely explaining that the separation of powers doctrine provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>for both independent judgment and substantial evidence review; it was not creating different substantial evidence standards for agencies with constitutional powers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141.) <em>Bixby </em>went on to say in another footnote: \u201cCode of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 required the trial court to consider \u2018the whole record\u2019 in reviewing the evidentiary basis for the administrative decision. [Citations.] The trial court in the present case indicated that it attempted to isolate only the evidence which supports the board\u2019s findings and thus disregarded relevant evidence in the record. [Citations.] ... In <em>Boreta [supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 85] we adopted a substantial evidence review of the entire record for all administrative proceedings under section 1094.5 which do not require an independent judgment approach.\u201d <em>(Bixby, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 149, fn. 22 [any error by trial court in using isolation approach was harmless].) As indicated, <em>Boreta </em>involved an agency upon which the Constitution has conferred limited judicial powers. <em>(Boreta, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 85, 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Thus, the California Supreme Court, in rejecting the \u201cisolation approach,\u201d did not limit its holding to administrative agencies not constitutionally endowed with adjudicative powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We continue to believe we were correct when we said in <em>Newman </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 41 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 601]: \u201cIn assessing whether substantial evidence exists, we consider all evidence presented, including that which fairly detracts from the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 47, citing <em>County of San Diego v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2 </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 548, 554 [195 Cal.Rptr. 895].)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Henderson cites our opinion in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 636 [179 Cal.Rptr. 637]. We there said that in reviewing an SPB decision, \u201c \u2018[t]he court may not take into account whatever evidence detracts from the weight of other evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 640.) However, the authority we cited for that proposition <em>(Pereyda </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 47, 50 [92 Cal.Rptr. 746]) relied upon <em>Neely </em>v. <em>California State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d at p. 489. We have seen that the isolation approach espoused in <em>Neely </em>has been disapproved by the California Supreme Court. Therefore, our opinion in <em>Washington v. State Personnel Bd., </em>no longer states good law on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We thus conclude the substantial evidence standard in SPB cases requires that all evidence be considered, including that which fairly detracts from the evidence supporting SPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">C. <em>The Role of the Credibility Determinations of the ALJ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">In the original briefing in this appeal, CYA, citing federal cases involving decisions of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that a special form of substantial evidence review applies where the SPB rejects factual determinations of the ALJ that are based on the ALJ\u2019s determination of the credibility of witnesses. (E.g., <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>Labor Bd., supra, </em>340 U.S. 474 (hereafter <em>Universal Camera)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>CYA argued SPB should be reluctant to disturb the findings of the ALJ unless error is clearly shown and that a greater quantum of substantial evidence must be adduced where the SPB disturbs the credibility determinations of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">This court independently discovered a potentially applicable statute (\u00a7 11425.50) which was not cited by any of the parties. We requested and received supplemental letter briefs from CYA, Henderson, and SPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The statute is section 11425.50, which provides with respect to administrative adjudications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\u201c(a) The decision shall be in writing and shall include a statement of the factual and legal basis for the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201c(b) ... If the factual basis for the decision includes a determination based substantially on the credibility of a witness, the statement shall identify any specific evidence of the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports the determination, and on judicial review the court shall give great weight to the determination to the extent the determination identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">The California Law Revision Commission commented that this provision \u201cadopts the rule of Universal Camera Corp. v.

Law Revision Commission comments are usually a reliable guide to legislative intent. <em>(In re Bryce C. </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 226, 241 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 120, 906 P.2d 1275].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We shall conclude section 11425.50 applies to SPB administrative adjudications of employment disciplinary actions (\u00a7 19570 et seq.). We shall also conclude the reference to credibility findings in section 11425.50, subdivision (b) (\u00a7 11425.50(b)) applies to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision as well as SPB\u2019s decision. We shall further conclude, however, that section 11425.50 does not affect the outcome of this appeal, because the statute requires deference only to the extent the ALJ identifies observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witnesses, and in this case the ALJ made no such identification in connection with his determinations on witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We note CYA\u2019s opening brief on appeal (which does not mention \u00a7 11425.50) appears to construe <em>Universal Camera, supra, </em>340 U.S. 474, as requiring deference to <em>all </em>credibility determinations of the ALJ, regardless whether the ALJ identified his reasons. However, the California Legislature did not adopt such a broad standard. (\u00a7 11425.50(b).) As reflected in the Law Revision Commission comments to section 11425.50: \u201cFindings based substantially on credibility of a witness must be identified by the presiding officer in the decision made in the adjudicative proceeding. . . . However, the presiding officer\u2019s identification of such findings is not binding on the agency or the courts, which may make their own determinations whether a particular finding is based substantially on credibility of a witness. <em>Even though the presiding officer\u2019s determination is based substantially on credibility of a witness, the determination is entitled to great weight only to the extent the determination derives from the presiding officer\u2019s observation of the demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness. </em>Nothing in subdivision (b) precludes the agency head or court from overturning a credibility determination of the presiding officer, after giving the observational elements of the credibility determination great weight, whether on the basis of nonobservational elements of credibility or otherwise.

Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 161, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">We will not by judicial fiat adopt a broader rule where, as here, the California Legislature has struck a careful balance in a detailed statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>scheme. (See <em>Osborn </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 703, 710-711 [252 Cal.Rptr. 613].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">1. <em>Statutory Framework of Section 11425.50</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Section 11425.50 is part of the Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights (\u00a7 11425.10 et seq.), which was enacted in 1995 (Stats. 1995, ch. 938, \u00a7 21, p. 7127, operative July 1, 1997), as part of a major revision of California\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act (APA). (\u00a7\u00a7 11340-11529.) (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>pp. 5-542.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The APA covers both (1) administrative regulations and rulemaking (\u00a7\u00a7 11340-11357), and (2) administrative adjudications (\u00a7\u00a7 11400-11529). However, this appeal concerns only administrative adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Before the 1995 legislation, the APA\u2019s administrative adjudication provisions (which were found in ch. 5 of div. 3 of tit. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 11500-11529 (Chapter 5)) generally did not apply to SPB. Thus, former section 11501 provided (and still provides) that Chapter 5 applied to \u201cany agency as determined by statutes relating to that agency\u201d and a list of \u201cenumerated agencies\u201d which did not include SPB. (Former \u00a7 11501, Stats. 1994, ch. 26, \u00a7 231, p. 269.) Statutes relating to SPB (\u00a7 18500 et seq.) did not (and do not now) make Chapter 5 <em>generally </em>applicable to SPB administrative adjudications, but did (and now do) make <em>specific </em>APA provisions applicable. Thus, section 19578 provided (and still provides) that hearings sought by employees subjected to adverse action are to be conducted in accordance with section 11513, which addresses admissibility of evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Thus, before 1995, the administrative adjudication provisions of the APA generally did not apply to SPB. (See also 25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>p. 79 [many agencies, including SPB, were wholly or largely uncovered by the adjudicative provisions of the pre-1995 APA]; Cal. Administrative Hearing Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 1997) appen. A, p. 521 [APA provisions generally not applicable to SPB].)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">A major legislative revision of the APA in 1995 kept Chapter 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 11500-11530), but retitled it \u201cAdministrative Adjudication: Formal Hearing.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 938, \u00a7 24.5, p. 7154, operative July 1, 1997.) As indicated, it appears Chapter 5 continues to be generally inapplicable to SPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">However, the 1995 legislation also added a new Chapter 4.5 (\u00a7\u00a7 11400-11475.50) to division 3 of title 2 of the APA (Chapter 4.5), which is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Administrative Adjudication: General Provisions, and which contains the Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights (\u00a7\u00a7 11425.10-11425.60) in which we find the statute of interest to this appeal\u2014section 11425.50. The bill of rights sets the minimum due process and public interest requirements for hearings subject to Chapter 4.5. (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 154, commenting on \u00a7 11425.10 [governing procedure by which agency conducts adjudicative proceeding is subject to various requirements, including \u00a7 11425.50].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">2. <em>Section 11425.50 Applies to SPB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We asked for supplemental briefing as to whether section 11425.50 applies to SPB. We shall conclude section 11425.50 does apply to SPB administrative adjudications of employment disciplinary actions (\u00a7 19570 et seq.), as conceded by SPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The 1995 legislation became operative July 1, 1997 (Stats. 1995, ch. 938, \u00a7 21, p. 7127) and was therefore operative before the February 1998 commencement of the ALJ hearing in this case. (\u00a7 11400.10 [Chapter 4.5 applies to adjudicative proceedings commenced after July 1, 1997].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Pursuant to the 1995 legislation, Chapter 4.5 (\u00a7\u00a7 11400-11475.50), of which section 11425.50 is a part, \u201capplies to a decision by an agency if, under the federal or state Constitution or a federal or state statute, an evidentiary hearing for determination of facts is required for formulation and issuance of the decision.\u201d (\u00a7 11410.10.) Clearly, SPB\u2019s decision concerning Henderson\u2019s dismissal fell within that description. (\u00a7\u00a7 19578-19582 [statutory provisions for evidentiary hearing concerning disciplinary action of state employees].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Section 11410.20 provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute: ffl] (a) This chapter applies to all agencies of the state. [|] (b) This chapter does not apply to the Legislature, the courts or judicial branch, or the Governor or office of the Governor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Section 11415.10 says the \u201cgoverning procedure by which an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding is determined by the statutes and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>regulations applicable to that proceeding,\u201d and Chapter 4.5 \u201csupplements the governing procedure by which an agency conducts an adjudicative proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Section 11415.20 provides: \u201cA state statute or a federal statute or regulation applicable to a particular agency or decision prevails over a conflicting or inconsistent provision of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Thus, on its face, Chapter 4.5 of the APA applies generally to SPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">When we examine the statutes governing SPB involvement in disciplinary action of state employees (\u00a7\u00a7 19570-19588), we find no statutory exemption of SPB from the APA\u2019s Chapter 4.5, as is the case elsewhere. (See e.g. \u00a7 15609.5 [expressly exempting State Board of Equalization from APA Chapters 4.5 and 5]).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor do we find any statute particular to SPB which is conflicting or inconsistent with section 11425.50. Section 19582 requires of SPB decisions in administrative adjudications that \u201c(e) The decision shall be in writing and contain findings of fact and the adverse action, if any. The findings may be stated in the language of the pleadings or by reference thereto. . . .\u201d As SPB concedes in its supplemental brief, section 19582 does not conflict with, but instead can be harmoniously applied with section 11425.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">SPB in its supplemental brief concedes it is subject to section 11425.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Despite SPB\u2019s concession, Henderson argues SPB is <em>not </em>subject to section 11425.50. However, Henderson cites inapposite statutory exemptions of SPB from APA provisions concerning <em>regulatory and rulemaking </em>powers (as opposed to adjudicatory powers). (\u00a7\u00a7 18211, 18215.) This appeal involves administrative adjudication, not administrative rulemaking. Henderson cites section 18675, that SPB hearings shall be governed by rules of practice and procedure adopted by SPB. However, Henderson fails to identify any SPB rule or regulation that would conflict with section 11425.50. Therefore, Henderson\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Henderson also says California Constitution, article VII, section 3 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> mandates that SPB enforce the civil service statutes (a point we have already observed, <em>ante). </em>However, Henderson develops no constitutional argument and therefore presents nothing requiring discussion by this court. <em>(In re Marriage of Nichols </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 661, 672-673, fn. 3 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 13] [disregarding appellate contentions unsupported by legal/ factual analysis].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We conclude section 11425.50 applies to SPB.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">3. <em>Construction of \u201cDecision\u201d in Section 11425.50(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">That does not end our inquiry, however, because section 11425.50(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> requires the court to give great weight to certain credibility findings in a \u201cdecision,\u201d and we requested supplemental briefing on whether \u201cdecision\u201d in this statute referred to the SPB\u2019s decision or the ALJ\u2019s (proposed) decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">SPB argues that since the only decision is rendered by SPB, not the ALJ (\u00a7 19582 [\u201cHearings may be held by [SPB], or by any authorized representative, but [SPB] shall render the decision\u201d]), section 11425.50(b) does not apply to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision unless SPB adopts that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">CYA argues the context compels application to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, because the statute refers to \u201cobserved\u201d demeanor of witnesses, and it was the ALJ rather than SPB who observed witness demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">We shall conclude section 11425.50(b)\u2018s reference to credibility findings in a decision refers to <em>both </em>the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision and SPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">We begin with the statutory definitions contained in the APA\u2019s Chapter 4.5. Thus, section 11405.50, subdivision (a), provides: \u201c \u2018Decision\u2019 means an agency action of specific application that determines a legal right, duty, privilege, immunity, or other legal interest of a particular person.\u201d Section 11405.30 provides: \u201c \u2018Agency\u2019 means a board, bureau, commission, department, division, office, officer, or other administrative unit, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>agency head, and one or more members of the agency head or agency employees or other persons directly or indirectly purporting to act on behalf of or under the authority of the agency head.\u201d The Law Revision Commission Comments to section 11405.30 state: \u201cAn administrative unit of an agency that has no authority to issue decisions or take other action on behalf of the agency is not an \u2018agency\u2019 within the meaning of this section.\u201d (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., supra, at p. 138, reprinted in 32C West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 11405.30, p. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Based on these definitions alone, it would appear that \u201cdecision\u201d in section 11425.50 does <em>not </em>refer to the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision, because the ALJ in this type of case has no authority to issue decisions or take other action on behalf of the agency. Instead, as indicated, \u201cHearings may be held by [SPB], or by any authorized representative, but [SPB] shall render the decision . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 19582.) Thus, the SPB\u2019s decision does not constitute an administrative review of an ALJ\u2019s decision, but rather constitutes the only decision. Since the ALJ does not make a decision, but only a \u201cproposed\u201d decision, it would thus appear from the statutory definitions that section 11425.50\u2019s reference to \u201cdecision\u201d refers only to SPB\u2019s decision, not the ALJ\u2019s \u201cproposed\u201d decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">However, the statutory definitions govern construction of Chapter 4.5 \u201c[u]nless the provision or context requires otherwise . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 11405.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">As we shall explain, the context of section 11425.50(b) requires that \u201cdecision\u201d include the ALJ\u2019s proposed decision as well as SPB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Thus, section 11425.50 speaks of \u201cobservations\u201d of witness demeanor, manner, or attitude. When SPB elects to have an ALJ hold the hearing and when SPB elects to decide the case upon the record without taking additional evidence (\u00a7 19582), it is the ALJ rather than SPB who observes the witnesses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The Law Revision Commission comments to section 11425.50 state that subdivision (b), which adopts the rule of <em>Universal Camera, supra, </em>340 U.S. 474, \u201cgeneralizes the standard of review used by a number of California agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 160-161, reprinted in 32C West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code, <em>supra, </em>foll. \u00a7 11425.50, p. 149.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>One of the cases expressly cited in the Law Revision Commission comments is <em>Apte v. Regents of University of California, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 1084, 1092 (Apte)\u2014a case which, it almost goes without saying, we find apt.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\"><em>Apte, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 1084, involved administrative adjudication by an entity (University of California) which had quasi-judicial powers conferred by the California Constitution. <em>(Apte, </em>at p. 1090.) In <em>Apte, </em>a university professor challenged a faculty vote terminating programs that had the incidental effect of eliminating his employment. Pursuant to university policies which had the status of statutes <em>(ibid), </em>the matter was heard by a hearing committee which made factual findings and a recommendation (in favor of the professor) in a report to the chancellor, who made the actual decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1092.) The chancellor rejected the committee\u2019s recommendation and upheld the faculty vote. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1088-1089.) <em>Apte </em>assumed the applicability of <em>Universal Camera, supra, </em>340 U.S. 474. <em>(Apte, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 1091.) Of particular interest to the instant appeal, <em>Apte </em>said: \u201cIn this case, we face an unprecedented question concerning the relevance of the hearing committee\u2019s finding of fact to our review of the chancellor\u2019s decision. The University notes that the substantial evidence test must be applied to the decision of the chancellor, not to that of the hearing committee, and implies that the hearing committee report is irrelevant because the chancellor did not follow it. Apte counters by citing administrative law decisions holding that an administrative board which delegates the task of hearing testimony to a referee must ordinarily accept the findings of the referee on issues of witness credibility. [Citations.] The findings of the hearing committee are undoubtedly relevant to this appeal. First, the chancellor in effect incorporated those findings by reference in his decision by stating that he agreed \u2018in general with the factual findings of the Hearing Panel.\u2019 The decision presumably adopts the findings of the committee unless it states otherwise. Second, under the current substantial evidence test the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>reviewing court is required to review the entire record, including the hearing committee\u2019s report. Since the committee alone was in a position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, its conclusions may be considered in weighing the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Apte, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 1084, 1092.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Thus, <em>Apte, </em>like the appeal now before us, involved (1) constitutionally conferred quasi-judicial powers, (2) an administrative procedure where the persons who heard the evidence did not make the decision but merely transmitted a proposed decision to the decision maker, and (3) rejection of the proposed decision by the decision maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We note <em>Apte </em>said the decision maker agreed \u201c \u2018in general with the factual findings of the Hearing Panel.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Apte, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 1084, 1092.) However, <em>Apte </em>also gave a second reason unrelated to any concurrence between the decision maker and the hearing officer, i.e., the reviewing court is required to review the entire record, including the hearing committee\u2019s report, and since the hearing panel alone was in a position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses, its conclusions may be considered in weighing the probative value of the evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Since section 11425.50 \u201cgeneralizes the standard of review\u201d of <em>Apte </em>and other cases (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 161-162, reprinted in 32C West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 11425.50, at p. 149), we conclude section 11425.50(b)\u2019s reference to a decision\u2019s credibility findings encompasses the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, even though the ALJ does not make the decision but merely proposes a decision to SPB, and even if SPB disagrees with the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">We conclude section 11425.50(b)\u2019s provision (that \u201con judicial review the court shall give great weight to the determination to the extent the determination identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports it\u201d) applies to both SPB decisions and determinations by the ALJ in SPB administrative adjudications concerning employment disciplinary actions (\u00a7 19570 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">4. <em>Effect of Section 11425.50 on This Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Having concluded section 11425.50 applies to SPB, and the credibility determinations referred to in section 11425.50(b) apply to the ALJ\u2019s determinations (as well as SPB\u2019s determinations), we nevertheless conclude section 11425.50 does not apply in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">Thus, section 11425.50(b) (see fix. 8, <em>ante) </em>requires the court to give great weight to credibility determinations only \u201cto the extent the determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>identifies the observed demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness that supports it.\u201d As stated in the Law Revision Commission Comments: \u201cEven though the presiding officer\u2019s determination is based substantially on credibility of a witness, the determination is entitled to great weight only to the extent the determination derives from the presiding officer\u2019s observation of the demeanor, manner, or attitude of the witness.\u201d (25 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep., <em>supra, </em>p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Here, the ALJ merely stated in his decision that he believed or disbelieved certain witnesses; he did not identify any \u201cobserved demeanor, manner, or attitude\u201d of the witnesses. Thus, the ALJ merely said several times in his proposed decision that various witnesses \u201ccredibly testified\u201d to factual matters. The ALJ also said Henderson\u2019s denial that supervisor Baugh asked him to prepare a report \u201cis not credible in view of the credible testimony of Mr. Baugh. It is not plausible that on an issue that was so extremely important, Mr. Baugh would provide testimony that was inaccurate or dishonest.\u201d Thus, the ALJ based this credibility determination on inferences unrelated to witness demeanor, manner, or attitude.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Since the ALJ never identified any \u201cobserved demeanor, manner, or attitude\u201d of witnesses, section 11425.50 does not come into play in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Without section 11425.50, CYA cannot rely on its broad construction of <em>Universal Camera, </em>because we will not by judicial fiat adopt a broader rule where, as here, the California Legislature has struck a careful balance in a detailed statutory scheme. (See <em>Osborn v.
