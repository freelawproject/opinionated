Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 828 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 40, 50 P.3d 751] <em>(Myers) </em>the Supreme Court answered that question: \u201cThe Immunity Statute applies to certain statutorily described conduct of tobacco companies that occurred <em>during </em>the 10-year immunity period, which began on January 1, 1988, and ended on December 31, 1997. With respect to such conduct, therefore, the statutory immunity applies, and no product liability cause of action may be based on that conduct, regardless of when the users of the tobacco products may have sustained or discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>injuries as a result of that conduct. That statutory immunity was rescinded, however, when the California Legislature enacted the Repeal Statute, which as of January 1, 1998, restored the general principles of tort law that had, until the 1988 enactment of the Immunity Statute, governed tort liability against tobacco companies. Therefore, with respect to conduct falling <em>outside </em>the 10-year immunity period, the tobacco companies are not shielded from product liability lawsuits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Because the Souderses\u2019 personal injury and wrongful death causes of action allege conduct by Philip Morris and B&amp;W that occurred prior to January 1, 1988, we reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">1. <em>The plaintiffs</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Donald Souders and his wife Mary Schuler smoked cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris and B&amp;W for more than 30 years, beginning sometime prior to 1969, when they were both minors. On July 12, 1999, Donald Souders was diagnosed with emphysema and terminal heart disease attributable to his smoking. Mary Schuler died on July 20, 1999 as a result of damage to her heart caused by smoking. Sandra, Barbara, Ben, Elizabeth, Jessica, Donald, Jr., David and Ann Souders are the children of Donald Souders and Mary Schuler and the surviving heirs of Mary Schuler.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">2. <em>Proceedings in the trial court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">The Souderses filed this action against Philip Morris and B&amp;W, as well as several other tobacco manufacturers and retailers, on November 18, 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint contains causes of action for negligence, strict products liability and other torts, as well as claims for breach of express warranty and for violation of Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500. The complaint alleges that Mary Schuler\u2019s death and Donald Souders\u2019s injuries were caused by smoking cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris and B&amp;W and that Philip Morris and B&amp;W had engaged in wrongful conduct in connection with the manufacture and marketing of cigarettes dating from the 1950\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Philip Morris and B&amp;W demurred to the product liability causes of action on the ground that they were barred in their entirety by the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>former section 1714.45. The trial court sustained the demurrer, ruling that the 1997 amendment did not apply retroactively to conduct that occurred prior to its January 1, 1998 effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Although the trial court\u2019s tentative ruling had been to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, at the request of the Souderses\u2019 counsel, the Souderses were granted leave to amend for the purpose of alleging wrongful conduct by Philip Morris and B&amp;W occurring after January 1, 1998. The Souderses subsequently determined not to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The parties stipulated that the trial court\u2019s tentative ruling to sustain the demurrer to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth and tenth causes of action without leave to amend could be entered as the order of the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties additionally stipulated that the only two remaining causes of action (the sixth and seventh) were dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The order of dismissal was entered on May 3, 2000. The Souderses filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">3. <em>Our initial decision on appeal and the Supreme Court\u2019s transfer order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">In a decision filed on March 7, 2001, we reversed the judgment of dismissal, holding amended section 1714.45 applied to personal injury and other tort causes of action against tobacco manufacturers that accrued on or after January 1, 1998. We further held there was no constitutional impediment to application of amended section 1714.45 to causes of action accruing after the Repeal Statute\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">On May 16, 2001, the Supreme Court granted review and ordered briefing deferred pending <em>its </em>decision in <em>Myers. </em>On October 30, 2002, the Supreme Court transferred the case back to us \u201cwith directions to vacate [our] decision and to reconsider the cause in light of <em>Myers v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>[, <em>supra,] </em>28 Cal.4th 828 and <em>Naegele v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 856 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 61, 50 P.3d 769].\u201d <em>(Souders v.

Additional changes were made to reflect the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting this amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Section 2 of Senate Bill No. 67 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) contained the Legislature\u2019s declaration that the 1997 amendment \u201crestores those common law rules [for product liability actions] with respect to the manufacture or sale of tobacco products by tobacco manufacturers and their successors in interest.\u201d (Stats. 1997, ch. 570, \u00a7 2.) The 1997 amendment did not affect other, traditional liability defenses available to tobacco companies in responding to product liability lawsuits. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 67 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 16, 1997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">3. <em>The Supreme Court decisions in Myers and Naegele.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In <em>Myers </em>the Supreme Court considered the following question, certified to it by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \u201cDo the amendments to Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1714.45 that became effective on January 1, 1998, apply to a claim that accrued after January 1, 1998, but which is based on conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 1998?\u201d <em>(Myers v. Phillip Morris Companies, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 239 F.3d 1029, 1030.) In answer to that question, the court first held that permitting product liability suits to proceed against tobacco companies for supplying tobacco products to smokers during the immunity period would constitute a retroactive application of the Repeal Statute, regardless of when the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action formally accrued. <em>(Myers, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 840.) The court then held that the Legislature did not intend to apply the Repeal Statute retroactively <em>(id. </em>at pp. 840-845), and explained that constitutional considerations reinforced its reading of the Repeal Statute as not having retroactive application. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 845-847.) Because the Repeal Statute is not retroactive, the court concluded the plaintiff Betty Myers has no product liability claim against the defendant tobacco companies for their conduct in manufacturing and distributing cigarettes during the statutory immunity period. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Noting, however, that Myers began smoking cigarettes in 1956 and continued to do so until 1997 <em>(Myers, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 847), the Supreme Court also held the Repeal Statute \u201cremoved the protection that the Immunity Statute gave to tobacco companies for their conduct occurring <em>before </em>the Immunity Statute\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[B]y abrogating the Immunity Statute, the Repeal Statute restored the law governing product liability for the manufacture or sale of tobacco products to what it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>before the January 1, 1988, effective date of the Immunity Statute. [|] Before January 1, 1988, general tort principles defined the extent of any tort liability that tobacco companies might have for manufacturing or distributing their tobacco products for sale to voluntary consumers. When, 10 years later, the California Legislature repealed the statutory immunity for tobacco manufacturers in product liability actions, it reinstated those general tort rules.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 847-848.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, plaintiff Myers was entitled to pursue her tort claims against the tobacco company defendants for their conduct prior to January 1, 1988 (and after Dec. 31, 1997, as well) under general tort law principles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Having decided in <em>Myers </em>that former section 1714.45 continues to provide immunity for tobacco companies in product liability actions for conduct during the 10-year period the Immunity Statute was in effect, in <em>Naegele, </em>the companion case to <em>Myers, </em>the Supreme Court considered what forms of conduct by tobacco companies come within the Immunity Statute\u2019s protection. <em>(Naegele, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 860.) First, the court held actions for fraud, as well as for negligence and manufacture of an inherently unsafe product, are barred by the Immunity Statute\u2019s broad definition of product liability lawsuits, provided the lawsuit is seeking damages for personal injury or death caused by use of \u201cpure and unadulterated\u201d tobacco products. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 863-864.) Therefore, an allegation that tobacco companies increased the nicotine content of their cigarettes through blended or high-nicotine tobacco does not <em>avoid </em>the bar of the Immunity Statute \u201cbecause it does not allege the defendants exposed plaintiff to a risk <em>other than </em>those inherent in tobacco products.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 865.) Similarly, because allegations that tobacco companies lied about the addictive nature of smoking do not suggest that the plaintiff was exposed to dangers other than those inherent in cigarette smoking, any claims based on such allegations during the 10-year statutory immunity period (but not before or after that period) are barred by former section 1714.45. <em>(Naegele, </em>at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">To the extent the plaintiff alleged the tobacco companies manipulated the addictive properties of their cigarettes through additives, however\u2014for example, adding ammonia to the \u201cnicotine delivery system\u201d\u2014the defendants are not protected from product liability lawsuits during the immunity period: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cThe essence of these allegations is that the defendant tobacco companies adulterated the cigarettes plaintiff smoked with additives that exposed him to dangers not inherent in cigarette smoking. Because, as we have explained, the statutory immunity does not shield a tobacco company from liability for injuries or deaths caused by something not inherent in the product itself, the Immunity Statute does not bar these claims.\u201d <em>(Naegele, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">4. <em>The Souderses \u2019 complaint states causes of action for personal injuries and other torts under Myers and Naegele.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The Souderses\u2019 personal injury and wrongful death causes of action allege conduct by Philip Morris and B&amp;W beginning some time prior to 1969 and continuing through the beginning of the 10-year statutory immunity period of former section 1714.45. Accordingly, the Souderses may pursue each of those causes of action under general tort principles. <em>(Myers, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 848.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Under <em>Naegele </em>the Immunity Statute applies to the Souderses\u2019 claims for false representation (third cause of action) and deceit and fraudulent concealment (fourth cause of action) to the same extent it does to their negligence and strict product liability claims. <em>(Naegele, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 863-864.) Allegations that Philip Morris and B&amp;W misrepresented the addictive nature of nicotine and developed and utilized high-nicotine tobacco in their product blends do not avoid the immunity bar for the period from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1997. However, because the Souderses\u2019 claims assert misconduct by the tobacco companies prior to January 1, 1988, the demurrer to these causes of action should have been overruled. In addition, to the extent the Souderses have alleged defendants \u201cadd[ed] ammonia, or otherwise alter[ed] the PH of the tobacco, enhanced the delivery of nicotine, thereby increasing addiction and/or dependence\u201d and thus have alleged Philip Morris and B&amp;W exposed the Souderses to a risk other than those inherent in tobacco products, the Immunity Statute provides no protection for the defendants. <em>(Naegele, </em>at p. 865.)</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed. The trial court shall enter a new order overruling the demurrers to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and tenth causes of action of the complaint. The trial court shall also correct its records to reflect that no demurrer was filed as to the eighth and ninth causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of action, which remain pending against Philip Morris and B&amp;W. The Souderses are to recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Klein, P.
