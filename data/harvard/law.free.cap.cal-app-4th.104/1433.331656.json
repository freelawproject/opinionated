(Denny\u2019s) petitions this court by a writ of review challenging the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) to dismiss the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) as a party to a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Denny\u2019s contends CIGA is statutorily required to guarantee a proportionate share of an insolvent insurer\u2019s disability obligation when a permissibly self-insured employer is jointly and severally liable for the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Unfortunately, one of Denny\u2019s employees suffered a work-related cumulative injury over a one-year period that overlapped two months with the time Denny\u2019s elected to insure itself for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. The 10-month balance was the responsibility of a private insurance company which became insolvent. Denny\u2019s fervently argues that it should only have to pay its 20 percent proportionate share of the disability award and CIGA should pick up the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">We agree with the WCAB and find the claim outside CIGA\u2019s indemnification responsibility. Essentially, Denny\u2019s made the business decision to opt for self-insurance over private insurance and to not purchase an excess workers\u2019 compensation policy. To use an annoying proverb, <em>pro tali numismate tales merces. </em>(\u201cYou get what you pay for.\u201d) (Rogers, The Diet, of Clich\u00e9s (1985) p. 295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">Esther Bachman (Bachman) claimed a cumulative injury to her wrists while working as a cook for Denny\u2019s Restaurant in Bakersfield between May 22, 1996, and May 22, 1997. Denny\u2019s admitted the injury was work related and provided Bachman with appropriate medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">During Bachman\u2019s injury period, Denny\u2019s insured itself for workers\u2019 compensation purposes through July 31, 1996. Thereafter, Denny\u2019s obtained private workers\u2019 compensation insurance from HIH America.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">In May 2001, HIH America was judicially declared insolvent, triggering CIGA\u2019s statutory obligation to guarantee HIH America\u2019s \u201ccovered claims\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>under the provisions of article 14.2 of the Insurance Code. (Ins. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1063 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Bachman\u2019s disability claim proceeded to trial, and a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) concluded Bachman\u2019s wrist injury caused a 38 percent level of permanent disability. The WCJ also found the disability award did not constitute a CIGA \u201ccovered claim\u201d because Denny\u2019s remained jointly and severally liable. The WCJ dismissed CIGA as a party to the action, thereby absolving CIGA from any liability and leaving Denny\u2019s solely responsible for Bachman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award. In November 2001, the WCAB denied Denny\u2019s petition for reconsideration and adopted the WCJ\u2019s reasoning as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">Denny\u2019s contends the WCAB erred by dismissing CIGA as a party to the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and requiring Denny\u2019s to pay the full amount of Bachman\u2019s disability award. Denny\u2019s believes CIGA, as the guarantor of insolvent HIH America, should have assumed HIH America\u2019s approximate 80 percent proportionate share of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">Under the California workers\u2019 compensation system, a compensable injury may be either \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201ccumulative.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3208.1.) A specific injury results from \u201cone incident or exposure which causes disability or need for medical treatment,\u201d while a cumulative injury results from \u201crepetitive mental or physically traumatic activities extending over a period of time, the combined effect of which causes any disability or need for medical treatment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; Western Growers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 227, 234 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 26].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">When an employee suffers a cumulative injury over time, the employee may claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits against any one or more of successive employers or insurance carriers that employed or insured the employee during a maximum one-year injury period. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5500.5; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548, 553-556 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295].) The WCAB will hold the multiple employers or insurance carriers in the chain of causation jointly and severally liable for the entire award and allow them to apportion their relative liabilities in separate WCAB proceedings. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>at pp. 554-556; see also <em>Flesher v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 322, 327 [152 Cal.Rptr. 459, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>590 P.2d 35]; <em>Marsh v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1968) 257 Cal.App.2d 574, 579 [65 Cal.Rptr. 69].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Established in 1969 under the Guarantee Act (art. 14.2 of the Ins. Code), CIGA provides \u201cinsolvency insurance\u201d against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies. (\u00a7\u00a7 119.5, 1063 et seq.; <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 556.) Although funded by a compulsory membership of insurance companies doing business in California, CIGA \u201cwas created to provide a limited form of protection for insureds and the public, not to provide a fund to protect insurance carriers.\u201d <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 988, 994 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 848]; \u00a7 1063, subd. (a).) CIGA\u2019s role in guaranteeing workers\u2019 compensation claims is therefore limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-5\">\u201c \u2018CIGA is not, and was not created to act as, an ordinary insurance company. [Citation.] It is a statutory entity that depends on the Guarantee Act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers, duties, and protections.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018CIGA issues no policies, collects no premiums, makes no profits, and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018CIGA\u2019s duties are not co-extensive with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.\u2019 [Citation.] Instead, CIGA\u2019s authority and liability in discharging \u2018its statutorily circumscribed duties\u2019 are limited to paying the amount of \u2018covered claims.\u2019 [Citations.] CIGA \u2018is authorized by statute to pay only \u201ccovered claims\u201d of an insolvent insurer, those determined by the Legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] CIGA has the statutory authority to \u2018deny a noncovered claim.\u2019 [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-6\">\u201c \u2018Since \u201ccovered claims\u201d are not coextensive with an insolvent insurer\u2019s obligations under its policies, CIGA cannot and does not \u201c\u2018stand in the shoes\u2019 of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.\u201d [Citation.] Indeed, CIGA is \u201cexpressly forbidden\u201d to do so except where the claim at issue is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d [Citation.] It necessarily follows that CIGA\u2019s first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a \u201ccovered claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018It is unequivocally clear the scope of CIGA\u2019s rights and duties turns on the definition of \u201ccovered claim.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 556-557.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(1), in pertinent part, broadly defines \u201ccovered claims\u201d as \u201c \u2018the obligations of an insolvent insurer . . . (i) imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>(ii) which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer; (iii) which are presented as a claim [timely]; (iv) which were incurred prior to the date coverage under the policy terminated . . . ; (v) for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full; [and] (vi) in the case of a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law of this state . . . <em>(Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 306, 310 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 87].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(3) through (13), continues to define \u201ccovered claims\u201d by excluding specific obligations from CIGA\u2019s insolvency insurance coverage. Among the exclusions, subdivision (c)(9) provides that \u201c \u2018[c]overed claims\u2019 does not include . . . any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">\u201cCases interpreting this language have established that where an insured has overlapping insurance policies and one insurer becomes insolvent, the other insurer, even if only a secondary or excess insurer, is responsible for paying the claim. In other words, CIGA is an insurer of last resort and does not assume responsibility for claims where there is any other insurance available. [Citation.] \u2018The legislative intent was to create a protection for the public against insolvent insurers <em>when no secondary insurer is </em>available.\u2019 \u201d <em>(R.J. Reynolds Co. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 595, 600 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 405].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">\u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation insurance is a class of insurance covered by the provisions of the CIGA statutes.\u201d <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 557, fn. 5, citing \u00a7 1063, subd. (a).) Accordingly, CIGA may not guarantee a disability claim when a solvent workers\u2019 compensation insurer is otherwise jointly and severally liable for the claim. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co., </em>at p. 558; see 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed., Tancor edit., 2001) Liability Insurance, \u00a7 2.84, p. 2-100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">Every California employer must secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by either purchasing third party insurance or obtaining a \u201ccertificate of consent to self-insure\u201d from the Director of Industrial Relations. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700; see 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Liability Insurance, \u00a72.10[1], p. 2-20.) Under the self-insurance program, the employer must demonstrate the financial ability to pay any compensation that may become due to its employees. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3700, subd. (b); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 15203.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>The WCAB concluded the self-insurance Denny\u2019s provided during the first portion of Bachman\u2019s injury period constituted available \u201cother insurance\u201d within the meaning of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9), thereby removing Bachman\u2019s claim from CIGA\u2019s guarantee responsibility. Denny\u2019s disputes the WCAB\u2019s determination, contending employer self-insurance is not mentioned in the Guarantee Act and therefore is not \u201cother insurance of a class covered by\u201d article 14.2 of the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">We disagree. The Insurance Code divides insurance in California into 22 separate classes, of which workers\u2019 compensation constitutes a single class, without distinguishing self-insured and privately insured employers. (\u00a7 100, subd. (9).) Moreover, workers\u2019 compensation insurance is defined as \u201cinsurance against loss from liability imposed by law upon employers to compensate employees and their dependents for injury sustained by the employees arising out of and in the course of the employment . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 109.) Again, the statutory definition of workers\u2019 compensation insurance does not separate self-insured employers from those who are privately insured. (Cf. <em>In re El Dorado Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1149, 1153 [234 Cal.Rptr. 734] [\u201cThis definition is broad enough to encompass insurance for claims for benefits pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.) as well as insurance for claims pursuant to the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3201 et seq.).\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Denny\u2019s believes a self-insured employer does not provide \u201cinsurance\u201d and is not an \u201cinsurer\u201d because section 22 defines \u201cinsurance\u201d as \u201ca contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.\u201d Further, section 23 provides that \u201c[t]he person who undertakes to indemnify another by insurance is the insurer, and the person indemnified is the insured.\u201d Because of the lack of a contractual relationship to indemnify another, \u201c[a]n entity that self-insures is not an insurer within the meaning of Insurance Code sections 22 and 23.\u201d <em>(Truck Ins. Exchange v. Amoco Corp. </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 814, 823 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 551].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">Contrary to Denny\u2019s contention, sections 22 and 23 provide a general insurance framework and do not refer to workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Within the workers\u2019 compensation laws, the term \u201cinsurer\u201d specifically denotes permissibly self-insured employers. Labor Code, section 3211, provides: \u201c \u2018Insurer\u2019 includes the State Compensation Insurance Fund and any private company, corporation, mutual association, reciprocal or interinsurance exchange authorized under the laws of this State to insure employers against liability for compensation <em>and any employer to whom a certificate of consent to self-insure has been issued.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>\u201cA statute dealing expressly with a particular subject controls and takes priority over a general statute. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859, Civ. Code, \u00a7 3534.)\u201d <em>(Neumarkel v. Allard </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 457, 463 [209 Cal.Rptr. 616].) Accordingly, the specific statutory characterization of a workers\u2019 compensation insurer supercedes general Insurance Code definitions. Thus, while a self-insured employer may not be an \u201cinsurer\u201d when it protects itself against general civil liabilities <em>(Truck Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Amoco Corp., supra, </em>35 Cal.App.4th at p. 823), an employer is expressly deemed an \u201cinsurer\u201d if issued a certificate to self-insure for workers\u2019 compensation. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3211.) It reasonably follows that the workers\u2019 compensation liability protection an employer provides itself under the self-insurance program is a class of \u201cinsurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Denny\u2019s argues that our holding in <em>Gallo Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 485 [196 Cal.Rptr. 23] supports its position that a self-insured employer is not an insurer under the relevant CIGA statutes. In determining whether the exclusive workers\u2019 compensation remedy rule under Labor Code sections 3600 and 3601 applied to a self-insured employer, we held that \u201can employer does not act in the capacity of an insurer when self-insured.\u201d <em>(Gallo Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 489, citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>International Paper Co. </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 810, 815 [181 Cal.Rptr. 342].) Denny\u2019s fails to recognize, however, that our holding was limited to preventing a self-insured employer from escaping liability as an insurer; we immediately added that, under Labor Code section 3211, \u201c[t]he fact that the statutory definition of \u2018insurer\u2019 includes a self-insured employer makes legislation regarding insurers applicable to such employers . . . .\u201d <em>(Gallo Glass Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">We agree with our holding in <em>Gallo Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d 485. Legislation regarding workers\u2019 compensation insurers applies equally to private third party insurers and self-insured employers. Thus, while the Guarantee Act does not expressly mention employer-provided self-insurance, it references workers\u2019 compensation insurance, which statutorily includes employers with permission to self-insure. Accordingly, an employer self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes provides \u201cother insurance of a class covered by\u201d the Guarantee Act within the meaning of section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Our determination comports with the intent of the Guarantee Act.  As an insurer of last resort, CIGA assumes responsibility for claims <em>only </em>when no secondary insurer is available. (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9); <em>R.J. Reynolds Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn., supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>p. 600.)  The Legislature did not establish the CIGA to protect Denny\u2019s as a self-insurer, but rather, to protect Bachman as a member of the insured public by ensuring she received a full disability award. (See <em>CD Investment Co. </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1425 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 806], citing Barger, <em>California Insurance Guarantee Association </em>(1970) 45 State Bar J. 475, 482.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">We also find no reason to assess liability against CIGA on equity grounds. As a self-insurer, Denny\u2019s placed itself in the position of a private insurer. If Denny\u2019s had been covered by a third party insurer instead of being self-insured during the first portion of Bachman\u2019s cumulative injury period, that insurer would be liable for the entire disability award. <em>(Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 553-556.) Denny\u2019s made a risk-management decision to self-insure, gambling that it could lower its costs by not purchasing third party workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Denny\u2019s cannot reap the benefits of self-insurance without accepting its burdens. Moreover, Denny\u2019s could have limited its liability by purchasing \u201ca special excess workers\u2019 compensation policy to discharge any or all of the employer\u2019s continuing obligations as a self-insurer to pay compensation or to secure the payment of compensation.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3702.8, subd. (c).) By not purchasing a special excess workers\u2019 compensation policy, Denny\u2019s effectively chose not to insulate itself from the long tail of potential self-insurance liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">In summary, the WCAB concluded that Denny\u2019s and HIH America were jointly and severally liable for Bachman\u2019s disability award. Since Bachman could recover the full award from Denny\u2019s self-provided \u201cother insurance,\u201d the Guarantee Act prevented CIGA from assuming insolvent HIH America\u2019s proportionate share. The WCAB therefore properly dismissed CIGA as a party to the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-7\">The order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board is affirmed. Costs are awarded to the California Insurance Guarantee Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">Ardaiz, P.
