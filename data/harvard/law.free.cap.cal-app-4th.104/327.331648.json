If the undertaking is not posted, the action \u201cshall be dismissed as to the defendant in whose favor the order requiring the undertaking was made.\u201d (\u00a7 1030, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This mandate proceeding raises a question of first impression. Can section 1030 be applied to require an out-of-state defendant who has filed a cross-complaint against a California resident to post an undertaking in order to continue prosecution of the cross-complaint? We conclude it does not so apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">Brian Lovell sued Ruby Yao on a variety of causes of action. The operative facts involve an agreement between the two to form a production company and develop a film project and the breach(es) of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Yao filed a cross-complaint against Lovell. The cross-complaint included six causes of action arising out of the same factual matrix alleged in Lovell\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Citing section 1030, Lovell filed a motion for an order requiring Yao to post security in order to continue to prosecute her cross-complaint. Lovell offered evidence Yao was not a California resident but instead a citizen of Hong Kong residing in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Yao\u2019s opposition to the motion for security did not contest that she was not a California resident. Instead, she contended section 1030\u2019s requirement of posting a bond did not embrace a \u201ccross-complainant\u201d but instead applied only to a \u201cplaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The trial court rejected Yao\u2019s analysis. At the hearing on the motion, the court stated: \u201c[Ijt\u2019s just so basic. . . . When you\u2019ve got a complaint and a cross-complaint, each one is a separate lawsuit. So when cross-actions are filed, they constitute two simultaneous, separate actions between the same parties, wherein each party is, at the same time, both a plaintiff and a defendant. It goes back a long time. So that was an easy one.\u201d The court granted Lovell\u2019s motion for security and required Yao to post $10,000 security within 20 days of its order (Mar. 14, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Yao filed a petition for a writ of mandate to overturn the trial court\u2019s order. We stayed the trial court\u2019s order requiring Yao to post security and later, after receiving preliminary opposition to Yao\u2019s petition and copies of the court\u2019s minute order and the reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing held on the motion, issued an alternative writ of mandate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lovell has since filed an \u201copposition\u201d to Yao\u2019s petition. We now grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Section 1030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhen the plaintiff in an action . . . resides out of the state, ... the defendant may at any time apply to the court by noticed motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to file an undertaking to secure an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees which may be awarded in the action . . . .\u201d Subdivision (b) explains the \u201cmotion shall be made on the grounds that the plaintiff resides out of the state . . . and that there is a reasonable possibility that the moving defendant will obtain judgment in the action . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The purpose of the statute is to enable a California resident sued by an out-of-state resident \u201c \u2018to secure costs in light of the difficulty of enforcing a judgment for costs against a person who is not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Shannon v. Sims Service Center, Inc. </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 907, 913 [210 Cal.Rptr. 861], quoting from Recommendation Relating to Security for Costs (Oct. 1978) 14 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1978) p. 323.) The statute therefore acts to prevent out-of-state residents from filing frivolous lawsuits against California residents. (See also <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 18 [137 Cal.Rptr. 312].) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute violates neither federal nor state due process guarantees because the \u201cstatutory hearing procedure is the one usually prescribed for pretrial motions, that is, the opportunity to present declarations and other documentary evidence, the opportunity for both counsel to be present, and the opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>(Shannon, supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d at p. 913.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The only issue in this writ proceeding is whether section 1030 applies to a nonresident cross-complainant. In other words, if a California resident (e.g., Lovell) sues an out-of-state defendant (e.g., Yao) and the defendant responds, in part, by filing a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, can the plaintiff move the court to require the defendant/cross-complainant to post security in order to prosecute the cross-complaint? We conclude the answer is \u201cno\u201d for two reasons. The first is that section 1030 unambiguously refers only to a \u201cplaintiff\u2019; when the Legislature intends for a specific statutory provision to apply to both a plaintiff and cross-complainant, it expressly indicates that intent. The second is that to construe the statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>include an out-of-state cross-complainant would not promote the policy served by the statute. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">To begin, it is highly significant that section 1030 refers only to an out-of-state plaintiff but makes no similar reference to an out-of-state cross-complainant. This is in marked contrast to many other statutes that reference both a plaintiff and a cross-complainant. Such a dual reference clearly demonstrates a legislative intent to have the specific statutory provision apply both to a plaintiff and a cross-complainant. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 386, subd. (c) [\u201cplaintiff or cross-complainant\u201d deposit in court amount subject to interpleader action], 389, subd. (b) [trial court should consider \u201cwhether the plaintiff or cross-complainant will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder\u201d], 403.020, subd. (a) [stating who pays the additional fee \u201c[i]f a plaintiff, cross-complainant, or petitioner files an amended complaint or other amended initial pleading that changes the jurisdictional classification from limited to unlimited\u201d], 411.35, subd. (a) [requirement that \u201cthe attorney for the plaintiff or cross-complainant\u201d shall file the required certificate in designated professional malpractice actions], 430.10 [a demurrer or answer may be filed by \u201c[t]he party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed\u201d], and 1031, subd. (c) [\u201cin any judgment recovered by the plaintiff or cross-complainant\u201d for wages for labor performed, attorney fees can be recovered as costs if certain conditions met].) Section 1030, on the other hand, contains no similar reference to a cross-complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In another group of statutes, there is an express statement that a plaintiff includes a cross-complainant and a complaint includes a cross-complaint. That is, in certain situations when the Legislature intends for a particular statutory provision to apply to both plaintiffs and cross-complainants, it explicitly indicates the words are being used interchangeably. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 425.16, subd. (h) [SLAPP statute], 426.10, subds. (a) &amp; (b) [compulsory cross-complaints], 481.180 [attachment actions], 1032 [in defining a \u201cprevailing party\u201d, \u201cplaintiff\u2019 includes a cross-complainant].) Such a direction is lacking in section 1030. Nothing in the statute states that a plaintiff includes a cross-complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In sum, the Legislature clearly knows how to indicate when it wants a statutory provision to apply to both a plaintiff and a cross-complainant. It also clearly knows how to indicate that a reference to \u201cplaintiff\u2019 must be construed as including a cross-complainant. The Legislature chose not to adopt either option in this case. We therefore decline plaintiffs invitation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>rewrite section 1030 to provide that \u201cplaintiff\u2019 includes cross-complainant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   \u201cWhere the Legislature makes express statutory distinctions, we must presume it did so deliberately, giving effect to the distinctions, unless the whole scheme reveals the distinction is unintended. This concept merely restates another statutory construction canon: <em>we presume the Legislature intended everything in a statutory scheme, and we should not read statutes to </em>omit expressed language or <em>include omitted language. </em>As our Supreme Court stated, \u2018we are aware of no authority that supports the notion of legislation by accident.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Jurcoane </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 886, 894 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 483], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Lovell\u2019s argument to the contrary is not persuasive. He argues: \u201cSection 1030 does not directly equate the term \u2018plaintiff with \u2018cross-complainant\u2019 because this is a foregone conclusion that has been previously litigated and rests in common sense.\u201d The cases he cites are inapposite because none involved an interpretation of section 1030. (See, e.g., <em>Skaff v. Small Claims Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 76 [65 Cal.Rptr. 65, 435 P.2d 825] [interpreting former \u00a7 117j, which denied the right of appeal t\u00f3 a small claims court plaintiff, not to bar an appeal by a plaintiff from an adverse decision on a cross-complaint filed against it in small claims court because in that context the plaintiff has become a defendant]; <em>McColm v. Westwood Park Assn. </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1218 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 288] [citing the statutory definition of \u201cplaintiff\u2019 in the vexatious litigant statute]; <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Group v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 444, 448-451 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 771] [interpreting the word \u201cplaintiff\u2019 in \u00a7 394, a change of venue statute, in light of judicial interpretations of a related venue statute]; <em>Eveleth v. American Brass &amp; Iron Foundry </em>(1962) 203 Cal.App.2d 41, 46-47 [21 Cal.Rptr. 95] [interpreting \u201cplaintiff\u2019 and \u201cdefendant\u201d in \u00a7 396, a change of venue statute, to include cross-complainants and cross-defendants].)  Because a \u201ccase is not authority for an issue not raised by its facts\u201d <em>(Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1230 [254 Cal.Rptr. 410]), these authorities simply do not support Lovell\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Lastly, Lovell\u2019s reliance upon \u201ccommon sense\u201d to support his argument fails. Common sense, in fact, supports the contrary conclusion. The purpose of section 1030 is to protect California residents who are sued by out-of-state plaintiffs when there is no reasonable possibility the out-of-state plaintiff will prevail. The section protects California residents by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>requiring the out-of-state plaintiff to post security to ensure payment of costs and attorney fees (if recoverable) in the likely event the plaintiffs action is defeated. <em>(Shannon v. Sims Service Center, Inc., supra, </em>164 Cal.App.3d 907, 913.) This purpose is attenuated when, as here, a California resident has initiated a lawsuit against an out-of-state defendant and that defendant has responded, in part, by filing a cross-complaint. In that circumstance, requiring the posting of security by an out-of-state defendant does not further the statute\u2019s salutary goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The alternative writ, having served its purpose, is discharged. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue compelling respondent court to set aside its March 14, 2002 order granting real party in interest Brian Lovell\u2019s motion to require petitioner Ruby Yao to post security in order to prosecute her cross-complaint and to enter a new and different order denying that motion. Our April 2, 2002 order staying enforcement of the March 14, 2002 order is to remain in effect until the remittitur issues. Petitioner Yao is to recover her costs in this writ proceeding. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 56.4(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Hastings, J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-17\">All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>In any event, our issuance of the alternative writ constitutes a determination the remedy at law is inadequate. (See, e.g., <em>Hoversten v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 636, 644 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 197] and cases cited therein.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Loveil\u2019s contention the remedy at law is adequate is meritless. For one thing, subdivision (g) of section 1030 provides: \u201cAn order granting or denying a motion for an undertaking under this section is not appealable.\u201d The Law Revision Commission comment explains this provision \u201ccodifies existing law. See Horton v. City of Beverly Hills, 261 Cal.App.2d 306, 67 Cal.Rptr. 759 (1968). An order granting or denying a motion for an undertaking may sometimes be reviewed by extraordinary writ. See Beaudreau v. Superior Court, 14 Cal.3d 448, 535 P.2d 713, 121 Cal.Rptr. 585 (1975). A judgment of dismissal following the plaintiffs failure to furnish required security is appealable as a final judgment. Efron v. Kalmanovitz, 185 Cal.App.2d 149, 156-57, 8 Cal.Rptr. 107, 112 (I960).\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 18A West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (2002 supp.) foil. \u00a7 1030, p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">For another thing, Lovell\u2019s claim that Yao has the option of refusing to post the undertaking and then appealing' from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of her cross-complaint is not persuasive. The complaint and cross-complaint arise out of the same transaction(s). Judicial economy suggests the two pleadings should be litigated together. This is particularly true if Yao is correct that her cross-complaint is compulsory so that if she failed to file it, she would be barred from subsequently pursuing its claims. (See \u00a7 426.30.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-10\"><em> Gonzales </em>found an earlier version of section 1030 to be unconstitutional because it failed to \u201cprovide a meaningful pretaking hearing\u201d allowing inquiry into all the pertinent issues. <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Fox, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 18.) Thereafter, the Legislature enacted what is essentially the present version of section 1030. Nonetheless, the <em>Gonzales </em>court\u2019s observations about statutory intent remain apposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Because we conclude the statute does not include a cross-complainant within its reach, we need not address Yao\u2019s contention that a contrary construction would be unconstitutional. \u201cConstitutional issues will be resolved only if absolutely necessary and not if the case can be decided on any other ground.
